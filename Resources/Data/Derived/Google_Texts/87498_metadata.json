Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a member of the committee, hit immigration officials for allowing 97 percent of illegally arriving children to stay in the country.\n\nGrassley cited a new government report that found that the Department of Health and Human Services failed to establish a \u201csystematic\u201d plan to handle renewed surges of unaccompanied minors in 2016 and beyond.\n\nFrom October through January, federal immigration officers caught 20,455 such children at the border\u2014more than twice the number caught during the same time span the year before.\n\nIf the trend continues, Grassley warned, this year\u2019s numbers could outpace the more than 68,000 unaccompanied minors caught in 2014.\n\nSessions said immigration officials failed to monitor illegally arriving children adequately, enabling 97 percent to avoid deportation.\n\nDuring the past two and a half years, Sessions said, only 4,680 of the more than 127,000 such minors were deported.\n\nSessions said the administration\u2019s lax policies signal to others in Central America that if they make it to the U.S., they will be released. This, he said, would prompt children to \u201ctake undue risk\u201d to illegally cross the border:\n\nI think nobody\u2019s looking for them. The system is not working. All you have to do is come into the country unlawfully, be released into the country, and if you don\u2019t show up for court, you\u2019re never looked for, and you aren\u2019t deported.\n\nAdministration officials testified that they had taken steps to correct their failure to ensure the safety of unaccompanied children who crossed the border but made little mention of how they planned to halt the flow.\n\nRonald Vitiello, deputy chief of the Border Patrol, said U.S. Customs and Border Protection had improved its screening process for apprehended minors to better determine whether a child is a victim of human trafficking.\n\nVitiello said the Border Patrol also is beginning to implement automated systems to better document children once they are transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which will improve the agency\u2019s ability to monitor how long a child stays in custody. The refugee office is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS.\n\nMark Greenberg, acting assistant secretary at HHS\u2019 Administration for Children and Families, testified that his agency\u2019s guiding principle when releasing minors to sponsors is the children\u2019s safety and well-being. He called the ongoing border surge a \u201crefugee crisis.\u201d\n\nAt the request of Grassley and other Senate leaders, the Government Accountability Office investigated how the administration responded to the tens of thousands of Central American children who have entered the U.S. over the past few years.\n\nThe findings, released Monday, revealed that the Office of Refugee Resettlement doesn\u2019t have a system to track unaccompanied minors once they\u2019re released from government detainment to a sponsor. Sponsors, who are vetted by the refugee office, are supposed to care for the children and take them to immigration court for a determination of their status.\n\nThe government\u2019s inability to monitor children once they go to a sponsor, critics say, has enabled some to escape government tracking and caused others to end up in homes where they are abused or forced into coerced labor.\n\nGrassley called the findings \u201ctroubling\u201d and criticized immigration officials for \u201ccutting corners\u201d that he said led to minors falling into the hands of human traffickers or being \u201cpawned off\u201d to adults who sexually abuse them.\n\n\u201c[Government officials] need a plan, they need to learn from their mistakes, they need to ensure that minors are quickly and safely returned to their home country, and they need to be held accountable,\u201d Grassley said.\n\n\u201cWe have to have compassion for these people, but we also have to have enforcement under the law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "From October through January, federal immigration officers had caught 20,455 unaccompanied children at the U.S.-Mexico border, twice as many as a year ago.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "From October through January, federal immigration officers had caught 20,455 unaccompanied children at the U.S.-Mexico border, twice as many as a year ago.", "title": "Senator: Obama Not Prepared for Border Crisis", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160223_BorderSurge_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-29T11:40:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1WHg5pF"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "From October through January, federal immigration officers had caught 20,455 unaccompanied children at the U.S.-Mexico border, twice as many as a year ago.", "title": "Senator: Obama Not Prepared for Border Crisis", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160223_BorderSurge_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2016-02-23T19:06:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-29T11:40:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Chuck Grassley, Jeff Sessions, undocumented minors, Customs and Border Control, DHS, HHS, illegal immigrants, border, Ronald Vitiello"}, "article_summary": "The Obama administration isn\u2019t prepared for a revived wave of unaccompanied children crossing illegally into the United States, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Tuesday.\nIf the trend continues, Grassley warned, this year\u2019s numbers could outpace the more than 68,000 unaccompanied minors caught in 2014.\nThe refugee office is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS.\nSessions said immigration officials failed to monitor illegally arriving children adequately, enabling 97 percent to avoid deportation.\nIn opening remarks before a Judiciary Committee hearing, Grassley criticized the White House for \u201cshirking responsibility\u201d while the influx of Central American children fleeing across the U.S.-Mexico border threatens to outpace 2014\u2019s crisis."}
