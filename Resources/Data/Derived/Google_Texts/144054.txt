NORTHGLENN — With a careful reach of his paw and an anxious shake of his rump, Juno the dog fell noggin-first into the pool Monday, looking every bit like a pooch having only his second encounter with swimming.

“He likes the snow, but he’s never had much exposure to the water,” said Juno’s owner, Jeanette Smith of Thornton.

No matter. Once all in, 2-year-old Juno, a Labrador mix, proved a graceful paddler. He swam after chew toys. He went careening down the slide.

After an hour at the pool, Smith had to drag Juno away.

The dogs had their day Monday at the Kiwanis Pool in Northglenn. The city hosted its first-ever dog swim day on the last day the pool was open. On Tuesday, the pool will be drained for the season.

Steve Hanson, the aquatics coordinator for the city’s recreation department, said the hope was to give dogs that haven’t been around the water the chance to learn how to swim in a safe place.

In the morning, Hanson said, guide dogs were allowed to practice. In the afternoon, members of the public, such as Smith, could bring their dogs in for a $5 fee. About 50 dogs and owners attended.

The result was a day of soggy canine chaos.

“We’ve been looking to do something for the dogs for a while,” Hanson said. “We have to close down tomorrow anyway.”
