An additional talk, \u201cOur Path to Winning Is Paved with Values,\u201d will be given by Sandra VanderVen, a senior organizer with the progressive advocacy group Fuse Washington.\n\n\u201cA growing number of people recognize that the Affordable Care Act will leave too many Americans inadequately covered with unaffordable private insurance policies,\u201d said HCFA-WA president Chuck Richards.\n\nJeff Johnson, President of the Washington State Labor Council, emphasized this point in his testimony at a legislative hearing for House Bill 1085 in Olympia in February 2013, the 2-minute video of which can be viewed at: http://www.healthcareforallwa.org/health-care-videos/hb1085-hearing-testimony-videos/#anchor4.\n\nThe meeting will take place from 1 to 4:30 p.m. in Hildebrand Hall at Plymouth Church, U.C.C., 1217 6th Ave. All are invited to attend. Refreshments provided.\n\nThe goal of HCFA-WA is to obtain secure, affordable, and comprehensive health coverage for all Washington residents. Coverage would be provided through a unified health care financing system, the proposed Washington Health Security Trust. In the 2013 legislative session, a bill establishing the WHST, HB 1085, had a hearing in the House Health Care and Wellness Committee. Video clips of the hearing can be viewed at http://www.healthcareforallWA.org.\n\n\"The annual meeting is especially important this year as we consider where we are on our goal to achieve coverage for all Washingtonians,\" said HCFA-WA president Richards. \"We will learn how each of us can participate in the 2014 strategy.\"\n\nThe nonpartisan U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimates that about 30 million Americans will remain uninsured even after full implementation of the ACA. President Obama himself stated, at a 2009 press conference, that \"Unless you have what's called a single-payer system in which everybody is automatically covered, then you're probably not going to reach every single individual.\"\n\nPlymouth Church, U.C.C., is in downtown Seattle, across from the Seneca Street I-5 off-ramp at 1217 6th Ave Seattle, WA 98101. Free parking is available in the church's garage, on University Street approached from Fifth Avenue.
