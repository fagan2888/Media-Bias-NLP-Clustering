And then, according to activist Steve Schmidt, whites were asked to leave:\n\nThe seven groups amounted to six breakout groups for black (or at least non-white) students and one for the remaining white students. The deliberately segregated arrangement was confirmed by local reporter Jared Koller, who was there on behalf of local KOMU-TV news:\n\nJohnetta Elzie, a national Black Lives Matter activist who is in Columbia after previously leading protest efforts in Ferguson, Missouri and Baltimore, said the focus groups were intended to create a \u201cblack-only healing space.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not totally surprising that Concerned Student 1950 would attempt to create segregated areas as part of its protest movement. After protesters attacked reporters who were attempting to cover the drama Monday at MU, the group attacked \u201cwhite media\u201d for failing to \u201cunderstand the importance of respecting black spaces\u201d (though that tweet has since been deleted).\n\nFollow Blake on Twitter\n\nSend tips to blake@ dailycallernewsfoundation.org.\n\nClick here for reuse options!
