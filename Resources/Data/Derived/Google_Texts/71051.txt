A person with life-threatening injuries was one of five people injured in a collision between two SUVs after the driver of one of the vehicles ran a red light.

The person who is in critical condition has not yet been identified.

Four other people who were riding in both of the SUVs received minor injuries in the 11:15 a.m. crash, said Lt. Jeff Turner, Aurora police spokesman.

A man was driving a white Chevrolet Tahoe north on Chambers when he allegedly ran a red light and crashed into the front and side of a Ford Expedition occupied by two adults and four children.

“None of those people in the Tahoe were wearing their seat belts,” Turner said.

A passenger in the Tahoe was hurled through a window as the SUV rolled onto its roof, he said. Two other people in the Tahoe were taken to a local hospital for treatment.

Everyone in the Expedition were wearing their seat belts when the SUV spun 180 degrees during the collision, Turner said. A woman in the front passenger seat of the Expedition and a child in the back of the SUV were taken to a hospital with minor injuries, he said.

The investigation is continuing. The westbound off-ramp of Interstate 70 onto Chambers was closed during the accident investigation.

No one has yet been cited in the accident, although several witnesses including a man who barely avoided the crash himself said the Tahoe had gone through a red light, Turner said.
