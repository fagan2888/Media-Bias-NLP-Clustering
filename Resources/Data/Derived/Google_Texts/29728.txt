Nearly 300,000 people who obtained coverage though HealthCare.gov and state exchanges stopped paying their premiums between March and June of this year, according to CMS data.



As of June 30, about 9.9 million consumers had paid for coverageâ€”which means they had an active policy. That figure is down from 10.2 million consumers who had indicated they wanted to purchase coverage as of March 31.



Mississippi and Georgia, the two states with the most anti-Obamacare political leadership, saw the greatest losses, with both seeing decreases of 8%. Arizona, Indiana, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania saw decreases of 7%. On the flip side, Massachusetts saw an increase between the two periods of 26%.



Despite the losses, CMS notes it is still above its enrollment target of 9.1 million for the end of 2015.



CMS has also noticed a drop in the number of people receiving an advance premium tax credit. There were 8.3 million receiving the credit at the end of June compared to 8.7 million at the end of March.
