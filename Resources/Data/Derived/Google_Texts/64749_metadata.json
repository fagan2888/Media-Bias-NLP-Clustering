I was always hunched,\" he said.\n\nHe stooped before his total double knee replacement just over a year ago because severe arthritis in both joints made it impossible for him to straighten either knee enough to stand tall.\n\nBut more than 10 years of chronic knee pain \u2014 not poor posture \u2014 drove him to seek the surgery he underwent on Dec. 5, 2013.\n\n\"By then, I was icing my knees almost every day, and I said (to the surgeon), 'Look. I'm taking enough Aleve that I should have bought stock in it,'\" Farrell said.\n\nBill Farrell works out in Dawson School's gymnasium Wednesday morning, Jan. 07, 2015. Farrell has had both of his knees replaced and still remains active. (Lewis Geyer / Longmont Times-Call)\n\nHe popped between 10 and 15 of the name brand, over-the-counter pain relief tablets every day to help him referee boys basketball and umpire competitive softball.\n\nBut by then, the pain had sidelined him from playing those sports and forced him to quit alpine skiing both competitively and recreationally 18 years earlier for the same reason.\n\nAll the usual, less invasive methods to relieve knee pain \u2014 anti-inflammatory pain medication, cortisone and/or lubrication shots, physical therapy, and weight loss \u2014 either didn't apply or proved unsuccessful long term in Farrell's case.\n\nStill, the surgeon hesitated to replace both knees at the same time as Farrell requested because of the risk of a longer surgery, greater blood loss, and more difficult recovery.\n\n\"Then, he looked at my X-rays, and he said, 'You don't have a good leg to stand on,'\" recalled Farrell, 56.\n\nTechnology comes of age\n\nIn spite of how pain eroded his active lifestyle, Farrell said he put off the surgery in order to wait for technology to advance.\n\nFor instance, when the total knee replacement surgery debuted in the early 1970s, some surgeons used a titanium device with an actual hinge, said Dr. William P. Cooney, Farrell's surgeon at Front Range Orthopedics & Spine in Longmont.\n\n\"Now all of it \u2014 the surgical technique, anesthesiology and post operative pain management and rehabilitation \u2014 has come 360 degrees. Those improvements have made it an increasingly reliable operation,\" he said.\n\n\"... The biggest misconception is that we chop off the bottom of the thigh bone and the top of the shin bone,\" Cooney continued. \"What we do is remove what is worn out, bone on bone arthritis, and replace it with a metal on plastic implant. ...\n\n\"And this is not just a bone operation. It is an operation that preserves as much of the ligaments and other soft tissues around the joint as possible.\"\n\nCooney begins by carefully pushing aside the knee cap and soft tissue to recontour the bottom of the thigh bone and top of the shin bone. Typically, he removes about inch of bone from each tip.\n\nThen, he cements a highly polished cobalt chrome metal cap to the new surfaces \u2014 eight standard sizes are available to fit knees from petite to burly \u2014 and inserts a very hard plastic bearing between them made from polyethylene to fill the space where cartilage had worn away.\n\nSuch an implant allows the knee to flex in the most anatomically correct way, which \u2014 when combined with the improved low-friction artificial surfaces \u2014 makes movement more natural and sustainable over time, Cooney said.\n\nThe implant's extended durability explains the trend of replacing knees sooner than later, he added. For instance, the age of a typical knee replacement patient in his practice is shifting from between ages 65 and 75 down toward ages 65 and 55.\n\nA year after undergoing a successful double knee replacement, Longmont resident Bill Farrell referees a varsity boys high school basketball game on Dec. 16 in Golden between Golden High School and Fort Collins High School.

He took five or six steps then,\" she said.\n\nThe patient \"x\" factor\n\nThose half-dozen steps launched Bill Farrell's intensive, 10-week rehabilitation under the care of FROS physical therapist Deirdre Weber.\n\nAfter three days in the hospital using a walker and seven days using crutches at LUH's transitional care unit, he headed home and started outpatient rehabilitation with her.\n\nHis first goal entailed graduating from the hospital bed he rented and put in the family's front room in place of their Christmas tree in order to keep his first week at home on one level.\n\nWeber confirmed that the range of motion in his knees would not allow him to safely navigate stairs when he began his therapy with her Dec. 19, 2013.\n\nHer chart shows that Farrell's his right leg flexed 65 degrees versus a healthy 120-plus degrees and his left knee allowed for 75 degrees of flexion.\n\nIf you go What: \"Innovations in the Treatment of hip and knee arthritis: a Patient oriented approach,\" presented by Dr. William P.

I am not a magician.\"\n\nFarrell never expected her to be, and he hopes other prospective patients remember their role in the success of today's knee replacement surgery.\n\n\"Before, I would feel the grind in my knees with every step. I would hear it. I could feel it through my bones,\" Farrell said. \"Now, I don't feel the grind in my knees. And in a game, when I am running the court with 5A varsity boys in high school basketball, I am able to keep up.\"\n\nPam Mellskog can be reached at p.mellskog@gmail.com or at 303-746-0942.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/health/ci_27297482/longmont-man-returns-active-lifestyle-double-knee-replacement", "modificationDate": "2015-01-10T18:38:49-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0110/20150110__11TCCLIFw~3_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Pam Mellskog \n  For the Times-Call", "description": "These days, Bill Farrell jokes about his old place between chimpanzees and modern humans on the Evolution of Man chart. \"I was that Cro-Magnon man.
