Haley VA Medical Center. Joe D. Battle has only been on the job seven weeks but already has a long \u201cto do\u201d list.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get a new bed tower here and authorized for construction,\u201d said Battle, an engineer who started working for the VA more than 32 years.\n\nThe plan is to provide individual rooms for veterans now housed in hospital wards that are almost 50 years old.\n\n\u201cMy personal belief is every veteran deserves a private room to be in when they come to the hospital, and unfortunately at Haley we don't have that in all cases,\u201d Battle said.\n\nHe has other priorities such as consolidating VA services back onto the main campus at 13000 Bruce B. Downs Blvd., Tampa.\n\n\u201cRight now we have a lot of facilities within a 5 mile radius of this campus,\u201d Battle said. \u201cI was joking the other day, it felt like every corner I drove by had a VA clinic of some kind on it.\u201d\n\nThe Haley service area of Hillsborough, Hernando, Pasco and Polk counties includes more than 90,000 veterans currently being treated by the VA.\n\nBattle, who said he loves technology and innovation, also is working the phone system so callers get a response in less than 30 seconds. Right now, he said, it takes on average about a minute. Providing public Wi-Fi to patients and visitors is another priority.\n\nWhen it comes to concerns over wait times for medical appointments, Battle said right now 96 percent of veterans get an appointment within 30 days or less. But he\u2019s aiming to make that 99 percent.\n\nBattle hosted a news media roundtable Monday as part of his outreach to get acquainted with the community. He\u2019s already met with several members of congress, visited MacDill Air Force Base, held a mental health summit with local leaders and a town hall with veterans and met with officials from Tampa and Hillsborough County.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/haley-va-director-patient-tower-priority", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201509/440511512.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Haley VA Director: Patient Tower A Priority"}, "story_id": 440366382, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Bobbie O'Brien", "org_id": 671, "dc": {"title": "Haley VA Director: Patient Tower A Priority"}, "nid": 11960, "datePublished": "2015-09-15", "keywords": "James A.
