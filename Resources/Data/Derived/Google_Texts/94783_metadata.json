The committee, along with gun-control advocates, rightly argued that the information was public and vital to understanding the impact of the law.\n\nBut the data release also begs the question: How many New Yorkers are actually complying with the registration requirements?\n\nIf partisans like the National Shooting Sports Foundation are to be believed, hardly any. The trade group for the firearms industry claims there are at least 1 million assault weapons in the Empire State. That number would be a comfort should the Zombie Apocalypse arrive, but should strike most law-abiding citizens as, well, overkill.\n\nA 4 percent response rate would be disturbing, if true. But given the nature of many firearms transactions, legal or otherwise, we truly have no way of knowing how many of these weapons are available.\n\nStephen Aldstadt, president of the shooters committee, cites the figures as proof that the law is a farce. \"The majority of gun owners and sportsmen in New York have absolutely no respect for this law,\" he said.\n\nWhy he might view this attitude with approval is unclear. How would Aldstadt respond to anyone who says, \"I have absolutely no respect for the Second Amendment?\" The answer, most likely, would be, the law is the law, whether you agree with it or not.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing in the Constitution's right to bear arms that precludes a registry of military-style weapons. Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the SAFE Act has helped limit the availability of illegal weapons and required mental-health officials to report any suspicious activity of gun owners in their care.\n\nThe number of guns registered \"is only evidence of how long overdue the SAFE Act was,\" said Leah Gunn Barrett, executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. \"... The law does not require individuals to surrender their assault weapons, merely to register them.\"\n\nSupport for the SAFE Act remains strong statewide, according to the latest Siena College poll, although slightly more voters in upstate New York oppose the law than favor it.\n\nAmericans are rightly appalled by the ready availability of deadly weapons. There have been 279 mass killings \u2014 four or more slain in one incident \u2014 in the United States since 2006, according to USA Today.\n\nThankfully, a Republican attempt to weaken the SAFE Act failed this legislative session. Like the federal Affordable Care Act, it appears the SAFE Act is here to stay. It's time for gun owners to be the good citizens they aspire to be and make sure every weapon is registered.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1Lv9JHM", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Whether NY gun owners agree or not, they are obligated to register weapons under SAFE Act.", "og": {"site_name": "Rochester Democrat and Chronicle", "description": "Whether NY gun owners agree or not, they are obligated to register weapons under SAFE Act.", "title": "NY gun owners need to obey SAFE Act", "url": "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/06/24/ny-gun-owners-need-obey-safe-act/29234575/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/democratandchronicle.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Whether NY gun owners agree or not, they are obligated to register weapons under SAFE Act.", "title": "NY gun owners need to obey SAFE Act", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/03ee0fef08b23913f9ba5b3cfe8eb08cfdfcb0a6/c=1161-0-4023-2862&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Rochester/B9317849438Z.1_20150624164734_000_GFAB60AR6.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DandC", "site": "@DandC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028377", "fb": {"app_id": 176958652324613}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Siena College", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Siena College", "title": "NY gun owners need to obey SAFE Act", "author": "Editorial Board", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2b246329f1498e898d565f31ed930c772b0c5614/c=1519-0-3665-2862/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Rochester/B9317849438Z.1_20150624164734_000_GFAB60AR6.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/73b58492ccc206ff56e8065cb1bf052b69feaccf/c=1161-0-4023-2862/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Rochester/B9317849438Z.1_20150624164734_000_GFAB60AR6.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1d08a20332ec187f1bb7ec8aa19c9227940e6b9a/c=684-0-4500-2862/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Rochester/B9317849438Z.1_20150624164734_000_GFAB60AR6.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8041d988678d9c9d09ce1e86ea1f0d6be88b1826/c=48-0-5136-2862&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Rochester/B9317849438Z.1_20150624164734_000_GFAB60AR6.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-06-24T17:12:43.603000-04:00", "shorthed": "NY gun owners need to obey SAFE Act", "articleid": 29234575, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/add96db00aece41719d5f358036b69b489af2b2a/c=48-0-5136-2862/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Rochester/B9317849438Z.1_20150624164734_000_GFAB60AR6.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/715d7c12f20713b99d454e7f47643ebc05bcd63d/c=1787-0-3397-2862/local/-/media/2015/06/24/Rochester/B9317849438Z.1_20150624164734_000_GFAB60AR6.1-0.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ed7\"", "article_summary": "Like the federal Affordable Care Act, it appears the SAFE Act is here to stay.\nAndrew Cuomo signs the SAFE Act in a ceremony in Rochester in January 2013.\nIt's time for gun owners to be the good citizens they aspire to be and make sure every weapon is registered.\nThankfully, a Republican attempt to weaken the SAFE Act failed this legislative session.\nAndrew Cuomo says the SAFE Act has helped limit the availability of illegal weapons and required mental-health officials to report any suspicious activity of gun owners in their care."}
