Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sales grew by 9.1% in the second quarter to $19.5 billion, beating expectations of $18.99 billion.\n\n\"When you look at our pharmaceutical business, what\u2019s so impressive is that about five years ago, when we went through a very significant period of patent expiry, we really focused on five key therapeutic areas where we felt there was a lot of unmet medical need,\u201d said Gorsky. \u201cSince then we\u2019ve launched 14 new compounds since 2009, six of which have already achieved blockbuster status.\u201d\n\nGorsky said the company intends to launch ten new pharmaceutical products between 2013 and 2017.\n\nBut not every medical segment is doing as well. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s medical-device sales were up only 0.7% in the second quarter to $7.2 billion in sales, and domestic sales of medical devices decreased by 1.4%.\n\nMore On This... Johnson & Johnson CEO: We are staying in the U.S.\n\nGorsky said the weaker numbers in medical device sales may be tied to the overall economy.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFor many years, you didn\u2019t see a connection necessarily between broader economic themes and consumption of medical devices and utilization in hospitals \u2026 (we) seem to see some elasticity between the overall economy and health-care demand,\u201d said Gorsky. Despite this, Gorsky seemed optimistic about medical device sales in the future, referencing the aging population in the U.S.\n\nNo Plans to Move Overseas\n\nThough other American companies have discussed moving headquarters overseas to avoid the high corporate tax rate in the U.S.,Gorsky said Johnson & Johnson plans to stay put.\n\n\u201cAs we think about acquiring other companies, new technologies and really managing our business for the long-term and the future, tax is certainly an issue we take a look at, but it\u2019s not the primary driver and we always first focus on strategy,\u201d said Gorsky.\n\nGorsky said he thinks not just about a one-year plan, but also a five-and-ten-year plan.\n\n\u201cAnd what we see [is that] tax law can change,\u201d said Gorsky.\n\nAnd while Johnson & Johnson was a supporter of the Affordable Care Act, Gorsky said the law has meant significant taxes and fees for the company.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re paying additional taxes and fees well over a billion dollars for a company the size of Johnson & Johnson,\u201d said Gorsky.\n\nHe added that he thinks the longer-term impact of the Affordable Care Act will just now start to be seen in the United States.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/MARKETS/Earnings,/FOX BUSINESS/INDUSTRIES/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-09 12:21:49 EST", "dc.type":
