Light snow and snow showers will continue through Tuesday morning, Kalina said.\n\nOver the central mountains, snow will increase through the afternoon, Kalina said,while over the plains it will taper off.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, it is over,\u201d Kyle Frieden, NWS meteorologist, said on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche Information Center warns of possible danger from avalanches as new snow continues to pile up. The weather service said 4 feet of snow has fallen between Denver and the Continental Divide.\n\nIn spite of the heavy precipitation, there isn\u2019t much danger of flooding as the snow melts, said Frieden.\n\n\u201cTemperatures are going to likely stay cool enough that it will be a slow release. The snow should melt at a manageable rate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe melt will raise some rivers and streams, but flooding won\u2019t be a problem in the near future. Flooding is more likely in late May and early June, Frieden said.\n\nThe weekend snowstorm is to blame for one death.\n\nA patient was killed when an ambulance crashed around 2 a.m. Sunday on Interstate 76 near Brush, according to Colorado State Patrol officials.\n\nLauren Putney, a 23-year-old from Julesbeg, was transporting Brenda Ebke, a 57-year-old patient, between hospitals in a Sedgewick County EMS Ambulance when she lost control in the snow. Ebke died on the scene.\n\nPutney and Vickie Sandlin, a 53-year-old Julesberg resident who was riding along, were transported to a hospital with injuries.\n\nState Patrol officials said the crash was the only fatality related to dangerous road conditions due to the weekend\u2019s snowstorm.\n\nA Colorado State Patrol trooper escaped serious injury early Sunday. A car that skidded on Interstate 25 near Castle Rock struck the trooper\u2019s cruiser while the officer was out of the car assisting with a three-car crash.\n\nTravel at Denver International Airport returned to normal Sunday despite the airport receiving almost a foot of snow. More than 850 flights were canceled Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have many delays because our flight schedule was thinned out,\u201d said Heath Montgomery, DIA spokesman.\n\nBecause big crowds were expected Sunday, Montgomery urged travelers to arrive at the airport at least two hours before their scheduled departure.\n\nThe slow-moving snow storm forced the postponement of the annual 420 Rally in Civic Center park.\n\nThe weekend storm dumped wet, heavy snow that coated power lines and tree branches. Kalina said that reports show there\u2019s about an inch of precipitation in every 10 inches of snow.\n\n\u201cThe main worry with it being this wet is for it to stick to trees and cause broken tree limbs and the concern is for power outages,\u201d Kalina said.\n\nAt 10:57 a.m. Sunday, Xcel Energy reported 147 power outages, most in the metro area, that left 4,053 customers without power.\n\nPeople trying to dig out are encouraged to break up the work and not try to shovel too much wet, heavy snow at once.\n\nThe Colorado Comprehensive Spine Institute recommends:\n\n\u2022 Use a shovel with a small blade to help ensure you don\u2019t pick up too heavy of a load.\n\n\u2022 Warm up your muscles before heading out to shovel.\n\n\u2022 To improve leverage, keep your hands at least 12 inches apart on the handle.\n\n\u2022 If you must lift rather than push the snow, don\u2019t use your back. Squat with your back straight and lift with your legs.\n\n\u2022 Walk small amounts of snow over to where you want to dump it.\n\n\u2022 Move your feet rather than twist.\n\nThe weather is expected to improve through the week.\n\nThe sun is expected to be finished by Wednesday, when the temperature is expected to be near 56 degrees.\n\nOn Thursday, the mercury will climb to 67 degrees and temperatures should be back in the 70s by Friday.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee\n\nStaff writer Katy Canada contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bulk of Colorado\u2019s spring snow has fallen, but light snow expected to continue in some areas", "title": "Bulk of Colorado\u2019s spring snow has fallen, but light snow expected to continue in some areas", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/17/bulk-of-colorados-spring-snow-has-fallen-but-light-snow-expected-to-continue-in-some-areas/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416_055316_snowy-denver-1.jpg", "height": 449}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416_055316_snowy-denver-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-17T08:16:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T03:59:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2436\"", "article_summary": "The weekend storm dumped wet, heavy snow that coated power lines and tree branches.\nPeople trying to dig out are encouraged to break up the work and not try to shovel too much wet, heavy snow at once.\nLight snow and snow showers will continue through Tuesday morning, Kalina said.\nThe sun is expected to be finished by Wednesday, when the temperature is expected to be near 56 degrees.\nA patient was killed when an ambulance crashed around 2 a.m. Sunday on Interstate 76 near Brush, according to Colorado State Patrol officials."}
