They face the toughest economic challenges in converting to alternative energy sources.\n\nRelated: Obama: This May Be \u2018The Last Generation\u2019 That Can Stop Climate Change\n\nYet according to the new report, Ohio already is on track to meet 82 percent of the EPA goals by 2022 based on rate of emissions, Michigan is 63 percent of the way there, Arizona 84 percent and Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina could end up achieving twice the federal target.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really sort of an interesting look at how far along states are towards getting to the targets,\u201d said Richardson. \u201cWhat we analyzed for this rule was just looking at existing policies that states already have in place.\u201d\n\nIn short, states have achieved a lot on their own, while Congress and the Obama administration bickered for nearly seven years over new policies for addressing global warming. \u201cBut I think the federal rule is critical because it puts us nationally on a pathway to reducing our emissions,\u201d Richardson noted. \u201cIt recognizes the leadership that certain states have already taken to reduce emissions, but it is really trying to bring everybody along in that pathway towards a clean air economy.\u201d\n\nIn issuing the final rules, the EPA gave the states two extra years to meet the new goals and granted them broad flexibility in implementing the plan. That means states will be allowed to exercise discretion in how best to manage the emissions \u2014 including a carbon tax, investments in renewable energy sources and a multi-state emissions trading system.\n\nRelated: The High Cost of Climate Change \u2013 Wildfires Burn through the Forests Service Budget\n\nOpponents view the new rule as an illegal power grab by the Obama administration that will force states highly dependent on coal-generated electricity to spend large sums to upgrade or close older power plants, increase utility rates and lay off workers.\n\nA new Morning Consult poll found that pluralities of registered voters believe that the new Clean Power Plan will result in higher energy bills, although 63 percent support the rule.\n\n\u201cThese regulations, if allowed to proceed, will do serious harm to West Virginia and the U.S. economy, and that is why we are taking quick action to bring this process to a halt,\u201d West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a leading opponent of the rule, said recently.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new study by the Union of Concerned Scientists", "title": "As States Battle New EPA Rules, Some Make Surprising Progress on Emissions", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/16/States-Battle-New-EPA-Rules-Some-Make-Surprising-Progress-Emissions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05162012_Droughts_Crops_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/16/States-Battle-New-EPA-Rules-Some-Make-Surprising-Progress-Emissions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05162012_Droughts_Crops_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new study by the Union of Concerned Scientists", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7ba\"", "article_summary": "Many of those states are highly reliant on coal-generated power and emit high levels of carbon emissions that directly contribute to global warming.\nMoreover, 20 states are effectively more than halfway toward meeting their 2030 Clean Power Plan target, with 16 set to surpass those targets.\n\u201cBut I think the federal rule is critical because it puts us nationally on a pathway to reducing our emissions,\u201d Richardson noted.\nRelated: Which States Get Hit Hardest by Obama\u2019s New Energy Rule?\nThat means states will be allowed to exercise discretion in how best to manage the emissions \u2014 including a carbon tax, investments in renewable energy sources and a multi-state emissions trading system."}
