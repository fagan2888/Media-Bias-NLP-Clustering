By law, breastfeeding mothers are not protected from harassment and refusal of service in public, often forcing them to feed in secluded spaces such as public bathrooms,\u201d the advertisement copy reads. \u201cContact your state and/or local representative to voice your support for breastfeeding mothers, because a baby should never be nurtured where nature calls.\u201d\n\nThe ads are simply conceptual, and the students don\u2019t actually have plans to print them and place them on the back of bathroom stalls. But they\u2019ve gone somewhat viral online, featured on sites like the Huffington Post, Popsugar, and Cosmopolitan. Haro and Wenske say they\u2019re glad for the exposure. \u201cIt means we did our jobs right as art directors in creating a campaign that is getting real responses, and as students, it\u2019s been a wonderful feeling,\u201d Wenske told The Huffington Post.\n\nDoctors, researchers, and government health agencies all encourage mothers to breastfeed if they\u2019re able. Nonetheless, the act remains contentious. The above ads are receiving some criticism for being \u201cobscene.\u201d And one of the women featured in the campaign wrote on Facebook that she often gets sexual comments while she\u2019s breastfeeding, and \u201cit\u2019d be pretty great not to have any nasty comments made while I\u2019m feeding my child.\u201d\n\nWomen have been asked to stop breastfeeding in church, during jury duty, at the pool, at the mall, and on social media. Often, they\u2019re specifically told to go to the bathroom. Sometimes, they have even less sanitary options available to them \u2014 one Pennsylvania woman sued her employer after being forced to pump breast milk in a dingy and sweltering locker room littered with dead bugs.\n\nObamacare took a step forward in this area by requiring all employers to provide their workers with \u201creasonable break time\u201d to pump breast milk, as well as a private and clean space for that activity. Advocates praised the health law for \u201cbringing breast feeding out of the bathroom.\u201d But the state laws in this area still vary. Twenty two states \u2014 including Texas \u2014 don\u2019t specifically exempt breastfeeding from public indecency laws. The legislation tied to this ad campaign would protect Texas mothers\u2019 right to feed their babies in public, stipulating that \u201ca mother\u2019s authority to be in a location may not be revoked for the sole reason that she begins to breast-feed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Their ad campaign depicts young mothers being forced to feed their children in dirty bathroom stalls.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Their ad campaign depicts young mothers being forced to feed their children in dirty bathroom stalls.", "title": "College Students In Texas Fight For Women\u2019s Right To Breastfeed In Public", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/05/14/3437835/breastfeeding-public-campaign-texas/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/breastfeeding-campaign-665x385.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Their ad campaign depicts young mothers being forced to feed their children in dirty bathroom stalls.", "title": "College Students In Texas Fight For Women\u2019s Right To Breastfeed In Public", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/breastfeeding-campaign-665x385-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/breastfeeding-campaign-665x385.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/breastfeeding-campaign-665x385.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-14T12:16:31+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2343\"", "article_summary": "Health College Students In Texas Fight For Women\u2019s Right To Breastfeed In Public CREDIT: When Nature CallsIn order to drum up support for a proposed bill in Texas that would protect women\u2019s right to breastfeed in public, a pair of college students created an ad campaign illustrating what it looks like when women don\u2019t have that right.\nBy law, breastfeeding mothers are not protected from harassment and refusal of service in public, often forcing them to feed in secluded spaces such as public bathrooms,\u201d the advertisement copy reads.\nTwenty two states \u2014 including Texas \u2014 don\u2019t specifically exempt breastfeeding from public indecency laws.\nThe legislation tied to this ad campaign would protect Texas mothers\u2019 right to feed their babies in public, stipulating that \u201ca mother\u2019s authority to be in a location may not be revoked for the sole reason that she begins to breast-feed.\u201d\n\u201cWhen Nature Calls,\u201d a class project by University of North Texas students Kris Haro and Johnathan Wenske, depicts young mothers forced to feed their children in dirty public bathroom stalls:CREDIT: When Nature CallsCREDIT: When Nature CallsCREDIT: When Nature Calls\u201cWould you eat here?"}
