DAYTON, Ohio â€” A national real estate search company says two of the top 10 most affordable U.S. cities to live in are Kansas City, Mo., and Wichita.

Trulia ranked Akron and Dayton as the two most affordable cities in its survey, based on a combination of high wages and low home prices.

Kansas City, Mo., was fourth on the list and Wichita fifth.

Trulia analyzed the percentage of an average middle-class income spent on housing, commuting and utilities.

Home prices in those cities are below the national average, and more people can afford to make monthly mortgage payments depending on their income levels.

Others in the top 10 included Louisville, Ky.; Little Rock, Ark.; Cleveland, Toledo, Ohio; Syracuse, N.Y., and St. Louis.
