NEW YORK (AP) — Another Clinton is becoming an author.

Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and current presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, has a deal with Penguin Young Readers for “It’s Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired & Get Going!” the publisher announced Wednesday.

The book aims to inspire young people to “change the world” and will cover issues including poverty and gender equality, according to Penguin. Publication is scheduled for Sept. 15.

“In `It’s Your World,’ I try to explain what I think are some of the biggest challenges facing our world today, particularly for young people,” Chelsea Clinton said in a statement issued by Penguin.

“I also explore some of the solutions to those challenges and share stories of inspiring kids and teenagers doing amazing work to help people and our planet have brighter and healthier futures.”

Penguin said the idea for the book originated with Jill Santopolo, executive editor of the Penguin imprint Philomel Books.

A spokesman for Chelsea Clinton, Kamyl Bazbaz, said she will donate all the proceeds to “charities of her choosing that focus on the issues addressed in the book,” including the family charity, the Clinton Foundation.

Clinton’s parents have each released million-selling memoirs centered on their White House years. Their other books include Hillary Clinton’s memoir on her years as secretary of state, “Hard Choices,” and a publication by Bill Clinton that has a theme not unlike Chelsea’s book, “Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World.”
