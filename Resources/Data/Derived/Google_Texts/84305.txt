Golden firefighters raced to rescue a fallen hiker in Clear Creek Canyon eight miles west of town Sunday evening, leading to closure of a three-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 6 for more than three hours.

A hiker left a trail and fell on loose rock. He slid and suffered a broken ankle, Golden Fire Department spokeswoman Karlyn Tilley said. A friend telephoned for help.

The Colorado State Patrol closed the highway around 5:26 p.m. to help the rescue, a dispatcher said. The Golden rescuers reached the hiker shortly before 6 p.m. and were in the process of hauling him down the trail.

Casinos that benefit from free-flowing traffic up the mountain canyon help equip rescue crews.
