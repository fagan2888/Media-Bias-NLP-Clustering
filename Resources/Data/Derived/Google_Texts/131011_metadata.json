As consumers, we have more choices than ever for streaming, downloading, sharing, and enjoying music. Meanwhile, as new services and billion-dollar acquisitions of companies are announced with astounding regularity, independent creators of all types face an array of threats that they might \u201cdisappear\u201d from the Internet unless they agree to licensing deals and business practices that cannot sustain continued production of their works.\n\nThe press is abuzz with reports of Google\u2019s recently revealed extortionate tactics against indie labels and artists. Rumors are that those who don\u2019t accept YouTube\u2019s take-it-or-leave-it licensing deal for its new streaming service will be barred from offering their own channels on YouTube and prevented from using tools like Content ID to identify their music when it is posted by others without authorization. This means not only that authorized versions of such indie artists\u2019 work will vanish from YouTube, but that infringing copies, against which Google will still sell advertising, will stay up.\n\nThese practices are not limited to the music world. Not so long ago, Google changed its image search interface so that full-size, high-resolution images \u2013 rather than low-resolution thumbnails \u2013 appear in a slideshow-like format. Google search results now omit specific references to the site where the photographer\u2019s work appears, and instead enable users to page through the full size gallery of images in search results without navigating to the source websites. This switch has resulted in traffic declines of close to 80 percent to photography-rich websites and squanders the investment made by site owners in applying SEO practices to the photographs they license or produce. Google\u2019s response to photographers and site owners in the U.S.? \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, mark your site not to be searched.\u201d Put another way \u2013 \u201cthe only way to stop us is to remove yourself from the Internet.\u201d\n\nLikewise, authors have been recently held hostage by Amazon in order to extract more favorable terms from publishers. When negotiations between Amazon and Hachette stalled, the online retailer \u201cdisappeared\u201d Hachette authors from their pages by eliminating Buy buttons for certain books, preventing pre-orders of new titles, delaying shipments of some Hachette products, and even prompting customers to buy \u201csimilar\u201d works instead of the Hachette title being sought.\n\nIt should give us all reason to pause when companies known for evangelizing the benefits of making creative work available on the Internet and through new technology platforms instead use their market power to make the work of indie artists and creators inaccessible, except through infringing means. Congress, the DOJ and the FTC should ask why this is happening.\n\nAistars is the chief executive officer of the Copyright Alliance, a non-profit organization representing artists, creators and innovators across the spectrum of creative disciplines.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Companies known for evangelizing the benefits of making creative work available on the Internet use their market power to make the work of indie artists and creators inaccessible.", "description": "Companies known for evangelizing the benefits of making creative work available on the Internet use their market power to make the work of indie artists and creators inaccessible.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Companies known for evangelizing the benefits of making creative work available on the Internet use their market power to make the work of indie artists and creators inaccessible.", "title": "Why are artists disappearing from the Internet?", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/210113-why-are-artists-disappearing-from-the-internet", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/210113-why-are-artists-disappearing-from-the-internet", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-24T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Sandra Aistars", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-24T10:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/210113-why-are-artists-disappearing-from-the-internet", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Companies known for evangelizing the benefits of making creative work available on the Internet use their market power to make the work of indie artists and creators inaccessible.", "card": "summary", "title": "Why are artists disappearing from the Internet?"}, "dcterms.title": "Why are artists disappearing from the Internet?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a61\"", "article_summary": "This means not only that authorized versions of such indie artists\u2019 work will vanish from YouTube, but that infringing copies, against which Google will still sell advertising, will stay up.\nThis week, Congress is holding the second of two hearings on music licensing.\nThe press is abuzz with reports of Google\u2019s recently revealed extortionate tactics against indie labels and artists.\nAistars is the chief executive officer of the Copyright Alliance, a non-profit organization representing artists, creators and innovators across the spectrum of creative disciplines.\nIt should give us all reason to pause when companies known for evangelizing the benefits of making creative work available on the Internet and through new technology platforms instead use their market power to make the work of indie artists and creators inaccessible, except through infringing means."}
