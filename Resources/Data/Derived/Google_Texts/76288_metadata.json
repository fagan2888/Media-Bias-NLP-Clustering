Beegle says that although she told the flight attendant that her daughter was autistic and might begin to \u201cscratch\u201d other passengers if she did not get food that she was willing to eat, it was difficult to get the United employee to comply.\n\nAlthough others say that, after the meal arrived, the autistic passenger was calm, the family was still escorted off of the plane after an emergency landing. Though Beegle is saying the incident is an example of \u201cfear of autism,\u201d some other people who were on board the flight were relieved when Juliette was ushered off. One such flyer, Marilyn Hedlund, told KOIN-6 that she felt threatened by the \u201chowling\u201d of the young autistic girl.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of howling, and we thought well, what\u2019s going on? And it never stopped. She wasn\u2019t put off the plane because she had autism, she was put off the plane because she was maybe proposing some kind of a threat, to (about) 170 other people at 36,000 feet, which doesn\u2019t make anyone feel safe. What if she got crazy and got up and opened an exit door at 36,000 feet?\u2026 I think the airline did everything they possibly could.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that the rest of the passengers agreed with the decision. One man, Chris Hall, became so irritated that he began filming the incident with his cell phone. Chris handed over that footage, where a another person can be heard saying that a lawsuit is likely, to KOIN-6.\n\n\u201cThe child would make noise every now and then, no louder than, say, a baby crying. I don\u2019t think they should have landed a plane for her being fussy.\u201d\n\nUnited has issued a statement where they claim that the reaction was justified and that the family of the autistic young lady was given another flight.\n\n\u201cAfter working to accommodate Dr. Beegle and her daughter during the flight, the crew made the best decision for the safety and comfort of all of our customers and elected to divert to Salt Lake City after the situation became disruptive. We rebooked the customers on a different carrier and the flight continued to Portland.\u201d\n\n[Image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 15-year-old autistic girl was kicked off of a flight home from Disney World along with the rest of her family because her behavior was reportedly making the", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "A 15-year-old autistic girl was kicked off of a flight home from Disney World along with the rest of her family because her behavior was reportedly making the", "title": "Autistic Girl Booted From Disney World Flight, Family Plans Lawsuit", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2080087/autistic-girl-booted-from-disney-world-flight-family-plans-lawsuit/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/autisticgirlbooted.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-10T21:01:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-10T21:11:40+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/autisticgirlbooted.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-05-10T21:01:01+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "autism,fussy,united airlines,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/autisticgirlbooted.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A 15-year-old autistic girl was kicked off of a flight home from Disney World along with the rest of her family because her behavior was reportedly making the"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "One such flyer, Marilyn Hedlund, told KOIN-6 that she felt threatened by the \u201chowling\u201d of the young autistic girl.\nAlthough others say that, after the meal arrived, the autistic passenger was calm, the family was still escorted off of the plane after an emergency landing.\nWe rebooked the customers on a different carrier and the flight continued to Portland.\u201d[Image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]\nChris handed over that footage, where a another person can be heard saying that a lawsuit is likely, to KOIN-6.\nI don\u2019t think they should have landed a plane for her being fussy.\u201dUnited has issued a statement where they claim that the reaction was justified and that the family of the autistic young lady was given another flight."}
