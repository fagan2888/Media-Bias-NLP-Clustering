Schimmel shocked the world in route to a Final Four appearance, where the \u201cUmatilla Thrilla\u201d pulled off the ultimate David vs. Goliath feat when she and her Louisville Cardinals knocked off one of the greatest female basketball player of all time, Brittney Griner, and the #1-rated Baylor Bears.\n\nThis year, Natives across the country are preparing for another March Madness run by one of our own: Ho-Chunk citizen Bronson Koenig.\n\nIn today\u2019s world of college hoops, it is a rarity to see a team return 11 of 12 lettermen, but that is what coach Bo Ryan has done at Wisconsin. Although the highly respected coach has been successful throughout his career while compiling a record of 363-169, this season may be the best opportunity Ryan gets to win a NCAA men\u2019s basketball national title.\n\nMinus a small group of Native hoops aficionados who have followed the 6\u20194\u201d guard since high school, Koenig, burst on to the scene last year during the men\u2019s NCAA tournament, when his timely shooting and key defensive stops played a huge role in Wisconsin\u2019s first trip to the Final Four. This year, Koenig is playing big minutes and the Badgers are on everyone\u2019s short list of national title contenders.\n\nIn high school, Koenig was rated as one of ESPN\u2019s top 100 players and as the 14th best senior point guard in the country by Rivals.com. As a senior, Koenig was named the Wisconsin Player of the Year after averaging 17.0 points and 4.0 assists a game for Aquinas High School in La Crosse, Wisconsin.\n\nKoenig was courted by Duke and other hoops powerhouses but to the delight of the Badger faithful, he decided to stay in-state. Koenig headlined a spectacular recruiting class for UW as he was joined by Nigel Hayes, who has developed into one of the best low-post scorers in the BIG 10.\n\nNow, the Badgers are enjoying the fruits of that masterful recruiting season as the two super- sophomores are playing big-time minutes alongside All-American Frank Kaminsky. Although a dead-eye shooter, Koenig, has flourished in Ryan\u2019s swing offense where he has displayed his aptitude as a distributor establishing a notable 4/1 assist to turnover ratio.\n\nCurrently, the Badgers are ranked #4 in both the Coaches and USA Today polls, and are second behind Maryland in the BIG 10.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two years ago, Indian Country united behind the rez ball game of Shoni Schimmel.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/01/02/ho-chunk-baller-lighting-it-badgers-158527", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/bronson_koenig_0.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Ho-Chunk Baller Lighting it up for Badgers"}, "dcterms.date": "2015-01-02T12:52-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/01/02/ho-chunk-baller-lighting-it-badgers-158527", "dc": {"title": "Ho-Chunk Baller Lighting it up for Badgers"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Ho-Chunk Baller Lighting it up for Badgers"}, "article_summary": "This year, Koenig is playing big minutes and the Badgers are on everyone\u2019s short list of national title contenders.\nThis year, Natives across the country are preparing for another March Madness run by one of our own: Ho-Chunk citizen Bronson Koenig.\nCurrently, the Badgers are ranked #4 in both the Coaches and USA Today polls, and are second behind Maryland in the BIG 10.\nIn high school, Koenig was rated as one of ESPN\u2019s top 100 players and as the 14th best senior point guard in the country by Rivals.com.\nNow, the Badgers are enjoying the fruits of that masterful recruiting season as the two super- sophomores are playing big-time minutes alongside All-American Frank Kaminsky."}
