That\u2019s the smallest pension deficit since 2007, when plans had a surplus of $82 billion. The overall average funded status last year rose to 91 percent from 78 percent.\n\nRelated: Mismanaged State Pensions Bill Taxpayers for Shortfall\n\nAverage investment returns for plan sponsors were 10.8 percent. Companies are shifting their investment mix from stocks to fixed income and alternative investments in order to reduce investment risk.\n\nAmong the 100 plans analyzed, 22 were fully funded, up from just 5 at the end of 2012. In 2007, before the 2008 financial collapse, half the plans were fully funded.\n\nUnderfunded pension plans have recently become more expensive for companies. New regulations passed in last year\u2019s federal budget substantially increased the premiums that companies must pay to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation if their pension funds are not fully funded.\n\nPlan sponsors contributed a total $27.8 billion to their pension funds, down from $45.2 billion in contributions in 2012 and the smallest amount since 2008. The median contribution was 60 percent more than the value of benefits accrued during the year.\n\nGiven the high cost of defined-benefit plans, companies are increasingly replacing them with defined-contribution plans such as 401(k)s in which employees bear more responsibility to save for their own retirement. Less than one third of Fortune 100 companies offered defined benefit pension plans to newly hired workers last year, down from 90 percent in 1985.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Finally, some good news for pensioners, at least those who work for or used to work for large companies.
