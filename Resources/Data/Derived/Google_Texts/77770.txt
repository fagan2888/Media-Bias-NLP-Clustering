It's being called the 21st century house call.



Known as Telehealth, it's a way for patients to connect with board-certified doctors 24 hours a day, seven days a week, live and online.

"It brings health care home," said Dr. Roy Schoenberg, the cofounder and CEO of Boston-based American Well, the creator of the technology. "Anyone of us can download the app or go to the website, select a physician that they choose and they like and engage with them immediately."

Compare that to the average wait for an appointment in Boston -- 44.5 days, according to Merritt Hawkins, a national health care search and consulting firm.

"All of these 30-something million people who can now afford health care (through the Affordable Care Act) are going to start taking advantage of it. So physicians' lines are going to be longer. Appointments are going to take forever," said Schoenberg.

NewsCenter 5 first told you about American Well in 2009, when Telehealth was only available in Hawaii. Four years later, it's now live in 44 states, including Massachusetts.

"This is changing, literally, on almost weekly basis. It's growing so fast. It's really unbelievable," said Schoenberg.

That's why Schoenberg paid a visit to the White House last month to talk about the role Telehealth will play in President Barack Obama's health care plan.

"If you don't have a primary care physician or if you live too far or it's late at night, this is really where technology comes in," said Schoenberg.

While it does have limits, it's affordable with costs ranging from $10 to $50 per online consultation, depending on your health care coverage.



"We haven't found a way to do heart bypass, you know coronary bypass, through an iPhone, yet," said Schoenberg.

In the four months since Telehealth's role out here in Massachusetts, more than 50,000 people have signed up.
