The black conservative group Project 21 is defending Bill Cosby from the release of the court documents from a 2005 case in which Cosby saidadmitted he obtained Quaaludes to give to women he wanted to have sex with.

At issue was how Judge Eduardo Robreno decided to release the documents due to Cosby’s role as a “public moralist,” specifically with his “Pound Cake” speech talking about crime and the responsibility of black families.

In the Project 21 press release, co-chair Horace Cooper says, “This ruling is appalling. A decision to unseal documents is a weighty one and should only occur under exceptional circumstances – circumstances that have nothing to do with the popularity (or lack thereof) of one of the litigating parties.”

Member Deroy Murdock also said that “Americans should be free to express themselves without fearing that their views will be used later to justify breaching confidential documents in what resembles political score settling by federal judges.”

There’s also this comment from Bishop Council Nedd:

“What the judge did in this case is as morally reprehensible as SCOTUS deciding to ignore the Constitution on the gay marriage issue. The judge releasing those sealed documents is pandering to the media, akin to Justice Roberts’s decision in the ObamaCare ruling, and Charleston County Magistrate James Gosnell, Jr.’s very odd speech at the arraignment of Dylann Roof.”
