A boil water advisory issued for the town of Pretty Prairie last week has been lifted.

City officials said Sunday morning that the latest water test results came back negative for any harmful bacteria.

A boil water advisory has been issued for the town of Pretty Prairie after a water sample turned up positive for E. coli.

While this is just a precaution until further tests can confirm the results, residents are asked to boil water before consuming.

"We just decided to play on the safe side and use bottled water," said resident Mike Hendrick.

Many residents like Hendrick found out about the boil advisory late Friday afternoon.

"It was kind of a jolt and we just had an incident where a young girl in Kansas died from E. coli which was very recent so it definitely gets your attention," he said.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment issued the alert because an E. coli positive bacteria sample out of the town's public water supply. KDHE says most E. coli is harmless, however some can make people very sick, especially those young and old.

Hendrick hopes this is either an isolated incident or a bad sample.

"Until they complete their testing and find a cause I don't think there's a huge reason to panic just do what they ask to do and you'll be fine," he said.

Until this boil advisory is lifted, Pretty Prairie residents are asked to:

1. Boil water for a minute before drinking or using for food preparation.

2. Throw away ice cubes and don't use ice from a household automatic icemaker.

3. Water used for bathing doesn't generally need to be boiled, but parents are asked to supervise their young children to make sure water is not ingested.
