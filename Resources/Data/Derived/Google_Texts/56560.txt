BUFFALO, N.Y. — The Sabres made newly acquired forward Ryan O’Reilly their highest-paid player by signing him to a $52.5 million, seven-year contract extension Friday.

The Sabres announced the signing, while two people familiar with discussions revealed the value of the contract to The Associated Press. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Sabres did not disclose the monetary terms.

O’Reilly’s extension will kick in after he completes the final year of his existing contract, which will pay him $6.2 million next season. He will make $11 million in the 2016-17 season of an extension that runs through the 2022-23 season.

The 24-year-old O’Reilly is regarded as a top-line talent and was acquired from Colorado in a trade that involved five players during the first round of the NHL draft June 26.

The Sabres also acquired forward Jamie McGinn, while giving up forwards Mikhail Grigorenko and JT Compher, defenseman Nikita Zadorov and the 31st pick in the draft.

“It’s not easy to find a player who, at his age, is already established in the league as someone who plays a complete game and makes his teammates better,” Sabres general manager Tim Murray said of O’Reilly. “When we acquired him, we viewed him as someone who could immediately improve our roster, but was still young enough to make an impact for several years to come. And this contract reflects that belief.”

O’Reilly will get an opportunity to play alongside rookie center Jack Eichel, who was selected with the second pick in the draft. O’Reilly had 17 goals and 55 points in 80 games with the Avalanche last season.

He also led Avalanche forwards in averaging nearly 20 minutes of ice time.

The sixth-year NHL player has 90 goals and 246 points in 427 games during his career.

O’Reilly is a key fixture in a rebuilding process for a Sabres team that is coming off consecutive last-place finishes.
