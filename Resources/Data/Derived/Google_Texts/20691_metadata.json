Donald Trump is the number one contender for the GOP Presidential nomination. Love or hate him \u2014 really appears to be no in-between \u2014 he\u2019s taken the illegal immigrant issue to task and now turning his aim to the tax code.\n\nHillary Clinton has voiced here own concerns over Wall Street and capital gains taxation. Trump is now in on the hedge fund bashing, noting, \u201cThe hedge fund guys didn\u2019t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky\u2026.They make a fortune. They pay no tax. It\u2019s ridiculous\u2026\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s issue is carried interest that allows hedge funds to pay taxes at capital gain rates instead of ordinary income.\n\nThe answer, per Donald Trump, is to simplify the tax code by reducing deductions and lowering rates for the middle class. Trump is incensed that a person earning $50,000 has to spend money on professional advice from H&R Block to file his returns.\n\nBasically, H&R Block would be rendered useless. Trump is the self-appointed \u201cking of maneuvering the tax code,\u201d enjoying laughs with his hedge fund friends about \u201chow little they pay\u201d.\n\nNow \u2014 there\u2019s been a call for tax \u201csimplification and reduction\u201d for some time. With many complaining that the tax code is filled with complexities and idiosyncrasies.\n\nH&R Block isn\u2019t throwing in the towel. In an interview, CEO Bill Cobb said that he doesn\u2019t want complexity in the tax business. But any President will have to deal with 535 people in the Congress to amend any tax laws. Bill does not that complications arise from social programs like dependents and child care, Affordable Care Act, etc. No doubt a ploy to pacify H&R Block investors.\n\nThis also comes as the company just installed a fresh $3.5 billion share buyback. Get ready for some buyback blowback and look for the calls for H&R Block to go private to resurface if Trump makes his tax plan public this month.\n\nLike this article?
