Scott Walker, is a further lurch to the left for an organization that played an instrumental role in getting Obamacare passed.\n\n\u201cWe made an offer to anyone who cut their AARP card in half that we\u2019d give them a year\u2019s free membership,\u201d said Randy Lewis, spokesman for the American Seniors Association. \u201cWe had to stop it early. I had too many 55-gallon trash bags full of AARP cards cut in half.\u201d\n\nPhillip Owens, of Beloit, dumped his AARP membership after 20 years with the organization, objecting to his dues supporting liberal policies like Obamacare he didn\u2019t agree with.\n\nOwens joined and is now the state delegate for the Association of Mature American Citizens. AMAC now boasts more than 1 million members, including 18,500 members in Wisconsin alone, Owens said. He claims the organization has been adding about 60,000 new members a month.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking for an alternative,\u201d he said. \u201cAMAC listens to membership, they respond to membership. AARP\u2019s membership had written them on a repeated basis and they continued to support Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAnd all that AARP junk mail?\n\n\u201cTheir mail still comes and it goes right into the trash barrel,\u201d said Owens, a retired veteran of the U.S. Army and Navy.\n\nThe American Seniors Association\u2019s 1.5 million members is a fraction of AARP\u2019s 37 million membership, but the \u201cboldly conservative\u201d for-profit service is growing and targeting an ever-expanding senior demographic.\n\nObamacare, Lewis said, was a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d in the senior advocacy circuit.\n\n\u201cOver the last three decades, AARP has gone from having an independent voice to being the seniors department of the Democratic Party,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to see anger towards AARP for the role they played in passing Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe ascension of Stella isn\u2019t likely to quell any anger. In November 2011, while secretary of state Department of Employee Trust Funds, Stella signed a petition to recall Walker. He criticized Republican-led changes to the state pension fund, which required employees to contribute to their pensions.\n\nStella\u2019s wife, Kathleen, circulated the recall petition in their Middleton neighborhood. She contributed $100 to Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett in that June 2012 recall election. She also wrote letters to the editor in praise of Obamacare just weeks before the disastrous rollout of the HealthCare.gov website.\n\nWisconsin Reporter tried to reach Stella, but he did not return calls.\n\nSam Wilson, state director of AARP, insisted Stella would be the non-partisan leader of a non-partisan advocacy group for seniors.\n\n\u201cOur policy is very straightforward that AARP is a non-partisan organization,\u201d Wilson told Wisconsin Reporter. \u201cAnyone named to a position of leadership, as (Stella) has as state president, having a non-partisan stance is the first guiding principle. When we engage in advocacy campaigns they are non-partisan in nature.\u201d\n\nWilson acknowledges that AARP supported Obamacare. The organization has opposed Walker\u2019s call for a three-month delay of a law AARP supported that would move roughly 80,000 childless adults living in poverty into Medicaid this January.\n\n\u201cWe supported the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cOne of the things we are focused on now is the education component of that. The law is being implemented \u2014 that piece of it is settled.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the Wall Street Journal published scores of emails between high ranking AARP officials and the White House unmasking AARP as a propaganda machine for Obamacare.\n\nReaction from AARP members was so negative, former executive vice president John Rother was compelled to draft a letter to a White House official:\n\n\u201cAnn, I think we will try to keep a little space between us and the White House on the issue. Our polling shows we are more influential when we are seen as independent, so we want to reinforce that positioning.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Obamacare\u2019s passage AARP lost 3 million members in 2011, according to a Washington Business Journal report. A company spokesman estimated that 300,000 of those lost memberships were due to Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, in a report titled \u201cBehind the Veil: The AARP America Doesn\u2019t Know\u201d in 2011, contended AARP stood to make more than $100 million annually from Obamacare due to cuts to Medicare Advantage.\n\nHouse Republicans asked the IRS to investigate AARP\u2019s nonprofit status, specifically \u201cwhether the operational activities of AARP are primarily motivated by political or profit interests, instead of to benefit its members.\u201d\n\nWilson said he wasn\u2019t aware of any action taken by the IRS after the report. An IRS spokesman said he was prohibited by law from commenting on the matter.\n\nContact Ryan Ekvall at rekvall@watchdog.org or follow him on Twitter @Nockian", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Older conservatives flee AARP for alternatives after Obamacare.", "title": "Conservatives flee AARP after Obamacare - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/obamacare.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-21T14:57:54+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/117159/conservatives-aarp-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "AARP,Affordable Care Act,AMAC,American Seniors Association,David Stella,ETF,Health Care,ObamaCare,Pension,senior citizens,seniors,Social Security", "published_time": "2013-11-22T04:00:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-21T14:57:54+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Older conservatives flee AARP for alternatives after Obamacare.", "title": "Conservatives flee AARP after Obamacare - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/obamacare.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Older conservatives flee AARP for alternatives after Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd6d\"", "article_summary": "When we engage in advocacy campaigns they are non-partisan in nature.\u201dWilson acknowledges that AARP supported Obamacare.\nAMAC now boasts more than 1 million members, including 18,500 members in Wisconsin alone, Owens said.\nBy Ryan Ekvall | Wisconsin ReporterMADISON \u2014 David Stella taking over AARP in Wisconsin might be very good for the conservative seniors service business.\n\u201cOur policy is very straightforward that AARP is a non-partisan organization,\u201d Wilson told Wisconsin Reporter.\nSam Wilson, state director of AARP, insisted Stella would be the non-partisan leader of a non-partisan advocacy group for seniors."}
