We keep hearing the various Republican Presidential candidates respond to Obamacare in the same fashion–something along the lines of “repeal and replace”.

During an interview on free market healthcare last week on the Tampa-based radio show, Outbreak News This Week, Surgery Center of Oklahoma founder, Dr. Keith Smith was asked:

“When I hear Republicans like Ted Cruz say, I will repeal Obamacare and replace it with health care that’s personal, portable, and affordable, and stops getting in between patients and their doctors.” what do you think he means, replace it with what?”

Smith replied: “Well, replace it with a brand of cronyism that will line his pockets. That’s what politicians do.

“I’ve told Republicans, you should say–‘repeal and acknowledge’. Acknowledge that Washington DC has no business in the healthcare business at all.

“To repeal and replace, is like substituting vodka for gin with an alcoholic thinking you’re going to get a different result.

” Now I’m not interested in anybody planning my life for me, whether its Ted Cruz or anybody on the other side.

“I say let the American people and let the market decide what is needed from the health industry marketplace, not somebody with a grand scheme for how to plan my life, I’m not interested.”
