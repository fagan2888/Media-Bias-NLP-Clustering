Wisconsin Republican John Kline wasn\u2019t on anybody\u2019s radar in Washington as someone who might be vulnerable, or a potential pickup for the Democrats in the November election.\n\nThe choice of Kline was widely mocked by the punditocracy as less than optimal. Real Time executive producer Scott Carter explains that putting Kline in the media spotlight is a way to highlight the student debt issue. Kline chairs the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and Maher\u2019s calling him out on his conservative positions could mobilize young voters in his district and elsewhere.\n\nKline emerged from a field of 16, then made it to the Final Four, with Reps. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), and Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.), all with higher profiles than Kline, and in more high-stakes races.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t going for the biggest clown in the House,\u201d says Carter, who concedes Kline is \u201ckind of a bland individual. But we wanted to identify this issue of student debt as one the voters in his district know about and care about.\u201d More importantly, Kline\u2019s disaffected constituents mounted the winning grassroots campaign, exhibiting a level of discontent that Carter says Maher\u2019s campaign can tap into.\n\nMaher will visit the district, but he will not be donating to the campaign of former Minnesota state representative Mike Obermueller, of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (the state\u2019s Democratic Party), who is challenging Kline for the second time.\n\nUnder current campaign law it would constitute illegal coordination. Carter says he didn\u2019t even know the name of Kline\u2019s challenger when they named Kline the contest winner. \u201cGame changer for our campaign!\u201d Obermueller tweeted. As for Maher, he likes to say, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing positive about what we\u2019re doing; we\u2019re simply being negative against one member of Congress.\u201d\n\nThis is nothing like the million-dollar donation Maher made to the Obama campaign in 2012. This will be more like an air war with Maher responding week to week to developments in the campaign and any broadsides from Kline, and citing more reasons why he shouldn\u2019t be returned to Congress. The race should give Maher fresh material for his fall season of Friday night Real Time shows.\n\nEasily reelected in 2012 to his sixth term in the House, Kline has never received less than 54 percent of the vote, a landslide in these partisan times. He is, like so many of the 435 members of the House, coasting to reelection while taking positions that many in his district may not agree with but feel powerless to change, and as a consequence often don\u2019t bother to vote. That is especially true of young people, Maher\u2019s target audience in his campaign to oust Kline.\n\n\u201cWe thought we could make the bigger statement about Kline,\u201d says Carter. Instead of highlighting other lawmakers who have made clownish statements, Maher chose someone who would otherwise get no attention, but who wields considerable power around the issues that touch young voters most\u2014student loan debt, and climate change.\n\nIn a statement that first appeared on Medialite, a Kline spokesman ticked off Maher\u2019s history of controversial statements and said Obermueller \u201cpromotes this behavior essentially naming Maher as his campaign manager.\u201d\n\nIn announcing Kline as the winner, Maher called him \u201cthe living embodiment of legislators for hire, the Men\u2019s Warehouse of empty suits.\u201d Realizing that few people had ever heard of Kline, Maher added that those thinking he might be Jewish are wrong, then pointed out that might have made him more interesting.\n\nTruth is, Kline\u2019s blandness is what made him so appealing as a representative of dysfunctional government. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those silent threats you never see coming,\u201d Maher said. \u201cEbola, Isis, John Kline\u2026One of the whores and sellouts that keep this town running.\u201d\n\nMaher\u2019s language is brutal, and funny, and all too true as he takes aim at Kline\u2019s exalted position of chairman of the education committee, declaring he \u201chas done more to keep twentysomethings in their parents\u2019 basements than anyone else alive.\u201d He calls Kline the champion of for-profit colleges, which have a dropout rate \u201cworse than celebrity rehab.\u201d They\u2019re not real colleges, Maher says: \u201cThey\u2019re scams because John Kline is bought and paid for by the very people he is pretending to regulate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "eleanorclift"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli, Bill Maher", "publicationDate": 201409160945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "US Politics, Bill Maher", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Bill Maher Wants You to Meetand BeatRepublican Jeff Kline", "tags": "topic:politics,entity:person/bill_maher", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The \u2018Real Time\u2019 host reveals John Kline as the GOP House member who wins his \u2018Flip a District\u2019 contest, and most people say: Uh, who\u2019s he?", "title": "Bill Maher Wants You to Meet\u2014and Beat\u2014Republican John Kline", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/16/bill-maher-wants-you-to-meet-and-beat-republican-jeff-kline.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/09/16/bill-maher-wants-you-to-meet-and-beat-republican-jeff-kline/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1410909122054.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "The \u2018Real Time\u2019 host reveals John Kline as the GOP House member who wins his \u2018Flip a District\u2019 contest, and most people say: Uh, who\u2019s he?", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Eleanor Clift", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-09-16T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/eleanor-clifthtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/09/16/bill-maher-wants-you-to-meet-and-beat-republican-jeff-kline", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Bill Maher Wants You to Meet\u2014and Beat\u2014Republican Jeff Kline\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/16/bill-maher-wants-you-to-meet-and-beat-republican-jeff-kline.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/09/16/bill-maher-wants-you-to-meet-and-beat-republican-jeff-kline/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47030304.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/09/16/bill-maher-wants-you-to-meet-and-beat-republican-jeff-kline\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-16T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Eleanor Clift\",\"tags\":[\"politics\",\"bill_maher\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/e/eleanor-clift", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "Easily reelected in 2012 to his sixth term in the House, Kline has never received less than 54 percent of the vote, a landslide in these partisan times.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t going for the biggest clown in the House,\u201d says Carter, who concedes Kline is \u201ckind of a bland individual.\nThat is especially true of young people, Maher\u2019s target audience in his campaign to oust Kline.\nReal Time executive producer Scott Carter explains that putting Kline in the media spotlight is a way to highlight the student debt issue.\nCarter says he didn\u2019t even know the name of Kline\u2019s challenger when they named Kline the contest winner."}
