The chemicals seep into the air, and the only way to know that an attack happens is when the victim smells the gas.\n\nThe chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs of those who inhale it, leading to suffocation, foaming at the mouth, and extremely slow and painful deaths for victims.\n\n\u201cThere are so many ways to die in Syria,\u201d said Sparrow, who has spent the past two years along the Syrian border helping train doctors. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to hide.\u201d\n\nThese atrocities are aimed only at civilians, many of whom are small children.\n\nThe Syrian government has deliberately attacked families, homes, hospitals and even schools, the witnesses say.\n\nJust yesterday, 21 children and their mothers were murdered at a summer camp with a chemical weapon.\n\n\u201cI am a doctor, and I\u2019m very familiar with death,\u201d Sparrow said. \u201cBut I have never seen a more obscene way to kill children.\u201d\n\nSparrow and the other panelists pled for a no-fly zone from the U.S. government that would help save Syrian civilians.\n\nRobert Ford, former ambassador to Syria and senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, pointed out that assisting the Syrians would also help the U.S. fight ISIS.\n\nFord says that ISIS uses the apparent U.S. indifference towards helping Syrian civilians as propaganda in enlisting Syrian fighters.\n\n\u201cThis hearing is an important step in deflecting that Islamic State recruitment propaganda,\u201d Ford said.\n\nBut Ford cautioned that if a no-fly zone is implemented it must be negotiated through neighboring Middle East countries Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan to ensure that \u201csuch a military operation is used as a tool to help reach the larger national political negotiation that Syria so desperately needs.\u201d\n\nObama has warned Assad not to cross the red line of using chemical weapons, but he has not responded to Assad\u2019s actions with force.\n\nFarouq Habib, a leading activist in Syria who has testified for the United Nations General Assembly, criticized the U.S. inaction in this matter.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe legitimacy of the international community crumbles when it becomes merely ink on paper.\u201d\n\nIf the U.S. takes action with a no-fly zone and grounds Assad\u2019s helicopters, he will no longer be able to carry out the chemical attacks.\n\nThis action would \u201ccreate a safe haven\u201d for civilians, according to Habib.\n\nIn recent months and throughout the hearing, Royce and fellow committee member Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., have pushed for establishing a no-fly zone in Syria.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t just keep going on and on,\u201d Royce said. \u201cIf nothing is done, the human tragedy in Syria and the region will reach depths the world hasn\u2019t seen in generations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "During a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, experts call for a no-fly zone to save Syrian
