Students at The King’s Daughters’ School had an extra special Christmas this year due to the efforts of Community First Bank &Trust who sponsored the Santa’s Mailbox program for the 13th consecutive year.

More than 250 wish letters were filled and a generous Christmas was provided for about 50 students. Santa’s Mailbox is similar to an angel tree and provides coats, shoes, clothing and toys for students who don’t have homes or families to visit and must spend Christmas at the school for the holidays.

“We appreciate so much the leadership of Community First Bank in providing Christmas presents for our children who could not go home for the holidays,” said KDS executive director Dr. David Craig. “With the leadership of the bank and the generosity of the community, our children had a happy and exciting Christmas.”

This year to vamp up fundraising efforts, Community First held two separate $5 Jean Days that allowed all employees at its eight locations in Maury, Williamson and Hickman counties to donate $5 to wear jeans to work on those days.

This alone generated more than $700. They used this money to fill letters from Santa’s Mailbox.

Along with Community First, The King’s Daughters’ circles, Knights of Columbus, St. Catherine Catholic Church and many generous friends rallied to buy and wrap gifts, fill stockings, host Christmas parties and provide financial and other support to the students during the holidays.

“Most of all, we are thankful for the tremendous support we receive from our employees, customers and community members who fill the letters to Santa, make generous donations and support and welcome the students in the community all year long. We extend our most sincere gratitude and thanks to each of you,” said Louis Holloway Community First president and CEO.
