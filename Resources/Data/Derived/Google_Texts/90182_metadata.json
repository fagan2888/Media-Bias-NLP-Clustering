Starting in 2014, the credit will rise to 50 percent; qualifying businesses will be able to claim the credit for up to two consecutive years.\n\nUnder original ACA rules, employers only could claim the credit if they had purchased coverage through a state-run SHOP (Small Business Heath Options Program). But in proposed rules published on August 26 the IRS outlined a transitional option that will come as a relief to employers in states that have been dragging their feet on opening the exchanges. Now, if a small employer offers coverage through a plan that begins on a date other than the first day of its taxable year; if that coverage would have qualified the employer for the credit under the rules applicable before January 1, 2014; and if the employer begins offering coverage through a SHOP exchange on the first day of its plan year that starts in 2014, they can qualify for the full credit for the entire 2014 tax year--even if coverage was purchased outside the SHOP exchange.\n\nOK, that\u2019s a lot to unpack. Fortunately, Inc.com is here to help.\n\nLet\u2019s say your plan year, for insurance purposes, starts on October 1, 2013, while your tax year officially starts on January 1, 2014. Because you and your employees haven\u2019t yet been able to evaluate plan options available through the SHOP Exchange, you purchase ACA-qualifying coverage for your employees through a private broker instead. As long as you get coverage through the SHOP exchange when your plan renews on October 1, 2014, you would be eligible for the tax credit in both 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe amount of the tax credit varies based on the size of your workforce and wages. Only businesses with fewer than 10 full-time-equivalent employees and average annual wages below $25,000 would qualify for the full 50 percent credit. Larger companies with higher average wages must use a (slightly complicated) formula to determine what size credit they qualify for.\n\nEileen Elliott, an attorney specializing in health care issues at the Burlington, Vermont-based law firm Dunkiel Saunders is advising business owners not to be discouraged by the potential paperwork: \u201cFor those employers that think they could be eligible for this, go talk to your accountant to figure it out, because it\u2019s worth real money,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd maybe a lot more than you realize.\n\nThe two-consecutive-year limit on the tax credit only applies to coverage for 2014 and beyond. \u201cIf a small business provided insurance and paid a percentage of the premium that would have earned them a tax credit for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, they can go back and file amended returns to receive credit for those years, too,\u201d says Elliott. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much politics and lack of understanding that a lot of small employers haven\u2019t taken advantage of this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you do, and you're not bothering to claim it, you could be leaving lots of cash on the table", "title": "Do You Qualify For An Obamacare Tax Credit?", "og": {"site_name": "Inc.com", "description": "If you do, and you're not bothering to claim it, you could be leaving lots of cash on the table", "title": "Do You Qualify For An Obamacare Tax Credit?", "url": "http://www.inc.com/adam-bluestein/obamacare-tax-credit.html", "image": "http://images.inc.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/obamacare-regulations-970_29859.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you do, and you're not bothering to claim it, you could be leaving lots of cash on the table", "creator": "@AdamBluestein", "url": "http://www.inc.com/adam-bluestein/obamacare-tax-credit.html", "image": "http://images.inc.com/uploaded_files/image/1940x900/obamacare-regulations-970_29859.jpg", "title": "Do You Qualify For An Obamacare Tax Credit?", "site": "@Inc", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.inc.com/adam-bluestein/obamacare-tax-credit.html", "robots": "index,follow", "fb": {"app_id": 139291179414843}, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "article": {"section": "Wire", "published_time": "Fri Sep  6 16:08:45 2013", "author": "Adam Bluestein"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc1e2\"", "article_summary": "The amount of the tax credit varies based on the size of your workforce and wages.\nThe two-consecutive-year limit on the tax credit only applies to coverage for 2014 and beyond.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so much politics and lack of understanding that a lot of small employers haven\u2019t taken advantage of this.\u201d\nLarger companies with higher average wages must use a (slightly complicated) formula to determine what size credit they qualify for.\nOnly businesses with fewer than 10 full-time-equivalent employees and average annual wages below $25,000 would qualify for the full 50 percent credit."}
