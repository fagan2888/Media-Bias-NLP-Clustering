It\u2019s an increasingly popular destination for tourists craving the turquoise waters of the Caribbean and beaches with sugar-white sand.\n\nDreams La Romana, a gated, five-star resort, charges about $280 per night for a standard room.\n\nMiguel Castro grew up in La Romana. He might as well have lived a world away.\n\n\u201cMy family didn\u2019t have a lot of things,\u201d the Rockies\u2019 promising, 21-year-old relief pitcher said. \u201cThe only money we\u2019ve ever really had comes from me.\u201d\n\nCastro could throw a 97 mph fastball when he was 17 years old. Ismael Cruz, the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 director of Latin American operations, signed Castro for a $43,000 bonus when Castro was 18. Castro didn\u2019t party or buy himself a sports car. Rather, he took care of his parents, who were having medical issues.\n\nHis mother, Yesenia Baez, needed a tumor removed. His father, Miguel Castro Sr., a journeyman boxer, had surgery on his prostate. Both are doing fine now. Until Castro received his signing bonus, his parents couldn\u2019t afford their operations.\n\n\u201cMoney doesn\u2019t mean a lot to me,\u201d Castro said. \u201cWhat matters is my parents\u2019 health and being able to help them. They are loving people for me.\u201d\n\nFor the record, Castro did splurge on himself, just a bit. He bought himself braces. They came off last summer and his teeth are now shiny, white and straight.\n\nCastro is a 6-foot-5, 190-pound string bean right-hander. The Rockies acquired him last summer as part of the trade with the Blue Jays that sent star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki to Toronto. Castro\u2019s attacking nature on the mound, sizzling fastball, sharp-breaking slider and confounding changeup have made him one of Colorado\u2019s top performers this season.\n\nIn six appearances, he has a 1.50 ERA with eight strikeouts and two walks.\n\nCastro suffered a setback when shoulder soreness kept him out of last week\u2019s series at Cincinnati and landed him on the 15-day disabled list Friday. The Rockies, however, don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a serious injury.\n\n\u201cJust some soreness,\u201d general manager Jeff Bridich said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure and take care of it right away. We think he\u2019ll be fine after some rest.\u201d\n\nIf Castro stays healthy, adds muscle to his frail frame and continues to mature, he appears to be a potential closer.\n\n\u201cEverything Castro throws is special, not just his fastball,\u201d veteran catcher Nick Hundley said at spring training. \u201cHe has a plus changeup and a plus slider too. And he\u2019s extremely smart. He\u2019s composed beyond his years. He just has to be more consistent. But there is no question he has the skills to be a front-line, late-game reliever.\u201d\n\nBridich said the Rockies were unaware of Castro\u2019s magnanimous gesture for his parents when they traded for him. What they did know impressed them enough. He displayed his talents early last season when he made his major-league debut with Toronto on April 6. At age 20 years and 103 days, he was the third-youngest player to debut in the majors last season. He notched his first big-league save April 9.\n\n\u201cIt was very apparent for a young guy at the major-league level, and seeing how the Blue Jays handled him, that he was a very good person and a tough kid,\u201d Bridich said.\n\nAfter the Tulowitzki trade, the Rockies assigned Castro to Triple-A Albuquerque, where he went 2-0 with a 1.32 ERA in 13 innings. Recalled by the Rockies on Sept. 1, Castro struggled with his command. In five relief appearances he was 0-1 with a 10.31 ERA before he was shut down because of a sore back.\n\nCastro has been playing baseball since he was 5. Asked what he loves about the game, he said through a translator: \u201cI don\u2019t have the words, it\u2019s just something that runs through me veins.\u201d\n\nHe is earning $507,500 this season, providing comfort for himself and his family that he never imagined.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much every Latin American player\u2019s experience in the majors,\u201d said Rockies right fielder Carlos Gonzalez, who has taken Castro under his wing. \u201cYou get that big signing bonus and then the first big-league contract, and everything changes so quick. But whenever you can do something for your family, it makes you a better person.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies have no worries that Castro will become too satisfied with his station in baseball. During spring training, Castro usually was the first player at the Salt River Fields facility in Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\n\u201cI would get there sometimes at 5 a.m., just walking around, sipping my coffee, and he would already be there,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cThat stands out big time. He wasn\u2019t there to mess around, or just act like a big-leaguer. He was there to get better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "For Rockies\u2019 Miguel Castro, biggest save was helping ailing parents", "title": "For Rockies\u2019 Miguel Castro, biggest save was helping ailing parents", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/23/for-rockies-miguel-castro-biggest-save-was-helping-ailing-parents/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160423__BN20160424_Z00_BNSP24BBNROXENTERp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160423__BN20160424_Z00_BNSP24BBNROXENTERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-23T12:00:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T12:19:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Dreams La Romana, a gated, five-star resort, charges about $280 per night for a standard room.\nIsmael Cruz, the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 director of Latin American operations, signed Castro for a $43,000 bonus when Castro was 18.\nLa Romana is a city of about 140,000 people in the Dominican Republic.\nMiguel Castro grew up in La Romana.\nAfter the Tulowitzki trade, the Rockies assigned Castro to Triple-A Albuquerque, where he went 2-0 with a 1.32 ERA in 13 innings."}
