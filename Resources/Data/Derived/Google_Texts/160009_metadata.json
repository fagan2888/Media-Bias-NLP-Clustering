Another presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee, fresh off exhibiting the moral relativism of his defense of Ted Nugent\u2019s music while attacking Beynoc\u00e9\u2019s, is now telling us that it isn\u2019t that he hates gay people, it\u2019s just that he can\u2019t give gay people a break because, well \u2013 it\u2019s all out of his hands, as he told televangelist Jim Bakker:\n\nWe are just people who believe that there is a standard that was not ours, it was God\u2019s, it was given to us and for us to change it we have to get his permission.\n\nOh. So he\u2019s just following orders. I shudder when I imagine this kind of nonsense coming out of the White House\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Iran, I had to push the button. It was out of my hands.\n\nSo Huckabee and his fellow bigots are taking one on the chin for God:\n\nThe way that we\u2019ve allowed words like tolerance, bigotry \u2014 what has happened to us, we allow ourselves to be called homophobic or bigoted, we\u2019re not.\n\nOh, you\u2019re stand-up guys all right. And women. Don\u2019t forget Sally Kern\u2019s heroic struggle against gay sex in Oklahoma.\n\nAll Huckabee is doing, after all, is acting in defense of his \u201ccore moral values,\u201d which apparently tell him it\u2019s okay to sing a Nugent ode to pedophilia while excoriating Beyonc\u00e9 for corrupting children.\n\nYeah. I think my brain just said, \u201cI quit.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll try to push on without it. If Huckabee can do it, so can I.\n\nLiberty Counsel\u2019s Matt \u201cone man violently cramming his penis into another man\u2019s lower intestine and calling it \u2018love\u2019\u201d Barber, meanwhile, wrote an op-ed yesterday for World Net Daily in which he used \u201can exercise in logic\u201d as he put it, to slap down marriage equality once and for all:\n\nDeclared Jesus: \u201c\u2018Haven\u2019t you read,\u2019 he replied, \u2018that at the beginning the Creator \u201cmade them male and female,\u201d and said, \u201cFor this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh\u201d? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate'\u201d (Matthew 19:4-6). Rather conspicuously, and as I\u2019venoted before, Jesus did not say: \u201cAt the beginning the Creator made them lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT). For this reason a male, female or shemale will leave his, her or whatchahoozie\u2019s father and mother, father and father or mother and mother and be united to his or her wife \u2013 and/or husband \u2013 and the two or more will become one flesh. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that.\u201d\n\nWhat is interesting about Barber\u2019s use of this passage is that here, Jesus is talking about divorce, not marriage. He is not attacking gays, as you might think from Barber\u2019s context. He is simply telling his followers that divorce is not allowed, under any circumstances.\n\nNow here is where his clever use of logic comes in:\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what marriage is not: \u201cAnything else.\u201d\n\nJust wow. Slayed it in one. The only problem is that Jesus did not condemn any other kind of marriage. And the Bible is full of plenty of examples, as we have pointed out here on more than one occasion. Polygyny, the marriage of one man to X wives, is enshrined in the Law of Moses (Exodus 21:10; Deuteronomy 21:15-17; Deuteronomy 25:5-10).\n\nWhat Jesus did not say is that marriage is ONLY the union of 1 man + 1 woman. Jesus did not condemn these other types of marriage. He lived in a society where polygyny was practiced by his fellow Jews, and never uttered one word of condemnation. Yet logic dictates, if Jesus believed it was wrong, he must have condemned it. But he didn\u2019t? What gives?\n\nHuckabee says they are not allowed to pick and choose what to believe, but it seems obvious that what Barber wants to do here is pick and choose his biblical passages. I\u2019ve not seen him push, for example, for the stoning of unruly children, which is absolutely required by the Law.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if the rest of the Bible doesn\u2019t exist for Barber. Only the parts about gays, which are very few. By my estimation, the Religious Right\u2019s Bible is not so much a book as a pamphlet \u2013 and not really even that. More of a supermarket flyer.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t even getting into all the things Jesus said for the poor and against the rich that Barber ignores on a daily basis. If, as Huckabee claims, their hands are tied, why are they attacking the poor and elevating the rich, in complete defiance of Jesus\u2019 words?\n\nBarber says,\n\nSo, to be clear, and when measured against Christ\u2019s unambiguous and biologically affirmed definition of marriage, all \u201csame-sex marriages\u201d are \u201cpagan marriages.\u201d They are \u201cmock marriages\u201d insofar as they mock both real marriage and the Christ who created it. Moreover, the very thing that defines \u201cgay marriage, the biologically and spiritually disordered act of same-sex sodomy,\u201d likewise mocks God\u2019s design for natural sexual intercourse. The Bible, throughout both the Old and New Testaments, unambiguously condemns as sin rising to the level of \u201can abomination,\u201d all same-sex sexual conduct, be it, \u201cloving, monogamous and committed,\u201d or otherwise.\n\nHomosexuality is mock sexuality. And \u201cgay marriage\u201d is mock marriage.\n\nIt would be swell if Republicans would only devote themselves as much to a war on joblessness as they would their wars on women and gays. It is beyond my own \u2013 admittedly limited \u2013 ability to understand how legislating against women\u2019s right to control their own reproductive health in any way buttresses the Middle Class or creates jobs, yet the new Congress is rolling out anti-abortion bills as fast as we can track them. Likewise, how does preventing marriage equality strengthen our economy?\n\nI would argue that these are impositions of a narrowly defined and far from universal morality: you\u2019re going to obey our Bible, or else. If these bills aren\u2019t a violation of the First Amendment, I don\u2019t know how to define them. It was their own Ben Carson who argued that Obamacare was unconstitutional because, he claimed, it does not help all Americans. How does banning marriage equality help all Americans? How does banning contraception and abortion help all Americans?\n\nWhat would help all Americans is creating more jobs, acting in a positive way on behalf of the environment (because there won\u2019t be a lot of marriages taking place under water). Huckabee says he\u2019d like to be president but he doesn\u2019t have any real presidential obsessions. Instead, the father of a dog-torturer wants to lecture us on parenting and on how we can\u2019t ignore God except when we find God\u2019s focus on poor people to be\u2026well, inconvenient when we want to talk about the evils of gay sex.\n\nBarber, meanwhile, has already launched his new campaign, and no, it has nothing to do with saving the environment or boosting the economy or on a very Jesus-focused income inequality. Instead, he is telling us, thanks to marriage equality, incest is The Next Frontier In \u2018Reproductive Freedom\u2019. Makes you wonder how the Pope can make it through a day without obsessing on sex.\n\nI\u2019m not seeing anything remotely relevant or meaningful coming out of right wing circles any time soon. I suggest the rest of us let them quietly work out their sexual frustrations and ambiguities while we get on with the important business of not only keeping the country running, but moving it forward in pace with the rest of the world. Eventually, it can be hoped, the right wing will grow up and rejoin us as mature adults.\n\nDon\u2019t expect any miracles by 2016 though. While Ben Carson seems more obsessed with convincing us he\u2019s not crazy than with sex, he\u2019s a black guy in a party that has already made it clear black guys can\u2019t be president. And while Lindsey Graham isn\u2019t obsessing over sex and seems to be flirting with the idea of maybe thinking about the White House, I\u2019m not too certain he can find the courage to crawl out from under his bed to actually run.\n\nNo, if we\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019re going to have to do it without the Republican Party, which is unfortunate, because we could use some diversity of thought. It\u2019s just that we aren\u2019t going to find any diversity on that side of the aisle.
