As such, Trump has dominated the U.S. political conversation in recent months.\n\nDonald Trump will not be the next president of the United States. He\u2019s too gaffe-prone, obnoxious and bereft of constructive ideas for that.\n\nBut for now, precious time is being wasted in America in not putting electoral candidates on the hot seat over plummeting U.S. education standards (the U.S. ranks 30th in student test scores, and Canada an unacceptably low 13th). Or an infrastructure crisis of 80,000 \u201cstructurally deficient\u201d U.S. bridges, and decaying Civil War-era schools and hospitals. Or the intrusions on Americans\u2019 privacy rights by the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. Or how the epidemic of U.S. mass shootings demands a rethink of gun control. \u201cThese tragedies are now happening about every two weeks,\u201d a frustrated Obama said recently.\n\nThese are serious times, and Canadian voters are acting accordingly. One hopes Americans eventually will, too.\n\nIn each of the past four U.S. election cycles, Trump, 69, has loudly contemplated a presidential bid, using Trump-friendly TV and radio \u201cinterviewers\u201d as an audience for absurd Trumpisms. (\u201cI would have won the race against Obama,\u201d Trump said of the 2012 contest. \u201cHe would have been easy.\u201d) And each time, Trump has abruptly quit before having to endure demands that he cough up at least one viable solution to the hundreds of faults he finds with the country that made him rich.\n\nTrump is not even a conservative, at least as the conservative U.S. mainstream recognizes itself. He has belonged to no fewer than four parties, and backed the successful U.S. Senate campaign of Hillary Clinton (an obvious disability if he faces off against her in next year\u2019s general election). In quitting the GOP in 1999, Trump explained: \u201cI really believe the Republicans are just too crazy right.\u201d Even mountebanks like Newt Gingrich acknowledge that the GOP has since been taken hostage by outright nutters.\n\nIn his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, Trump proposed U.S. adoption of Canada\u2019s health care system, which many GOPers equate with communism. \u201cWe should not hear so many stories of families ruined by healthcare expenses,\u201d he wrote. In 2004, Trump said, \u201cI probably identify more as a Democrat. It just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans.\u201d That last part is true, dating from Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nIn quitting a long, unofficial campaign for New York governor in May 2011, Trump explained, \u201cBusiness is my greatest passion and I am not ready to leave the private sector.\u201d\n\nBut that business passion has yielded, at best, mixed results. Those who recall the failed Trump Shuttle airline and the defunct New Jersey Generals of the defunct United States Football League know that Trump is not to be confused with Warren Buffett or Bill Gates.\n\nTrump\u2019s overleveraged real estate holdings put him on the brink of personal bankruptcy in 1991. The biggest of Trump\u2019s business bets, the $1 billion (U.S.) Trump Taj Mahal Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City \u2014 home of America\u2019s first casino strip club \u2014 filed for bankruptcy protection last year.\n\nTrump\u2019s business activities expose him as a hypocrite. Trump vows to be \u201cthe greatest jobs president that God ever created\u201d by repatriating jobs from abroad. Yet since 2000, Trump\u2019s companies have sought to import at least 1,100 foreign workers on temporary visas as dirt-cheap labour for his resort casinos. Most of the visas have been granted. That number includes close to 250 visas for offshore \u201cfashion models,\u201d there being, this space is surprised to learn, an apparent shortage of American-born beautiful women.\n\nTrump\u2019s status as a successful tycoon, wildly exaggerated though it is, accounts for his current popularity with Republicans.\n\nTrump appeals to the long-held belief that businesspeople make superior political leaders, a curious notion mocked by the historical record.\n\nGeorge W. Bush was America\u2019s first MBA president. (Harvard, no less.) We saw how that worked out. Torontonians took a chance for mayor on a discount retailer, Mel Lastman of Bad Boy Furniture, and got a maladroit, ineffectual mayoralty.\n\nTrump makes most of his money by licensing his name to developers of buildings he doesn\u2019t own. The allure of the Trump name can end in tears, as for many aggrieved investors in downtown Toronto\u2019s Trump International Hotel & Tower.\n\nTrump says boosting his name recognition is unrelated to his electoral non-campaigns, but the opposite is true. In his own financial disclosures, Trump attributes 80 per cent of his estimated net worth of $4.1 billion (U.S.) to assets derived from licensing his name to developers and vendors of Trump-branded apparel and other merchandise. Which is to say that Donald John Trump values his name at $3.3 billion (U.S.).\n\nTrump is a poseur who will quit the crowded GOP presidential race (with its 14 candidates) well before the end of the year. But in the meantime, serious issues will be crowded out of town-hall debate by outbursts like Trump\u2019s recent redefinition of war heroes as those who avoid being taken prisoner. U.S. Senator John McCain, tortured by the Viet Cong for several years, doesn\u2019t qualify. \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d Trump said, prompting the prestigious Des Moines Register\u2019s call for Trump\u2019s immediate departure from the race.\n\nDoug Heye, former deputy chief of staff for then-GOP House Majority leader Eric Cantor, recently described Trump as the baby who commands attention from his constant tantrums.\n\n\u201cWhat if everyone treated Mr. Trump as the thing he is not: a serious-minded candidate for president of the United States?\u201d Heye wrote. \u201cIt would quickly become clear that the emperor has no clothes.\u201d\n\nThe success of latest Trump branding exercise disguised as a passion for public service reflects poorly on an electorate easily distracted by buffoonery, and of an American celebrity culture that zealously abets it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican front-runner claims is financial experience qualifies him for candidacy.
