She\u2019d had her moments of fame\u2014first as Commander Susan Ivanova in the 1990s sci-fi television series Babylon 5. She had a role in the critically beloved Judd Apatow comedy Freaks and Geeks, a Playboy pictorial, and a long list of prominent lovers that included George Clooney and the late Dodi Fayed.\n\nBut by the early oughts, Christian was struggling to stay afloat. Her drinking had spiraled from social to bingeing. She\u2019d abstain for weeks at a time, and then find herself at Ralph\u2019s Grocery Store near her Los Angeles home first thing in the morning, tossing cr\u00e8me de menthe and Drambuie into her cart with the loud pronouncement she was planning on making souffl\u00e9s. (\u201cEverybody was so on to me,\u201d she says, \u201cespecially the kid who said, \u2018Isn\u2019t it a little early for this stuff?\u2019\u201d)\n\nShe repeatedly tried to stop. \u201cI went to dozens of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in two different countries. I tried moderation. I tried tapering. I tried hypnosis. I tried rehab. I tried everything.\u201d\n\nBut in 2009, as she was leaving a California detox center, she noticed a flyer for a drug called Vivitrol, an injectable form of the opioid blocker naltrexone. It prevents endorphins, or feel-good hormones, which are released when people drink, from reaching their target, the opioid receptors.\n\nThe drug worked\u2014and Christian, who continues to act in feature and television films, has become an evangelist for an approach to alcohol use disorder that is widely known in other countries but little used in the United States.\n\nChristian, 50, has produced, narrated, and is the protagonist of a new documentary called One Little Pill, which details her recovery with a treatment pioneered in Finland called the Sinclair Method. (The film is available for rental on Vimeo and VHX.) In 2013, she started a public charity, the C3Foundation.org, whose goal is to educate patients and physicians on the method she credits with saving her life. It also has a branch in the U.K.\n\nThe use of the drug that helped Christian was pioneered by the late American neuroscientist David Sinclair, who developed the idea while studying rats specially bred to crave alcohol. He found that when he withdrew alcohol bottles from the rats for a few days or weeks, the rats returned to them with more determination\u2014and thirst\u2014than ever before. He repeated his experiment several times, each time noting that the rats\u2019 benders would last progressively longer after periods of abstinence. \u201cWhat that showed us,\u201d Sinclair says in the film, is that the cold-turkey approach \u201cnot only failed to work\u2014it was backwards.\u201d All the effort getting people into detox and abstinence, Sinclair says, is counterproductive\u2014and it might make some people worse.\n\nHe published his initial findings, but they were not popular among American researchers, who believed that a strict abstinence policy was best for all problem drinkers. So in the early 1970s Sinclair moved to Finland, which has a severe binge-drinking culture, and which also generously funded scientific approaches to problem drinking. Sinclair believed that drinkers develop problem habits through a strictly chemical process. With each drink, the brain releases endorphins, or feel-good hormones. Drinkers experience a \u201creward\u201d once the endorphins reach their target, the brain\u2019s opioid receptors. Habitual drinking repeatedly strengthens the synapses, reinforcing the \u201creward\u201d imbibers get when they drink. It also results in a predictable pattern: growing thoughts and cravings for alcohol that develop into a compulsion.\n\nBy using naltrexone, a 40-year-old generic opioid blocker that has few side effects, an hour before drinking, Sinclair found, you could effectively block the reward of the alcohol. By using this protocol repeatedly, the cravings and the obsession with drinking subsides, he found. His method has been tried on thousands of patients in three facilities he co-founded Finland since the late 1990s, and has been shown to reduce drinking to normal levels in 78 percent of patients, said Jukka Keski-Pukkila, CEO of the Contral Clinics.\n\nChristian, who found the drug by accident, has devoted her time and resources to educating others. \u201cI wish someone had done it for me when I was searching for an answer to my alcohol problem,\u201d she says on the film.\n\nHer fame draws attention to the cause, and attracts nearly 6,000 visitors to her site per month. She refers them to local doctors who prescribe naltrexone, which was approved by the FDA for the treatment of alcohol abuse in 1994. It is seldom used.\n\nAccording to a spokesman at the National Institutes for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, only about 1 percent of Americans are ever prescribed medications for the treatment of alcohol use disorder, the term for problem drinking now used by the DSM-5. It connotes a spectrum from mild to moderate to severe, and the CDC estimates that some 18 million Americans have AUD.\n\nThis past week, Christian flew from her home in L.A. to Washington, D.C., to meet with substance use counselors at their annual conference to try to draw attention to the method. She was not encouraged by the reception she got: In the U.S., abstinence-only models have dominated the alcohol treatment landscape since the advent of Alcoholics Anonymous in 1939. \u201cPeople just want to know how they can monetize treatment,\u201d Christian says. (Under Obamacare, insurance companies are required to pay for treatment for alcohol and substance use disorders.) Meanwhile, only 12 people showed up at a talk about prevention, says Jenny Williamson, executive director of the C3Foundation.\n\nStephen Cox, a University of Kentucky psychiatrist, said he was not surprised. Cox has prescribed naltrexone according to Sinclair\u2019s protocol to about 100 patients over the past eight years. Because the method seems so counterintuitive in a country where most believe that anyone with a drinking problem should never touch alcohol again, Dr. Cox invites family members to hear an explanation about how the drug-plus-drinking combination works. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, chances are the wife or husband will hit the roof and report me to the medical licensing board. I tell them that I was a personal friend of David Sinclair\u2019s, and just having that knowledge can help boost the level of compliance and support.\u201d Of his 100 or so patients who have used the drugs, about 75 percent of them return their drinking to moderate levels, he said.\n\nBut Cox adds that the drug is not effective on everyone. \u201cSome people just need to abstain,\u201d he said. \u201cNot everybody, but some.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Who was that person? It wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n\nChristian\u2019s candor has deepened her fans\u2019 appreciation, and many of them have been heartened to discover that the invincible space queen suffered problems much like their own, as she first depicted in her 2012 memoir, Babylon Confidential: A Memoir of Love, Sex, and Addiction. She details a glamorous life at Paris restaurants and yachts in the Mediterranean, but doesn\u2019t hide her dark moments, either. Her 14-year-old brother was killed by a drunk driver while riding his bike in Texas, tearing a hole in her close-knit family. At 15, Christian was raped by a neighbor, but felt too ashamed to ever report the crime. She underwent several abortions, and suffered multiple miscarriages.\n\nTrauma is a known risk factor for developing alcohol use disorder. And eventually, Christian\u2019s only solace seemed to be in numbing herself. One morning, she found herself at a bus stop, shakily pouring tiny vodka bottles into her orange juice, not caring whether her fans spotted her or not. By then, she says, \u201cmy brain had changed. I could feel it. I needed that drink in the morning just to feel normal.\u201d\n\nHer mother insisted on rehab, which was rooted in the faith-and-abstinence-based principles of Alcoholics Anonymous. \u201cI have plenty of faith,\u201d she says today, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t think praying was going to fix what was going on in my brain. It was physiological\u2014and I wanted a physiological answer.\u201d\n\nIn the film, Christian also traces the experiences of other drinkers who\u2019ve successfully used the method. She follows Patricia, a Napa Valley winemaker whose drinking habit was edging north of a bottle and a half a day before she discovered naltrexone. Until then, Patricia says in the film, she was trying to weigh how to stay in the field she loved\u2014and in which she\u2019d achieved success\u2014or leave it entirely. Suicide, she said, crossed her mind. For two years, she has taken the drugs according to protocol, and rarely overdrinks.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "alcoholism, diseases, Health, Hollywood", "publicationDate": 201510220500, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/tech-and-health", "description": "How a rarely used medicine helped one Hollywood star finally stop her problem drinking.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Could This Drug Cure Alcoholism?", "tags": "entity:medicalcondition/alcoholism,entity:medicalcondition/diseases,topic:lifestyle/health,entity:city/hollywood", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Could This Drug Cure Alcoholism?\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/22/could-this-injection-cure-alcoholism.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/22/could-this-injection-cure-alcoholism/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/48184593.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/22/could-this-injection-cure-alcoholism\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-22T05:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Tech + Health\",\"author\":\"Gabrielle Glaser\",\"tags\":[\"alcoholism\",\"diseases\",\"health\",\"hollywood\"]}", "news_keywords": "alcoholism, diseases, Health, Hollywood", "sectionTaxanomies": "tech-and-health", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Gabrielle Glaser", "article": {"section": "health", "published_time": "2015-10-22T05:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/gabrielle-glaserhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/22/could-this-injection-cure-alcoholism", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "How a rarely used medicine helped one Hollywood star finally stop her problem drinking.", "title": "Could This Drug Cure Alcoholism?", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/22/could-this-injection-cure-alcoholism.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/22/could-this-injection-cure-alcoholism/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1445537813869.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/g/gabrielle-glaser", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI wish someone had done it for me when I was searching for an answer to my alcohol problem,\u201d she says on the film.\n\u201cPeople just want to know how they can monetize treatment,\u201d Christian says.\nBrain ScienceHow a rarely used medicine helped one Hollywood star finally stop her problem drinking.\nShe was not encouraged by the reception she got: In the U.S., abstinence-only models have dominated the alcohol treatment landscape since the advent of Alcoholics Anonymous in 1939.\nSo in the early 1970s Sinclair moved to Finland, which has a severe binge-drinking culture, and which also generously funded scientific approaches to problem drinking."}
