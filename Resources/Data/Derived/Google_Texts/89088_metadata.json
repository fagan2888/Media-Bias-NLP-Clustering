But three on, the Firely festival has ballooned into an altogether different beast.\n\n\n\nNow boasting 80,000 attendees and 124 acts across its seven stages, Firefly 2014 has matured into an A-class international music event on par with prized U.S. festivals like Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza. Fans from all 50 U.S states hit the Firefly site Thursday evening (June 19) and made their way across the new and improved festival grounds that features an expanded main stage area, air-conditioned vintage arcades, a coffee house featuring board games and stripped-down performances by big-stage acts, a brewery run by Dogfish Head and vast campgrounds that include amenities like a farmers market, morning yoga sessions and more.\n\n\n\nBut of course, what drew the masses to the First State was the music. Including a diverse array of artists, including chart-topping rock bands like Foo Fighters and Arctic Monkeys, buzzed-about rappers such as Vic Mensa and Chance the Rapper and booty-shaking DJs like A-Trak and Girl Talk, there was a flavor to meet just about everyone\u2019s specific taste on Friday\u2019s Firely bill. Here\u2019s a selection of particularly delicious highlights we saw on day 2:\n\nFirefly 2014 Photos! | Firely Grows 'Bigger & Better'\n\n2:18pm: South Africa\u2019s Kongos warm up the Firefly crowd as the first act to play the main stage Friday. The band ends their sun-soaked set with their breakaway hit \"Come With Me Now.\" The song\u2019s extended accordion solo drives the growing masses wild.\n\n\n\n2:50pm: At the Porch Stage, Chance the Rapper and members of his Social Experiment band rush the stage to bring the energy of fellow Chicago native Vic Mensa up even higher, while members Young the Giant look on from backstage. The entire crowd is jumping, the entire stage is shaking.\n\n3:13pm: \"Where'd the Bob Saget sign go?\" Says Bleachers frontman Jack Antonoff as he scopes the crowd, looking for a placard depicting the comic that one festivalgoer has been waving at shows. Antonoff is reassured when the Saget sign reappears. \"Don't get tired on me. The whole set. We're in this together.\" Later, the ecstatic singer says that the Firefly audience is \u201cthe best crowd we've ever played to.\"\n\n\n\n3:23pm: Members of Young the Giant prep for their second Firefly appearance by playing leisurely games of pool and frisbee in the artist compound. YTG is in good spirits despite the fact that guitarist Jake Tilley won\u2019t be joining them onstage after breaking his arm during a video shoot last week. \u201cJake\u2019s a little bummed out; he wanted to be here for all these shows,\u201d says frontman Sameer Gadhia. \u201cBut the good news is his fracture isn\u2019t that bad and he\u2019s going to be back on the road with us in a few weeks.\u201d The Jake-less show rolls on a few hours later, as the band plays back-to-back hits to a packed crowd on the Backyard stage.\n\n\n\n3:55pm: A shirtless Chance the Rapper breaks free from the pair of giddy female fans he plucked out of the crowd during Vic Mensa\u2019s set long enough to snap a pic for our cameras in the artist lounge.\n\n\n\n4:45pm: \u201cIt\u2019s toasty out there,\u201d says Iron & Wine\u2019s Samuel Beam as he takes the sun-drenched main stage. Noting that they only have an hour, the band rolls through its set with little banter, delivering one dusty indie-folk tune after the next. The crowd eats up favorites like \u201cFreedom Hangs Like Heaven,\u201d \u201cGod Made the Automobile\u201d and \u201cRabbit Will Run.\u201d \u201cThank you for sticking with us,\u201d says Beam near the end of the set. \u201cI know it\u2019s hot out there. Some days, you have to work for your fun.\u201d\n\n\n\n5:55pm: Airborne Toxic Event frontman Mikel Jollett makes a special request of Firefly fans hailing from nearby Philadelphia. \u201cWhenever we play Philly, fans always hiss after our songs. It\u2019s like an inside joke we have with them.\u201d After the crowd replies with an almost collective \u201cHuh?,\u201d Jollett replies, \"I didn't say we were a particularly intelligent band.\" ATE is met with far more cheers than hisses for the remainder of their Porch Stage set.\n\n\n\n6:45pm: A male fan in the crowd waiting for Arctic Monkeys raises a sign that says \u201cShow me your nips!\u201d To his dismay, only dudes oblige the raunchy request.\n\n6:50pm: On the Lawn Stage, Chance the Rapper tells the crowd to jump on the count of four as he drops \"Favorite Song,\" a standout from his \u2018Acid Rap\u2019 mixtape. They happily oblige, even though Childish Gambino, who's playing Firefly on Sunday, doesn't come out to do his guest verse. Later in the set, Chance leads the crowd in a smile-inducing \"Happy Birthday\" sing-along for his keyboardist.\n\n7:18pm: \u201cThis song's dedicated to that booty call you might make later on,\u201d says Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner before launching into \u201cWhy\u2019d You Only Call Me When You\u2019re High?\u201d Turner grows sexier by the song as the band struts through its main stage set, rolling from swaggering \u2018AM\u2019 material like \u201cFireside,\u201d \u201cArabella\u201d and \u201cOne for the Road\u201d into teenage classics like \u201cI Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor.\u201d The packed crowd responds feverishly to both old and new gems.\n\n\n\n9:50pm: The long-awaited Foo Fighters hit the Firefly main stage and begin rocking the entire crowd of 80,000 attendes (they\u2019re literally the only band performing during their headlining timeset.) Grohl, who famously vacations at Delaware\u2019s Rehobeth Beach, immediately shares his affinity for the First State. \u201cLet me tell you, it\u2019s good to be back. I spend a lot of time around these parts. Every time I smell Grotto\u2019s Pizza \u2026 damn.\u201d\n\n\n\n10:28pm: During the obligatory band-member intros, Grohl calls out guitarist Chris Shiflett, who has played the entire show sitting in an office chair on the side of the stage \u201cChris broke his foot, or his ankle or something, but he came out here to play for you guys anyway,\u201d Dave says as the crowd roars. \u201cYou know how you did it?\u201d Grohl continues. \u201cBy being fucking old.\u201d\n\n\n\n10:37pm: \u201cSo we\u2019ve got a new record done,\u201d Dave Grohl says, explaining that the next Foo Fighters album will feature eight songs recorded in eight different cities. \u201cBut right now, we\u2019re going to play an old one for you.\u201d The band slowly breaks into a stripped-down version of \u201cBig Me,\u201d which they pluck from the vault after a long hiatus.\n\n\n\n11:45pm: Foo Fighters extend their scheduled set time and return to the stage for an encore. Against a stage backdrop that reads \u201cThe Holy Shits,\u201d the band tears through a quartet of rockin' cover tunes that includes Alice Cooper\u2019s \u201cSchool\u2019s Out,\u201d the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cMiss You,\u201d Van Halen\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t Talkin\u2019 Bout Love\u201d and David Bowie & Queen\u2019s \u201cUnder Pressure.\u201d The band concludes their set with a fierce version of their own \u201cEverlong,\u201d which concludes with a fireworks display over the main stage.\n\n\n\n11:50pm: It's nearly midnight, but the fun's far from over. Girl Talk keeps the party going on the Backyard Stage with a collection of bottom-heavy mashups that keep the crowd grooving well past 1am. Highlights of the set include a wicked mix of Lorde\u2019s \u201cRoyals\u201d and M.I.A.\u2019s \u201cPaper Planes,\u201d yet another rendition of Bowie & Queen\u2019s \u201cUnder Pressure,\u201d and an appearance by rapper Freeway, who joins to perform hits from the pair\u2019s collaborative \u201cBroken Ankles\u201d EP.\n\nAdditional reporting by Frank DiGiacomo", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Highlights from day 2 of Dover, Delaware's third-annual Firefly Music Festival.", "title": "15 Hot Firefly Friday Highlights: Foo Fighters, Arctic Moneys, Chance the Rapper & More", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6128693/15-hot-firefly-friday-highlights-foo-fighters-arctic-moneys", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/foo-fighters-firefly-billboard-2014-650x430.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Highlights from day 2 of Dover, Delaware's third-annual Firefly Music Festival.", "title": "15 Hot Firefly Friday Highlights: Foo Fighters, Arctic Moneys, Chance the Rapper & More", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6128693/15-hot-firefly-friday-highlights-foo-fighters-arctic-moneys", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/foo-fighters-firefly-billboard-2014-650x430.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Highlights from day 2 of Dover, Delaware's third-annual Firefly Music Festival.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Foo Fighters, Arctic Monkeys and More Firefly 2014 Friday Highlights| Billboard"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0fb\"", "article_summary": "| Firely Grows 'Bigger & Better'2:18pm: South Africa\u2019s Kongos warm up the Firefly crowd as the first act to play the main stage Friday.\n9:50pm: The long-awaited Foo Fighters hit the Firefly main stage and begin rocking the entire crowd of 80,000 attendes (they\u2019re literally the only band performing during their headlining timeset.)\nATE is met with far more cheers than hisses for the remainder of their Porch Stage set.\n4:45pm: \u201cIt\u2019s toasty out there,\u201d says Iron & Wine\u2019s Samuel Beam as he takes the sun-drenched main stage.\nLater in the set, Chance leads the crowd in a smile-inducing \"Happy Birthday\" sing-along for his keyboardist."}
