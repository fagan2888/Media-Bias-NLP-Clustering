How many years have you been in the St. Vrain Valley? 26 years

What brought you here? What has kept you here? I came to Colorado to teach English and Latin and to head up the outdoor program at the Dawson School. I have stayed because the Dawson School and I have grown together. It is fair to say that the school and I challenge each other to be our best. I am hugely proud of my students, my athletes and my colleagues. At the end of the day, it is the people that keep me here.

What's the best part of being the varsity coach for the canoe and kayak team at the Dawson School? I love helping students discover that they are athletes with huge potential, then helping them achieve that potential. There are many valuable lessons my student athletes learn outside of the classroom on the river that they cannot learn inside the classroom. I have been able to travel from Kaua'i, all over the continental United States, and around Europe with my athletes. This is a lifetime sport, pursuing it keeps me young.

What's one memorable lesson you've learned from your students while working as a teacher and coach? The most important lesson is to be relentlessly positive.
