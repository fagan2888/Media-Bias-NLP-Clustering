Finally, the administration wants Congress to raise the eligibility threshold for Medicaid, which is lower in Puerto Rico than it is in the states, up to 100 percent of the poverty level.\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s healthcare problems are complicated by the Zika virus, which is expected to hit the territory far harder than the 50 states.\n\nThe White House\u2019s Zika funding request to Congress includes about $250 million in funding for health assistance for pregnant women and other costs.\n\nPuerto Rico has been helped by a one-time influx of federal health funding from the Affordable Care Act, but those funds are set to expire in 2019, which the administration warns could lead to 600,000 people losing healthcare coverage.\n\nIn fact, officials said Puerto Rico appears to be burning through the funds at a faster rate, meaning they would run out before 2019.
