But, the candidates agree more often than not, and some of their plans are met with skepticism from public healthcare experts.\n\nLeading up to the U.S. Senate primary, ads for U.S.Republican Representatives Marlin Stutzman and Todd Young place a lot of focus on the same issue: repealing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nBoth Stutzman and Young have voiced opposition since Congress approved the law.\n\nAnd they both have plans to replace it for the nearly 200,000 Hoosiers that have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, and the nearly 400,000 that use the state\u2019s program, HIP 2.0 \u2013 which is funded by the federal law.\n\nStutzman & Young: Repeal ACA, Establish Alternative\n\nTo start, both Republican primary candidates propose something Young calls a federal health insurance marketplace.\n\n\u201cSo that Hoosiers can shop for a health insurance plan that they might find best meets their needs but happens to be located out of Arizona or Florida,\u201d Young says.\n\nFor his part, Stutzman says the federal government\u2019s role should be to break down barriers and allow for greater competition.\n\n\u201cMy belief is if the customers and consumers and patients have the best choices and the most flexibility and freedom in the marketplace, that companies will also be successful if they go work hard,\u201d Stutzman says.\n\nBut a number of public health experts find flaws with that plan.\n\nI\u2019m interested that this argument is still going on after 30 years. \u2014Beth Myerson, IU Public Health Professor\n\nIndiana University public health professor Beth Meyerson says the problem with this idea is that it doesn\u2019t seem to work.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen states already vote with their feet on these ideas and they\u2019re not coming forward,\u201d Myerson says. \u201cSo I\u2019m interested that this argument is still going on after 30 years.\u201d\n\nMeyerson says six states have passed legislation in the last decade to allow for \u201cacross state lines\u201d coverage, and not a single insurer has taken advantage.\n\nThe biggest issue, Myerson says, is what\u2019s called \u201cnetwork development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese insurers could not develop a network of providers to, in fact, be the care on the ground for the people that would buy their insurance product.\u201d\n\nSo a Hoosier could buy insurance out of Arizona, but without any local provider to take that insurance, the patient\u2019s cost wouldn\u2019t be any lower.\n\nMore Federal Money, Fewer Strings\n\nThe two candidates also want to see federal money flow to the states for health care, but with far fewer strings attached.\n\nFor Young, that would come in the form of what\u2019s called \u201cblock grants\u201d \u2013 big chunks of federal tax dollars given to the states without many stipulations. Stutzman calls that \u201ca good start\u201d but doesn\u2019t necessarily want to stop there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find more efficiencies, we\u2019ll find more accountability and ultimately I think that those dollars should be paid directly to the state rather than having to be transferred through the federal government,\u201d Stutzman says.\n\nBut not everyone agrees that giving states more autonomy to develop health care policies will equal better results. Meyerson points to Indiana\u2019s poor health rankings as compared to the rest of the nation.\n\nI think our record\u2019s pretty crappy, so not sure that any more control is\u2026going to be what will elevate the health of Hoosiers. \u2014Beth Myerson, IU Public Health Professor\n\n\u201cI think our record\u2019s pretty crappy so not sure that any more control is going to solve \u2026 going to be what will elevate the health of Hoosiers.\u201d\n\nBut Stutzman says more local control is the answer.\n\n\u201cThey will have a better understand of the needs \u2013 what waivers should be granted and what waivers shouldn\u2019t be granted; what services need to be provided, what services should not.\u201d\n\nOn some other details, Young and Stutzman don\u2019t necessarily overlap.\n\nYoung says people or groups should be allowed to pool together to buy insurance. It\u2019s something he says will force insurance companies to be more competitive.\n\n\u201cBut if they\u2019re competing only within a given state and negotiating with individuals or entities that are much smaller than them, then it\u2019s difficult to get a good bargain,\u201d Young says.\n\nThat\u2019s while Stutzman seeks to make coverage more portable. He says people should be able to take their insurance from one job to another.\n\nFundamentally, while they might differ on some little details, the two Republicans\u2019 overarching message going into their primary competition is this: the federal government should remove itself from the health care process as much as possible.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both Republican primary candidates for the open U.S. Senate seat say Obamacare should be repealed, but experts say their alternative plans won't work.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "Both Republican primary candidates for the open U.S. Senate seat say Obamacare should be repealed, but experts say their alternative plans won't work.", "title": "Healthcare Experts Critical Of Stutzman, Young Plans | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/healthcare-experts-critical-stutzman-young-plans-97096/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2016/04/shutterstock_166155479-940x626.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2016/04/shutterstock_166155479-940x626.jpg", "title": "Healthcare Experts Critical Of Stutzman, Young Plans", "description": "Both Republican primary candidates for the open U.S. Senate seat say Obamacare should be repealed, but experts say their alternative plans won't work.", "card": "summary", "site": "@wfiunews"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1", "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c"}, "article_summary": "Stutzman & Young: Repeal ACA, Establish AlternativeTo start, both Republican primary candidates propose something Young calls a federal health insurance marketplace.\n\u2014Beth Myerson, IU Public Health ProfessorIndiana University public health professor Beth Meyerson says the problem with this idea is that it doesn\u2019t seem to work.\nBut a number of public health experts find flaws with that plan.\nBut, the candidates agree more often than not, and some of their plans are met with skepticism from public healthcare experts.\nBoth Stutzman and Young have voiced opposition since Congress approved the law."}
