The law denied benefits to same-sex couples married in states that allowed it.\n\nObama, in a June statement after the decision, said he had directed Holder to work with members of his cabinet \u201cto review all relevant federal statutes to ensure this decision, including its implications for federal benefits and obligations, is implemented swiftly and smoothly.\u201d\n\nSimilar Standard\n\nThe Justice Department announced in 2011 it would no longer defend the law, known as DOMA, after a determination that it was unconstitutional. A similar standard will apply to veterans\u2019 benefits, which are defined in statute as available to a spouse who is \u201ca person of the opposite sex.\u201d\n\nVeterans Affairs Department Secretary Eric K. Shinseki, in an August letter to Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, said the existing law would \u201cnot confer spousal status for purposes of eligibility for VA benefits.\u201d\n\nA federal judge in California last week ruled that same-sex spouses must be eligible for the same veterans\u2019 benefits as married heterosexual couples after the Supreme Court decision.\n\nHolder, in the two-page letter, said Obama has \u201cdirected the Executive Branch to cease enforcement\u201d of the sections of the law barring the benefits.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court decision didn\u2019t directly address the veterans\u2019 benefits statute, \u201cthe reasoning of the opinion strongly supports the conclusion that those provisions are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment,\u201d Holder said.\n\nQuick Implementation\n\nVeterans and gay-rights groups today announced their support for the decision and called for quick implementation.\n\nAlexander Nicholson, legislative director for the New York-based Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, called Holder\u2019s decision a \u201csmart move.\u201d His organization supported overturning the section of DOMA that prevented same-sex couples from being recognized as spouses under federal law.\n\n\u201cAll service members need to be treated equally and need to have their families taken care of equally,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cIt would have been a waste of time and money\u201d for the Justice Department to continue enforcing laws that barred gay spouses from sharing veterans benefits, he said.\n\nJoe Davis, a spokesman for the Kansas City, Missouri-based Veterans of Foreign Wars, said in an e-mail that \u201cwe hope that VA moves quickly to implement this change and begins paying veterans and eligible survivors promptly.\u201d\n\n\u2018Doing Right\u2019\n\nVictoria Dillon, acting press secretary for the Veterans Affairs Department, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a phone call and e-mail seeking comment about how much it will cost the agency to provide benefits to gay spouses.\n\nMichael Cole-Schwartz, communications director for the Human Rights Campaign, said the announcement \u201crests solidly\u201d on the principle laid out by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration is doing right by our veterans and faithfully executing the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion and we look forward to guidance as to how the VA will treat veterans and their spouses living in states that do not recognize their marriages,\u201d Cole-Schwartz, whose Washington-based group advocates for gay rights, said in an e-mail.\n\nShaheen has sponsored legislation in the Senate that would expand federal benefits for married gay couples by amending the definition of \u201cspouse\u201d in federal law. The Veterans Affairs Committee approved the bill in July.\n\nA similar House bill, from Representative Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat, hasn\u2019t moved forward in that chamber.\n\nThe decision clears the way for the Veterans Affairs Department to join a growing list of federal agencies that have implemented changes since the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe Treasury Department last week said gay spouses in all states will be treated as married under federal tax law. The Defense Department said last month it would make the same benefits available to same-sex spouses that are available to opposite sex spouses.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Phil Mattingly and Kathleen Miller", "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Justice Department will stop enforcing federal law barring married gay couples from veterans\u2019 benefits, clearing the way for payments to begin, according to a letter sent to congressional leaders.", "title": "Gay Spouses to Receive Veterans Benefits, U.S. Says", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-04/u-s-allows-gay-spouses-to-receive-veterans-benefits", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iaaf4Iew0Mgw/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Phil Mattingly and Kathleen Miller", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Justice Department,Barack H Obama,Supreme Court,Law,Eric H Holder,Veterans Affairs", "news_keywords": "Justice Department,Barack H Obama,Supreme Court,Law,Eric H Holder,Veterans Affairs", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-04/u-s-allows-gay-spouses-to-receive-veterans-benefits", "parsely-title": "Gay Spouses to Receive Veterans Benefits, U.S. Says", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-09-04T20:57:47.772Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The U.S. Justice Department will stop enforcing federal law barring married gay couples from veterans\u2019 benefits, clearing the way for payments to begin, according to a letter sent to congressional leaders.", "parsely-tags": "Justice Department,Barack H Obama,Supreme Court,Law,Eric H Holder,Veterans Affairs,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2013-09-04T20:57:47.772Z", "parsely-section": "world", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "The U.S. Justice Department will stop enforcing federal law barring married gay couples from veterans\u2019 benefits, clearing the way for payments to begin, according to a letter sent to congressional leaders.", "title": "Gay Spouses to Receive Veterans Benefits, U.S. Says", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-04/u-s-allows-gay-spouses-to-receive-veterans-benefits", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iaaf4Iew0Mgw/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "The U.S. Justice Department will stop enforcing federal law barring married gay couples from veterans\u2019 benefits, clearing the way for payments to begin, according to a letter sent to congressional leaders."}, "parsely-post-id": "MSM6VZ6JTSG601", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iaaf4Iew0Mgw/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c19\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt would have been a waste of time and money\u201d for the Justice Department to continue enforcing laws that barred gay spouses from sharing veterans benefits, he said.\nShaheen has sponsored legislation in the Senate that would expand federal benefits for married gay couples by amending the definition of \u201cspouse\u201d in federal law.\nThe Treasury Department last week said gay spouses in all states will be treated as married under federal tax law.\nThe U.S. Justice Department will stop enforcing federal law barring married gay couples from veterans\u2019 benefits, clearing the way for payments to begin, according to a letter sent to congressional leaders.\nThe Defense Department said last month it would make the same benefits available to same-sex spouses that are available to opposite sex spouses."}
