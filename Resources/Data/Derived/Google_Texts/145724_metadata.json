Stanford professor Amos Nur, an expert on earthquakes and in the more general field of how rocks fracture when subjected to high pressure, saw something at the ancient Greek city of Mycenae that countless others had simply overlooked.\n\nIt was 1993 and Nur was attending a conference on archaeo-seismology, a relatively new term to describe how archaeologists and seismologists were trying to join forces and benefit from each other\u2019s work. But as Nur later recounted, the conference was a disappointment. The archaeologists and the seismologists seldom mixed, except during short breaks when both groups would indulge in drinking strong Greek coffee, and during an occasional day trip when they were taken to see one of the nearby ancient sites. It was during one such trip that Nur and the others visited Mycenae.\n\nHere a quick diversion explains an unexpected circumstance that links Mycenae to California and its geology. In 1851, Heinrich Schliemann, then a German businessman, made a trip to California to claim his dead brother\u2019s estate. His brother had been one of the first to arrive in the gold fields, though instead of searching for gold, the brother made a quick fortune buying and selling claims. When Schliemann arrived, he too sensed an opportunity and opened a bank in Sacramento, where he traded in gold dust. The venture was short-lived; local agents were soon complaining that they were receiving short-weight consignments, and Schliemann, feigning illness, quickly left. He eventually made his way to the eastern Mediterranean, where he used his brother\u2019s fortune\u2014and whatever additional money he had accumulated while in California\u2014to finance archaeological work at Mycenae and Troy and other soon-to-be-famous sites. More than a century later, Nur, standing at Mycenae, recognized a feature that Schliemann had unearthed that would change the way seismologists determine earthquake risk in California.\n\nWhat Nur saw is along the entranceway to the ancient city and within sight of the famous Lion Gate, where a stone relief depicts two lionesses in upright heraldic positions. It was through this gate, so tradition says, that Agamemnon, a Mycenaean king and one of the main characters in Homer\u2019s Iliad, marched his army and led them on a ten-year siege of Troy. Just outside the gate is an immense stone wall that sits atop a head-high steep incline of highly polished rock. To most people, the incline conveys a sense of rock-solid security. To Nur, it was evidence of a past calamity.\n\nNur recognized the rock incline as a fault scarp\u2014a line along which a past earthquake had fractured and thrust the ground upward. That meant the Mycenaeans had built their city over an active fault. Fortunately for them, this particular fault has not moved in thousands of years, but earthquakes are common in the region. Nur realized that the ancient city of Mycenae, which was at its greatest influence during the Bronze Age, must have been subjected to repeated seismic shakings. But what effect might such subterranean activity have had on the city\u2019s history? Might the sudden abandonment of Mycenae around 1200 B.C. have been caused by an earthquake?\n\nArchaeologists said no. Though many major cities in the eastern Mediterranean\u2014including Thebes in Greece, Knossos on Crete, and Troy in western Turkey\u2014were also destroyed around 1200 B.C., and though every major site\u2014from Pylos on the Peloponnese Peninsula, to Aleppo in Syria, and Ashkelon in southern Israel\u2014shows some damage consistent with seismic shaking happening around 1200 B.C., the widespread destruction that brought about the end of the Bronze Age\u2014\u201cthe worst disaster in ancient history, even more calamitous than the collapse of the Western Roman Empire,\u201d according to one noted classicist\u2014was not instantaneous but had occurred over several decades.\n\nFor that reason, archaeologists argued that the end of the Bronze Age was probably caused by several factors, including invasions by foreign peoples and by internal political strife. But Nur proposed another idea.\n\nSince a single catastrophic earthquake could not have been the cause, Nur suggested that several major earthquakes had struck a broad region of the eastern Mediterranean over a period of several decades. But was there any evidence that such a sequence of major earthquakes anywhere in the world had occurred in quick succession? Nur pored through catalogues of ancient earthquakes and discovered that, indeed, there was.\n\nOne such period of increased seismic activity had started in A.D. 343, when an earthquake struck northeast Turkey. Then in A.D. 358, a second earthquake happened to the west. Others followed, also in northern Turkey, in 362 and 368. Then between 394 and 412 A.D., six earthquakes occurred near Constantinople, modern-day Istanbul. Also during the late fourth and early fifth centuries, major earthquakes shook the southern Italian peninsula, the island of Sicily, and Libya in northern Africa, as well as the Holy land and Cyprus. One of the largest events occurred in 365, when the southern shoreline of Crete was pushed up as much as 27 feet, comparable to the maximum amount of uplift recorded along the coast of Alaska in 1964\u2014meaning the 365 earthquake had been a colossal event. In all, during the second half of the fourth century and the first few decades of the fifth century A.D., at least a dozen damaging earthquakes hit the central and eastern Mediterranean region. Nur\u2019s examination of earthquake catalogues also showed that the centuries immediately before and after were periods of relative seismic quiet.\n\nBut was there a more recent\u2014a more obvious\u2014example of a series of major earthquakes that had detailed information about the location and size of individual events? Yes, there was.\n\nIn 1939, after two centuries of quiescence, the North Anatolian Fault, which runs across northern Turkey roughly parallel to the coastline of the Black Sea and which is a boundary between the African and Eurasian plates, came to life. By 1999, 13 major earthquakes had occurred. What is even more remarkable, 7 of the 13 ruptured the North Anatolian Fault in a systematic way: Each successive earthquake ruptured a segment of the fault that was immediately west of the previous earthquake.\n\nThe sequence began in northeast Turkey\u2014as it had in A.D. 343\u2014near the city of Erzincan, where, on December 26, 1939, the shaking was so severe and the damage so great that the old part of Erzincan was abandoned and a new city center was soon built to the north. Then three years later, in 1942, the next earthquake happened, immediately west of Erzincan, and a year later yet another earthquake west of the 1942 event. In all, the sequence of seven west-migrating earthquakes ruptured a 600-mile-long continuous segment of the North Anatolian Fault.\n\nEach of these prolonged releases of seismic energy\u2014in the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. and again in the 20th century\u2014 lasted several decades and occurred after a millennium of relative seismic quiescence. This supported Nur\u2019s suggestion that a similar series of major earthquakes could have occurred over several decades around 1200 B.C., nearly a millennium before the recorded quakes of the fourth and fifth centuries. It was a new phenomenon, one that Nur called \u201can earthquake storm.\u201d\n\nBut why would seismic energy be released as a series of large earthquakes lasting for decades?\n\nNur had an answer: stress transfer.\n\n* * *\n\nI once spent an intriguing afternoon watching an artisan prepare colored glass panes for a stained-glass window. The secret, he revealed, was not to cut completely through a thick pane, which could shatter the glass into shards, but to etch each one with a cutting tool that left the geometric curve he wanted the edge of a pane to have. Then, by the appropriate application of heat and cold, by twisting the pane ever so slightly, and by relying on the weakness of an etched curve, he could induce a glass pane to break as a series of arcuate cracks and produce a pane of any desired shape.\n\nThe purpose of the application of heat and cold and of the twisting was to induce a specific pattern of concentrated stress that enabled the artisan to control where the pane was mostly likely to break.\n\nIt is an art that few people have ever mastered. If one substituted the induced thermal and twisting stresses for the buildup of stress in the earth\u2019s crust by the movement of tectonic plates, and substituted the sequence of cracks produced in the glass panes for earthquakes, then one can understand how an earthquake storm could be produced.\n\nThink of it in another way. Imagine that a giant zipper is holding together two tectonic plates. As the two plates tug against each other, a segment of the zipper sudden slides open, but, as a zipper is apt to do, it snags occasionally. As the tugging continues, the zipper again slides, then snags again. Each time, the sliding zipper represents an earthquake and the tugging of the plates becomes concentrated at another place along the zipper.\n\nOr consider another example\u2014one that Nur prefers. Take a wide rubber band and cut a few short slits in it. As the band is stretched, each slit in turn opens up and the ends of the slits lengthen. The sequence that the slits open and by how much depends on how the stress pattern gets transferred and concentrated at new locations across the rubber band.\n\nIf this seems complicated, rest assured it can all be explained mathematically by applying what is known as the Coulomb-Navier failure criterion, a well-established physical law widely used by engineers to design buildings, bridges, and other monumental structures. The Coulomb-Navier failure criterion tells how much an object\u2014or the Earth\u2019s crust\u2014can be pushed or pulled, twisted or sheared, before it breaks. And the criterion has probably never been more thankfully applied\u2014at least in a geologic application\u2014than during the recent earthquake storm along the North Anatolian Fault in northern Turkey.\n\nIn 1997, using the Coulomb-Navier failure criterion, a forecast was made, based on the sequence of recent earthquake ruptures, that there was a 12% chance that a magnitude-7 or larger earthquake would strike near the city of Izmit, 40 miles east of Istanbul, during the next 30 years. Two years later, a magnitude-7.6 earthquake did devastate Izmit, killing more than 25,000 people and causing $65 billion in damages. Within months after that earthquake, another forecast was made, this time for the area around D\u00fczce, 60 miles east of Izmit. Some school buildings, thought to be in danger of collapse by seismic shaking, were closed. Then on November 17, 1999, another earthquake hit, flattening school buildings.\n\nSuch success gives credibility to earthquake forecasting, or rather to the idea that the probability of a future earthquake\u2014identifying the magnitude and a time period\u2014can be given based on stress transfer. It also prompted a search for other examples of earthquake storms throughout the Earth\u2019s history.\n\nAn earthquake storm probably ran up and down the Italian peninsula during the late 17th and throughout most of the 18th centuries. It began with two damaging earthquakes that originated beneath the Apennine Mountains east of Naples in 1694 and 1702. The activity then migrated north to a region east of Rome with three major earthquakes in early 1703. By the second half of the 18th century, activity had returned to southern Italy, where five major shakings occurred along the toe of the Italian boot, in Reggio Calabria.\n\nA more recent storm occurred in eastern Mongolia between 1905 and 1957, when four magnitude-8 events struck. And an earthquake storm is happening now along the Xianshuihe and adjacent faults along the northern edge of the Tibetan plateau in southwest China, where 11 major earthquakes have happened in the last 120 years.\n\nAfter decades of almost no seismic activity, the Xianshuihe Fault became active in 1893 when an earthquake rocked the Tibetan district of Kada, destroying the Dalai Lama\u2019s Grand Monastery of Hueiyuan and seven smaller monasteries. In all, 74 Buddhist priests and 137 Chinese and Tibetan soldiers were killed. Since then, ten more strong shakings have occurred, including a magnitude-8.0 shock on the nearby Longmenshan Fault in 2008. The most recent event occurred on April 14, 2010, in Qinghai Province when many Buddhists were killed when a 12th-century monastery collapsed.\n\nThis, of course, raises the question: Has an earthquake storm ever occurred in California? Here we are hampered by a historical record that spans barely 200 years. But using the techniques of paleoseismology, evidence has been revealed that two storms may have occurred in a place that few people associate with devastating earthquakes\u2014Hollywood.\n\n* * *\n\nThough it is one of the most densely populated regions of California, Hollywood offers an unusual opportunity to recognize and walk along an active fault. The area was urbanized in the 1920s, before the widespread use of mechanized earth-moving equipment, so much of the original topography is still intact, even subtle features such as alignments of low hills and shallow troughs that record the trace of recent earthquakes. In essence, the network of winding streets and the placement at odd angles of apartment buildings and commercial enterprises, as well as the occasional abrupt slope across one of the sprawling lawns in Hollywood and nearby Beverly Hills, are subtle evidence of an original jumbled ground surface. And by finding the appropriate steep incline, one can follow the Hollywood Fault.\n\nBegin at the corner of Hollywood and Vine and look north along Vine Street beyond the 13-storied cylindrical tower that houses Capitol Records. Just beyond Capitol Records, just before Vine Street reaches the Hollywood Freeway, the roadway ramps up a steep hill. The hill is there because the ground was pushed up by repeated earthquakes. Along the base of the hill is the Hollywood Fault.\n\nFrom that point, the fault can be followed west along the base of the same hill, running parallel to and maintaining a distance of a few blocks north of Hollywood Boulevard. It runs along the base of the low hill where the Magic Castle, a private club of magicians and the home of the Academy of Magical Arts, is located. Farther west, the fault runs directly beneath the house where the Nelson family lived and where the opening scene of their famous 1960s sitcom\u2014the series was called \u201cThe Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\u201d\u2014was filmed.\n\nContinuing west, close to where Hollywood Boulevard ends, the fault angles to the southwest and crosses just south of the busy intersection of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards. This is a neighborhood of fine restaurants and fashionable boutiques. On the north side of Sunset Boulevard one can find, after considerable searching through the urban construction, an occasional outcrop of hard granite. This is the rock that comprises the Santa Monica Mountains to the north; high up the mountainside is the famous hollywood sign. South of Sunset Boulevard, there are no rocky outcrops; instead, one stands on a deep layer, several hundred feet thick, of loose sediments that washed out of the canyons of the Santa Monica Mountains and that fill the Hollywood Basin. It is this discontinuity\u2014granite outcrops north of Sunset Boulevard and deep sedimentary fill to the south\u2014that, here, defines the Hollywood Fault.\n\nThe western end of the fault lies somewhere near the grounds of the Beverly Hills Hotel, just north of the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Rodeo Drive. From there, if one walks a mile or so south along Rodeo Drive to Santa Monica Boulevard, then turns right and continues to Wilshire Boulevard, one will now be standing at the eastern end of another fault\u2014the Santa Monica Fault\u2014which continues to the ocean\u2019s edge and beyond.\n\nNow return to where the Hollywood Fault crosses under Vine Street and head east. From here, the fault runs close to Franklin Avenue, then along Los Feliz Boulevard. At the east end of the Santa Monica Mountains\u2014that is, at the southeast corner of Griffith Park, home of the Los Angeles Zoo and Griffith Observatory\u2014the fault disappears under the floodplain of the Los Angeles River. What lies on the other side?\n\nThere is another fault\u2014the Raymond Fault\u2014which is, perhaps, a continuation of the Hollywood Fault and which runs eastward through southern Glendale and across the San Gabriel Valley, through South Pasadena to the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains. Kinks in the Raymond fault are responsible for the low hill where the luxurious Langham Hotel\u2014formerly Ritz-Carlton\u2014is perched and for the shallow depression that is Lacy Park. The Raymond Fault is also responsible for the low hills on the north side of the Santa Anita Racetrack, visible from the grandstand.\n\nWhat do the Santa Monica, Hollywood, and Raymond Faults have in common? Besides lying along what seems to be a continuous line, all three ruptured about 10,000 years ago and again about 1,000 years ago.\n\nUnfortunately, paleoseismologists have not yet determined whether the earthquakes along the Santa Monica, Hollywood, and Raymond Faults occurred as a single colossal event or as a series of relatively quick earthquakes, happening over years to centuries, the latter being an earthquake storm. (Unfortunately, the techniques used in paleoseismology are not yet sufficiently refined to distinguish, in this case, between years and centuries.) But there is a curious coincidence: All three faults did rupture at about the same time; then, after a period of several thousand years, all three ruptured again, lending further credence to Richter\u2019s statement: \u201cWhen you get a lot of earthquakes, you get a lot of earthquakes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A major earthquake wouldn't just be disastrous in its own right \u2014 it could trigger an even deadlier chain reaction", "title": "West Coast apocalypse: How \u201cearthquake storms\u201d could devastate California", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A major earthquake wouldn't just be disastrous in its own right \u2014 it could trigger an even deadlier chain reaction", "title": "West Coast apocalypse: How \u201cearthquake storms\u201d could devastate California", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/15/west_coast_apocalypse_how_earthquake_storms_could_devastate_california/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/sf_earthquake4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A major earthquake wouldn't just be disastrous in its own right \u2014 it could trigger an even deadlier chain reaction", "title": "West Coast apocalypse: How \u201cearthquake storms\u201d could devastate California", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/sf_earthquake4.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Dvorak", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, California, Earthquake Storms, Earthquakes, Editor's Picks, San Francisco, Science, west coast", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Now return to where the Hollywood Fault crosses under Vine Street and head east.\nThen between 394 and 412 A.D., six earthquakes occurred near Constantinople, modern-day Istanbul.\nBut was there any evidence that such a sequence of major earthquakes anywhere in the world had occurred in quick succession?\nThen three years later, in 1942, the next earthquake happened, immediately west of Erzincan, and a year later yet another earthquake west of the 1942 event.\nBut was there a more recent\u2014a more obvious\u2014example of a series of major earthquakes that had detailed information about the location and size of individual events?"}
