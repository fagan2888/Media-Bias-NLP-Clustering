Stricter fuel-economy standards are expected to lead to a decline in gasoline consumption, the EIA says. Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGood news for green groups and your greenbacks.\n\nAs stricter fuel standards force cars to guzzle far less fuel over the next few decades, gasoline consumption is expected to decline substantially by 2040, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Thursday.\n\n\u201cOne of the primary drivers of the decrease in motor gasoline consumption is more stringent fuel economy standards that \u2026 will require new light-duty vehicles to average about 49 miles per gallon in vehicle model year 2025,\u201d an EIA report said.\n\nVehicles from model year 2012 and later now are required to get an estimated 33 mpg.\n\n\n\nGasoline consumption is projected to fall over the next few decades. Diesel consumption and exports of oil products, by contrast, are expected to rise. Courtesy U.S. Energy Information Administration\n\nYet even as gas consumption is predicted to fall, the use of diesel fuel and exports of refined oil products \u2013 such as diesel, gasoline, jet fuel and chemicals \u2013 are projected to increase.\n\nEven though the Environmental Protection Agency has unveiled new fuel-efficiency standards for tractor-trailers and other heavy-duty trucks, there will also likely be an increase in the number of miles traveled by such vehicles. The reason, the EIA said: as the economy continues to grow, more trucks will be on the road, accumulating miles and consuming diesel as they haul freight from Point A to Point B.\n\nExports of oil products, meanwhile, will be fueled by the domestic oil boom in the Midwest, which is expected to continue for at least the next few decades.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Data Mine [News]", "title": "As Fuel Standards Tighten, Gas Consumption to Fall, EIA Says", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Gasoline consumption is expected to decline through 2040.
