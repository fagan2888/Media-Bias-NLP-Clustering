She and her husband have moved to North Carolina. She\u2019s a Republican and she\u2019s noticed something, \u201cUp in Connecticut, we didn\u2019t dwell that much on gay marriage and abortion.\u201d In fact, and here she began to whisper, \u201cI\u2019m pro-choice.\u201d We were standing in the middle of the Guilford County Republican Party Headquarters, a large room filled with state and military flags\u2013and campaign posters for Thom Tillis who is running for Senate and Mark Walker, a local minister who is running for Congress.\n\nThe room was filling up fast and I asked Candace why she was a Republican, \u201cEconomic issues.\u201d She explained that she was a supply-sider, \u201cI don\u2019t mind paying my fair share. What I do mind is being vilified for having done well. My husband and I have been pretty successful and I don\u2019t like being considered part of the \u2018evil rich.\u2019 You can disagree with my point of view, but we shouldn\u2019t vilify people for their views in this country?\u201d\n\n\n\nI was curious about how Mrs. DeSantes would react to a heaping helping of Dixified red meat. In a year, say 2010, when the southern GOP was slinging anger and anti-Obama conspiracy silliness, DeSantes might have second thoughts about her party of choice in North Carolina. But what followed was\u2026well, it was different.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d Thom Tillis said, \u201cthat we have to be this disappointed in this President.\u201d And that\u2019s about as rough as it got. He criticized Obama\u2013on health care, on foreign policy. He criticized his Democratic opponent Kay Hagan\u2013for supporting the Affordable Care Act, diplomacy with Iran, the Senate immigration bill\u2013with a call and respond line, \u201cIs that a Senator from North Carolina?\u201d He told his own up-by-his-bootstraps story. (Tillis started on a loading dock and didn\u2019t get his college degree until he turned 36; but he\u2019s been successful in business and is now the Speaker of the state legislature.) \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about our country,\u201d he said, running against the right-wing radio trope that everything is going to hell in a hand basket.\n\nI thought it was pretty effective, more smoked brisket than red meat. But the real shocker was Mark Walker, the Congressional candidate, who mostly talked about missions to help the poor that he\u2019d undertaken via his church. He talked about faith-based social programs, much the way George W. Bush did. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pull the rug out from under people who are suffering,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I do want to change the incentives in many of programs that we have. You don\u2019t pull people out of poverty by making them more comfortable.\u201d (Earlier, he\u2019d told me that the thing he was most interested in doing if he won was finding Democrats he could work with to make the social welfare system more effective).\n\nWhat didn\u2019t the minister mention? Abortion. Homosexuality. Here\u2019s his toughest line about Obama, \u201chis present policies are hurting the country.\u201d\n\nNow, you know exactly how Tillis and Walker will vote if they win. I would be surprised if either of them took a single vote that wasn\u2019t lockstep Republican. (And a local billboard quotes \u201cextremist\u201d Walker saying, \u201cI think Romney was right about the 47%.\u201d) But the style change is striking: The Republicans aren\u2019t yelling this year. At least, not in North Carolina.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Greensboro, North Carolina &nbsp; Candace DeSantes has just retired as a reinsurance broker in Connecticut.
