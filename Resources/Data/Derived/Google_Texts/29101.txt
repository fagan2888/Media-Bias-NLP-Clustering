Boobs are amazing. Let me rephrase that. Boobs are a biological wonder among mammals, especially humans. Although only human males tend to develop a sexual fixation for their female counterpart’s breasts, all mammals (from the word "mammary") get their nutrition at a young age from their mother’s milk. But where does that milk come from?

Surprisingly, the milk produced by a woman’s breast actually starts in her blood supply. Breast milk is simply the product of proteins, sugars, and fats that are pulled from the mother’s blood. When a baby does start nursing from their mother’s breast, the milk is secreted through a number of tiny, little holes as opposed to one single orifice like many of us thought.

Next let’s talk about something a lot of women worry about, even though they shouldn’t: their left boob being larger than the right. Breast asymmetry is actually pretty common — 50 percent of the female population common. Here’s the thing, scientists aren’t really sure why. They speculate it’s in part due to hormonal changes during puberty. And if that wasn’t confusing enough, the production of estrogen and progesterone throughout the menstrual cycle causes the size of boobs to change from week to week.

I can go on and on about the awesome power of a woman’s boobs, but it's best you just listen to this woman from AsapSCIENCE, who probably knows a lot more about boobs than I do.
