Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) on conservative lawmakers\u2019 Obamacare strategy. She asked both Gohmert and Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) why they won\u2019t get out of the way and allow Obamacare be fully implemented so they can reap the political advantage if it fails.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether you hurt the Republican party,\u201d Kelly said, adding that the current deal still gives Democrats everything they\u2019ve wanted. \u201cThe debt limit is going to get raised, the government is going to resume\u2026with no conditions. That\u2019s what Harry Reid wanted.\u201d\n\nHuelskamp noted Democrats\u2019 unwillingness to compromise on anything in his response, while Gohmert again fell back on his principles.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no statute of limitations on doing what\u2019s right,\u201d Gohmert said.\n\nThe Texas congressman went on to argue that deficit spending President Barack Obama has increased from $160 billion in former President George Bush\u2019s last year to $1.6 trillion the following year. Gohmert maintains that spending is out of control. He also said the Obama administration has stolen Americans\u2019 \u201cdoctor rights\u201d under Obamacare.\n\nGohmert said conservative lawmakers are only asking for the Obama administration to delay the individual mandate in Obamacare to match the 1-year delay that the president \u201cillegally\u201d extended to big businesses.\n\n\u201cHow is it right for Harry Reid to say, \u2018no, no, no, no,\u2019?\u201d he added.\n\nLater in the segment, Kelly asked Gohmert why, if Obamacare is \u201cimploding,\u201d they don\u2019t just stay out of it and build a case in 2014.\n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s one contention, but if Ted (Cruz) doesn\u2019t spend the filibuster, if we don\u2019t make this the focus \u2014 we had already heard what was coming,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cAs soon as we got beyond this summer, we were going to have an amnesty bill come to the floor \u2014 that\u2019s what we would have been talking about and that\u2019s where the pivot would have been if we had not focused America on Obamacare.\u201d\n\nGohmert went on to say that it\u2019s not too late to get a vote on delaying the individual mandate in Obamacare if Republicans stand firm.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\n(H/T: Mediaite)\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "During a discussion on a potential deal to end the government shutdown, Megyn Kelly grilled Rep.
