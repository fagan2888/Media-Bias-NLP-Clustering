Security was tight across the city, where tens of thousands of police and paramilitary personnel were deployed on street corners and rooftops.\n\nObama's presence at the parade - at Modi's personal invitation - marks the latest upturn in a roller-coaster relationship that a year ago was scarred by protectionism and a fiery diplomatic spat.\n\nCounterweight to China\n\nThe United States views India as a vast market and potential counterweight in Asia to a more assertive China, but has frequently been frustrated with the slow pace of New Delhi's economic reforms and unwillingness to side with Washington in international affairs.\n\nRelated: FactBox: Obama and Modi Unveil Nuclear Trade Breakthroughs\n\nElected last May, Modi has injected a new vitality into the economy and foreign relations and, to Washington's delight, has begun pushing back against China across Asia.\n\n\"The larger goal that the United States should be pursuing here is to convince India to join a coalition of democracies to balance China's rise,\" former U.S. ambassador to Beijing Jon Huntsman and the South Asia Center's acting director, Bharath Gopalaswamy, wrote in a joint opinion piece for Reuters.\n\nIndia, with the world's third-largest population of Muslims, has not openly engaged so far in international efforts to combat the spread of Islamic State. Indian Muslims have largely shunned radical causes, and police say only four Indians are known to have joined the group.\n\nAnalysts say that, under Modi, India appears more willing to engage on issues beyond its borders, including security in the South China Sea and Islamist militancy.\n\nRelated: ISIS Is Growing Its 'Terror Army' of Global Jihadists\n\nModi and Obama on Sunday committed to close consultation on global crises, including in Iraq and Syria. \"The leaders agreed to exchange information on individuals returning from these conflict zones and to continue to cooperate in protecting and responding to the needs of civilians caught up in these conflicts,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nThey also agreed to a 10-year framework for defense ties and struck deals on cooperation that included joint production of drone aircraft and equipment for Lockheed Martin Corp's C-130 military transport plane.\n\nOther deals ranged from an Obama-Modi hotline - India's first at a leadership level - to financing initiatives aimed at helping India use renewable energy to lower carbon intensity.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "India could play a role in battling Islamic State, the White House said on Monday duri", "title": "How India Could Help U.S. Battle ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/26/How-India-Could-Help-US-Battle-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01222015_Iraq_Kurds.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/26/How-India-Could-Help-US-Battle-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01222015_Iraq_Kurds.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "India could play a role in battling Islamic State, the White House said on Monday duri", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb48\"", "article_summary": "Analysts say that, under Modi, India appears more willing to engage on issues beyond its borders, including security in the South China Sea and Islamist militancy.\nIndia, with the world's third-largest population of Muslims, has not openly engaged so far in international efforts to combat the spread of Islamic State.\nOther deals ranged from an Obama-Modi hotline - India's first at a leadership level - to financing initiatives aimed at helping India use renewable energy to lower carbon intensity.\n\"Mobama breaks N-deadlock,\" ran the front-page headline of the Mail Today newspaper, which carried a photograph of Modi and Obama hugging each other warmly.\nRelated: ISIS Is Growing Its 'Terror Army' of Global JihadistsModi and Obama on Sunday committed to close consultation on global crises, including in Iraq and Syria."}
