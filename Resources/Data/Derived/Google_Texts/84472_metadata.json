Yet, it is this same story the liberal media is trying to silence. \u2018The Principle,\u2019 Delano\u2019s latest film project, challenges the Copernican principle, the notion that humans are just an insignificant speck in the universe. Interviews with cosmologists, in depth studies and surveys will leave viewers wondering whether we are indeed a unique species. Yet, it seems this is exactly what liberal academics and the mainstream media don\u2019t want.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question at all that this film clearly threatens some very powerful people,\u201d Delano told Townhall. \u201cWhen I made this film, one of the things that became really apparent to me was, when you really look at the history of modern civilization, it really begins with Copernicus. The idea that we\u2019re not the center. It\u2019s such a powerful change in the way we view ourselves. Of course it had tremendous implications in terms of the relative power of the church versus the academy. It is this change that really brings the modern world into existence\u2026If we construct a worldview based on the fact that we are the center of creation, and that the entire reason and existence of this universe is us, you\u2019re going to have a certain kind of civilization that flows from that assumption.\u201d\n\nSome specific ways the media targeted the film was by contacting the cast and other people involved in the production and convincing them they had been tricked.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the actual media assault was the result of an attempt to call these guys up out of the clear blue and say, \u2018Hey, do you know you just got duped into making a movie with a bunch of crazed geocentrists who made you sound like you believe in geocentrism?\u2019 If you put yourself in the position of these guys getting these calls, it would be highly embarrassing for them.\u201d\n\nDespite the media firestorm, a conservative grassroots effort has been building to get the film to as many theaters as possible.\n\n\u201cThat was nothing other than our determination not to allow the film to be buried,\u201d Delano explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible experience. We were able to secure a passionate base of supporters who were willing to go out there and find an audience for us.\u201d\n\nThey chose areas where they had the most support and launched a limited release. So far, the film has arrived in ten cities and has been met with a positive reception.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming response we\u2019ve received from people who have actually seen the film is tremendous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been absolutely vitiated in the mainstream media and it\u2019s clear that\u2019s never going to change. It\u2019s sort of like a culture war. But, so many of the people who have reviewed the film have written amazing reviews of the film. Our entire audience is people who have heard about the film through word of mouth or who have come in contact with it through our Facebook page or website and have gone to see it and told their friends, \u2018You\u2019ve got to see this.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacing a ruthless media goliath and a lack of resources isn\u2019t stopping \u2018The Principle\u2019 team from trying to expand its audience.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the money, we don\u2019t have the connections, we don\u2019t have the media support to expect this thing to go to wide theatrical release, but let\u2019s go as far as we can.\u201d\n\n\u2018The Principle\u2019 DVD is set to come out midsummer.
