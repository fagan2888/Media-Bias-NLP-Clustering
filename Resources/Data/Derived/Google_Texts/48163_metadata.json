We've got a lot of problems, they have been identified. I think everybody has recognized them. Let's fix it. Let's get together and fix things,\" he said.\n\nWhite House officials said on Wednesday that enrollment requirements were being changed so that consumers could sign up for health insurance right up to the March 31 deadline and avoid penalties. Some people previously needed to be signed around Feb. 15 to meet the end of March deadline.\n\nA White House official said that pushing back the sign-up requirement was not related to glitches with Healthcare.gov, but was simply an effort to eliminate confusion over the two deadlines.\n\nThe comments from the handful of Democrats posed a new potential hazard for the White House and gave Republicans a chance to portray their efforts to derail the healthcare program as bipartisan.\n\nDemocratic Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who faces a tough re-election race next year, said he agreed with fellow Democrat Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire that the open enrollment period to sign up for insurance should be extended beyond March 31, 2014.\n\nRepresentative James Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking House Democrat, criticized the website for forcing consumers to provide private information before deciding what kind of health insurance plan they want to buy.\n\n\"I've talked to too many people who tell me before they ever get around to figuring out what it is they want to buy, they're having to answer questions that they don't feel they should be answering,\" Clyburn said.\n\nCONTRACTOR TESTIMONY\n\nRepublicans said they would intensify their investigations into the launch of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as \"Obamacare.\"\n\n\"It is our job to hold them accountable, and when it comes to Obamacare clearly there is a lot to hold accountable,\" House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner told reporters.\n\nThe Republican-led House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday will hear from the top contractors responsible for the program. They included website developer CGI Federal, a unit of Canada's CGI Group Inc, which said in prepared testimony that the software from another contractor designed to allow users to create an account led to early bottlenecks.\n\nBut the other contractor, United Health Group unit Quality Software Services Inc (QSSI), said in prepared testimony that some of its problems stemmed from a late decision by the administration to require consumers to register for an account before browsing for insurance products.\n\n\"This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have occurred if consumers could 'window shop' anonymously,\" said QSSI.\n\nThe company's software is now keeping pace with demand. Andrew Slavitt, executive vice president with QSSI's parent, said the software has had \"error rates close to zero\" since Oct. 8.\n\nObama administration officials, including U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, met with the chief executives of 14 leading insurance companies, including Aetna Inc, WellPoint Inc and Humana Inc.\n\nThe executives agreed to form new technical teams with the administration to help fix the website, which provide online access to the marketplaces designed to be the main way for millions of uninsured Americans to research and buy health insurance plans under the law.\n\n\"We had a candid discussion on the challenges facing the exchange, and the plan that is being put in place to get the program on track,\" Aetna Inc spokeswoman Cynthia Michener said.\n\nThe Oct. 1 debut of the exchanges was marred by technical glitches that have kept many from signing on and making purchases. Those unable to sign up online can call a toll-free telephone number as an alternative.\n\nThe administration has so far declined to disclose the number of enrollments, either online or by telephone.\n\n'WORKING HARD TO FIX THE PROBLEMS'\n\nA prolonged delay in getting Healthcare.gov to work could jeopardize White House efforts to sign up as many as 7 million people in 2014, the first full year the law takes effect. The administration this week began what it called a \"tech surge,\" bringing in experts led by the administration's top economic aide Jeffrey Zients to analyze and fix the problems.\n\n\"I think what we learned is they're working hard to fix the problems,\" Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said after Wednesday's briefing.\n\nThe U.S. Health and Human Services Department will begin regular news briefings on Thursday to provide updates on \"the progress that's being made and on the efforts that are being undertaken, both to address the technical problems and to make the whole experience for American consumers better,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said.\n\nHouse Democrats said there was no discussion in the briefing about whether the problems should lead to a delay of the individual requirement that every American have insurance or pay a tax penalty. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a delay would reduce enrollment significantly.\n\nREPUBLICANS DEMAND DELAY\n\nRepublicans, who have fought the healthcare law as an unwarranted extension of the federal government, said the requirement should be delayed until the problems with the rollout are resolved.\n\n\"With so many unanswered questions and the problems arising around this rollout, it doesn't make any sense to impose this one percent mandate tax on the American people,\" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly tried to derail or delay the healthcare law since taking control of the House in the 2010 elections. They demanded more answers on Wednesday about the scope of the problems.\n\nThree committees in the Republican-controlled House have announced investigations of the law's rollout, which Cantor described as \"nothing short of a debacle.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate\n\n1 of 12 Healthcare In America Is Already 'The Best In The World' One of the more positive sounding admonitions from health care reform opponents was that the United States had \"the best health care in the world,\" so why would you mess with it? Well, it's true that if you want the experience the pinnacle of medical care, you come to the United States. And if you want the pinnacle of haute cuisine, you go to Per Se. If you want the pinnacle of commercial air travel, you get a first class seat on British Airways. Now, naturally, you wouldn't let just anyone mess with someone's tasting menu or state-of-the-art air-beds. But like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody. The costs are prohibitively high, the access is prohibitively exclusive, and the resources are prohibitively scarce. What do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get? Well, at the time of the health care reform debate, they were participating in a system that was, by all objective measurements, overpriced and underperforming -- if you were lucky enough to be participating in it. As anyone who's fortunate enough to have employer based health care or unfortunate enough to have a pre-existing condition can tell you, health care for ordinary people already involved all of those things that we were told would be a feature of the Affordable Care Act -- long waits, limited choice, and rationing. When the Commonwealth Fund rated health care systems by nation , the top marks in the surveyed categories went to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Ezra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care. Our delivery system underperforms, too. 'Even when access and equity measures are not considered, the U.S. ranks behind most of the other countries on most measures. With the inclusion of primary care physician survey data in the analysis, it is apparent that the U.S. is lagging in adoption of national policies that promote primary care, quality improvement, and information technology.'\" Share this slide:\n\nGetty", "article_metadata": {"description": "By David Morgan and Mark Felsenthal                 WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The contractors for the  government's troubled healthcare ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-10-24 20:18:00 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "By David Morgan and Mark Felsenthal                 WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The contractors for the  government's troubled healthcare ...", "title": "Manchin: 'Let's Get Together And Fix Things'", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/23/joe-manchin-individual-mandate_n_4152816.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1423593/images/o-JOE-MANCHIN-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostPol", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1423593/images/o-JOE-MANCHIN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "By David Morgan and Mark Felsenthal                 WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The contractors for the  government's troubled healthcare ...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Manchin: 'Let's Get Together And Fix Things'"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-23 20:18:00 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4152816", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "health care enrollment,joe manchin individual mandate,obamacare,Mark Pryor,reuters,individual mandate,Jeanne Shaheen,Joe Manchin,health care,Barack Obama", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "health care enrollment,joe manchin individual mandate,obamacare,Mark Pryor,reuters,individual mandate,Jeanne Shaheen,Joe Manchin,health care,Barack Obama", "published_time": "2013-10-23 20:18:00 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-12-23 05:12:02 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0f7\"", "article_summary": "Ezra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care.\nBut like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody.\nWhat do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get?\nWhen the Commonwealth Fund rated health care systems by nation , the top marks in the surveyed categories went to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Netherlands.\nOne Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, said he would join a Republican effort to delay the so-called \"individual mandate,\" that requires people to buy insurance or face a tax penalty."}
