In fact, some are spending millions lobbying representatives in hopes the tax will eventually be struck down.\n\nAccording to a late-January report by the Center for Responsive Politics, lobbyists for the medical device makers handed out nearly $33 million in the form of campaign contributions and donations to support groups, the highest amount lobbied by the group since 1998.\n\nDevice maker Medtronic led the year, spending more than $5 million on lobbying efforts.\n\nPart of the Affordable Care Act, the medical device tax placed a 2.3 percent levy on the sale of any medical devices, which the manufacturer or the importer must pay to the Internal Revenue Service. Supporters say the tax helps pay for reforms, while opponents say the tax will tighten cash flow for device makers, hurting their abilities to innovate.\n\nAccording to the Center, much of the lobbying has been in the form of campaign donations for politicians who have backed various bills to repeal the tax. Those include Democrats as well as Republicans, who are most outspoken about killing the tax.\n\nAll of Medtronic\u2019s top donors were Minnesota politicians, including Democratic Sens. Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nHere\u2019s the list of companies in the medical device lobby, along with the amount each spent in 2014:\n\nClient Affiliate Total Client Affiliate Total Abiomed Inc - $80,000 Academy of Radiology Research - $140,000 Accuray Inc - $170,000 AdvaMed - $2,360,000 Alere Inc - $889,000 Alliance Surgical Distributors - $30,000 American Neuromonitoring Assn - $200,000 American Orthotic & Prosthetic Assn - $200,000 Arrow International - $10,000 Arteriocyte Inc - $70,000 Baxter International Baxter Healthcare $2,820,000 Baxter International - $190,000 Becton, Dickinson & Co - $1,040,000 Biomet Inc - $60,000 Bone Growth Stimulator Coalition - $90,000 Boston Scientific Corp - $1,740,489 Breathe Technologies - $180,000 CCS Medical - $196,444 CliniComp International - $180,000 Cochlear Corp - $140,000 Cook Group - $1,140,000 Coqui RadioPharmaceuticals - $212,531 CR Bard Inc - $120,000 Cure Care - $380,000 CyberKnife Coalition - $105,000 Cyberonics Inc - $80,000 Derma Sciences - $180,000 DeRoyal Industries - $51,000 Direct Supply Inc - $90,000 Djo Inc - $200,000 Edwards Lifesciences - $890,000 Ekso Bionics - $120,000 Elekta Instruments - $1,345,000 FujiFilm Sonosite Inc $100,000 Globus Medical - $10,000 Gordian Medical Inc - $130,000 Health Industry Distributors Assn - $155,000 Healthcare Nutrition Council - $60,000 Hearing Industries Assn - $40,000 Heartware Inc - $110,000 Hill-Rom Holdings Hill-Rom Co $195,000 Hill-Rom Holdings - $360,000 Hollister Inc - $200,000 Hologic Inc - $240,000 Institut Merieux BioFire Defense $120,000 Institut Merieux BioFire Diagnostics $30,000 Intl Assn Med Equip Remark & Servicers - $40,000 Intl Contrast Ultrasound Society - $150,000 Intuitive Surgical - $265,000 Invacare Corp - $573,790 iWalk Inc - $170,000 Johnson & Johnson McNeil Consumer Healthcare $60,000 Kinetic Concepts Lifecell Corp $150,000 Masimo Corp - $80,000 Med-Care Diabetic & Medical Supplies - $390,000 Medical Device Competitiveness Coalition - $320,000 Medical Device Manufacturers Assn - $520,000 Medical Information Working Group - $420,000 Medtronic Inc - $5,310,000 Merit Medical Systems - $70,000 Mobilex USA - $160,000 National Disease Research Interchange - $120,000 Natl Coalition For Assistive/Rehab Tech - $162,000 Ohio Willow Wood - $40,000 Omeros Corp - $120,000 Orasure Technologies - $40,000 Orthocare Innovations - $60,000 Philips Electronics Philips Healthcare $220,000 PillGuard Medication Delivery Systems - $150,000 Pride Mobility Products - $240,000 sBioMed - $20,000 Semprus BioSciences - $60,000 Smith & Nephew - $1,740,000 Soluble Systems - $30,000 St Jude Medical - $635,000 Steris Corp - $490,000 Stryker Corp - $180,000 Temp Time Inc - $120,000 Trident USA Health Services - $90,000 Varian Medical Systems - $710,000 Vertos Medical - $8,000 VGM Group - $120,000 Viatronix Inc - $132,500 VJ Technologies - $70,000 Welch Allyn Inc - $327,084 Z-Medica - $70,000 Zimmer Holdings - $130,000 Zimmer Inc - $583,405\n\nSource: Center for Responsive Politics\n\nTwitter: @HenryPowderly", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/see-which-medical-device-companies-lobbied-most-2014", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Medtronic-wiki-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Lobbyists for the medical device makers handed out nearly $33 million in 2014 to politicians supporting bills to repeal the medical device tax.", "title": "See which medical device companies lobbied the most in 2014"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Medtronic-wiki-feature.gif"}, "description": "Lobbyists for the medical device makers handed out nearly $33 million in 2014 to politicians supporting bills to repeal the medical device tax.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "See which medical device companies lobbied the most in 2014"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Medical device makers aren\u2019t sitting quietly as Congressional lawmakers debate the medical device tax.
