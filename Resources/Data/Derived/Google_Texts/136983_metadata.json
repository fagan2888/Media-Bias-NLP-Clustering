Nothing except the president\u2019s pen \u2014 or in this case, his keyboard \u2014 was necessary to postpone the law\u2019s mandate that all American businesses provide health insurance for their employees.\n\nThe move sent shockwaves through the media, and raised questions about whether the White House had the legal authority to rewrite major pieces of legislation and regulatory policy on the fly.\n\nPerhaps that move shouldn\u2019t have been so surprising. On a smaller scale, this sort of thing happens almost every day.\n\n\u201cDark matter has completely changed the game,\u201d Clyde Wayne Crews, a vice president of policy for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told Watchdog Radio. \u201cWhen you start digging into it, you see that Congress really has no idea what the scope of this stuff is.\u201d\n\nCrews has spent years tracking federal regulations, but his most recent undertaking is an attempt to understand the scope of the dark matter regulatory state. The results are published in a new report published this week.\n\nThe numbers are staggering. There have been 777 executive orders issued since 1994, according to the Federal Register.\n\nBy comparison, there have been more than 500,000 informal \u201cpublic notices\u201d issued by regulatory agencies of the federal government during the same period of time.\n\nIn the world of astrophysics, dark matter is a theoretical type of matter that cannot be seen or otherwise detected with telescopes, but is believed to make up the majority of all substance in the universe. In much the same way, regulatory dark matter is difficult to detect or track, but accounts for the majority of all federal rules and regs.\n\nHere\u2019s how to understand what regulatory \u201cdark matter\u201d actually looks like, and how it comes into existence.\n\nFirst, Congress passes a law like the ACA. Within that law, Congress designates regulatory powers to certain federal agencies.\n\nFor example, the ACA included a new requirement that chain restaurants provide customers with nutritional information on menus. Congress wrote the broad parameters of that requirement into the text of the ACA, but left the details up to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nREAD MORE: Dispute menu regulations, Americans are still getting fatter\n\nThen there\u2019s things like the presidential decision in June 2013 to postpone the individual mandate for one full year. That\u2019s regulatory dark matter, completely disconnected from the traditional lawmaking process.\n\nIn making the decision to postpone the employer mandate, the administration cited \u201cthe complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively.\u201d\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t take the authority of the White House to create dark matter regulations. There are 438 federal agencies with the ability to make rules, and they can really crank them out. More than 2,600 have been issued just this year, Crews says.\n\nUnder the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, Congress established the process of public notice for proposed rulemaking, including the opportunity for public input and a 30-day period before rules becomes effective. But the APA\u2019s requirement of publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and allowing public comment does not apply to \u201cinterpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.\u201d\n\nIn other words, dark matter regulations are exempt from almost any oversight and have little public accountability. They are the product of \u201cpen and phone\u201d authority, Crews says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real breakdown in representative democracy, in my view,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Regulatory \"dark matter\" is difficult to detect or track, but accounts for the majority of all federal rules and regs.", "title": "Regulatory dark matter expands power of federal government - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/12/shutterstock_348090491.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/251104/regulatory-dark-matter-expands/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Accountability", "published_time": "2015-12-11T11:31:18+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Regulatory \"dark matter\" is difficult to detect or track, but accounts for the majority of all federal rules and regs.", "title": "Regulatory dark matter expands power of federal government - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/12/shutterstock_348090491.jpg"}, "creator": "@ericboehm87", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Regulatory \"dark matter\" is difficult to detect or track, but accounts for the majority of all federal rules and regs."}, "article_summary": "Here\u2019s how to understand what regulatory \u201cdark matter\u201d actually looks like, and how it comes into existence.\nIn much the same way, regulatory dark matter is difficult to detect or track, but accounts for the majority of all federal rules and regs.\nThat\u2019s regulatory dark matter, completely disconnected from the traditional lawmaking process.\n\u201cDark matter has completely changed the game,\u201d Clyde Wayne Crews, a vice president of policy for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told Watchdog Radio.\nIn the world of astrophysics, dark matter is a theoretical type of matter that cannot be seen or otherwise detected with telescopes, but is believed to make up the majority of all substance in the universe."}
