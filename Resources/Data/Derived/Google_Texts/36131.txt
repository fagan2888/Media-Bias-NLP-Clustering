The 16-day government shutdown has been shutdown. The fed is back up and running and hundreds of thousands of non-essential furloughed government workers (a measly 17 percent of the massive Republic) are back on the non-essential job. Life is rough for them. They’ve had to give up their two-week Netflix binges and will still get paid (some of them twice!) for their non-essential, non-work. Sigh. Now they know what welfare is like.

The grand finale of the shutdown theatre ended with a typical Capitol Hill compromise in which the Democrats got everything they wanted, with the added bonus that the GOP is being blamed for a shutdown no one would have noticed had the liberals not made it seem like the end of life as we know it.

There was a food stamp riot at a Wal-Mart in Mississippi. Chaos ensued when a computer “glitch” caused EBT cards to stop working temporarily, and the shelves were wiped clean. People were outraged that these people were taking what they didn’t pay for…Uhm.

Turns out German people are rude, and there’s a reason for it: “The explanation is that the country’s centuries old divisions may make some feel like they are ‘surrounded by enemies.'” Arnold Schwarzenegger* is trying to break this stereotype by becoming both our friend and our president!

*Austrian, I know, but close enough.
