Because emergency initiatives such as the Federal Reserve\u2019s mass purchases of government securities, known as quantitative easing, operate outside the norm of traditional monetary and fiscal policy, he said, the government has created uncertainty in the business community that acts as a damper on economic growth.\n\nRELATED: AMERICAN INFRASTRUCTURE GETS A NEW WAKE-UP CALL\n\nNot so, said Summers, now a professor at Harvard. \u201cExpansionary fiscal policy is the right primary response to our current woes.\u201d\n\nWhile there was disagreement over how best to stimulate economic growth there appeared to be a rough consensus among economists that at the very least 2014 will be better than 2013.\n\nMartin Feldstein, Summers\u2019 colleague at Harvard and a former top economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan, summed up the sense of the economists at the meeting that \"2014 has a much better shot than we've had in the last several years of producing stronger growth.\"\n\nFollow Rob Garver on Twitter @rrgarver\n\nTop reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers warns that \u201cdisastrous\u201d federal spending cuts have been bad for the U.S. economy, and urges increased spending on infrastructure.", "title": "Summers: Infrastructure Spending Key to Economic Growth", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/06/Summers-Infrastructure-Spending-Key-Economic-Growth", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01062014_Larry_Summers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/06/Summers-Infrastructure-Spending-Key-Economic-Growth", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01062014_Larry_Summers.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers warns that \u201cdisastrous\u201d federal spending cuts have been bad for the U.S. economy, and urges increased spending on infrastructure.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1df4\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: AMERICAN INFRASTRUCTURE GETS A NEW WAKE-UP CALLNot so, said Summers, now a professor at Harvard.\nAt the annual meeting of the American Economic Association on Saturday, Taylor argued that the very kind of policy initiatives that Summers advocates, namely government-driven spending programs, are a main source of the problems facing the U.S. economy.\n\u201cExpansionary fiscal policy is the right primary response to our current woes.\u201dWhile there was disagreement over how best to stimulate economic growth there appeared to be a rough consensus among economists that at the very least 2014 will be better than 2013.\nFollow Rob Garver on Twitter @rrgarverTop reads from The Fiscal Times:\nBecause emergency initiatives such as the Federal Reserve\u2019s mass purchases of government securities, known as quantitative easing, operate outside the norm of traditional monetary and fiscal policy, he said, the government has created uncertainty in the business community that acts as a damper on economic growth."}
