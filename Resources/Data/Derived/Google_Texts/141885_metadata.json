It is a terror organisation,\u201d Erdogan told a group of reporters on his return from a visit to Afghanistan. \u201cIt would be wrong for the United States with whom we are friends and allies in Nato to talk openly and to expect us to say \u2018yes\u2019 to such a support to a terrorist organisation.\u201d\n\nErdogan\u2019s comments were reported by the state-run Anadolu agency on Sunday.\n\nIn Washington, the Texas senator Ted Cruz, a presumed candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, criticised President Barack Obama for not aiding the Kurdish fighters.\n\n\u201cWe have dropped a bomb here and a missile there, but it has been a photo-op foreign policy,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s opposition to arms transfers to the Kurdish forces, meanwhile, is hampering the US-led coalition\u2019s efforts to fight the extremists and further complicating relations between Turkey and Washington. The countries are involved in negotiations about Ankara\u2019s role with the US and Nato allies fighting the Islamic State group, which is attempting to capture Kobani.\n\nTurkey has demanded that the coalition widen its campaign against the militants by providing greater aid to Syrian rebels, who are battling both Isis and President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces. Turkey has so far provided sanctuary to an estimated 200,000 Syrians fleeing Kobani, and recently agreed to train and equip moderate Syrian rebel fighters trying to remove Assad from power.\n\nThe White House said President Barack Obama spoke to Erdogan on Saturday about the situation in Kobani and steps that could be taken to counter Isis advances.\n\n\u201cThe two leaders pledged to continue to work closely together to strengthen cooperation against [Isis],\u201d a statement said.\n\nFighting between the militants and the Kurdish fighters defending Kobani continued on Sunday. Mortar strikes hit the town, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Three mortars also fell on the Turkish side of the border, landing in an open field where they caused no injuries. On Saturday and Sunday, Isis appeared to be targeting the border crossing area, potentially in a bid to hamper Kobani\u2019s last link to the outside world.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thick smoke and flames from a fire rises following a strike in Kobani.

Several air strikes hit Kobani on Saturday evening. US-led warplanes launched 11 air strikes near Kobani on Saturday and Sunday, US Central Command said.\n\nThe flow of migrants into Turkey has intensified since Isis\u2019s push to take Kobani and cut access for Kurdish fighters to other areas of Syria they control. On Saturday, Isis fighters also weighed in on their attempts to take Kobani, arguing it was not a fight against the Kurds.\n\n\u201cWe came to establish the laws of God not to fight the Kurds,\u201d a fighter in army fatigues said on a video uploaded to YouTube. The video was uploaded by a user who appears to be embedded with the militants in Kobani. It appeared genuine and reflected Associated Press reporting.\n\nBut another fighter who appeared to be from a European country, judging from his accent in Arabic, described their aim \u201cto liberate the land from the fifth of the apostates, the PKK and others\u201d, referring to Kurdish secular fighters who are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim as apostates.\n\nThe fighter said the US-led coalition to fight the militant group was a sure sign of the justness of their cause.\n\n\u201cAs for the planes that shell us 24 hours, day and night, by God we say: they increase our faith, assuredness and steadfastness. We know we are on the right path because all the [non-believers] of the world have gathered against us.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos, visited one of the refugee camps set up in a school in the Turkish border town of Suruc. While 900,000 people have been registered as refugees in Turkey since the Syrian crisis began four years ago, \u201cthe reality is that the numbers are nearer to 1.6 million\u201d, Amos said.\n\n\u201cOf course countries have concerns about security, and about the impact on their economies and on essential services like health and education. But it\u2019s also a crisis with a huge human impact,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe international community has to continue to do all it can to find a political solution to this crisis.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "President calls Syrian Kurdish group \u2018a terrorist organisation\u2019 as US launches further air strikes against Isis at Kobani", "application-name": "The Guardian", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "President calls Syrian Kurdish group \u2018a terrorist organisation\u2019 as US launches further air strikes against Isis at Kobani", "title": "Turkey will not cooperate in US support for Kurds in Syria, says Erdogan", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/19/turkey-will-not-cooperate-us-support-kurds-erdogan", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/19/1413731059899/33fda7b8-a900-47ae-a921-828a8d734418-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=970efe4db769d0e50e724128e50db293", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2014/oct/19/turkey-will-not-cooperate-us-support-kurds-erdogan?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/19/turkey-will-not-cooperate-us-support-kurds-erdogan", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2014/oct/19/turkey-will-not-cooperate-us-support-kurds-erdogan?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/19/1413731059899/33fda7b8-a900-47ae-a921-828a8d734418-2060x1236.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2014/oct/19/turkey-will-not-cooperate-us-support-kurds-erdogan?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Turkey,US news,Islamic State,Kurds,Syria,Middle East and North Africa,World news,Obama administration,Nato,US foreign policy,US national security,US politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "World news", "tag": "Turkey,US news,Islamic State,Kurds,Syria,Middle East and North Africa,World news,Obama administration,Nato,US foreign policy,US national security,US politics", "published_time": "2014-10-19T16:04:01.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T21:42:01.000Z"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/19/1413731059899/33fda7b8-a900-47ae-a921-828a8d734418-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=f6da3a7113c98ff3a32fdc4cd625cf35", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Turkey,US news,Islamic State,Kurds,Syria,Middle East and North Africa,World news,Obama administration,Nato,US foreign policy"}, "article_summary": "Washington has said recently that it has engaged in intelligence sharing with Kurdish fighters and officials have not ruled out future arms transfers to the Kurdish fighters.\nOn Saturday, Isis fighters also weighed in on their attempts to take Kobani, arguing it was not a fight against the Kurds.\nIn Washington, the Texas senator Ted Cruz, a presumed candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, criticised President Barack Obama for not aiding the Kurdish fighters.\nThe flow of migrants into Turkey has intensified since Isis\u2019s push to take Kobani and cut access for Kurdish fighters to other areas of Syria they control.\nIt is a terror organisation,\u201d Erdogan told a group of reporters on his return from a visit to Afghanistan."}
