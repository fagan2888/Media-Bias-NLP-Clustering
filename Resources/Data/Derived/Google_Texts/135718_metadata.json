At just 27,000, the paltry Healthcare.gov enrollment total is even less than what some experts warned it would be earlier in the week, and way below what the White House estimated it needed for the law to be successful.

The enrollees could all squeeze into President Obama\u2019s law-school alma mater\u2019s football field, Harvard Stadium, with room to spare: 30,323 seats.\n\n2.
