One of the first motorists was none other than Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry, who tweeted a picture of the tunnel and said he was \"hyped\" for the opening.\n\nMoney for the $417 million fourth bore included $194 million from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, $124.6 million from Contra Costa County Measure J sales tax for transportation, $50 million in Bay Area bridge toll money, $20 million in state congestion funds, $19 million in state highway funds and $11 million in federal highway funds.\n\nThe fourth bore primarily will benefit motorists driving in the reverse commute direction -- eastbound in the morning from Oakland and westbound in the afternoon.\n\nBut the fourth bore will provide some travel benefits round the clock because it has a 10-foot-wide shoulder for stalled or crashed cars or emergency vehicles to use without blocking traffic. None of the older three bores have a traffic shoulder.\n\nThe fourth bore also has extensive safety features, including seven escape tunnels that connect to the third bore.\n\nAn invitation-only ribbon cutting was held Friday afternoon, but there will be no ceremony for the general public because of the limited space near the tunnel openings, Caltrans said.\n\nContact Denis Cuff at 925-943-8267.
