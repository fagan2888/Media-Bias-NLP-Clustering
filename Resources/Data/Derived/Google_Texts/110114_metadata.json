When you look at Hollywood, Berkley, there are communities where fifty percent of the kids are not vaccinated, and when you get to that point I think you really need to look at possibly eliminating or at least narrowing these exemptions,\u201d Mr. McCormack said, referring to state\u2019s laws that allow exemptions for parents that chose not to vaccinate their children for religious or philosophical reasons.\n\nMr. Maher argued that there is no scientific evidence to prove that people who get vaccinated have as robust an immune system as people who don\u2019t.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HBO talk show host Bill Maher said Friday that the media's attitude toward vaccine skeptics reminded him of the \"don't ask any questions\" attitude he perceived leading up to the Iraq War.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "HBO talk show host Bill Maher said Friday that the media\u2019s attitude toward vaccine skeptics reminded him of the \u201cdon\u2019t ask any questions\u201d attitude he perceived leading up to the Iraq War.", "title": "Bill Maher: media treat vaccines like Iraq War: \u2018Don\u2019t ask any questions\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/7/bill-maher-media-treat-vaccines-like-iraq-war-dont/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/02/bill-maher.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/02/bill-maher.jpg", "description": "HBO talk show host Bill Maher said Friday that the media's attitude toward vaccine skeptics reminded him of the \"don't ask any questions\" attitude he perceived leading up to the Iraq War.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bill Maher: media treat vaccines like Iraq War: \u2018Don\u2019t ask"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Health Medical Pharma, Bill Maher, Marianne Williamson"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m not an anti-vaxxer,\u201d Mr. Maher clarified, but added, \u201cThe attitude of the media this week kind of pissed me off.\nHBO talk show host Bill Maher said Friday that the media\u2019s attitude toward vaccine skeptics reminded him of the \u201cdon\u2019t ask any questions\u201d attitude he perceived leading up to the Iraq War.\nMr. Maher argued that there is no scientific evidence to prove that people who get vaccinated have as robust an immune system as people who don\u2019t.\nIt was just a lot of \u2018shut the [expletive] up.\u2019 You know, it reminded me of the Iraq war, the first weeks \u2018just don\u2019t ask any questions,\u2019\u201d Mediaite reported.\nMs. Williamson explained that people are distrustful of the government and the pharmaceutical industry because they have been lied to in the past."}
