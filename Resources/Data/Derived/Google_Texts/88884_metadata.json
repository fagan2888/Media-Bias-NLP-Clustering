The piece is an informative and important piece of advocacy regarding women\u2019s health and women\u2019s options in the fight against cancer. (For the gossips among us, it is also skillfully timed, debuting the same day as Jolie Pitt\u2019s film Unbroken became available on DVD and streaming.)\n\nIn a way, her op-ed functions as a sequel to her previous 2013 Times op-ed, \u201cMy Medical Choice,\u201d where she went into detail about testing positive for the BRCA1 gene. The combination of that positive test, which means that she runs a high risk of having cancers (87% chance of breast cancer, 56% of ovarian cancer), along with her family history (her mother died at 56 from ovarian cancer), led to her choice of a double mastectomy at the time. It was shocking to hear about this choice from one of the world\u2019s leading sex symbols, but it\u2019s a choice that women have been facing since the genetic link was discovered: in 2008, television writer Jessica Queller released a memoir called Pretty Is What Changes: Impossible Choices, the Breast Cancer Gene, and How I Defied my Destiny, about how her positive BRCA gene test changed her life.\n\nAs I read Jolie Pitt\u2019s latest op-ed, I wondered about whether or not her choice was one that\u2019s possible for the average American patient running the gamut of private insurance. Is her quality of health care different from the rest of us? While money is clearly not a problem for Jolie Pitt, it\u2019s \u201cnot the issue,\u201d according to James Burgess, Professor of Health Policy and Management at the Boston University School of Public Health, where he is the director of the health economics program.\n\n\u201cIf somebody had a mother go through what her mother went through, and Jolie Pitt\u2019s positive genetic testing for the BRCA gene, pretty much anybody in that situation would be getting the blood test that the actress was getting. What\u2019s going on is pretty specialized,\u201d Burgess told me over the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s about educating the public about the available testing. We want the people who need testing the most to get testing.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember, if the Affordable Care Act goes through the Supreme Court, we will get to a more equal system of health care, or a more equitable system,\u201d Burgess said, suggesting that that the ACA will make screening for disease more accessible for the public. \u201cIn general, [with] the U.S. health care system, once we get on the case, and on the horse, we spend a lot of resources on a case.\u201d\n\nBurgess said that Jolie Pitt\u2019s advocacy makes these issues \u201cmore vivid to people,\u201d because of her celebrity. \u201cBut again, to draw large conclusions from it is something that we academics don\u2019t love doing,\u201d he noted. Jolie Pitt is taking \u201crelatively austere\u201d approaches, he said, whereas other people \u201cmay take their chances until they saw something.\u201d\n\nWhile Jolie Pitt may be on the leading edge of women\u2019s health, it was a pleasant surprise to talk to Burgess and to realize that preventative health care, particularly in the United States, can, should, and will be for everybody. Women who are in similar positions can and do have access to the testing and resources that can lead to tough choices about how to combat the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible to remove all risk, and the fact is I remain prone to cancer,\u201d Jolie Pitt concluded, in a moment of moving honesty. She is clear-eyed about what she wants the future to hold: \u201cI know my children will never have to say, \u2018Mom died of ovarian cancer.'\u201d Clearly, she is doing the work to be informed and prepared, and by sharing her journey in public, she\u2019s informing women about their health options regarding a deadly disease.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/flavorwire-2016/img/ms-icon-144x144.png", "description": "We talk to James Burgess about whether Angelina Jolie Pitt's health care op-ed is a story that will impact the health of average women.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Flavorwire", "description": "On Tuesday, Angelina Jolie Pitt wrote an op-ed, \u201cDiary of a Surgery,\u201d in The New York Times, explaining why she had \u201ca laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\u201d \u2014 or in \u2026", "title": "Why Cancer Screening Is For Everyone: A Health Economist on Angelina Jolie Pitt\u2019s \u2018NY Times\u2019 Op-Ed", "url": "http://flavorwire.com/511109/a-health-economist-on-angelina-jolie-pitts-ny-times-op-ed", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/la-et-mg-angelina-jolie-directing-unbroken-dujour-brad-pitt-20141119.jpeg?w=1200", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/la-et-mg-angelina-jolie-directing-unbroken-dujour-brad-pitt-20141119.jpeg?w=640"}, "site": "@flavorwire", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@flavorwire"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://flavorwire.com/feed;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/5af1ea63c8deb1c43404735fce2401ed?s=16", "p": {"domain_verify": "d14fb4bfdccbc45ec9b9cf467123426d"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "application-name": "Flavorwire", "google-site-verification": "LEPlfEAe87ZYYO-w5cvjSSIHi6-qE8orVaxsi6TkE9Y", "keywords": "activism, celebrity, angelina jolie, angelina jolie pitt, brca, cancer, ovarian cancer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-03-25T16:00:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-25T16:55:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Angelina Jolie, James Burgess, cancer, ovarian cancer, The New York Times, Angelina Jolie Pitt, Unbroken"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0bd\"", "article_summary": "(For the gossips among us, it is also skillfully timed, debuting the same day as Jolie Pitt\u2019s film Unbroken became available on DVD and streaming.)\n\u201cIt is not possible to remove all risk, and the fact is I remain prone to cancer,\u201d Jolie Pitt concluded, in a moment of moving honesty.\nIs her quality of health care different from the rest of us?\nOn Tuesday, Angelina Jolie Pitt wrote an op-ed, \u201cDiary of a Surgery,\u201d in The New York Times, explaining why she had \u201ca laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\u201d \u2014 or in layman\u2019s terms, the removal of her ovaries and fallopian tubes.\nIn a way, her op-ed functions as a sequel to her previous 2013 Times op-ed, \u201cMy Medical Choice,\u201d where she went into detail about testing positive for the BRCA1 gene."}
