Michael Wright's direction.\n\nJane shrugs, but she doesn't disagree \u2014 even though, thanks to a drunken one-night stand after a party in their native Dublin, she's told Tim he is indeed an expectant father. Now 32, still single and hearing the ticking of the biological clock, Jane has decided to go ahead and have the baby.\n\nGiven the class differences between Jane and Tim \u2014 she's a lawyer and he's a house painter \u2014 Jane assumes she'll be raising the child alone.\n\nShe assumes wrong. \"Let yourself see that maybe this was meant to happen,\" Tim urges. \"Give me a chance.\"\n\nIf you're rolling your eyes about now, you've got company in Jane herself. \"God, you are so corny,\" she tells Tim, as she continues to resist his plea. And while Jane isn't all wrong, that doesn't mean she's right.\n\nWhen both the world and the stage are filled with so much ironically cool snark, a quest like Tim's \u2014 or the moving and equally quixotic efforts of a band of misfits to save the soul of a damaged war veteran, as in Next Act Theatre's just-opened \"Welcome Home, Jenny Sutter\" \u2014 may indeed seem corny.\n\nBut such journeys can also be revolutionary. And when this one is buoyed by onstage chemistry of the sort delivered by Wainwright and Gray \u2014 married in real life \u2014 it also feels satisfying and right.\n\nSmart, witty and good with words, Jane knows all about snark; an overworked subplot involving an ex-boyfriend has left her bitter and disappointed.\n\nBut as Gray has done before \u2014 her beautiful portrait of Sally in Chamber's 2008 \"Talley's Folly\" comes to mind \u2014 she also conveys the poignant, love-starved need of a closet romantic, hoping that life might offer her more even as she resigns herself to less.\n\nTim knows that Jane is clever in ways he'll never be; O'Reilly captures the mix of taciturn shyness and its obverse \u2014 nervous rambling volubility \u2014 in a man self-consciously aware of his limitations.\n\nHence Tim's cane, added in this production after Wainwright recently experienced an injury but barely used: It's a crutch, giving Tim something to do with his hands.\n\nWainwright not only channels Tim's awkwardness and his bluff efforts to hide it, but also the underlying vulnerability of a man softer and more easily hurt than he lets on, which makes one ache for him as he clumsily reaches out, heart in hand.\n\nNo wonder Jane is tempted to grab hold.\n\nBut even if she does, will the two of them find the strength they'll need to hold on?\n\nThat question gets answered after intermission, in a second act that includes two plot twists involving the baby; both come suddenly and the second feels particularly improbable.\n\nBoth unwittingly confirm what this beautifully acted production makes clear: The vital and believable conception in this play involves this odd couple's own inspiring struggle to grow together.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\n\"The Good\n\nFather\" continues through Oct. 12\n\nat the Broadway Theatre Center's Studio Theatre, 158 N.
