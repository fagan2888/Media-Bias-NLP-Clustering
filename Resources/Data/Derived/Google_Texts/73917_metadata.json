The company had previously projected growth of 3% to 4% for the year, but lowered its guidance last month citing the impact of the strengthening US dollar. The company's share price has lost about 16% of its value over the last 12 months.\n\nDespite its slowing revenue growth, Walmart continues to invest heavily in employee wages and e-commerce in an effort to stay competitive with Amazon.\n\nRelated: The Scary Truth Behind Walmart\u2019s Struggles\n\nBut the store's online sales growth has started to contract. Online revenue growth slowed to 12% for fiscal year 2016, following 22% growth for the previous year.\n\nThat has some investors concerned about Walmart's long-term prospects.\n\nBut O'Shea says that Walmart's e-commerce performance is still impressive.\n\n\"All in all, a $14-15 billion global online business is more than respectable, especially when it augments a brick-and-mortar business that generates around $470 billion in annual sales,\" O'Shea wrote.\n\nHe said that the stock market \"can be unfriendly,\" and investors are ignoring the long-term benefits of Walmart's e-commerce investments.\n\n\"We continue with our thesis that brick-and-mortar retailers that resist the move to at least have representative online businesses will find themselves in a precarious competitive position over the longer term,\" O'Shea wrote.\n\nTo reduce losses, Walmart is closing 269 underperforming stores globally, including 154 in the US. Analysts are expecting even more store closings down the road.\n\n\"Future thinning of the herd will occur at some point as more of the business moves online,\" O'Shea wrote.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.
