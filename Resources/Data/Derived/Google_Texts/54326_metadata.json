Five hours of golf\n\nThis past week, President Obama engaged in a lot of fun activities: He played pool and drank beer with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, visited the castle from the film \u201cBlank Check\u201d to rub elbows with a rich Austin crowd, dropped $300 on barbecue and even had time to sneak in a five-hour game of golf.\n\nOn Saturday, the president stopped at TPC Potomac Golf Club in Montgomery County, Maryland, to hit some balls on the championship course with three powerful friends.\n\nHis golf partners included White House aide Marvin Nicholson, ESPN host Mike Wilbon and co-founder of the investment firm Silver Lake Partners Glenn Hutchins.\n\nUndoubtedly, the outing was a pleasant one and President Obama likely accomplished his goal of avoiding Washington. The topics of conversation probably ranged from LeBron James to technology investments and maybe even to some light White House gossip. One can\u2019t imagine that any of the president\u2019s friendly guests brought up the border crisis or his impending lawsuit.\n\nEarlier on in the week, Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rep Henry Cuellar (D-TX), to name a few \u2014 sternly criticized Obama for refusing to visit the Texas border to address the crisis there during his visit to the state.\n\nObama defended his decision, saying he didn\u2019t want to engage in \u201ctheater.\u201d Clearly, golf is more his speed.\n\nIt looks like the president\u2019s summer of leisure will only continue; the Obamas will vacation for 15 days on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts in the middle of August for their longest summer break since the president took office. According to ABC News, the getaway home they\u2019re renting is worth millions. More importantly, though, the president has four golf courses to choose from.\n\nIronically, Obama complained Thursday about his do-nothing Congress, claiming that he\u2019s the only one \u201cdoing [his] job.\u201d Perhaps someone on his staff should tell him that golfing isn\u2019t a job requirement.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "This past week, President Obama engaged in a lot of fun activities: He played pool and drank beer with Colorado Gov.
