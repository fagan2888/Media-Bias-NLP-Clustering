But you\u2019d think that with victory secured, they\u2019d ease up on traditional marriage supporters, maybe go back to pretending they\u2019re journalists.\n\nBut no. On FNC\u2019s MediaBuzz, host Howard Kurtz asked his panel about it, noting that \u201cI can't remember another time in my career where I felt that coverage has been so one sided for a position that until three years ago Barack Obama held and until two years ago Hillary Clinton held, which is they were for traditional marriage.\u201d\n\nNational Review\u2019s Jim Geraghty cut right to the chase saying:\n\nBut on this issue press has decided that one side is effectively illegitimate, that one perspective is effectively evil. They\u2019re be neutral on all kinds of issues \u2013 sharia law, ISIS, the Castro regime in Cuba. We\u2019re not going to take a side on that one, we\u2019re not going to say one side is evil on this one, but if you oppose two men getting married or two women getting married we will call that out as evil.\n\nYep. And then dismiss you. Discussing the exclusion of dissenting opinions in reports on the issue, liberal NPR political correspondent Mara Liasson said, settled saw and settled beliefs \u2013 do we have a white supremacist on every single time we talk about a civil rights issue? No.\u201d\n\nGeraghty wasn\u2019t having it. Noting that \u201csomething in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 percent\u201d of Americans oppose gay marriage, he said to Liasson, \u201cYou just compared that 30 to 40 percent to white supremacists.\u201d Liasson tried to weasel out and ended up agreeing that it isn\u2019t hard to find opponents of gay marriage.\n\nBut increasingly, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to hear when we call for balance on gay issues: \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have to include the perspectives of Nazis, serial killers, the Mongol hordes or any other reviled, anachronistic group,\u201d so why bother with traditionalists?\n\nDuring the conversation, Kurtz wondered if \u201cdo some people feel marginalized by the media culture and the way these [issues] are approached?\u201d To which the only proper response is, \u201cYa think?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "If nothing else, the media\u2019s triumphalism over the SCOTUS gay \u201cmarriage\u201d decision proves they\u2019re sore winners.
