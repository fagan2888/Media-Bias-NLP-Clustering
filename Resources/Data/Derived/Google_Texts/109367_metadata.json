Yet unlike the Schiavo drama in Florida, the 33-year-old emergency medical technician made her wishes known to her husband Erick, who is also a paramedic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our decision that we didn\u2019t want to live in that condition,\u201d Munoz told The Washington Post in a telephone interview from his wife\u2019s hospital room.\n\nAlthough Munoz says a doctor pronounced his wife brain-dead, administrators at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, say the pregnant patient has not been officially declared brain dead and remains hospitalized with a serious condition. \u201cWe are following the law of the state of Texas,\u201d hospital spokeswoman J.R. Labbe said. \u201cThis is not a difficult decision for us. We are following the law.\u201d\n\nYet, three legal experts \u2013 including two who helped write the law \u2013 say otherwise.\n\n\u201cThis patient is neither terminally nor irreversibly ill,\u201d Robert Fine, clinical director of the office of clinical ethics and palliative care for Baylor Health Care System, told the Associated Press. \u201cUnder Texas law, this patient is legally dead.\u201d\n\nUnder the Texas Advance Directives Act, \u201cA person may not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient.\u201d\n\nYet, Tom Mayo, a Southern Methodist University law professor, said he didn\u2019t think the law applied to this particular case, but offered a possible explanation for the hospital\u2019s refusal to comply with family wishes. Were the hospital to pull life support for Munoz, they might face exposure to criminal and civil liability under the law. But he also noted that \u201cmost medical decisions\u201d carry some liability exposure for hospitals and doctors.\n\nThe third expert, Robert Fine, clinical director of the office of clinical ethics and palliative care for Baylor Health Care System, says the hospital is dead wrong. \u201cThis patient is neither terminally nor irreversibly ill,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder Texas law, this patient is legally dead.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Munoz says that although legal action remains a possibility he\u2019s interested in publicizing the case further to possibly clarify Texas law on the matter. \u201cIf anything good is to come of this, we want to inform people,\u201d Munoz said. The father of a 14-year-old boy, Munoz says he continues to endure a \u201croller coast of emotions\u201d but remains faithful as he sits by his wife\u2019s bedside, dead or alive.\n\nLikewise, Ernest Machado told The Dallas Morning News he wants the hopsital to pull life support. \"All we want is to let her rest, to let her go to sleep,\" he said. \"What they\u2019re doing serves no purpose.\"\n\nDuring the past 30 years, some 19 similar cases have been recorded, though only two babies survived to develop normally.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marlise munoz, texas right to die law, texas right to live law, texas brain dead patient, brain dead pregnant", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Marlise Munoz, a pregnant woman deemed brain-dead by at least one doctor, remains on life support as a Texas hospital cites state law.", "title": "Pregnant Texas Woman, Marlise Munoz, Left Brain-Dead On Life Support", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pregnant-texas-woman-marlise-munoz-left-brain-dead-life-support-legal-experts-claim-hospital-266449", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/06/texas-hospital-keeps-brain-dead-pregnant-woman-life-support.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marlise Munoz, a pregnant woman deemed brain-dead by at least one doctor, remains on life support as a Texas hospital cites state law.", "title": "Pregnant Texas Woman, Marlise Munoz, Left Brain-Dead On Life Support", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pregnant-texas-woman-marlise-munoz-left-brain-dead-life-support-legal-experts-claim-hospital-266449", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/06/texas-hospital-keeps-brain-dead-pregnant-woman-life-support.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/06/texas-hospital-keeps-brain-dead-pregnant-woman-life-support.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-01-06T17:47:57-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-06T17:47:54-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Marlise Munoz, a pregnant woman deemed brain-dead by at least one doctor, remains on life support as a Texas hospital cites state law."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0077\"", "article_summary": "Marlise Munoz, 33, remains on life support as a Texas hospital refused to pull the plug on the pregnant woman.\nWere the hospital to pull life support for Munoz, they might face exposure to criminal and civil liability under the law.\nLikewise, Ernest Machado told The Dallas Morning News he wants the hopsital to pull life support.\n\u201cWe are following the law of the state of Texas,\u201d hospital spokeswoman J.R.
