Monitoring these key steps in the treatment process has proved so effective, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania used this same tool to examine how patients with another chronic disease, hepatitis C, are faring within the U.S. health care system. Among the news, they discovered less than 10 percent of people infected with hepatitis C \u2014 330,000 of nearly 3.5 million people \u2014 were cured by antiviral hepatitis C treatment. \u201cThese data will help identify key deficits in chronic [hepatitis C virus or HCV] care that will be important for the development of programs to improve diagnosis, linkage to care, and management of this disease,\u201d wrote the authors in their study published in PLOS ONE.\n\nWill New Drugs Increase The Cure Rate?\n\nFinding the holes in any plan is unpleasant though important work, and it is especially necessary when it comes to health care. To understand where things stood for people with hepatitis C, the researchers of the current study dug through available data to estimate the number of people at each of seven steps along the way of the treatment cascade: infected with chronic HCV; diagnosed and aware of their infection; found access to outpatient care; infection confirmed; liver fibrosis staged by biopsy; prescribed treatment; and achieved sustained virologic response.\n\nTo begin, the team searched medical databases for articles concerning HCV in the U.S. published between January 2003 and July 2013. After identifying 9,581 articles, the researchers isolated 10 that met their analytical needs. Next, they estimated the number of people at each of these seven steps in the treatment cascade:\n\nNumber of people with chronic hepatitis C infection\u20143.5 million\n\nDiagnosed and aware of their infection\u20141.7 million (50% of those with infection)\n\nThose with access to outpatient care 1.5 million (43% of those with infection)\n\nHepatitis C RNA confirmed\u2014950,000 (27% of those with infection)\n\nDisease staged by liver biopsy\u2014580,000 (17% of those with infection)\n\nPrescribed treatment\u2014550,000 (16% of those with infection)\n\nAchieved sustained virologic response\u2014330,000 (9% of those with infection)\n\n\"There are many people who don't know that they have the infection, don't have access to hepatitis C care and medications, and who haven't been treated,\u201d said Dr. Baligh Yehia, an assistant professor of Medicine in Penn's division of Infectious Diseases and the study's first author. \u201cThis information will be useful for ensuring better access to hepatitis c care and treatment in the coming years.\"\n\nThe Food & Drug Administration recently approved Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), an oral drug that was both faster acting and had fewer side effects than the current treatment options. In clinical trials, it cured 90 percent of patients with HCV in 12 weeks. Other drugs are expected to gain FDA approval within the year.\n\nSource: Yehia BR, Schranz AJ, Umscheid CA, Lo Re, V.
