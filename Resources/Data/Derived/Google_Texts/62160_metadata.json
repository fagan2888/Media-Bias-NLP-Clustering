A new study shows the 2010 financial reform law known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act simply made \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d even bigger and increased the likelihood of greater risk and bailouts.\n\nThe paradoxes of bad policy are legend. We\u2019re still living through the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d that was supposed to drive health costs down but is instead costing more for everyone. Even the dietary practices meant to eliminate fat consumption are the very reason we\u2019re getting larger.\n\nLikewise, the sweeping law that was supposed to \u201creform\u201d America\u2019s financial institutions after the 2008 financial panic is proving its critics accurate.\n\nFirst, named after two of its now-retired proponents, Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the law was clearly established on statist principles \u2013 the government knows best.\n\nSecond, with a grandiose purpose that\u2019s so broad it lacks only the cure to Ebola, the expanse ensured collapse under its own weight. The law\u2019s preamble laid out its lofty goals: \u201cTo promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end \u2018too big to fail\u2019, to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.\u201d\n\nThird, this legislative web came in response to the \u201cGreat Recession.\u201d But bad government policies induced the risky behavior in the first place, and beefing up those policies was clearly the wrong solution.\n\nRemember, the most basic goal of Dodd-Frank was to prevent the increasingly prevalent consolidation of banks and lending institutions. However, the Harvard study aggregates hard data demonstrating the destructive effects of these new regulations on small community banks, which were eaten alive by compliance costs that followed a new mountain of regulations. \u201c[Larger] banks are better suited to handle heightened regulatory burdens than are smaller banks,\u201d the study notes, \u201ccausing the average costs of community banks to be higher.\u201d\n\nThat resulted in many more community banks being swallowed by large ones.\n\nForbes writer Carrie Sheffield explains, \u201c[T]he number of community banks fell by 40 percent since 1994, and their share of U.S. banking assets fell by more than half \u2013 from 41 percent to 18 percent. In contrast, the biggest banks saw their share of assets rise from 18 percent to 46 percent. And while the number of community banks had already declined before the crisis, since the second quarter of 2010 \u2013 Dodd-Frank\u2019s passage \u2013 community banks have lost market share at a rate double what they did between Q2 2006 and Q2 2010: 12 percent vs. 6 percent.\u201d\n\nStudy authors Marshall Lux and Robert Greene combed through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) data to observe, \u201cCommunity banks service a disproportionately large amount of key segments of the U.S. commercial bank lending market \u2013 specifically, agricultural, residential mortgage, and small business loans.\u201d\n\nDespite a 50% decline in total banking assets over the last two decades, community lenders provide 77% of agricultural loans and over 50% of small business loans. These smaller institutions serve as the lifeline of the working-man\u2019s industry.\n\nThese smaller banks are critical to farmers, for example, thanks to their ability to personalize loans to fit longer agricultural cycles and weather uncertainties. Larger banks more often reject lending applications or offer stiffer terms.\n\nOn the real estate front, the default rate in 2013 for borrowers securing loans for a family residence through a community bank was 3.47%, while larger banks owned a default rate of 10.42%. Those local relationships pay off in the area of accountability.\n\nWith the burden of regulation came the hefty price tag. Who\u2019s paying it?\n\nThe middle-class consumer is, through reduced bank services and increased fees.\n\nThe data is extensive and conclusive: Dodd-Frank is a bad law and should be repealed. The GOP-led legislative branch is moving to \u201cchip away\u201d at the choking regulations. But will the changes benefit the too-big-to-fail banks or work to assist the too-little-to-lobby?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dodd-Frank merely expanded the policy it claimed it would end.", "csrf-token": "r/xNsvR/7uRcflmXscJytqXgoiH6nooXh2CrR8UaqXg=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Dodd-Frank merely expanded the policy it claimed it would end.", "title": "Too Big to Fail vs. Too Little to Lobby", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/33208", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2015-02-17-45a97930.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce74e\"", "article_summary": "The data is extensive and conclusive: Dodd-Frank is a bad law and should be repealed.\n\u201c[Larger] banks are better suited to handle heightened regulatory burdens than are smaller banks,\u201d the study notes, \u201ccausing the average costs of community banks to be higher.\u201dThat resulted in many more community banks being swallowed by large ones.\nThese smaller banks are critical to farmers, for example, thanks to their ability to personalize loans to fit longer agricultural cycles and weather uncertainties.\nLikewise, the sweeping law that was supposed to \u201creform\u201d America\u2019s financial institutions after the 2008 financial panic is proving its critics accurate.\nHowever, the Harvard study aggregates hard data demonstrating the destructive effects of these new regulations on small community banks, which were eaten alive by compliance costs that followed a new mountain of regulations."}
