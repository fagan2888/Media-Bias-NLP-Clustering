Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, tweeted about a lawsuit filed by Senate Democrats challenging a House decision to adjourn the regular legislative session early.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit reads like it was researched and drafted by Sen Joyner \u2026 and spell checked by Sen Bullard,\u201d Gaetz wrote, referring to Senate Minority Leader Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, and Sen. Dwight Bullard, D-Miami. Joyner and Bullard are African-Americans, and the tweet caused an uproar that even led House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, to say he didn\u2019t condone Gaetz\u2019s post.\n\n\u201cHe is an agitator, yes, but not a racist,\u201d Crisafulli tweeted. \u201cPlease accept my apology to those offended.\u201d\n\nBut Joyner issued a lengthy statement Friday morning that described Gaetz\u2019s tweet as racist.\n\n\u201cAnd so while the speaker may try his best to walk back the motive of his member, he cannot walk back the 140 characters of Rep. Gaetz\u2019s racist barb,\u201d Joyner said in the statement. \u201cHis words are the kind I have fought against my entire life, the relic of days through which I lived and hope never to live through again.\u201d\n\nIn the apology Friday, Gaetz indicated his tweet was related to opposition to a health-coverage expansion under the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.\n\nThe state House and Senate are locked in a budget battle stemming, at least in part from a Senate proposal to use federal Medicaid money to expand coverage.\n\n\u201cMy criticisms of ObamaCare Expansion and it\u2019s supporters are based solely on the facts,\u201d Gaetz tweeted Friday. \u201cDeeply sorry if anyone read more into it than that.\u201d\n\n(The News Service of Florida contributed to this report.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "A state representative for Florida is apologizing for a tweet that drew criticism over possible racial undertones.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://miami.cbslocal.com/2015/05/01/florida-representative-apologizes-for-controversial-tweet/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/housephotooriginal5369.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/housephotooriginal5369.jpg?w=1500", "height": 1081}, "type": "article", "description": "A state representative for Florida is apologizing for a tweet that drew criticism over possible racial undertones.", "title": "Florida Representative Apologizes For Controversial Tweet"}, "twitter": {"site": "CBSmiami", "image": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/housephotooriginal5369.jpg?w=1500", "description": "A state representative for Florida is apologizing for a tweet that drew criticism over possible racial undertones.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Florida Representative Apologizes For Controversial Tweet"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Miami's Best", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Miami", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbsmiami", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbsmiami"}, "keywords": "local, news, politics, affordable care act, florida politics, florida politics controversy, fort walton beach, health coverage expansion, matt gaetz, matt gaetz tweet, news service of florida, obamacare, racial, sen. dwight bullard, senate minority leader arthenia joyner, state rep. matt gaetz, steve crisafulli", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://miami.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0984ebcee75feff1a6ce7f3d00419048?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, florida politics, florida politics controversy, fort walton beach, health coverage expansion, matt gaetz, matt gaetz tweet, news service of florida, obamacare, racial, sen. dwight bullard, senate minority leader arthenia joyner, state rep. matt gaetz, steve crisafulli"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd269c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMy criticisms of ObamaCare Expansion and it\u2019s supporters are based solely on the facts,\u201d Gaetz tweeted Friday.\n\u201cThis lawsuit reads like it was researched and drafted by Sen Joyner \u2026 and spell checked by Sen Bullard,\u201d Gaetz wrote, referring to Senate Minority Leader Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, and Sen.
