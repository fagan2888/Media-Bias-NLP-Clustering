A lot, maybe 20, and I\u2019ve had them done from all over the country,\u201d she said, adding that one of her favorites is labeled \u201cTrue Blue.\u201d It is a scene of the Blue Ridge Mountains framed with pink dogwood flowers.\n\nBrown was helping out at the Black Square booth, one of 150 tattoo booths at the fifth annual Visionary Tattoo Arts Festival held at Convention Hall Saturday. The festival continues from noon to 8 p.m. today.\n\nWhile many visitors could be seen sporting tattoos on every visible skin surface, Charles Ignar of Sea Bright, who was waiting in line to enter the festival, said he has no tattoos and doesn\u2019t plan to get any.\n\n\u201cI came more for the atmosphere and not a tattoo,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are sideshows, a pin-up contest and burlesque shows today (Saturday) and music.\u201d\n\nGlenda Rojas of Newark said this is her first time at the festival.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to be here. I love tattoos and can\u2019t wait to see how people are using them to express themselves,\u201d said Rojas, who has several tattoos on her arms and legs.\n\nShe also expressed concern that people often get the wrong impression about people who have tattoos.\n\n\u201cI work for a restaurant and they don\u2019t discriminate based on whether an employee has a tattoo or not,\u201d she said. Still, Rojas said, she doesn\u2019t have any tattoos on her hands or face and can easily cover her arms and legs by wearing long sleeves or pants if necessary.\n\n\u201cBut I feel that people should be allowed to show off their body art if they choose,\u201d she said.\n\nJon Lane, the creative director of the festival, said this is the biggest show to date, in terms of the number of tattoo artists who signed on to participate.\n\n\u201cAsbury Park is a great place for the show, and this year we are also having our second annual Miss Asbury Park pinup contest,\u201d said Lane, who with partner, Shannon Moran, operate a tattoo and oddities shop called Triple Diamond Tattoo in Brooklyn. Among the oddities on display at their booth at the festival are a hairy tarantula and other large insects in glass shadow boxes.\n\nIn a nod to Asbury Park and its heyday, a large banner of Tillie, this one with three eyes, is the theme of the festival.\n\nif you go\n\nToday is the final day, from noon to 8 p.m. At 5 and 7:30 p.m., there are tattoo contests. Awards will be given for best tattoos in these categories: large color, large black-and-gray, chest/back, sleeved arm/leg, best overall and best of show. Shore Skate Team will give a demonstration at 2 p.m.; Gisella Rose is the featured sideshow at 3 p.m.; and Old City is the 4 p.m. sideshow. Daily admission is $20, or $40 for a three-day pass.
