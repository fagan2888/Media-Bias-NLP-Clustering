The Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office said an employee of FedEx is accused of selling collectible U.S. currency from a package that was never delivered.

According to the incident report, 51-year-old Roy Lee Graves sold vintage currency at Westchester Gold on Boiling Springs Road on Oct. 7. Graves reportedly received $3,850 from the sale.

The owner of Westchester Gold said while researching the value of the currency, he discovered it may have been stolen. Deputies said an investigation revealed the currency was in a FedEx shipment traveling from Flemington, NJ to Greenville but the package was never delivered.

The owner asked Graves to bring in the rest of the currency and he returned with more. Deputies said the estimated total value of the currency is $125,000.

When questioned, Graves admitted to selling the currency but said he bought it from an unknown male in the parking lot of a Spinx gas station.

Deputies said they asked Graves about the coincidence of him working for FedEx, the FedEx package going missing and him selling the contents of the package, but Graves told them he did not steal the package.

Graves is charged with obtaining property by false pretense and receiving stolen goods.
