(Newser) – A federal grand jury today indicted a 37-year-old Ohio man who police say tried to buy a 10-year-old "wife" for $400, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reports. Robert W. Thomas Jr. allegedly posted an ad seeking a young bride/sex slave online last month. "The younger the better, something in the 5-8 year-old range would be good," he wrote, according to the affidavit. "I want a young wife that I can train."

Police spotted the ad and responded, offering him a "slightly broke in 10-year-old girl," according to a Fox 8 report. That was good enough for Thomas, but when he arrived to make the deal he found police waiting instead. Police later searched his home, seizing his computer, sexual paraphernalia, and weapons—including a grenade launcher, according to WCPO 9. The affidavit says he later admitted to receiving child porn. He also allegedly planned to shoot child porn of his own with the bride he bought, the Canton Repository adds.
