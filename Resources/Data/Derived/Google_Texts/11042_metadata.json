State of Wisconsin and St. Croix County, which deals with the important question of what constitutes the \u201crelevant parcel\u201d for determining whether a restriction on the use of property violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause.\n\nDonor-supported PLF is the leading watchdog organization that litigates for limited government and property rights, in courts nationwide. PLF attorneys represent Donna Murr and her siblings Joseph Murr, Michael Murr, and Peggy Heaver. They have been barred from developing a vacant lot that they own along the St. Croix River, in St. Croix County, Wisconsin \u2014 simply because they also happen to own a neighboring lot with a recreational cabin on it. PLF attorneys represent Donna Murr and her siblings without charge, as with all PLF clients. Today\u2019s announcement builds on a powerful PLF record of reaching and winning at the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of our clients. Founded in 1973, PLF has won its last seven direct-representation cases at the High Court.\n\n\n\nThe Murr case joins another PLF case for property owners\u2019 rights \u2014 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes \u2014 which the court has also accepted for hearing this term.\n\n\n\n\u201cEveryone who values property rights should welcome the court\u2019s decision to hear this important case,\u201d said PLF Principal Attorney John Groen, regarding the granting of the Murr case. \u201cThis litigation asks whether government can get away with telling property owners, in essence, \u2018The more land you own, the less we\u2019ll allow you to use.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re challenging a practice that is all too common among land use regulators, where they tell a landowner she can\u2019t use her property, based on the excuse that she also happens to own a neighboring parcel. In other words, bureaucrats will treat two, legally distinct parcels, as if they were one unified parcel, so they can prohibit all development on one of the parcels without providing compensation as required by the Fifth Amendment.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs we will argue to the Supreme Court, this kind of regulatory sleight of hand cannot be permitted if the Constitution\u2019s Takings Clause is to be respected.\u201d\n\nCan government deny owners their constitutional rights based on how much land they own?\n\nPLF filed the petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court following the Wisconsin judiciary\u2019s rejection of the Murr family\u2019s takings claim. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals proclaimed a \u201crule that contiguous property under common ownership is considered as a whole regardless of the number of parcels contained therein.\u201d The court insisted on considering the Murrs\u2019 two lots as a single entity \u2014 even though they were acquired separately, at different times, and for different purposes.\n\n\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to review the appellate court\u2019s ruling.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis case offers the Supreme Court an opportunity to address one of the major recurrent issues in property law, called the \u2018relevant parcel\u2019 question,\u201d said Groen. \u201cThe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause requires compensation when government prohibits all economic use of private property. The Supreme Court has previously stated that courts must consider the \u2018parcel as a whole.\u2019 The \u2018relevant parcel\u2019 question asks: What is the whole parcel?\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the Murrs\u2019 case, the government argues that the whole parcel is both of their lots,\u201d Groen continued. \u201cCan government forbid the use of a separately created, legally distinct residential lot, and get away with paying no compensation, just because the adjoining lot is already developed and happens to be owned by the same family? By accepting this case, the Supreme Court has an opportunity to make it clear that government can\u2019t cut off landowners\u2019 constitutional rights based on how much land they own.\u201d\n\nThe Murr siblings are victims of a \u201ctaking\u201d \u2014 and an inventive government excuse for not compensating them\n\nThe ownership timeline in this case starts 55 years ago. In 1960, the Murr siblings\u2019 parents purchased a 1.25-acre waterfront lot (Lot F) in a large subdivision on the St. Croix River and built a family recreation cabin. They placed title to the parcel in their private plumbing company.\n\n\n\nThree years later, the parents purchased the adjacent parcel (Lot E), bought as a discrete and legal lot that was also created by the St. Croix Cove subdivision. That lot, also 1.25 acres, has remained vacant and was held for investment purposes.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1970s, new land use regulations limited development to the \u201cnet project area\u201d that was remaining after subtracting slope preservation zones, floodplains, road rights of way and wetlands. Although the vacant lot has almost half an acre of buildable area, the lot is still treated as \u201csubstandard\u201d because it has less than one acre of \u201cnet project area.\u201d However, the regulations also have a \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d that allows development of substandard lots that existed as \u201clots of record\u201d prior to adoption of the new regulations in 1976.\n\n\n\nHowever, the grandfather clause allowing development applies only to lots that are in separate ownership from abutting lands. The Murrs\u2019 lots are under common ownership because the Murrs\u2019 parents transferred ownership to their children in the mid-1990s.\n\n\n\nBecause of the common ownership of the adjoining lots, the lots were forced to merge and neither can be sold or developed as a separate parcel. If anyone other than the Murrs owned the vacant lot, it could be developed and sold under the grandfather clause.\n\n\n\nAfter being denied variances and special exceptions, the Murr siblings brought a claim for a regulatory taking of their property. Ruling against them, the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin held that the relevant parcel for applying the takings analysis was the \u201cparcel as a whole,\u201d which the court ruled was both parcels combined together, rather than each discrete and separate parcel.\n\nAbuse of the \u2018relevant parcel\u2019 concept is widespread\n\n\u201cThis case has broad implications, because the Murrs are far from alone in confronting this issue,\u201d Groen continued. \u201cThe problem of bureaucrats and courts defining the parcel as a whole to include adjoining lots in common ownership presents itself throughout the country. It arises in multiple contexts, from agricultural operations concerning multiple separate tracts, to the typical American family such as the Murrs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy family and I are very encouraged by the court\u2019s announcement, and grateful to PLF for getting us here,\u201d said Donna Murr. \u201cThis case isn\u2019t just about our own rights, our own ability to use our land. It\u2019s about the Constitution\u2019s protections for everybody against overbearing regulations. We are hopeful that the justices will give all property owners a victory.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe case is Murr v. State of Wisconsin and St. Croix County.
