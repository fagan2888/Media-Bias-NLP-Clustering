Sen. Mark Udall tackled the topic of mountain biking trails in the wilderness and efforts to keep the Gunnison sage grouse off a federally protected list as he traveled nearly the length of Colorado on Tuesday.

Udall kicked off the day with a campaign event at the Off the Beaten Path bookstore in Steamboat Springs, where Rep. Diane Mitsch Bush provided an enthusiastic introduction for the senator, who faces Republican Congressman Cory Gardner in November.

Udall, Mitsch Bush said, “brings people together to get things done.”

“And, boy, has he gotten things done for us!” she told the crowd.

Udall visited with cyclists in Edwards, talked with Gunnison County officials about their efforts to accommodate the sage grouse and ended it at the Gunnison County Democratic Party’s annual barbecue.

The senator finishes the third and final day of a road trip combining politics and policy in Pueblo on Wednesday. On Monday, he visited Rocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park and Granby before heading to Steamboat Springs for a fundraiser that night.
