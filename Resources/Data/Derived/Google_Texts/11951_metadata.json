The company recognized the importance of Asia\u2019s rising middle class 15 years ago, and this is still one of its main drivers, Suh said at the cosmetics maker\u2019s factory in Osan, South Korea.\n\nAmorePacific Corp., South Korea\u2019s largest cosmetics maker, joins companies such as Hotel Shilla Co. and casino operator Paradise Co. in benefiting from the rising popularity of Korean entertainment and culture, especially in China. The maker of facial creams and ginseng serums plans to increase the number of Laneige and Sulwhasoo sales outlets in China and work with more online retailers to sell its products, Suh said.\n\nAmorePacific Group, whose brands also include Etude and Mamonde, competes with Procter & Gamble Co. and L\u2019Oreal SA in selling products such as the 270 yuan ($43) Laneige and 188 yuan Innisfree-brand facial creams in China. AmorePacific Corp. rose 0.4 percent to close at 2.85 million won in Seoul trading, while South Korea\u2019s benchmark Kospi Index fell 0.4 percent.\n\nThird-Richest Korean\n\nThe company, which has 2,335 stores in mainland China, plans to raise that by 15 percent this year, it said in an e-mailed reply to a query.\n\nAmorePacific Group had 2.1 percent of China\u2019s 131.4 billion-yuan skin care market in 2013, the 12th-biggest share, according to the latest data available from Euromonitor International. L\u2019Oreal has the largest market share with 11.4 percent, according to data from the industry researcher.\n\nSuh, a graduate of the Cornell University School of Management, took over running AmorePacific Corp. in 1997. The 52-year-old is now South Korea\u2019s third-richest man with a net worth of $6.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index.\n\nAmorePacific Corp.\u2019s shares jumped 19 percent in January, making it the best-performing stock in the beauty and personal care sector globally, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nBiggest Market\n\nChina and Southeast Asia will be the biggest growth drivers for the group, said Kim Boyoung, a Seoul-based analyst at BNP Paribas Securities Korea Co.\n\n\u201cThe Southeast Asia market has become almost half the size of China,\u201d said Kim, who has a buy recommendation on AmorePacific Corp. \u201cIt is also enjoying faster growth, and there is a meaningful number of middle class looking to buy affordable luxury brands.\u201d\n\nAmorePacific Group said Feb. 3 sales grew 21 percent to 4.7 trillion won ($4.3 billion) in 2014. China is its biggest market outside South Korea and accounted for 8.6 percent of sales in 2013.\n\nChina may make up 30 percent of AmorePacific Group\u2019s total sales by 2020, Chief Strategy Officer Kim Seunghwan said last year. The group expects to more than double sales to 12 trillion won by 2020, with half of that coming from overseas, it said last October.\n\nAmorePacific Group\u2019s sales may rise about 14 percent this year, according to the company. The growth will be driven by China and Southeast Asia, where the number of middle-class consumers is increasing, Suh said. AmorePacific also aims to expand in the U.S. and Europe, he said.\n\n(An earlier story was corrected to fix the company\u2019s sales growth target.)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Bloomberg News", "twitter": {"description": "AmorePacific Group expects sales in China to jump 30 percent this year as the South Korean cosmetics maker opens more outlets to capture a wealthier Chinese middle class keen to splurge to look more like their Korean idols.", "title": "Korea Pop Fervor to Lift AmorePacific China Sales by 30%", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-08/korea-pop-fervor-to-lift-amorepacific-china-sales-by-30-", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/irwKSoCa_RnY/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Bloomberg News", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "South Korea,Kyung-Bae Suh,China", "news_keywords": "South Korea,Kyung-Bae Suh,China", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-08/korea-pop-fervor-to-lift-amorepacific-china-sales-by-30-", "parsely-title": "Korea Pop Fervor to Lift AmorePacific China Sales by 30%", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-08T22:00:03.000Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "AmorePacific Group expects sales in China to jump 30 percent this year as the South Korean cosmetics maker opens more outlets to capture a wealthier Chinese middle class keen to splurge to look more like their Korean idols.", "parsely-tags": "South Korea,Kyung-Bae Suh,China,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-02-08T22:00:03.000Z", "parsely-section": "industries", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "AmorePacific Group expects sales in China to jump 30 percent this year as the South Korean cosmetics maker opens more outlets to capture a wealthier Chinese middle class keen to splurge to look more like their Korean idols.", "title": "Korea Pop Fervor to Lift AmorePacific China Sales by 30%", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-08/korea-pop-fervor-to-lift-amorepacific-china-sales-by-30-", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/irwKSoCa_RnY/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "AmorePacific Group expects sales in China to jump 30 percent this year as the South Korean cosmetics maker opens more outlets to capture a wealthier Chinese middle class keen to splurge to look more like their Korean idols."}, "parsely-post-id": "NJ875T6KLVRC01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/irwKSoCa_RnY/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "(An earlier story was corrected to fix the company\u2019s sales growth target.)\nChina may make up 30 percent of AmorePacific Group\u2019s total sales by 2020, Chief Strategy Officer Kim Seunghwan said last year.\nChina is its biggest market outside South Korea and accounted for 8.6 percent of sales in 2013.\nSuh, a graduate of the Cornell University School of Management, took over running AmorePacific Corp. in 1997.\nAmorePacific Corp. rose 0.4 percent to close at 2.85 million won in Seoul trading, while South Korea\u2019s benchmark Kospi Index fell 0.4 percent."}
