The 740-square-foot studio is just a few steps from the front door. \u2018It\u2019s a great commute,\u2019 said Mr. Eisner, whose last film was \u2018The Crazies.\u2019 Lisa Corson for The Wall Street Journal \u2026\n\nMr. Eisner\u2019s home. His Scenario Land production company studio is down a pathway planted with lavender and thyme.

Lisa Corson for The Wall Street Journal \u2026\n\nDesigned by Michael Palladino of Richard Meier & Partners, the 740-square-foot studio has walls of windows on three sides with a panoramic view of west Los Angeles. \u2018For the first six months to a year, I would often find myself in the middle of a meeting, staring out the window,\u2019 said Mr. Eisner, 43. Lisa Corson for The Wall Street Journal \u2026\n\nBuilt during an extensive 2007 remodel of his home, the studio was designed as a multipurpose workspace. Mr. Eisner can hold conferences on the first floor, write in the private office upstairs and host lunches on the teak deck. Lisa Corson for The Wall Street Journal \u2026\n\nDuring postproduction, large monitors and other editing equipment are brought into the studio, and the floor-to-ceiling windows are cloaked by black curtains.

Now that Mr. Eisner is off in Pittsburgh shooting his new movie, \u2018The Last Witch Hunter,\u2019 with Vin Diesel and Elijah Wood, his family has found new uses for the studio. \u2018The last time I Skyped with my wife, I saw kids\u2019 wrapping paper and toys all over the place,\u2019 said Mr. Eisner. \u2018I saw a yoga mat.\u2019 Lisa Corson for The Wall Street Journal \u2026\n\nAnthony Blumka, a fourth-generation art dealer in Medieval and Renaissance works, lives above his New York City art gallery. Claudio Papapietro for The Wall Street Journal \u2026\n\nTony Blumka, right, is pictured with his wife Lois, son Quintin, 16, and dog Phoenix in the entryway of the Blumka Gallery, and his home. Claudio Papapietro for The Wall Street Journal \u2026\n\nMr. Blumka\u2019s gallery features some of the statuary, altar pieces and ivories that he sells to museums and private clients. Once, Mr. Blumka threw a birthday party for his son there, complete with basketball nets and a juggler. \u2018We were going to repaint the gallery anyway,\u2019 he said. Claudio Papapietro for The Wall Street Journal \u2026\n\n\u2018Madonna and Child,\u2019 a late 15th-century wood sculpture by Hans Klocker, is pictured. Mr. Blumka has lost sleep some nights, when the state-of-the-art alarm system in his gallery suddenly goes off. \u2018I run down in my pajamas to see that everything is OK; thank goodness it\u2019s always been a false alarm,\u2019 he said.

During a three-year gut renovation, Mr. Blumka\u2019s architect, Peter Pennoyer, created a European-style townhouse with baronial interiors and an elegant plaster stucco facade. A balcony just off the home\u2019s oak-paneled foyer overlooks the gallery and its lighted vitrines; the gallery offices are tucked under a double staircase. Claudio Papapietro for The Wall \u2026\n\nDuring large exhibitions, Mr. Blumka installs additional displays in the mahogany-paneled second-floor library, pictured. Mr. Blumka works at an ornate desk from the French Renaissance, just opposite a 15th-century English linen-fold oak cabinet\u2014stained with the words \u2018Coward body maketh muche strife\u2019\u2014which houses 16-year-old Quintin\u2019s Xbox. Claudio Papapietro for The Wall Street Journal \u2026\n\nSmaller pieces are exhibited on Italian baroque pedestals in the second-floor dining room, which is hung with an early 16th-century Flemish wedding tapestry. Claudio Papapietro for The Wall Street Journal \u2026\n\nChuck Binder, a film producer and personal manager whose clients include Sharon Stone and Jon Lovitz, runs his company from an airy 600-square-foot office with white oak floors, exposed beams and equestrian art on wainscoted walls. He built it, along with the three-car garage below, on the property of his Beverly Hills home, a 1937 four-bedroom Colonial assessed at $2.24 million. Michal Czerwonka for The Wall Street Journal \u2026\n\nMr. Binder\u2019s wife, Lori O\u2019Brien, a psychoanalyst and avid equestrian, works from her own office, a converted 1937 garage annexed to the main house. To prevent awkward encounters between the couple\u2019s two sets of clients, Mr. Binder\u2019s visitors enter through a separate gate; the couple\u2019s three dogs, however, have made unscripted appearances during therapy sessions. Ms. O\u2019Brien is pictured with Downton.
