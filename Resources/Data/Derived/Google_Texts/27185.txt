Jon Gray was tagged as a can’t-miss pitcher when the Rockies plucked him out of the University of Oklahoma.

The stocky right-hander was the third overall pick in the 2013 draft, and the second pitcher taken behind Stanford’s Mark Appel, who was selected by the Astros.

Monday night at Citi Field, on a big-league stage, Gray showed us what all the fuss is about. Unfortunately for the Rockies, their shaky bullpen undid Gray’s good and the Mets won 4-2.

Here are the facts about the second start of Gray’s career:

Pitched six innings.

Allowed one hit (two if they take away an error charged to second baseman DJ LeMahieu).

Gave up one run, on a home run by Travis d’Arnaud in the second inning. Gray threw a 94 mph fastball that d’Arnaud blasted to right-center.

Issued two walks.

Struck out five.

Threw 75 pitches, 48 for strikes.

Threw a first-pitch strike 14 of 22 times.

His fastball topped out at 98 mph.

His slider came in at 88-89 mph.

He threw his changeup at 88-89 mph.
