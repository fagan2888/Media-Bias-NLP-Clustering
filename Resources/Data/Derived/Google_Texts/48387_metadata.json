The proposals come after the Utah Legislature passed SB97 during the 2015 session, which increased state revenue by $75 million by increasing Utah's basic property tax rate.\n\nCity and school district officials say the increases are needed to keep up \u2014 or catch up \u2014 on growing revenue demands, from inflation to needs for better student and teacher services.\n\nBut Billy Hesterman, vice president of the Utah Taxpayers Association, said taxpayers need to tell their elected officials \"taxes are already high enough.\"\n\n\"Certainly there are needs, but at the same time, policymakers need to look at their budgets,\" Hesterman said. \"They really need to dig down, cut out the fat, and find ways to take this burden off of the taxpayers and let the money stay in the family and in the home.\"\n\nReasons for the proposed tax hikes vary from city to city, but school districts are seeking additional revenue needed after the Legislature passed HB119.\n\nThe bill requires school districts to pay a full 25 percent of local property tax revenues to a statewide fund, providing capital resources for both district and charter schools. Prior to the bill, districts could pay the lesser of two options: 25 percent of per-pupil local revenues, or 25 percent of charter schools students' average local revenues.\n\nDistrict officials say the bulk of the proposed property tax increases are needed to cover that 25 percent.\n\nSalt Lake City School District\n\nThe Salt Lake City School District is proposing a $1.5 million property tax increase. If approved by the school board, a majority of the funds \u2014 $900,000 \u2014 will be used to pay the full cost of local replacement funding called for by HB119, district spokesman Jason Olsen said.\n\nThe remaining $600,000 would fund a new peer assistance review program and teacher development, Olsen said.\n\n\"The two programs we're looking to expand are direct benefits to our students,\" he said. \"But the overall majority of the need is unfortunately something we don't have a lot of control over. \u2026 If we didn't raise it through taxes, we'd have to cut it from some of our programs.\"\n\nThe tax hike would mean property taxes on an average home valued at $265,000 would increase by $12 per year \u2014 from $935 to $947. A commercial property at the same value would go up $22 \u2014 from $1,700 to $1,722.\n\nThe public hearing on the Salt Lake City School District tax increase is set for 7 p.m. Tuesday at the district offices, 440 E. 100 South.\n\nGranite School District\n\nDistrict spokesman Ben Horsley said the Granite School Board has proposed to increase taxes by roughly $860,000. The funds will be used to make up for HB119's local replacement funding.\n\n\"We're not going to cut services to our students to provide funding to charter schools,\" Horsley said.\n\nIf the tax increase is approved, an average home valued at $265,000 would see property taxes increase by $26 \u2014 from $991 to $1,017. A commercial property at the same value would face an increase of $48 \u2014 from $1,802 to $1,850.\n\nA public hearing for the Granite tax increase is set for 7 p.m. Tuesday at the district offices, 2500 S. State.\n\nMurray School District\n\nThe Murray School Board has proposed a $605,000 increase, of which $115,000 will be used to cover local replacement funding under HB119.\n\nSuperintendent Steve Hirase said the rest will be used to restore services and positions lost during the economic downturn, including professional development days for teachers and at least seven full-time positions \u2014 one administrator, three coaches, one math lab instructor, and two counselors.\n\n\"It's important for our students to be able to receive the educational services they deserve,\" Hirase said.\n\nIf the increase is approved, an average home valued at $265,000 would see property taxes increase by $30 \u2014 from $1,002 to $1,032. A commercial property at the same value would face an increase of $55 \u2014 from $1,822 to $1,877.\n\nA public hearing is set for 7 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 11, at the district offices, 147 E. 5065 South, Murray.\n\nSalt Lake City\n\nUtah's capital city hopes to generate $4.7 million in additional tax revenue, but Mayor Ralph Becker's spokesman, Art Raymond, said the bulk of the revenue \u2014 $4.5 million \u2014 is a \"tax stabilization,\" not a property tax increase.\n\n\"Salt Lake City is not seeking a tax increase this year but has, as state law requires, engaged the truth-in-taxation process for an adjustment to maintain the same revenues as it collected last year,\" Raymond said. \"This adjustment simply balances the revenue stream to match that of the previous year.\"\n\nThe other $200,000 is for a judgement levy, which is a property tax adjustment to replace revenues being rebated to companies that have made local or state appeals for property value reductions.\n\nIf approved, an average home valued at $265,000 would see property taxes increase by $38 \u2014 from $780 to $818. A commercial property at the same value would see an increase of $68 \u2014 from $1,419 to $1,487.\n\nThe public hearing is set for 6 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 13, at the Salt Lake City-County Building, 451 S. State.\n\nSandy\n\nSandy is proposing a $318,000 property tax increase.\n\nThe city has not raised property taxes since 1987, but unforeseen costs from the Affordable Care Act, as well as a need to compensate for inflationary costs and sales tax lost through businesses relocating to other cities, have necessitated a tax hike, spokeswoman Nicole Martin said.\n\n\"Raising property tax is always a last resort for Sandy city, which is why we've not done it since 1987 and now have one of the lowest property tax rates in the state,\" Martin said. \"Unfortunately, it has become necessary to ask for a modest increase if we hope to not negatively impact the service levels our residents expect and deserve.\"\n\nIf the hike is approved, an average home valued at $265,000 would see property taxes rise $8 \u2014 from $200 to $208. A commercial property at the same value would see an increase of $15 \u2014 from $363 to $378.\n\nA public hearing is set for 7 p.m. Tuesday at Sandy City Hall, 10000 S. Centennial Parkway.\n\nWest Valley City\n\nWest Valley City is proposing to increase property tax collections by nearly $200,000. The city's finance director, James Welch, said the increase would make up for a judgement levy, so it wouldn't produce any new revenue for the city.\n\n\"This is a property tax adjustment to replace revenues that were rebated to businesses who protested their property tax evaluations and does not represent any operational increases,\" Welch said.\n\nIf the hike is approved, an average home valued at $265,000 would see property taxes rise $5 \u2014 from $607 to $612. A commercial property at the same value would see an increase of $9 \u2014 from $1,103 to $1,112.\n\nA public hearing is set for 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 11, at West Valley City Hall, 3600 S. Constitution Blvd.\n\nTraverse Ridge Special Service District\n\nThe Traverse Ridge Special Service District in Draper is proposing a $165,000 increase, but it will cost the district's residents 75 percent less of what they used to pay to fund snow removal at higher elevations.\n\nLast year, Draper residents overwhelmingly voted down a property tax add-on for those services, which critics claimed was more than the cost of the services and double what Draper residents outside of the district pay. Since the levy was removed, the district's residents have not had to foot a special service property tax bill.\n\n\"Because our tax levy was zero last year, any tax levy is going to be an increase,\" said the district's treasurer, Blaine Carlton. \"What we've come up with is what we think is a reasonable budget, which is 75 percent lower than what Draper city had proposed a year and a half ago.\"\n\nIf the district's board approves the levy, an average home valued at $265,000 would see a property tax of $95. A commercial property at the same value would be $173.\n\nA public hearing is set for 7 p.m. Tuesday at Draper City Hall, 1020 E. Pioneer Road.\n\nJordan Valley Water Conservancy\n\nThe Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District is proposing a property tax increase of $655,000.\n\nRichard Bay, the district's general manager, said the hike is a part of a 10-year financial plan to keep up with population growth and demand.\n\n\"It's been eight years since we last adjusted the (tax),\" Bay said, \"and this year, to keep with our long-term plan, is the time to adjust it once again.\"\n\nThe district's two most recent projects are the Central and Strawberry water projects, which will cost $126 million, he said.\n\nIf the district board approves the increase, an average home valued at $265,000 would see property taxes rise $3 \u2014 from $55 to $58. A commercial property at the same value would see an increase of $6 \u2014 from $100 to $106.\n\nA public hearing is set for 6 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 12, at the district offices, 8215 S. 1300 West, West Jordan.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotos\n\nRelated Links\n\nRelated Stories\n\n0 Pending Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several Salt Lake County cities and school districts are proposing property tax increases, and if they're all approved, residents collectively could be asked to pay roughly $10 million more in taxes.", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.ksl.android", "og": {"image": "http://img.ksl.com/slc/2567/256724/25672435.jpg?filter=ksl/responsive_story_lg", "type": "article", "description": "Several Salt Lake County cities and school districts are proposing property tax increases, and if they're all approved, residents collectively could be asked to pay roughly $10 million more in taxes.", "title": "SL County cities, school districts propose $10M in property tax hikes | KSL.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kslcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=363278608, app-argument=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=35765356", "fb": {"pages": 68771464171}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 35765356}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "keywords": "news, traffic, weather, sports, classifieds, cars, jobs, homes, television, radio, salt lake, utah, local", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/kslcom/"}, "theme-color": "#0b162f"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd337\"", "article_summary": "Salt Lake City School DistrictThe Salt Lake City School District is proposing a $1.5 million property tax increase.\n\"This is a property tax adjustment to replace revenues that were rebated to businesses who protested their property tax evaluations and does not represent any operational increases,\" Welch said.\nAt least 30 Utah cities and school districts \u2014 including eight in Salt Lake County \u2014 are considering property tax increases.\nIf the tax increase is approved, an average home valued at $265,000 would see property taxes increase by $26 \u2014 from $991 to $1,017.\nReasons for the proposed tax hikes vary from city to city, but school districts are seeking additional revenue needed after the Legislature passed HB119."}
