On Thursday, Obama hit the golf course six minutes after he finished a press conference dealing with foreign policy crises and Michael Brown’s and was reportedly golfing while the funeral for Maj. Gen. Harold Greene was taking place at Arlington National Cemetery. Green, the two-star general, is the highest-ranking American to be killed in Afghanistan.

Mourning, the former Georgetown and NBA star who helped Obama promote Obamacare, is emerging as one of Obama’s top confidantes, according to news reports. Mourning is reportedly giving Obama advice on the types of foundations he could run after his presidency.

Critics like former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin have said that Obama golfs during crises because Obama is in over his head as the country’s chief executive.
