Nebraska is the only state that has a unicameral legislature. Nebraska is mainly a public power state, and although many of the public power districts act like private power companies, there is a growing movement to put the public back in public power, using our own natural resources (wind and sun).\n\nOur Republican governor-elect, Pete Ricketts, is a member of the TD Ameritrade managerial family that constructed a LEED platinum-certified headquarters, indicating their commitment to renewable energy and conservation. Nebraska is also one of two states that allow our electoral votes to be split.\n\nIn November, a long-serving Republican congressman was defeated by a Democrat, and Nebraska voters handily voted to increase the minimum wage.\n\nAs a public health professional, I am pleased that Nebraska has the second-best child immunization coverage in the country. Nebraska was also a site that treated Ebola patients. Nebraska has many progressive tendencies, but miles to go before we sleep.\n\nDAVID E. CORBIN\n\nOmaha, Dec. 27, 2014\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nMary Pipher hits the nail on the head when she toasts her group\u2019s members who are running for city council and the Nebraska State Legislature. That is where power is still accessible.\n\nTens of thousands of local and state elective offices are available to go after the power to change things, if progressives only knew how to use all three levels of the federal system.\n\nDAVID WYLIE\n\nBolton, Mass., Dec. 27, 2014\n\nThe writer is a former city councilor in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI read Mary Pipher\u2019s article with considerable sympathy. Like her, I grew up in a small Nebraska town \u2014 in my case, Hooper, where my great-uncles built some of the ornate Victorian buildings on Main Street that helped put the town on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nUnlike her, I left the state in 1955, after graduating from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and working in its public relations department for a few years. I wanted to write for magazines, and that meant the East Coast.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I was growing up, in the 1930s and \u201940s, I didn\u2019t know many Democrats: Dad\u2019s first cousin, the postmaster, was one. And Mother\u2019s father had been a follower of William Jennings Bryan. Given Nebraska\u2019s unicameral legislature, however, I wasn\u2019t very conscious of political parties. By the time I reached voting age, Dwight D. Eisenhower and other middle-of-the-road Republicans seemed right to me.\n\nAlthough I will always be a Cornhusker, I haven\u2019t been home for many years. I find that I have little to say to many of my oldest friends, who seem to get most of their information from Fox News. Frankly, what has happened to Nebraska because of recent Republican politics sickens me.\n\nEMILY HEINE\n\nPrinceton, N.J., Dec. 27, 2014\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nMary Pipher writes that \u201cwith the exception of Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s landslide in 1964, our state has not supported a Democrat for president since 1936.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Nebraska contributed one of its five electoral votes to Barack Obama, in District 2, which includes Omaha and its suburbs. It was hard fought and it was close, but Mr. Obama won, and because Nebraska allocates its electoral votes by district, it counted.\n\nI recall that a day before the primaries, Mr. Obama swept into town for an afternoon and filled Omaha\u2019s 10,000-seat Civic Auditorium on a few hours\u2019 notice. It was a raucous rally. I was there.\n\nAn overflow crowd of several thousand flooded the Civic\u2019s basement. Our Democratic mayor at that time, Mike Fahey, renamed the city \u201cObamaha.\u201d\n\nMs. Pipher might also have pointed out that just last fall, District 2 retired its Republican member of Congress, Lee Terry, after a 16-year incumbency, in favor of Brad Ashford. Mr. Terry was one of only three Republicans to lose a seat in the House in 2014. Sometimes, progressives do win in Nebraska.\n\nBRUCE E.
