As an answer to this, we offer the below labor of love \u2013 \"Piers Morgan Live, Rewind\" \u2013 dedicated and designed to getting you caught up and connected to the conversation.\n\nBubba's Back: Watson Returns After PGA Win\n\nAs regular viewers of \"Piers Morgan Live\" are all too aware, the primetime host has no shortage of jokes and jabs for his celebrity guests. As such, it came as little surprise a week ago when Morgan teased professional golfer Bubba Watson about his recent victory drought.\n\nHaving not won a tournament since the 2012 Master's, Watson promptly responded by capturing the championship of the very next event he entered, The Northern Trust Open.\n\nIn his return appearance Tuesday evening, Morgan sought praise and appreciation for his role in the win and Watson sarcastically obliged:\n\n\u201cYou're an inspiration to millions of people,\u201d Watson teased. \u201cNow I know what not to do in life, and so you inspire people to be better than you.\u201d\n\nFrom Bullied to Beautiful: Plastic Surgery to increase Self-Esteem\n\nWith counseling and harassment prevention programs popping up in schools nationwide, bullying has proved to be an epidemic that adults are committed to protecting their children from. But when bullying reaches unbearable levels, and traditional means seem ineffective, Dr. Thomas Roma\u2019s foundation is offering an unconventional solution: a trip under the knife. The NYC nonprofit Little Baby Face Foundation provides free plastic surgery to low income children who are severely harassed for their physical appearances, and in a live interview with Piers Morgan on Tuesday night, the founder explained his reasoning.\n\nSeated across from the host, Romo acknowledged that altering the victims, as opposed to addressing the bullies\u2019 behavior, may not be the most socially acceptable answer. However, for children with physical impairments it may be the most practical:\n\n\u201cTo think that we're going to stop bullying by attacking the bullies \u2013 I mean, it may or may not occur,\u201d Dr. Romo explained to Morgan.\n\nAs part of his visit to the program, Roma was joined by one of his patients \u2013 15 year-old Renata, who had plastic surgery to alter her appearance after years of social ostracizing and verbal abuse from her peers.\n\nFox had been out of school for two years, and a psychologist recommended seeking help to alter her appearance, a suggestion that ultimately lead to increased self-esteem and acceptance:\n\n\u201cI felt like I was a normal kid again,\u201d Renata said of her life post-treatment. \u201cI could actually look at myself without wanting to cry.\u201d\n\nThree years later, \"The Square\" tells the story of Egyptian unrest\n\nPolitical unrest has exploded across the globe of late, as violent protests have rocked Venezuela, Ukraine and Thailand. Such movements have captured worldwide attention before, particularly a 2011 revolt in Egypt which transformed the face of the country as part of what was quickly labeled the Arab Spring.\n\nOn Tuesday night Piers Morgan was joined by a woman who knows the political struggle in Egypt from the inside out, as Jehane Noujaim discussed her film, the Oscar-nominated documentary \u201cThe Square.\u201d\n\nNoujaim's movie follows the protest\u2019s origins and growth from the heart of Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square, and three years since, she told Morgan that though the struggle in Egypt is far from over. \u201cThe Square\u201d brings the Egyptian people\u2019s plight further into the public eye, ensuring that change will eventually come.\n\n\u201cOur story will never be able to be silenced,\u201d Noujaim said, referencing her film\u2019s Oscar buzz. \u201cAnd that's what is so important about this nomination, is the fuel that comes with it, because this is about the civil rights struggle and the struggle for human dignity of our time.\u201d\n\nFor the next edition of \"Piers Morgan Live,\" watch CNN every night at 9.\n\n-\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whether you fell asleep early, stayed out too late, or simply want to watch it again, we realize it's not always possible to get your entire \"Piers Morgan Live\" fix from television.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "\"Piers Morgan Live, Rewind\": Bubba Watson returns a champ,  from Bullied to Beautiful, and \"The Square,\" a story of Egyptian unrest", "og": {"url": "http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/19/piers-morgan-live-rewind-bubba-watson-returns-a-champ-from-bullied-to-beautiful-and-the-square-a-story-of-egyptian-unrest/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140218232510-exp-pmt-bubba-watston-pga-win-00010924-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Whether you fell asleep early, stayed out too late, or simply want to watch it again, we realize it's not always possible to get your entire \"Piers Morgan Live\" fix from television.", "title": "\"Piers Morgan Live, Rewind\": Bubba Watson returns a champ,  from Bullied to Beautiful, and \"The Square,\" a story of Egyptian unrest"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Piers Morgan", "keywords": "piers morgan live, piers morgan live, rewind, rebecca bluitt", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/169bdd3c913ad32d5e743b1d82ca1052?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b88\"", "article_summary": "-\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram\nAs an answer to this, we offer the below labor of love \u2013 \"Piers Morgan Live, Rewind\" \u2013 dedicated and designed to getting you caught up and connected to the conversation.\nBubba's Back: Watson Returns After PGA WinAs regular viewers of \"Piers Morgan Live\" are all too aware, the primetime host has no shortage of jokes and jabs for his celebrity guests.\nWhether you fell asleep early, stayed out too late, or simply want to watch it again, we realize it's not always possible to get your entire \"Piers Morgan Live\" fix from television.\nAs such, it came as little surprise a week ago when Morgan teased professional golfer Bubba Watson about his recent victory drought."}
