(AP) - The Montana Supreme Court has revived the case of a woman who says it\u2019s unfair for hospitals to charge different rates to treat insured and uninsured patients.\n\nThe high court reversed District Judge James Reynolds\u2019 decision last year to throw out the case challenging the agreements hospitals make with insurance companies to set discounts for the companies\u2019 customers.\n\nThe justices ruled 4-1 Tuesday that Reynolds didn\u2019t address all of plaintiff Jessica Gazelka\u2019s arguments on whether those discounts discriminate against uninsured patients.\n\nMontana hospitals can negotiate agreements with insurance companies that set discounts for the companies\u2019 customers. The law allowing the practice is the Montana Preferred Provider Agreements Act.\n\nGazelka, an uninsured 23-year-old woman who was in a car accident in 2010, sued St. Peter\u2019s Hospital over the Helena hospital\u2019s preferred provider agreements.\n\nUninsured patients are charged more for the same medical care as a result of the agreements, she argued. She asked a judge to rule the agreements violate the Montana Constitution\u2019s equal-protection provisions.\n\nAttorneys for St. Peter\u2019s Hospital responded that the insurance company agreements have nothing to do with the amount Gazelka was charged, and that they are beneficial because they help lower cost through more efficient-care delivery.\n\nThe hospital argued that simply being uninsured is not a condition that qualifies for protection under the state constitution\u2019s equal protection clause. St. Peter\u2019s attorneys also said that most of Gazelka\u2019s medical treatment after the accident was paid for by the other driver\u2019s insurance or was discounted through a program for poor patients.\n\nReynolds ruled for Helena\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Hospital in May 2014 after concluding that uninsured people are not a protected class under the state constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed Reynolds on Tuesday, saying he did not address all of Gazelka\u2019s arguments. Further proceedings are necessary to determine whether Gazelka\u2019s equal-protection claims are valid, the court ruled.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not rule on the substance of Gazelka\u2019s case, which now goes back to the lower court.\n\nJohn Morrison, Gazelka\u2019s attorney, said he was confident the high court would rule the way it did.\n\n\u201cWe believe the hospital\u2019s practice of charging uninsured people more than insured people clearly violates the equal-protection clause of the Montana Constitution,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to presenting that issue again to the district court.\u201d\n\nSt. Peter\u2019s attorney, Randy Cox, did not respond to a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Montana Supreme Court has revived the case of a woman who says it's unfair for hospitals to charge different rates to treat insured and uninsured patients.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/13/court-revives-health-insurance-discrimination-laws/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The Montana Supreme Court has revived the case of a woman who says it\u2019s unfair for hospitals to charge different rates to treat insured and uninsured patients.", "title": "Court revives health insurance discrimination lawsuit"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Montana Supreme Court has revived the case of a woman who says it's unfair for hospitals to charge different rates to treat insured and uninsured patients.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Court revives health insurance discrimination lawsuit"}, "Author": "MATT VOLZ", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3ba\"", "article_summary": "Montana hospitals can negotiate agreements with insurance companies that set discounts for the companies\u2019 customers.\nReynolds ruled for Helena\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Hospital in May 2014 after concluding that uninsured people are not a protected class under the state constitution.\nThe Supreme Court did not rule on the substance of Gazelka\u2019s case, which now goes back to the lower court.\nThe high court reversed District Judge James Reynolds\u2019 decision last year to throw out the case challenging the agreements hospitals make with insurance companies to set discounts for the companies\u2019 customers.\nGazelka, an uninsured 23-year-old woman who was in a car accident in 2010, sued St. Peter\u2019s Hospital over the Helena hospital\u2019s preferred provider agreements."}
