UnitedHealth Group (UNH) should log solid if slower growth when it reports Q2 earnings on Thursday. Meanwhile, some industry watchers wonder whether the nation’s biggest health insurer might be interested in entering the industry’s consolidation sweepstakes.

Reuters, citing tweets from CNBC, reported on Thursday that UnitedHealth “was looking to bid for Cigna (CI)” even as Cigna and Anthem (ANTM) have reportedly rekindled merger talks. Last month, Cigna spurned a $47.5 billion takeover from Anthem.

Another mega-merger, between Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), is already in the works.

UnitedHealth’s stock price rose more than 2% to 122.12 in afternoon trading Friday. Shares set a new high of 124.11 on June 26. The company boasts a very strong IBD Composite Rating of 98.

All of this plays out as UnitedHealth prepares to report Q2 earnings before the open on Thursday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of $1.59, up 12% from the previous year. Revenue is seen climbing 9.5% to $35.66 billion. If those results hold up, it would mark the third straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for UnitedHealth.

During the first quarter the company grew earnings 33% and revenue 13%. It was the biggest earnings gain since the second quarter of 2012 and the biggest top-line increase in at least three years.

Q1 results featured another strong performance from UnitedHealth’s Optum Health Services platform, which delivered a 15% year-over-year revenue gain to $13 billion. Optum includes a managed care business, software and consulting unit, and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) service provider.

The PBM unit, OptumRx, will get much bigger when UnitedHealth closes its $12 billion acquisition of Catamaran. That deal, announced on March 30, is expected to close during the fourth quarter.

The combined entity will serve 65 million customers, which should give UnitedHealth’s PBM business the kind of scale and bargaining power to land better deals on drugs and make it more competitive with CVS Health (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESRX), analysts say.

Meanwhile, UnitedHealth and other managed care stocks appear to have gotten a lift from last month’s Supreme Court decision to uphold the health care subsidies allowed by the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.

In a research report, Trefis said the decision “benefits insurers such as UnitedHealth” partly because ObamaCare customers “may not be able to afford private health insurance without the subsidies.”

Maintaining the subsidies “means that the private health insurance market should be able to sustain its growth going forward,” Trefis said. “Furthermore, UnitedHealth should be able to maintain its industry-leading market share in private health insurance, which is a major business for the company. “
