Bradley Byrne, Alabama Republican, and sets the table for Senate Republicans, now in the majority, to follow suit, although they\u2019re unlikely to find 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster and force President Obama to veto their efforts.\n\nCongressional Republicans had been focusing on more limited swipes at Obamacare.\n\nThe House voted to redefine full-time work under the law from 30 hours per week to 40, and it exempted veterans from the law\u2019s insurance mandate on businesses with the hope that employers will hire more ex-servicemen and women.\n\nOn Thursday, top Senate Republicans introduced a bill to scrap the mandate outright, saying companies that employ 50 or more workers should not be forced to pay for health coverage or face debilitating fines.\n\n\u201cObamacare\u2019s burdensome employer mandate continues to hinder job-creation and growth, and the best action Washington can take is to repeal it entirely,\u201d said Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, Utah Republican.\n\nCongressional Republicans also want to repeal Obamacare\u2019s tax on medical device makers. Several Democrats support that measure, too, because their states contain clusters of manufacturers that have complained about the tax.\n\nThe GOP has been unable to rally behind a comprehensive alternative to Obamacare to fulfill the second part of its repeal-and-replace strategy, although several proposals are floating around.\n\nWhile Mr. Obama wields a veto until 2016, the Supreme Court is set to rule by June on a case that could invalidate many of Obamacare\u2019s subsidies, blowing a hole in the law and giving the GOP daylight to swoop in with their plans.\n\nMr. McCarthy\u2019s memo says the new repeal bill instructs the relevant House committees to \u201cto develop our patient-centered health care reforms.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans will kick off February with a vote to repeal Obamacare, providing new members the chance to put their opposition on the record as the party chips away at the overhaul and devises some reforms of its own.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Republicans will kick off February with a vote to repeal Obamacare, providing new members the chance to put their opposition on the record as the party chips away at the overhaul and devises some reforms of its own.", "title": "Republicans to open February with vote to repeal Obamacare", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/29/republicans-open-february-vote-repeal-obamacare/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/13/1_132015_obama-congress-98201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/13/1_132015_obama-congress-98201.jpg", "description": "House Republicans will kick off February with a vote to repeal Obamacare, providing new members the chance to put their opposition on the record as the party chips away at the overhaul and devises som", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Republicans to open February with vote to repeal Obamacare"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Labor, Republican Party, Kevin Mccarthy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f3c\"", "article_summary": "House Republicans will kick off February with a vote to repeal Obamacare, giving new members the chance to record their opposition to the law while the party pursues its own health plan.\nThe bill also directs relevant committees to work up GOP-driven health reforms that could replace Obamacare after repeal.\nMr. McCarthy\u2019s memo says the new repeal bill instructs the relevant House committees to \u201cto develop our patient-centered health care reforms.\u201d\nRepublicans have voted dozens of times to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act since its passage in 2010, but this will be the first full-scale repeal vote of the new Congress.\nCongressional Republicans also want to repeal Obamacare\u2019s tax on medical device makers."}
