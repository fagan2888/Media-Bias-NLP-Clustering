Philip Breedlove, cited intelligence showing \u201ccolumns of Russian equipment, primarily Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air defense systems and Russian combat troops, entering into Ukraine.\u201d\n\nGen. Breedlove said Russia also appeared to be reinforcing its military bases in the Crimean Peninsula with equipment that is \u201ccapable of being nuclear,\u201d but added that NATO wasn\u2019t certain nuclear weapons were being deployed.\n\nRussia this year annexed the peninsula, which had been a region of Ukraine.\n\nThe latest developments have prompted fears in Washington that Moscow may now be preparing to try and repeat its Crimea action by annexing a wider swath of eastern Ukraine.\n\nBut Russian officials have denied charges they are expanding Moscow\u2019s military presence in the area.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, called Gen. Breedlove\u2019s claims unfounded last week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve stressed many a time there are no real facts behind the acts of shaking the air by Brussels officials,\u201d said Gen. Konashenkov, who accused the NATO commander of making \u201calarmist anti-Russian allegations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The head of NATO warned Tuesday that, in addition to deploying forces and military equipment into eastern Ukraine, Moscow is now engaged in a \"serious military buildup\" on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The head of NATO warned Tuesday that, in addition to deploying forces and military equipment into eastern Ukraine, Moscow is now engaged in a \u201cserious military buildup\u201d on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine.", "title": "NATO: Russia engaged in \u2018serious military buildup\u2019 near Ukrainian border", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/18/nato-russia-engaged-serious-military-buildup-near-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/15/35cc3f63f83cd51f5c0f6a7067005ae7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/15/35cc3f63f83cd51f5c0f6a7067005ae7.jpg", "description": "The head of NATO warned Tuesday that, in addition to deploying forces and military equipment into eastern Ukraine, Moscow is now engaged in a \"serious military buildup\" on the Russian side of the bord", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "NATO: Russia engaged in \u2018serious military buildup\u2019 near Uk"}, "Author": "Guy Taylor", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO , Moscow, Ukraine"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9c0\"", "article_summary": "The head of NATO warned Tuesday that, in addition to deploying forces and military equipment into eastern Ukraine, Moscow is now engaged in a \u201cserious military buildup\u201d on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine.\nMaj.
