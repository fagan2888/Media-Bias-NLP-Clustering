Act 48, the 2011 law that committed Vermont to a universal, publicly financed health care system, is still on the books. The law mandated that Governor Shumlin come up with a financing proposal by January 2013. Two years late, it was finally supposed to be presented to the legislature this January. Several financing proposals were made, but the governor declared none was sustainable and refused to propose any. An amendment presented to the Senate would tell the Green Mountain Care Board to examine a minimum of four public financing proposals, including one from the Vermont Workers\u2019 Center, and bring back a report to the legislature. Big business, meanwhile, still sees Act 48 as a threat, and is trying to repeal it. \u2013 Traven Leyshon\n\nThe Vermont Workers\u2019 Center, which helped mobilize statewide support for passage of Act 48 four years ago, countered the governor\u2019s claims by releasing its own plan for financing the program.\n\nOne hundred economists endorsed the VWC approach, which relies on progressive taxation. The VWC also struck back with a clever \u201cwhiteboard\u201d video, \u201cThe Time is Now: Healthcare Financing for Vermont, Explained in Three Minutes.\u201d\n\nBut, of course, neither the quick tutorial nor the VWC\u2019s full report garnered as much media attention\u2014or had the same legislative clout\u2014as Shumlin\u2019s demolition.\n\nLABOR PROTESTS\n\nSeveral hundred frustrated health care reform advocates showed up at the governor\u2019s January 8 inauguration in Montpelier\u2014and they weren\u2019t there to applaud. Instead they staged a sit-in at the state capitol, chanting and singing, unfurling banners and refusing to leave.\n\n\u201cPeople had fought for this a long time,\u201d says Liz Nikazmerad, president of United Electrical Workers Local 203 and a worker in the produce department of a Burlington grocery. \u201cIt was a huge win and to have the rug yanked out like that was very upsetting.\u201d\n\nBy the end of day, the UE leader and 28 others\u2014now known as \u201cThe Statehouse 29\u201d\u2014faced multiple criminal charges, including resisting arrest. The cases against 18 were later dropped; others settled by paying a fine or promising to do community service.\n\nIt was first in a series of angry labor sorties to Montpelier. During the legislative session, the bitter recriminations over the governor\u2019s health care retreat morphed into broader controversies about workers\u2019 rights, contract concessions, and what the Vermont Progressive Party calls Shumlin\u2019s \u201causterity budget.\u201d\n\nRead More: Governor Turns the Hose on Workers Abandoning universal health care, as it turned out, was only the opening shot in Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin\u2019s barrage against working people this year. But in the face of these assaults, the local labor movement is showing new energy...\n\nOBAMACARE\u2019S SOUR TASTE\n\nShumlin\u2019s about-face on Green Mountain Care reflected more than revised estimates of its cost and feasibility. Unfortunately, Vermont was forced to create a private insurance exchange first, before the Affordable Care Act would permit experimentation of a different sort in 2017.\n\nThe troubled 2013 rollout of Vermont Health Connect, the state\u2019s ACA-mandated private insurance exchange, hurt public perceptions of the longer-term goal, single payer. Lower-income people previously covered by state-subsidized plans ended up paying more out of pocket.\n\n\u201cOver the last few years, the Shumlin administration hasn\u2019t done anything to give Vermonters confidence that we could handle being innovators in health care,\u201d says Chris Pearson, a Progressive state rep and vice-chair of the House Committee on Health Care. \u201cThere were just too many bad headlines about the nightmare of enrolling, computer problems, and cost over-runs.\u201d\n\nAs a result, polls show, the popularity of Green Mountain Care is not what it was even a year ago. The Vermont Workers Center plans to do more grassroots organizing around the shortcomings of Vermont Health Connect coverage.\n\nBID FOR GOVERNOR?\n\nMeanwhile, in the Vermont Progressive Party, Statewide Organizer Kelly Mangan has \u201cgotten a lot of member feedback about running a candidate for governor next year.\u201d\n\nThis is something her third party refrained from doing in the last three election cycles, to avoid putting a Republican in office\u2014who would have opposed Act 48 from the outset or shelved it sooner than Shumlin did. Now, the growing estrangement of labor voters from the Democrats could lead to Shumlin\u2019s replacement by a Republican anyway.\n\nBut personal health problems may prevent State Senator Anthony Pollina, the VPP\u2019s most experienced statewide standard-bearer, from running for governor. (In 2008, he placed second in a three-way race).\n\nAnd Vermont\u2019s most successful progressive politician, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, seems more intent on seeking executive office higher than any available in Montpelier.\n\nA much longer version of this piece first appeared in Working In These Times.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://labornotes.org/sites/dc.lndev.opa.labornotes.org/files/logo_with_slogan.png"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Vermont Workers Center plans to do more grassroots organizing around the shortcomings of Vermont Health Connect coverage.\nAct 48, the 2011 law that committed Vermont to a universal, publicly financed health care system, is still on the books.\nFour years ago, Vermont took a promising first step when its legislature passed Act 48, laying the groundwork for a pioneering public health care plan called Green Mountain Care.\nBut six weeks after narrowly winning re-election to a third term, the governor abruptly abandoned universal health care.\nThe troubled 2013 rollout of Vermont Health Connect, the state\u2019s ACA-mandated private insurance exchange, hurt public perceptions of the longer-term goal, single payer."}
