The captured equipment is proof, Ukrainian officials claim, of the Kremlin\u2019s complicity in the ongoing conflict.\n\n\u201cIt was bizarre, the rebels started out with hunting rifles,\u201d Ukraine National Guard Capt. Alexei Lebed said, speaking about the evolution of military hardware used by the pro-Russian separatists over the course of the 10-month-old conflict. \u201cAnd then the next day they had artillery, and then the next day they had tanks, and then the next day they had helicopters and missiles.\u201d\n\nThe display of captured Russian equipment in Kyiv is part of a broader effort by Ukrainian officials to highlight Russia\u2019s role in the conflict\u2014a move meant to convince the United States and the European Union to continue sanctions against Russia and to secure additional military equipment and training for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces.\n\nThe military hardware currently on display in Kyiv includes a Russian T-64 tank captured on June 13, 2014, during a battle between Ukrainian government troops and separatist rebels outside the eastern Ukrainian town Slavyansk. According to a Ukrainian information placard accompanying the display, the tank was never a part of the Ukrainian military, underscoring its Russian provenance.\n\nAlso on display were several small, unarmed drone aircrafts that Ukrainian officials said were supplied by Russia for the separatists to scout Ukrainian positions in order to better target rocket and artillery attacks.\n\nAccording to a Ukrainian placard on display with one of the drones, \u201cUkrainian State Security Units in Artemivsk, Donetsk region, shot down this unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying over the city of Dzerzhinsk, Dzerzhinsk district, Donetsk region, on February 19, 2015. The UAV belongs to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nUkrainian officials have claimed for nearly a year that regular Russian soldiers have been fighting inside Ukraine, and that pro-Russian separatists are funded and equipped by Moscow.\n\nThe Kremlin denies providing material support for the separatists and has said that any Russian soldiers captured fighting in Ukraine were there on their own accord while on leave. Moscow has also said that convoys of trucks crossing from Russia into separatist-controlled areas have been transporting humanitarian supplies despite claims from Kyiv that the convoys were a ruse meant to conceal arms shipments.\n\nAlthough a cease-fire deal was reached last month in the Belarusian capital of Minsk, sporadic fighting continues in eastern Ukraine. And while major combat operations have eased off in the region, tensions still remain high.\n\nOn Friday, two people were injured in an explosion in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. The blast destroyed a minivan, which according to Ukrainian media reports was transporting the leader of a local volunteer battalion.\n\nWhile the White House has so far not approved sending lethal military aid to Ukraine, Kyiv\u2019s calls for help have resonated on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn Thursday, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, including House Speaker John Boehner and several top Democrats, called on the White House to send lethal aid to Ukraine to help defend against the Russian-backed separatists further escalating the conflict.\n\n\u201cWe should not wait until Russian troops and their separatist proxies take Mariupol or Kharkiv before we act to bolster the Ukrainian government\u2019s ability to deter and defend against further aggression,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in a letter to President Obama.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This past week one of Kyiv\u2019s most famous tourist spots was filled with evidence of the nearly year-old war in eastern Ukraine.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This past week one of Kyiv\u2019s most famous tourist spots was filled with evidence of the nearly year-old war in eastern Ukraine.", "title": "Ukraine Showcases Captured Russian Military Hardware", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150306_RussiaMilitary.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-21T22:29:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1E0qsNl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This past week one of Kyiv\u2019s most famous tourist spots was filled with evidence of the nearly year-old war in eastern Ukraine.", "title": "Ukraine Showcases Captured Russian Military Hardware", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150306_RussiaMilitary.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Ukraine", "published_time": "2015-03-06T14:13:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T22:29:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, Russian military, Kiev, military hardware, St. Michael\u2019s Square, Kremlin, cease-fire, lethal aid"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f7c\"", "article_summary": "According to the Ukrainian military, the Russian military hardware on display in St. Michael\u2019s Square was captured from pro-Russia separatists during recent battles.\nAccording to a Ukrainian information placard accompanying the display, the tank was never a part of the Ukrainian military, underscoring its Russian provenance.\nThe captured equipment is proof, Ukrainian officials claim, of the Kremlin\u2019s complicity in the ongoing conflict.\nThe military hardware currently on display in Kyiv includes a Russian T-64 tank captured on June 13, 2014, during a battle between Ukrainian government troops and separatist rebels outside the eastern Ukrainian town Slavyansk.\nAlexei Lebed said, speaking about the evolution of military hardware used by the pro-Russian separatists over the course of the 10-month-old conflict."}
