Barack Obama, still only president-elect, yet to take the vow, was about to waltz blithely into a White House mired up to its pretty marbled porte-coch\u00e8res in the bankers\u2019 legacy of heaving wet goat dung, a storm-wash of financial oomska that was about to leave America unemployed and broke.\n\nThe way in which deals were done and compromises battered out was as absorbing as any episode of The West Wing or Veep\n\nThe greatest financial crisis since the 30s. An entirely new, untested team \u2013 and they move them all in, not just aides and lawyers and PR flacks and others miserably prone to misuse of the noun \u201cimpact\u201d, but pot-plant ladies and those metrosexual wizards who can tell you if a picture\u2019s hanging straight. The one good thing they all had going for them, as so patiently and painstakingly documented by Norma Percy and director Paul Mitchell in the first instalment of their captivating tale of the first 100 days Inside Obama\u2019s White House, was of course Obama himself, a man so effortlessly cool he can walk up stairs with his hands in his pockets. It\u2019s a daredevil trick George W is still only practising with stabilisers and friendly line-of-sight holograms.\n\nThere was tremendous access and there were trenchant insights, not least from chief Obama strategist David Axelrod, who rued the simple fact that \u201cwe hadn\u2019t had a holy shit! moment when people realised just how serious the problem was\u201d. They soon did, however, and it was on Obama to push through the largest stimulus package \u2013 $831bn \u2013 in US history. FDR\u2019s New Deal cost only about $50bn, and remember that in those days 20 workers with shovels could be gainfully employed to do the work done today by one arse-scratching bozo with a hydraulic backhoe.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018A man so effortlessly cool he can walk up stairs with his hands in his pockets\u2019: President Barack Obama being briefed in the Oval Office, January 2009. Photograph: Pete Souza/BBC/The White House\n\nThe manner in which deals were done, compromises battered out, backs scratched, was as absorbing as any episode of The West Wing or Veep. Along the way we got to marvel over the Democrats\u2019 honest mystification at just why resentful and now irrelevant Republicans were blocking their every bill. It was like watching the very bored kicking of a soft-eyed spaniel. But we also got to see Obama in full resplendent charisma, barging through a corridor at the Copenhagen climate summit to charm, ingratiate and, frankly, embarrass a dirty little cabal of naysayers into yaysaying.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m not only amazed that he managed so much in relatively little time \u2013 that stimulus, Obamacare, the bailout of bloodily mismanaged Chrysler, vaulting investment in renewables, continuation of the revered tradition of America making an entire toley of itself on the world stage \u2013 but that he didn\u2019t simply retreat, in those first few weeks, to a beach in Lahaina, with a bucket of mai tais and a finger to the world, like a black Bill Hicks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Rather good\u2019: Last Week Tonight host John Oliver. Photograph: Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nOne perfect adjunct for the nights before Inside the White House airs (and also on for the next few weeks) is Last Week Tonight. It\u2019s hosted by British (Brummie) comedian John Oliver, who is rather good. Oliver recaps, with relatively dry humour and unshowy style, the past seven days in US politics, which is extremely useful these days as we eagerly await further announcements of outsize walls and humorous stereotypes. It\u2019s all a bit too Saturday Night Live \u2013 too-obvious joke banners flashing up and inviting one to muse on the surprising premise that no American, even though some of them are quite old, might ever have been exposed to the word \u201cfuck\u201d. But it\u2019s timely, and half wise, and Oliver lessens the buttock-clenching shame in our having tried to give them Piers Morgan, like the drunk at a party forgetfully offering you the spat-out canape.\n\nThe documentary Behind Closed Doors was almost unwatchable \u2013 literally so, in the case of a friend of mine who has undergone the coy term \u201cdomestic abuse\u201d. The courage of those women \u2013 Sabrina, Jemma, Helen \u2013 who allowed themselves to be filmed, through a year in Thames Valley and the later outcomes, was matched only by the cowardice of the big men who beat them and later cried, aptly, like little failures.\n\nIt starts of course with emotional abuse, emotional control. I\u2019d love a foot rub\u2026 moves on to: why haven\u2019t you given me a foot rub yet\u2026 foot rub, you fat lazy bitch\u2026 and, within a dainty little month, it\u2019s Lawrence Feek\u2019s boot-marks on Helen\u2019s face.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jemma, one of the victims of domestic abuse in the \u2018horrendous and necessary\u2019 Behind Closed Doors. Photograph: BBC/True Vision Aire\n\nHelen, with catastrophic stupidity, agreed to meet the loser Lawrence, and the resultant fallout \u2013 heads in hands from clever lawyers as she was caught on CCTV bouncing into a bar with smiles for an Easter \u201ctreat\u201d \u2013 woeful to behold. Helen\u2019s hands shook like someone gripped with palsy when taking the call about Lawrence\u2019s (nugatory, allowing him to flee this country) sentencing. She is, entirely possibly, both still in love with and terrified by him. In love with fat, ugly, charmless, pigmouth Lawrence. But that\u2019s the thing with love. Go explain. What I wanted this, or some, series to do was to explain the need that women have to love \u2013 no, not to love, that\u2019s a universal \u2013 but to love men in particular, with their egos and smelly teeth and needy \u201cneeds\u201d.\n\nStewart Lee said in an earlier broadcast that \u201cno one is equipped to review me\u201d. That\u2019s me told, bless him. The alleged theme of last week\u2019s Comedy Vehicle was patriotism. He could so easily have been lazy. Stew is many bastarding things, but lazy isn\u2019t one.\n\nSomehow, he managed \u2013 mouth-farting into a mic \u2013 to turn a full three minutes of the sounds of a cat\u2019s diarrhoea into the most plosive and gorgeous argument against deference. It was wonderful, and I still stand and applaud its sculpted perfection. A man mouth-farting into a microphone, while mumbling the national anthem badly and talking about cat shit shouldn\u2019t have been subtle, but somehow it and its wider points were, and clog-brained oversentimental deference might want to pipe down for a bit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest As good as it gets\u2026 Sarah Lancashire in Happy Valley.
