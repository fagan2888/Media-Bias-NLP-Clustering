Updated post at 8:31 p.m. by Tasha Tsiaperas: Oncor officials say about 10,000 customers are still without power Sunday night.

Crews are still working late into the evening to restore power in North Texas after a storm with strong winds blew through the area Thursday. Officials expect that only about 3,000 customers will still be without power by Monday morning, said Oncor spokesman Kris Spears.

Many of the final 3,000 outages are due to damage to electrical lines and equipment on the affected homes and businesses, Spears said. Some people will have to contact an electrician for repairs before Oncor can restore power, he said.

“We certainly understand the hardship this has caused many customers,” Spears said.

About 300,000 customers lost power after the storm Thursday. Arlington officials said about 2,500 houses and businesses were still without power Sunday evening. But, power had been restored in all Arlington schools. All Dallas schools will be open Monday.

Arlington ISD and more than 40 schools in Dallas closed Friday due to lack of electricity.

A note on its website says the company has brought power back to 270,000 customers since big storms wreaked havoc Thursday in North Texas. The number of power outages was up to about 85,000 Saturday.

Oncor hopes to have 95 percent of its customers who lost power back up by this evening.

Up to 302,000 customers had their lights go out Thursday evening.

Thousands of mutual aid electricity workers from other cities and states are helping out Oncor.
