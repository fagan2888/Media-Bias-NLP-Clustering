For Americans Zach Redmond and Nate Guenin, among others, it was Christmas all over. Gabe Landeskog, a Swede, and Russian Mikhail Grigorenko felt little emotion but were similarly as interested.\n\nThey all watched parts of the World Junior Championship showdown between the United States and Canada on television before their practice began. The under-20 Americans, as the players learned, scored two late goals to win 4-2 in Helsinki in what would become hockey\u2019s story of the day.\n\nThe average U.S. audience, however, still doesn\u2019t get it. To them, the annual WJC is too junior to be associated with anything big. They don\u2019t realize that virtually every WJC player will become a bona fide or borderline NHL player and the WJC is the best international hockey tournament outside the Olympics.\n\nEven the annual World Championship \u2014 open to all ages \u2014 doesn\u2019t compare because it\u2019s conducted during the NHL playoffs and always absent of many of the world\u2019s top players.\n\nAll the great ones played in the WJC or dreamed of it \u2014 particularly Canadian boys who equate it to the NCAA\u2019s College Football Playoff or basketball\u2019s Final Four. And thus far Canada is king, having won the WJC gold medal 16 times since 1982, including five-year runs from 1993-97 and 2005-09.\n\nThe U.S. won\u2019t always be North America\u2019s little brother when it comes to hockey. The Americans got their name in the mix by winning the WJC gold medal in 2004, then twice in a four-year span (2010 and 2013).\n\nThis year, three prominent American teenagers \u2014 Jack Eichel (Sabres), Dylan Larkin (Red Wings) and Noah Hanifin (Hurricanes) \u2014 aren\u2019t playing in the WJC because their NHL team won\u2019t allow it. Only Canada had that problem previously.\n\nColorado \u2014 like Minnesota, Michigan and Massachusetts \u2014 has had multiple local WJC story lines since Colorado College defenseman Mark Stuart captained Team USA in 2004, a gold medal-winning club that also featured University of Denver defenseman Matt Carle. Stuart (Jets) and Carle (Lightning) are still in The Show.\n\nThis year no CC or DU players are at the WJC, but Coloradans Scott Eansor and Brandon Carlo are playing for Colorado Springs-based USA Hockey in Helsinki. Eansor is a 5-foot-8 forward from Englewood and Carlo is a 6-4 defenseman from Colorado Springs.\n\nBoth played triple-A midget hockey for metro Denver\u2019s Colorado Thunderbirds, who compete nationally in hockey\u2019s highest youth level along with the Westminster-based Rocky Mountain RoughRiders, Colorado Springs\u2019 Pikes Peak Minors and the Colorado Rampage of Monument.\n\nCarlo, a two-time WJC participant, was the blue-line partner of University of Denver defenseman Will Butcher last year and has already signed his NHL entry-level contract with the Bruins.\n\nYou can\u2019t be a big-time Colorado hockey fan and not recognize the WJC for what it is: big-time hockey.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers @denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chambers: World Junior Championship should be must-see TV", "title": "Chambers: World Junior Championship should be must-see TV", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/26/chambers-world-junior-championship-should-be-must-see-tv/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T19:16:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:44:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd97ea\"", "article_summary": "You can\u2019t be a big-time Colorado hockey fan and not recognize the WJC for what it is: big-time hockey.\nThey all watched parts of the World Junior Championship showdown between the United States and Canada on television before their practice began.\nAnd thus far Canada is king, having won the WJC gold medal 16 times since 1982, including five-year runs from 1993-97 and 2005-09.\nThe Americans got their name in the mix by winning the WJC gold medal in 2004, then twice in a four-year span (2010 and 2013).\nEansor is a 5-foot-8 forward from Englewood and Carlo is a 6-4 defenseman from Colorado Springs."}
