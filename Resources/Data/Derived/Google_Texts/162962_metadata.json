The dentist took a look and thought it might be a swollen lymph gland.\n\nChances are, it\u2019s nothing, he told Medved. But go see an ear, nose and throat guy.\n\nMedved did, and that doctor did a CT scan right there, with a medical student tagging along. They left, and a little while later, came back in.\n\n\u201cYou have cancer,\u201d the doctor told Medved. The student burst into tears.\n\nAnd Medved, 66, a respected voice of conservative America was, quite suddenly, speechless.\n\n\u201cIt was so out of the blue,\u201d Medved said the other day of his stage 3 throat cancer.\n\nAfter four months of almost daily radiation and weekly chemotherapy treatments, he is cancer-free and \u2014 as of April 21 \u2014 back on the air at Seattle\u2019s KTTH 770-AM, where his weekday show is broadcast. Medved is syndicated through the Salem Radio Network and reaches almost 5 million listeners a week.\n\nOn Medved\u2019s first day back, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush came in \u2014 the only Seattle media he did before a fundraiser that night. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal called in to wish Medved well. So did Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan. (\u201cPaul went on for a while. He is one of the nicest people in politics.\u201d)\n\nAll have a stake in the GOP\u2019s showing in the upcoming presidential election \u2014 and are surely relieved to have Medved back on the air.\n\n\u201cI worked my whole life to be part of the national conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the start of an election?\u201d\n\nThere are those who are sorry to see him return to the airwaves \u2014 and told him so. One commenter said, \u201cI wish the cancer had killed you,\u201d a line Medved mentioned more than once as I drove him home from the station the other day.\n\nI didn\u2019t recognize him at first; he\u2019s lost 41 pounds and wears a baseball hat to cover the fact that his full head of hair has turned to fuzz. He\u2019s not allowed to drive because of the medication he\u2019s taking, so he climbed into my car and took in the ukulele-playing, shorts-wearing Barack Obama figure stuck to my dashboard. I picked it up in Hawaii, I told him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conversation starter,\u201d Medved said. Neither of us mentioned it again.\n\nAt his Eastside home, Medved\u2019s wife, Diane, had put out a plate of apples and cheese \u2014 but not for her husband, who hooked up a feeding machine he carries in a small backpack. His taste buds are \u201czapped,\u201d he said, and the sides of his mouth sore from the radiation.\n\nHe is looking forward to solid food like his wife\u2019s salmon with tarragon and maybe a kosher pizza.\n\nBut he\u2019s also hungry to divine the future of the country. The presidential candidates. And the issues, including health care.\n\nMedved is on Sound Path, a supplement of Medicare. Just for the record.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very impatient with people who say Obamacare has wrecked our medical-care system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s insulting to doctors and medical staff. It\u2019s operating well, and it\u2019s a system that cared for me.\n\n\u201cMy experience will inform everything I talk about from here on out.\u201d\n\nMedved started cancer treatment Jan. 5 and decided to work through it. He only told his producer, Jeremy Steiner, and the general manager of the Bonneville Radio offices in Seattle.\n\nOn Jan. 25, when he was invited to speak at The Roanoke Conference, a conservative group, on the Washington coast,his wife drove him, fixed his hair to cover up the parts lost to radiation and waited anxiously while he spoke (with both hands firmly holding the sides of the podium) and signed books.\n\nOn their way across the parking lot to their hotel room, Medved fell into a puddle. That was it.\n\nThe next Friday, he told the people at the station what was going on, and posted \u201cA Personal Note to My Radio Family\u201d on his website, explaining what was going on. (Within an hour, 25,000 people posted comments.)\n\nThen he signed off for more than two months and faced his cancer. (Colleague David Boze, \u201ca prince of a guy,\u201d filled in the noon to 3 p.m. slot), along with others.\n\n\u201cHad my voice sustained it, I would have tried to keep going longer,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked how his cancer experience changed him, Medved borrowed from a quote often attributed to Coach Vince Lombardi, but that actually came from UCLA Bruins Coach Henry Russell \u201cRed\u201d Sanders: \u201cWinning isn\u2019t everything; it\u2019s the only thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s \u2018Family isn\u2019t everything; it\u2019s the only thing,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt just reminds you.\u201d\n\nHis wife \u201cis like the sun coming up.\u201d His two daughters and son were loving and attentive. His new daughter-in-law, Richelle, is about to graduate from nursing school, and used all her skills to help him.\n\n\u201cIt makes you realize how precious the little things are,\u201d he said. \u201cWaking up in your own bed. Food.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s plenty to chew on, now that candidates are announcing for 2016 \u2014 Medved has counted as many as 20 in the Republican Party alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a messy race,\u201d Medved said.\n\nHe attended Yale Law School with Hillary Rodham Clinton and doesn\u2019t agree with the conservative portrayal of her as a \u201cwicked witch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think she\u2019s wrong on the issues. The election should go to the candidate who shows the best path for the country. Not the one who is the biggest bastard,\u201d Medved said of today\u2019s acrimonious political climate. \u201cIf it is Hillary versus Jeb, they\u2019re both better than that, and highly capable of arguing on an constructive and patriotic level.\u201d\n\nFor now, Medved is back working on his 14th book, \u201cGod\u2019s Hand on America: The Case for Divine Providence in U.S. History,\u201d for which his publisher, Random House, gave him an extension.\n\nHe has cut back from three or four movie reviews a week to just two.\n\nAnd he\u2019s back on the air, booking guests like John McCain and Rand Paul.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right time for me to come back,\u201d he said. \u201cI have strong feelings about the election. But mostly, I hope this is an uplifting election for the country.\u201d\n\nIt is already that for Medved: He is here to see it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a bout with throat cancer, the conservative radio host and movie critic is looking forward to being part of the 2016 conversation.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "After a bout with throat cancer, the conservative radio host and movie critic is looking forward to being part of the 2016 conversation.", "title": "Michael Medved: Beating cancer \u2018will inform everything I talk about from here on out\u2019", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/life/michael-medved-beating-cancer-will-inform-everything-i-talk-about-from-here-on-out/", "image": {"width": 1560, "identifier": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fc0be78a-e93d-11e4-90c1-6d1fa27c8ec1-1560x1040.jpg", "height": 1040}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a bout with throat cancer, the conservative radio host and movie critic is looking forward to being part of the 2016 conversation.", "creator": "@nicolebrodeur", "site": "@seattletimes", "card": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fc0be78a-e93d-11e4-90c1-6d1fa27c8ec1-780x520.jpg", "title": "Michael Medved: Beating cancer \u2018will inform everything I talk about from here on out\u2019"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Life", "published_time": "2015-05-01 10:46:04", "modified_time": "2015-05-01 18:06:28"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Life, Local News"}, "article_summary": "And so it was when Michael Medved, a nationally syndicated, conservative radio host, was getting his teeth cleaned last December.\n\u201cIt was so out of the blue,\u201d Medved said the other day of his stage 3 throat cancer.\nAfter a bout with throat cancer, the conservative radio host and movie critic is looking forward to being part of the 2016 conversation.\n\u201cYou have cancer,\u201d the doctor told Medved.\nChances are, it\u2019s nothing, he told Medved."}
