If, for instance, you made too much money to qualify for Medicaid, weren\u2019t old enough to qualify for Medicare, never served in the military, and didn\u2019t work for a large employer, you probably had to pay for your own insurance. If you were low- or middle-income, or you had a preexisting condition, there was a decent chance you were uninsured, unable to obtain routine care and at constant risk of financial ruin.\n\nAdd \u2019em all up and we\u2019re talking about upward of 50 million people.\n\nPart of the reason conservatives fought the Affordable Care Act so relentlessly, and continue to fantasize about its demise, is that it will ultimately fill that hole. Though flawed and inadequate in key ways, the safety net will now lack major structural gaps it just had. When conservatives warn that Obamacare will turn the United States into a European welfare state, they\u2019re being histrionic, but they\u2019re not being entirely disingenuous.\n\nThe extraordinary but ultimately failed efforts Republicans undertook in 2011 and 2012 to win back Congress and the White House \u2014 the direct assault on public sector unions, systematic disenfranchisement of minority voters, legislative sabotage on Capitol Hill \u2014 are perhaps best thought of as rearguard actions to prevent Obamacare from ever taking effect. To keep America from becoming Europe.\n\nObama\u2019s reelection was Game Over. GOP leaders understood this, even if rank-and-file Republicans and millions of Republican voters remain in denial about it.\n\nBut just because the American welfare state no longer lacks the linchpin of a healthcare guarantee doesn\u2019t mean the programs that compose it will lumber along in their current forms unchanged. In other words, the grueling ideological struggle over the shape and generosity of U.S. social programs will continue for years to come.\n\nEnter a snarky, unconventional but ultimately innocuous Rolling Stone article by Jesse Myerson. In it, he proposes five reforms that are pretty far-reaching relative to the country\u2019s existing social and economic regime, and would in fact dramatically alter the balance of economic and political power in America.\n\nWhen you strip away the comedic framing, though, they\u2019re a fairly straightforward mix of progressive and radical-centrist reforms. (See Matt Yglesias for a complete breakdown.)\n\nBut conservatives went absolutely apeshit. So severe was the apoplexy that they failed to recognize that included in these ideas were a bunch of things conservatives like \u2014 replacing income taxes and replacing paternalistic welfare programs with cash transfers \u2014 and that already exist successfully in the non-communist world. It was amazing.\n\nIn their rendering, Myerson hadn\u2019t sketched out a road to serfdom. He\u2019d planned a massive frog-march to Siberia for our society.\n\nPart of this was emotional affect. Myerson\u2019s Twitter bio is satirically hashtagged #FULLCOMMUNISM. Combine that with the article\u2019s hyperbolic framing and many conservatives reacted tribally.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives' overreaction to one progressive writer speaks volumes about their ongoing war against the safety net", "title": "The right\u2019s latest freakout \u2014 and why they\u2019re crying \u201ccommunism\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Conservatives' overreaction to one progressive writer speaks volumes about their ongoing war against the safety net", "title": "The right\u2019s latest freakout \u2014 and why they\u2019re crying \u201ccommunism\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/07/the_rights_latest_freakout_and_why_theyre_crying_communism/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/paul_rubio_cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives' overreaction to one progressive writer speaks volumes about their ongoing war against the safety net", "title": "The right\u2019s latest freakout \u2014 and why they\u2019re crying \u201ccommunism\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/paul_rubio_cruz.jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Beutler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama, Communism, Editor's Picks, Medicaid, Obamacare, Rolling Stone, safety net", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Though flawed and inadequate in key ways, the safety net will now lack major structural gaps it just had.\nWhen conservatives warn that Obamacare will turn the United States into a European welfare state, they\u2019re being histrionic, but they\u2019re not being entirely disingenuous.\nTopics: Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama, Communism, Editor's Picks, Medicaid, Obamacare, Rolling Stone, safety net, Politics NewsPrior to Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, healthcare access was the gaping hole in the country\u2019s tattered, patchwork safety net.\nWhen you strip away the comedic framing, though, they\u2019re a fairly straightforward mix of progressive and radical-centrist reforms.\nPart of the reason conservatives fought the Affordable Care Act so relentlessly, and continue to fantasize about its demise, is that it will ultimately fill that hole."}
