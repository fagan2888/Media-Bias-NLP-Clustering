Police say they have identified the gunman who took his own life after killing his ex-wife, another adult and two children in a quiet, suburban neighborhood outside Atlanta.

The Douglas County Sheriff's Office on Sunday said 33-year-old Cedric G. Prather died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after shooting six people Saturday afternoon in Douglasville, about 20 miles west of Atlanta. A hometown for Prather was not given.

The sheriff's office on Sunday identified the two adults who were killed as Latoya A. Andrews, Prather's ex-wife; and Joseph Terry Brown. Both were 33 years old. Authorities haven't released the identities of the two children killed. Two other children are in critical condition at an Atlanta area hospital.

A gunman has shot seven people, killing five of them, in a subdivision west of Atlanta, Georgia.

Douglas County Sheriff's Lt. Glenn Daniel said authorities received a 911 call Saturday reporting a shooting in Douglasville around 3 p.m.

Daniel said five people were killed, including several children.

The gunman was among those injured. He was taken a hospital.

Investigators have not released the names of the suspect or the victims because their family members have not yet been notified. The motive of the shooting was not immediately clear.
