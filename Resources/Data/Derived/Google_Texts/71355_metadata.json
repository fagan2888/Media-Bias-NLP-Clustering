The average premium for the cheapest, medium-coverage plan will be $489 per month. That\u2019s the most expensive in the country.\n\nWyoming Insurance Commissioner Tom Hirsig says insurance premiums are driven by the cost of care, so states with large metropolitan centers are likely to have more doctors, more competition, and lower premiums.\n\n\u201cWyoming has always been toward the top of health insurance costs. You know, we\u2019re a very rural population. You know, we have towns where there might be one or two doctors.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hirsig says that the amount a person or family actually pays will depend on their income, and many American families will qualify for subsidies that will lower their payments. For example, a family of four making $50,000 per year would pay about $282 per month for mid-range coverage. A family with higher income would pay much more.\n\nHirsig says the only way for Wyomingites to know their individual rates is to log in to the state\u2019s healthcare marketplace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just gonna be so specific to each individual as far as cost, subsidies. Get in the exchange and take a look. See what you qualify for, and see if it makes sense for you.\u201d\n\nAlthough health care marketplaces go online in October 1, coverage won\u2019t go into effect until January first. Wyomingites have until March 15 to obtain health coverage \u2013 if not through the marketplace, then through work or private purchase. Marketplace enrollment will close on March 15 until a new period in autumn. Anyone without health insurance after March 15 will pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nHirsig says an enrollment deadline will keep people from gaming the new health care system.\n\n\u201cIf there was no open enrollment period, why wouldn\u2019t you just wait until you got sick, and then enroll in health insurance? Since it\u2019s guarantee-issue, they can\u2019t deny you for health conditions, everybody would just wait until they had to go to the hospital and then they\u2019d enroll in the health insurance.\u201d\n\nHirsig says IRS penalties in 2015 will be $95 per uninsured person for the year, or onepercent of their income, whichever is higher. Hirsig adds that those penalties will increase each year.\n\nHirsig says people interested in shopping around Wyoming\u2019s marketplace should be sure to go to the https://www.healthcare.gov/ to avoid scams, not other web sites.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Starting October first, Wyomingites will be able to go online and shop for medical insurance coverage from the participating providers in the states", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wyomingpublicmedia.org/post/wyoming-can-expect-highest-premiums-country-its-health-care-marketplace", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wpr/files/styles/medium/public/201309/bigstockphoto_health_care_reform_green_road__5632944.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Starting October first, Wyomingites will be able to go online and shop for medical insurance coverage from the participating providers in the states", "title": "Wyoming can expect highest premiums in the country from its health care marketplace"}, "wordCount": 494, "twitter": {"site": "@WYPublicRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WYPublicRadio"}, "author": "Rebecca Martinez", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Wyoming can expect highest premiums in the country from its health care marketplace"}, "nid": 47482, "datePublished": "2013-09-25", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Healthcare reform, health care, Health insurance mandate, health insurance marketplace, health insurance, wyoming", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Hirsig says an enrollment deadline will keep people from gaming the new health care system.\n\u201cWyoming has always been toward the top of health insurance costs.\n\u201cIf there was no open enrollment period, why wouldn\u2019t you just wait until you got sick, and then enroll in health insurance?\nStarting October first, Wyomingites will be able to go online and shop for medical insurance coverage from the participating providers in the state\u2019s insurance marketplace.\nWyomingites have until March 15 to obtain health coverage \u2013 if not through the marketplace, then through work or private purchase."}
