With this news came renewed uncertainty for recent college graduates, many of whom are new entrants into the U.S. workforce.\n\nNotably, the unemployment rate for those ages 16 to 34 increased from 9 percent to 9.2 percent in May, and from 10.6 percent to 11.1 percent for 20- to 24-year-olds. Most Wall Street strategists and analysts say the job market is still a long way from where it should be.\n\n\u201cAre we really creating enough jobs to bring people back into the work force? We\u2019re not and we need to create more,\u201d Byron Wien, a Wall Street strategist, told The New York Times.\n\nFor Millennials and recent grads, the situation remains bleak.\n\n\n\nLast August, the Pew Research Center\u2019s analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data found that 36 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds were living in their parents\u2019 home \u2013 the highest share in at least four decades.\n\nNot only will the slew of grads this month face a tough job market, but many Millennials still languish in this economic recession.\n\nTake Alexis Gallagher, a 2013 graduate of Towson University who still cannot find a job in her field and lives with her parents.\n\nGallagher graduated with a B.S. in political science and mass communication and a concentration in journalism, was president and editor in chief of the Pre-Law Journal, and president of the Pre-Law Society at Towson. In addition to maintaining a 3.5 GPA, she interned three days per week on Capitol Hill, for which she had to travel from Baltimore, and also held a few part-time jobs throughout her college years.\n\nInstead of heading straight to law school upon graduating, Gallagher decided to jump into the job market first.\n\n\u201cIdeally I am interested in economic policy, so I would want to work in an economic think tank,\u201d she said in an interview with The College Fix. \u201cI started looking for jobs in public affairs and corporate communications, but have broadened my search to administrative roles and marketing jobs.\u201d\n\nBut her current job situation hasn\u2019t been what she expected. Currently living at home in Atlantic County, New Jersey, she has been working at The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa as a cocktail server.\n\n\u201cI make really good money,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is not at all what I want to do \u2013 especially with a college degree.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, she has been saving her money since she moved back home with her parents. She took the LSAT on Monday, and depending on her score, is considering applying to law schools in the fall.\n\nIn light of the most recent unemployment numbers and a grim outlook for recent college graduates, the Republican National Committee is saying enough is enough.\n\n\u201cMillennials propelled Obama into the White House, but all we\u2019ve seen are more regulations and fewer jobs,\u201d said Raffi Williams, an RNC spokesman. \u201cNearly 6 in 10 Americans now believe the American Dream is out of reach, but Republicans know we can do better\u2014for my generation and for all Americans.\u201d\n\nGallagher echoed these sentiments.\n\nShe blames \u201cgovernment regulation and tax policies\u201d as one of the main reasons recent graduates like herself cannot find good jobs.\n\n\u201cMinimum wage laws, overtime pay mandates, payroll taxes, unemployment insurance, and healthcare regulations all make it more expensive to employ labor, which then impacts the number of employees a firm will hire,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother significant reason is uncertainty, she said.\n\n\u201cMany firms do not know what the economy will look like in a few months, so they are more reluctant to hire more workers,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also put blame on President Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement in office, the Affordable Care Act, calling it an \u201cadded expense\u201d for many businesses.\n\nDebbie Wasserman-Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, tweeted on Sunday that her party will talk extensively about student debt this upcoming week, citing President Obama\u2019s weekly address titled \u201cSupporting America\u2019s Students.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama said in his address that \u201cwe have to do more to lift that burden\u201d of student loan debt, vowing to do whatever he can without Congress to help young people pay off their student debt more easily.\n\nBut Raffi Williams of the RNC accused Democrats of playing politics with the issue.\n\n\u201cDue to the Obama economy Millennials are stuck at home with their parents unable to find work,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cInstead of putting forth serious legislation like the dozens of House passed pro-growth bills that sit on Harry Reid\u2019s desk, Obama and the Democrats continue to play politics with the future of young Americans everywhere.\u201d\n\nLike most Millennials, Alexis Gallagher said she remains hopeful that the economy will improve.\n\nCollege Fix contributor Andrew Desiderio is a student at The George Washington University.\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\nIMAGE: UGL_UIUC/Flickr", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "Grads struggle with sluggish economy; move home, take jobs unrelated to field of study.", "title": "Jobless Millennials: Recent College Grads Move Back in with Parents - The College Fix", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 490, "identifier": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/StudyingStudent.UGL_UIUC.Flickr.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/17917/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/StudyingStudent.UGL_UIUC.Flickr.jpg", "description": "Grads struggle with sluggish economy; move home, take jobs unrelated to field of study.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jobless Millennials: Recent College Grads Move Back in with Parents - The College Fix"}, "fb": {"admins": "672627547,1540010264,100009162449428", "app_id": 1559699120988871}, "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "unemployment", "published_time": "2014-06-10T00:39:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde78a\"", "article_summary": "While the latest job numbers suggest a slight improvement in the U.S. economy, jobless Millennials \u2013 especially recent college graduates \u2013 continue to struggle.\nWith this news came renewed uncertainty for recent college graduates, many of whom are new entrants into the U.S. workforce.\nIn light of the most recent unemployment numbers and a grim outlook for recent college graduates, the Republican National Committee is saying enough is enough.\nShe blames \u201cgovernment regulation and tax policies\u201d as one of the main reasons recent graduates like herself cannot find good jobs.\n\u201cDue to the Obama economy Millennials are stuck at home with their parents unable to find work,\u201d he said in a statement."}
