The Topeka chapter celebrated by awarding a scholarship to a female student at Washburn Institute of Technology. They had planned to teach a Girl Scout troop how to make wooden desk calendars using kits on Sunday, but had to put off that event because of snow.\n\nTammy Botkin, a project manager assistant at Torgeson Electric and member of the Topeka chapter of Women in Construction, said they want to get girls interested in the construction industry before they reach middle school and start making serious decisions about their academic and career paths.\n\n\u201cThey start talking to the school counselors and they\u2019re all \u2018College, college, college,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nAs of 2011, about 828,000 women were working in the construction sector, meaning they accounted for about 9 percent of construction employees, according to NAWIC. That was down from a high of 1,131,000, but may have reflected overall job losses in the sector during the recession, rather than a lower percentage of women seeking construction careers.\n\nAbout 443,000 women, or about 54 percent of the total in the construction industry, worked in sales and office jobs in the sector. Another 236,000, or 29 percent, worked in management or professional services related to construction.\n\nJaclyn Revelle, who received a $1,500 scholarship from the group at a luncheon at McFarland\u2019s on Wednesday, said she is the only female in the heavy construction equipment program. Revelle, of Topeka, will graduate from Washburn Tech in May.\n\nOut of 118 students in five construction-related programs at Washburn Tech, five are female, according to Lori Hutchinson, spokewoman for the school. Overall, about 40 percent of the school\u2019s students are female, with many gravitating toward the health services programs, she said.\n\nRevelle said being the only female in the program hasn\u2019t been difficult.\n\n\u201cWe all have got a great sense of humor, so it works out pretty great,\u201d she said.\n\nIt helps to have physical strength when operating heavy equipment, Revelle said, but the mental side is equally important because of the information operators need to know about safety and maintenance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more than just operating the equipment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also checking the fluids and keeping (the machines) clean.\u201d\n\nSally Jackson, of Topeka, also was the only female in her construction classes at Washburn Tech. She graduated from Washburn Tech in 2011 and now she is an apprentice working with a licensed electrician. She said she needs about six months more experience before she can take the test to get her license.\n\n\u201cI had a really good class of gentlemen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too bad for me.\u201d\n\nJackson said she liked building things from an early age. She and her siblings would build forts and bridges across creeks, and when they got older the family worked on community service projects together.\n\nIn the past, girls were less likely to get early exposure to building concepts. Sue Schilling, who does safety inspections for KBS Construction and is president of the Topeka chapter of Women in Construction, said girls in her school didn\u2019t take shop because it was offered at the same time as their required physical education class, and it wasn\u2019t discussed as a career option. She started as a construction laborer about 18 years ago and then moved into the warehouse before reaching her current position.\n\nGirls who are interested in the construction industry need to take the initiative to learn about it, Revelle said, because others may not think to introduce them to it. Her first contact with the industry came from following her dad to work in his restoration and remodeling business.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to jump in there and get in with the guys,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t let them intimidate you either. Just get in there and do your job.\u201d\n\nJackson said some people underestimate her abilities because she is only about 5-foot-3-inches and doesn\u2019t have a large frame. While she can\u2019t lift as much as some of the larger workers, she said being smaller is an advantage when they need to work in tight spaces.\n\nThe mental side of electrical work is a strength for her, Jackson said. Electricians need to be focused on details, which is an area where women can excel, she said.\n\n\u201cGoing in expecting resistance, but also knowing you have advantages, is good because you can focus on your strengths,\u201d she said. \u201cMy size is not really a handicap.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Business, News, Local, Megan Hart, Local business", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Women still are a relatively rare sight on construction projects, but some of them working in the industry in Topeka are trying to show girls it can be a source of opportunity.", "title": "Topeka women in construction try to get more girls involved", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/business/2014-03-08/topeka-women-construction-try-get-more-girls-involved", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13149164.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Women still are a relatively rare sight on construction projects, but some of them working in the industry in Topeka are trying to show girls it can be a source of opportunity.The National Association of Women in Construction observed Women in Construction Week from March 2 to 8.
