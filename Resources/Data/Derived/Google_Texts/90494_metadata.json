First, though, a short rant\u2026\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is the most convoluted law ever written by any government in human history\u2026 or animal history or plant history. (Although I hear a few plant governments have gotten quite anti-oxygen and are writing some pretty stringent O-emission laws.)\n\nObamaCare\u2019s 380,000 words of dense legalese give it the bizarre distinction as the first law ever on which every adult, child and infant holds a strong opinion, but that not a single human has actually read. And if anyone out there has tried to plow through this thing cover to cover, let\u2019s hope that among the law\u2019s insurance \u201cmandatories\u201d is treatment for masochism, or flat-out lunacy.\n\nOkay. The healthcare law is a mess.\n\nBut what in the world are the people at H&R Block thinking with their new multi-zillion-dollar \u201cHelpth\u201d campaign?\n\nAs I understand it from the billboards and the commercials and the company\u2019s website, Helpth is H&R Block\u2019s program to help people find the best possible insurance policy under the complex new rules of ObamaCare. It\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d for \u201chealth\u201d insurance. Get it?\n\nH&R Block obviously realized this incomprehensible new law would leave millions of Americans confused about their health insurance. And they saw a business opportunity in addressing the problem. Sounds smart.\n\nBut when it came time to name their program \u2014 a program they claim will help clarify things for health-insurance consumers \u2014 H&R Block chose a bowl of letter salad, making up a word that\u2019s meaningless, nearly unpronounceable, and that looks like a typo.\n\nOn the typo issue: I know they know it looks like a typo, because they actually devote one of their billboards to reassuring us it\u2019s not a typo. That ad reads: \u201cHelpth. It\u2019s not a typo.\u201d (That\u2019s right, dear reader. We mean to look this dumb.)\n\nOn the unpronounceable issue: Try it yourself. Say \u201chelpth\u201d out loud. It\u2019s as though you\u2019ve got a bee sting on your tongue, and \u2014 appropriately enough \u2014 you\u2019re calling for help. (That\u2019s right, dear reader. We don\u2019t care if you sound this dumb.)\n\nOh, one more side note: Actually, they call it HelpthSM, with that little service-mark symbol, which I think is hilarious. (Sorry, competitors. Find your own gobbledygook name. This one\u2019s ours.)\n\nWhy would a respected organization, in business for 60 years, run ads like this? Does H&R Block think we\u2019re so stupid that we need tiny, one-syllable words to explain complex concepts \u2014 even if those words have to be made up? Another of their ads, the one pictured here, reads, \u201cHelpth. It\u2019s as simple as it sounds.\u201d Excuse me, but what is as simple as it sounds?\n\nActually, I don\u2019t blame H&R Block entirely. Their mistake was to trust the advice of their advertising agency, an ad agency they probably paid many millions of dollars to name the Helpth program. And that agency terribly abused H&R Block\u2019s trust.\n\nOne of the agency\u2019s creative folks was probably playing around with the words \u201chealth\u201d and \u201chelp\u201d and realized \u2014 Hey! \u2014 they have some of the same letters. Soon after that\u2026 Helpth! Look what I came up with!\n\nAnd that\u2019s the problem. H&R Block paid millions of dollars for a \u201clook what I came up with\u201d ad, not an ad that\u2019s designed to mean anything to its customers.\n\nI guess smashing the two words together to form a new one was clever, sort of. But who cares? Look: I can do it too. When my relatives get together for dinners, we have big arguments. They\u2019re relatiffs. Get it? Wait! I mean, RelatiffsSM. (Note to H&R Block: For your next ad campaign, hire some new helpth.)\n\nThe lesson: Always write with your reader in mind.\n\nThe good news here is that this advertising disaster provides us with a great reminder of the importance of writing always with our readers in mind (being \u201cyou-focused,\u201d as opposed to \u201cme-focused,\u201d as I like to say it).\n\n1. Write to resonate with your reader. Does helpth mean anything to anyone? Are any of us walking down the street thinking, \u201cI sure need some helpth?\u201d No. The concept ignores the reader altogether. Always place yourself in your reader\u2019s position as you write. Stay alert for passages you\u2019re writing that refer to information your reader might not have, details your reader won\u2019t care about, or concepts your reader won\u2019t understand. Your writing will be much clearer for it. 2. Remember that your reader is busy (and \u201cme-focused\u201d). Imagine: You\u2019re walking by a billboard or bus-stop bench and see the sign: \u201cHelpth. It\u2019s as simple as it sounds.\u201d Do you give it another second\u2019s thought? If you don\u2019t immediately understand it or think it applies to you, probably not. Don\u2019t demand your reader do any research or investigation to figure out what you\u2019re saying or asking for. That\u2019s your job. Besides, because your readers are busy and self-focused (as we all are), they won\u2019t do it anyway.\n\nToo bad for H&R Block, and for their potential customers. Assuming this helpth service they\u2019re offering is any good, a lot of people are going to miss discovering a potentially useful resource, because the idiotic Helpth sign won\u2019t get their attention. Unless they think it\u2019s a typo. Then maybe they\u2019ll stop for a second, just long enough to read the helpful subhead \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s not a typo\u201d \u2014 and then move on. I wouldn\u2019t blame them.\n\n\u00a9 2016 Robbie Hyman Copywriting. All rights reserved.
