NTE is also known as \u201csuper generics,\u201d \u201cvalue-added generics,\u201d or \u201chybrid generics.\u201d In the US, the term \u201csuper generics\u201d isn\u2019t recognized by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). They\u2019re the improved or enhanced version of approved drugs.\n\nSuper generics could be developed through a new route of administration, strength, dosage form, and combinations or device innovations to address specific patient needs.\n\nPlease refer to the above chart for the innovative techniques used to develop NTE. A few of the most popular ways to develop NTE are:\n\npediatric dose forms \u2013 the development of a dosage form for children with widely varying age and weight\n\nfixed-dose combinations \u2013 the combination of two or more APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) in a fixed proportion in a single dose. For example, the cold and flu tablet is a combination. Benefits of combination drugs are convenience, reduced pill burden, and cost.\n\nmodified-release versions \u2013 designed to release a drug in a controlled manner to achieve desired efficacy and safety. A few examples are an extended release drug and a targeted delivery drug.\n\nIt takes three or four years for product development and approval. These products enjoy low risk and high margins compared to newly patented drugs. If a branded company launches \u201cnew therapeutic entities\u201d of its own patented drugs, then the practice is called \u201clife-cycle management\u201d or \u201cproduct line extensions.\u201d\n\nmarket exclusivity \u2013 the major advantage that NTE offers over generics\n\npatent protection \u2013 NTE qualifies in some cases\n\nHigher investment and technological knowledge \u2013 NTE require this, unlike generics\n\nTeva (TEVA) has an NTE program to identify and develop new specialty medicines. Mylan\u2019s (MYL) branded specialty products consist primarily of injectables and nebualizers. Actavis (ACT) has modified and transdermal products. Hospira (HSP) has properietary specialty injectables in its portfolio.\n\nThe industry\u2019s value can also be capitalized through pharmaceutical ETFs like the S&P Health Care Select Sector Index (XLV) and the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF (XPH).\n\nContinue to Part 6\n\nBrowse this series on Market Realist:", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "From Yahoo Finance: There are two categories of specialty generics \u2013 NTE (New Therapeutic Entities) and Complex Generics.
