Let\u2019s open some stores now!\u201d\n\nSunday afternoon, protesters gathered at the Quik Trip gas station that was burned down last week after it was looted amidst the riots. The station has now become a makeshift shrine to Brown.\n\nEarly in the evening gunshots were heard near the gas station sending crowds of protesters screaming and running away. Police were immediately on the scene along with Emergency Medical Services.\n\nFerguson residents and others said they see no difference in confrontations with protesters since Missouri State High Patrol took over the operation. A young Ferguson resident told Breitbart News, \u201cWhy are [they] condoning the same things that you said you came here to change? That\u2019s stupid. That don\u2019t make sense. They\u2019re supposed to be protecting us and [they\u2019re] throwing tear gas at us like we\u2019re at war.\u201d\n\nFerguson residents also said they are upset that \u201coutsiders\u201d from the city of St. Louis are causing the looting and rioting mayhem.\n\n\u201cThe people from Ferguson wouldn\u2019t have started the looting. As you can see the people from Ferguson are right here. I feel it\u2019s the outsiders are what\u2019s causing the drama\u2013everybody that\u2019s coming from the city and Normandy and all that stuff. I feel like they\u2019re the ones who are causing the problems,\u201d a resident said.\n\nLocal officials are calling for calm. Normandy Mayor Patrick Green told Breitbart News that while he understands people are upset, the current protests are more \u201cdestructive than constructive\u201d right now.\n\n\u201cBecause more protests are what people personally feel and we\u2019ve gotta get to what happened to Mike Brown. That\u2019s most important. That\u2019s what everybody wants and the Justice Department is involved and the Justice Department is as high as you can go, \u201d he said. Beyond that it\u2019s only God himself and so unless someone can figure if there\u2019s someone higher than the Justice Department, I\u2019d like to know.\u201d\n\nGreen added, \u201cThey cant\u2019t indict. They have to investigate. They have to do many things. If you didn\u2019t know who burglarized your house, and even if you had an idea, we still have to prove it. And so people have to understand you just cant do that in the spur of the moment. What has to happen is it has to got through a due process of law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "FERGUSON, Missouri--Police dispersed crowds of protesters during another violent chaotic night here with tear gas, flash bang grenades, and an LRAD (Long Range Acoustic Device) sound cannon.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "FERGUSON, Missouri--Police dispersed crowds of protesters during another violent chaotic night here with tear gas, flash bang grenades, and an LRAD (Long Range Acoustic Device) sound cannon.", "title": "Police, Protesters Clash In Another Violent Night In Ferguson - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/08/18/992a2eb464861d205d0f6a7067003729jpg.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/18/police-protesters-clash-in-another-violent-night-in-ferguson/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FERGUSON, Missouri--Police dispersed crowds of protesters during another violent chaotic night here with tear gas, flash bang grenades, and an LRAD (Long Range Acoustic Device) sound cannon.", "title": "Police, Protesters Clash In Another Violent Night In Ferguson - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/08/18/992a2eb464861d205d0f6a7067003729jpg.jpg", "creator": "@kerrypicket", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ferguson, Jay Nixon,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Jay Nixon", "published_time": "2014-08-18T07:51:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ad3\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s what everybody wants and the Justice Department is involved and the Justice Department is as high as you can go, \u201d he said.\nEarly in the evening gunshots were heard near the gas station sending crowds of protesters screaming and running away.\nLet\u2019s open some stores now!\u201dSunday afternoon, protesters gathered at the Quik Trip gas station that was burned down last week after it was looted amidst the riots.\nFerguson residents and others said they see no difference in confrontations with protesters since Missouri State High Patrol took over the operation.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFERGUSON, Missouri\u2013Police dispersed crowds of protesters during another violent chaotic night here with tear gas, flash bang grenades, and an LRAD (Long Range Acoustic Device) sound cannon."}
