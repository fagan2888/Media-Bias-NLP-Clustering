In other words, only 29 percent of the public agrees with one of the two options that are favored by the leading Republican candidates for president.\n\nDespite their fervid opposition to the ACA ever since it became law in 2010, Republicans in Congress have found it impossible to agree on a replacement plan for Obamacare, much less to pass a bill for repeal or replacement that would be able to survive a veto from President Barack Obama, or any other Democratic president.\n\nThe ACA mandated that nearly all Americans have some form of health coverage or pay a fine. The law also barred insurers from denying coverage to people because of pre-existing medical conditions, and created government-run marketplaces that sell private individual insurance plans to people who do not have health coverage from their employers or from a government program like Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nCongressional Democrats have been criticized by more liberal members of their party for not passing a law that would create a single-payer health-care system for all Americans. Such a program, sometimes called \"Medicare for all,\" would have the government take the place of insurers in providing health coverage to all Americans.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "But more Americans support so-called liberal policies for changing the nation's health-care system than favor conservative options.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "But more Americans support so-called liberal policies for changing the nation's health-care system than favor conservative options.", "title": "Americans' big divide over health-care options", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/24/americans-widely-divided-over-what-to-do-with-health-care.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/07/16/102840332-GettyImages547016257.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "But more Americans support so-called liberal policies for changing the nation's health-care system than favor conservative options.", "title": "Americans widely divided over what to do with health care", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/24/americans-widely-divided-over-what-to-do-with-health-care.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/07/16/102840332-GettyImages547016257.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, Health Insurance, US: News, Politics, Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-02-25T03:00:00-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2016-02-25T03:02:34-0500", "tag": "Barack Obama"}, "pageNodeId": 103416527, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health insurance, Clinton, Sanders, Obama, health care divide"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe56b4\"", "article_summary": "The ACA mandated that nearly all Americans have some form of health coverage or pay a fine.\nSuch a program, sometimes called \"Medicare for all,\" would have the government take the place of insurers in providing health coverage to all Americans.\nJust 16 percent of all Americans want lawmakers to repeal the Affordable Care Act outright, and not replace it with another health-care law.\nCongressional Democrats have been criticized by more liberal members of their party for not passing a law that would create a single-payer health-care system for all Americans.\nAnd only 13 percent favor repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a Republican-crafted alternative."}
