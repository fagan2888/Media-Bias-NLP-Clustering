Program at Yale-New Haven Hospital\u2019s St. Raphael campus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard great things about Irene (Cullash )and I wanted to come in and check out the group,\u201d McPherson said.\n\nThe program launched three years ago to offer breastfeeding education to mothers for the first year of their baby\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cIts free to moms and babies. Once the moms go home they should still be supported and the hospital should be the first place besides their pediatrician,\u201d said Cullash, a lactation specialist.\n\n\u201cAny issues that come up along the way, they can get the help they need or come for just peer support and mother time with other adults who are experiencing similar issues,\u201d said Cullash.\n\nCullash said babies are weighed, checked for jaundice and any feeding issues.\n\n\u201cWe want to solve problems sooner, so they can breastfeed longer and more exclusively,\u201d she said.\n\nThe sessions run from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday and from 3 to 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nAccording to hospital staff, 10 to 22 moms attend an average session.\n\nMom Kate Bruce said she used a breast pump for four weeks after the birth of her child.\n\n\u201cI got very tired of using the pump and I came to group and Irene was able to get her to latch every time I came,\u201d said Bruce, who is now volunteers her time helping other moms.\n\n\u201cI would nurse while here and still go home and pump; I think pumps are good for moms, but it can be tiring,\u201d she said.\n\nBruce said her first two weeks home, her hormones took her through lots of changes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sore and not prepared for that, but you get the help you need here,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of the challenges moms face when breastfeeding are: babies who have difficultly latching on, babies who gain weight slowly, issues when weaning from a nipple shield, and sore nipples, among others, said Kate Manuel, an advanced practice registered nurse and international board certified lactation specialist.\n\n\u201cOur B.A.B.Y. Program along with our breastfeeding class provide families with additional support and effectively promotes strategies to allow for more of our mothers to successfully breastfeed for as long as they desire,\u201d said Manuel.\n\nAmong challenges in Connecticut, some women have been denied health insurance benefits that cover breastfeeding assistance, which violates the Affordable Care Act, according to a study by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, as reported in a story by the Connecticut Health Team.\n\nAccording to the study and story, Connecticut women have been denied coverage for breastfeeding counseling and education after two months following delivery, infertility treatments after the age of 40, sterilization procedures, emergency birth control, and maintenance care for such things as lupus, HIV, and hormones after breast cancer treatment. Coverage was also denied for transgender transitions.\n\nThe story noted that the state\u2019s Insurance Department informed insurers to provide breastfeeding counseling coverage for an undefined postpartum period, according to spokeswoman Donna Tommelleo.\n\nMom Nakia Matheney sad breastfeeding services have been beneficial for her.\n\n\u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t going to breastfeed (her daughter Elise), because I heard how painful it was,\u201d said Matheney, 22. \u201cI tried it and didn\u2019t like it, but I kept doing it and began to come to classes and talking to other women who helped me.\u201d\n\nMatheney said she encourages other young black mothers to breastfeed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough black women breastfeeding. Some black women say they rather do formula, not realizing it\u2019s much healthful for their baby,\u201d she said.\n\nMatheney believes the pain of breastfeeding, time and embarrassment are reason black women tend not to nurse.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s most recent figures, 62 percent of black babies born in the U.S. in 2010 started breastfeeding, compared to 79 percent of white babies. After six months, 36 percent of black children were still being breastfed, compared to 52 percent of white children.\n\nBut McPherson, who also is black, said black women do need to seek more help when it comes to breastfeeding.\n\n\u201cBlack women feed as much as other cultures do, I think the younger black women don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tend to look for family for advice or support, versus going outside of that circle.\u201d\n\nOther services offered by the Yale program include a couples class on breastfeeding and on going back to work while breastfeeding.\n\nFree and reduced price classes are available to those who qualify for certain financial assistance.\n\nFor class information visit www.ynhh.org/events and choose childbirth education from the categories on the left or register by calling 203-688-2000 or toll free at 1(888) 700-6543.\n\nReach Community Engagement Editor Shahid Abdul-Karim at 203 680-9343.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health, Health news, New Haven Health news, CT Health news, US Health news, world Health news.", "title": "New Haven program helps moms and babies with breastfeeding", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150705/NEWS/150709721", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150705/NEWS/150709721/AR/0/AR-150709721.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "966px"}, "type": "article", "title": "New Haven program helps moms and babies with breastfeeding"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "@Shahid_Akarim on Twitter NEW HAVEN>> Latara McPherson\u2019s then 19-month-old daughter wouldn\u2019t correctly latch on to her breast to nurse.", "title": "New Haven program helps moms and babies with breastfeeding", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150705/NEWS/150709721", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150705/NEWS/150709721/AR/0/AR-150709721.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "Health, Health news, New Haven Health news, CT Health news, US Health news, world Health news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "@Shahid_Akarim on Twitter NEW HAVEN>> Latara McPherson\u2019s then 19-month-old daughter wouldn\u2019t correctly latch on to her breast to nurse."}, "article_summary": "\u201cBlack women feed as much as other cultures do, I think the younger black women don\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough black women breastfeeding.\nBut McPherson, who also is black, said black women do need to seek more help when it comes to breastfeeding.\nSome black women say they rather do formula, not realizing it\u2019s much healthful for their baby,\u201d she said.\nMatheney believes the pain of breastfeeding, time and embarrassment are reason black women tend not to nurse."}
