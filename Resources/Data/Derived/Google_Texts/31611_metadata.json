Judging by the headlines, you might think the only election this year is to name President Obama\u2019s successor. In fact there will be four important elections in Wisconsin in 2016.\n\n\u25a0In the Feb. 16 primary, voters will select the two top candidates for Wisconsin Supreme Court as well as any local and county races with more than two contenders. Voters in Wisconsin Rapids will select the top two candidates in the mayoral race.\n\n\u25a0On April 5, we will elect the final winner for those contests and also vote for our favorite presidential candidate to be the nominee of his/her party.\n\n\u25a0The Aug. 9 partisan primary election will be held for U.S. Congress and the Wisconsin Legislature. In districts that are heavily Democratic or Republican, the primary election is particularly decisive.\n\n\u25a0On Nov. 8, we will elect the next president along with our state and federal representatives.\n\nNow is the time to get ready to vote. If you have not voted in Wisconsin before, or if your registration has lapsed, you will need to register. If you have a Wisconsin driver\u2019s license or state ID card, you will have to provide that number. You will also need proof of residence.\n\nOnce you are registered, you will need a photo ID when you vote. If you have a Wisconsin driver\u2019s license or state ID with an expiration date of Nov. 4, 2014 or later, you are all set. For more information, contact your municipal clerk or go to the Wisconsin voter information website at myvote.wi.gov.\n\nSue Mitchell,\n\nLeague of Women Voters,\n\nPort Edwards\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wrtnews.co/1TeUdE1", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Feb. 16 primary election will be for Wisconsin Rapids mayor and state Supreme Court.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Tribune Media", "description": "Feb. 16 primary election will be for Wisconsin Rapids mayor and state Supreme Court.", "title": "Four important elections will be held in 2016", "url": "http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/02/11/four-important-elections-will-held/80236348/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wisconsinrapidstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Feb. 16 primary election will be for Wisconsin Rapids mayor and state Supreme Court.", "title": "Four important elections will be held in 2016", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8223c4bd3b4bb15a66d404f93386207cec40c6fc/c=66-0-467-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/11/WisconsinRapids/B9320892268Z.1_20160211132227_000_GVFDE987B.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@wrtribune", "site": "@wrtribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=885558265", "fb": {"app_id": 132335483492709}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "primary, election, wisconsin rapids, mayor, Wisconsin, supreme court"}, "article_summary": "In fact there will be four important elections in Wisconsin in 2016.\n\u25a0The Aug. 9 partisan primary election will be held for U.S. Congress and the Wisconsin Legislature.\nIn districts that are heavily Democratic or Republican, the primary election is particularly decisive.\nIf you have a Wisconsin driver\u2019s license or state ID card, you will have to provide that number.\nIf you have a Wisconsin driver\u2019s license or state ID with an expiration date of Nov. 4, 2014 or later, you are all set."}
