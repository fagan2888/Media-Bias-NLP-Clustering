What\u2019s really going on is pretty routine \u2014 though, as is often the case in Washington, routine is not quite the same thing as sensible.\n\nMedicare Advantage is a $150-billion-a-year federal program that pays insurance companies to enroll elderly and disabled clients in managed-care plans \u2014 unlike traditional Medicare, which reimburses providers on a fee-for-service basis. About 17 million people participated in the program in 2015, 31 percent of those who were eligible for Medicare. Intended as a more efficient alternative, Medicare Advantage has always been controversial, plagued by various forms of system-gaming and perverse incentives. Democrats are especially critical of its per capita costs, which are higher than those of traditional Medicare. Yet it remains popular because many seniors prefer its all-in-one benefit packages to traditional Medicare\u2019s fragmented \u201cparts.\u201d The Affordable Care Act squeezed Medicare Advantage\u2019s federal funding \u2014 but enrollment, contrary to expectations, kept growing.\n\nEach year at this time, the Department of Health and Human Services announces how much it will pay insurance companies for serving Medicare Advantage patients in the next year, and each year the insurance companies complain it\u2019s not enough. To amplify their position, they support \u201ccitizens\u2019 groups,\u201d take to the airwaves and elicit letters of outrage from members of Congress, with the ultimate aim of influencing HHS\u2019s final rule, due this year by April 4.\n\nThe hot issue this year is the arcane one of \u201crisk adjustment.\u201d Basically, HHS subsidizes these plans partly based on how many chronic conditions their clientele has; the sicker the population, the bigger the subsidy. This gives insurers an incentive to diagnose more conditions but not necessarily to treat them; in recent years, some companies have deliberately driven up the \u201crisk profile\u201d of their clients, increasing costs to taxpayers with debatable health benefits, if any, for patients. In 2014, the \u201crisk scores\u201d of Medicare Advantage patients rose 9 percent faster, on average, than in traditional Medicare for comparable beneficiaries, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC.\n\nIn February, HHS unveiled a new, and, it says, more accurate risk adjustment formula, and other tweaks, the total impact of which would be to increase Medicare Advantage funding by just under 1 percent. Health insurers dispute that, arguing that there would be an overall cut. Notably, HHS could have gone much further: Its proposal reflected only the minimum risk adjustment savings required by the Affordable Care Act, and it didn\u2019t decide that patients\u2019 risk scores cannot be raised unless they\u2019re later confirmed in treatment settings, as some policy experts, including MedPAC, have recommended.\n\nIf the experience of recent years is any guide, the government will finally settle on a new funding figure that is somewhat more to the industry\u2019s liking, and the kerfuffle will go away for another year. Taxpayers might wonder, however, whether this annual Beltway ritual is really the most efficient or transparent way to allocate billions of their dollars \u2014 or what would happen if we could put the same energy and resources behind a structural reform of Medicare and other entitlements.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The annual ritual avoids dealing with the bigger questions of entitlements.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The annual ritual avoids dealing with the bigger questions of entitlements.", "title": "The Medicare Advantage dance", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/medicare-advantage-dance/2016/03/20/874e00ae-ec7f-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/20/Editorial-Opinion/Images/reedville%20dcotor%20patient7_1324595341.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "postopinions"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/medicare-advantage-dance/2016/03/20/874e00ae-ec7f-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "medicare advantage, health human serivces, center for medicare medicaid,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions"}, "eomportal-uuid": "874e00ae-ec7f-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "medicare advantage, health human serivces, center for medicare medicaid,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9af7\"", "article_summary": "Intended as a more efficient alternative, Medicare Advantage has always been controversial, plagued by various forms of system-gaming and perverse incentives.\nIn 2014, the \u201crisk scores\u201d of Medicare Advantage patients rose 9 percent faster, on average, than in traditional Medicare for comparable beneficiaries, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC.\nMedicare Advantage is a $150-billion-a-year federal program that pays insurance companies to enroll elderly and disabled clients in managed-care plans \u2014 unlike traditional Medicare, which reimburses providers on a fee-for-service basis.\nDemocrats are especially critical of its per capita costs, which are higher than those of traditional Medicare.\nMEAN OLD Washington is out to get granny again \u2014 or at least that\u2019s the impression created by ad campaigns on TV and the Internet, in which seniors warn, in heart-rending terms, of impending \u201ccuts\u201d to the Medicare Advantage program."}
