REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n4073373\n\nWisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan has joined the long list of Republicans who say President Obama\u2019s selective enforcement of federal laws makes it difficult for Republicans to negotiate a high-stakes immigration deal.\n\n\u201cThe challenge with all of this is we have a hard time trusting this president in enforcing the laws,\u201d he told a friendly audience of business executives gathered by the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in San Antonio, Texas.\n\n\u201cLook what he\u2019s doing on health care and all these extra-legal things he\u2019s doing with executive orders and executive actions that we don\u2019t believe he has the authority to do,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nBut Ryan insisted the GOP leadership should be trusted to negotiate a deal that will work.\n\n\u201cWe have to find a way to write these laws so that they are actually enforced. \u2026 I won\u2019t get into all the details on how to do that, but we have strong opinions on how to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nRyan\u2019s criticism of the administration echoes recent statements from numerous other GOP leaders and legislators who say the president has made a habit of overstepping his legal authority.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s not allowed to write legislation, he\u2019s not allowed to amend legislation, he\u2019s not allowed to initiate war, and he\u2019s not allowed to tell us when we\u2019re in recess and when we\u2019re not,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul told CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley Jan. 26.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s GOP leadership voiced the same concern in their weekly address, delivered by Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt. \u201cThe administration has decided which parts of the [Obamacare] law to follow, and which parts to delay,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "'Laws passed by Congress are not merely suggestions'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Wisconsin Rep.
