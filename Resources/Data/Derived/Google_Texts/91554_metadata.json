Train riders make the short walk home to a group of newly built condominiums and townhouses. Construction crews bolt glass panels onto a row of half-finished office buildings next to the train tracks. Parents play with their kids in a park nestled between four-story apartment complexes.\n\nA new model for the Peninsula\n\nThis is the Bay Meadows development, and it may represent the future of Silicon Valley. In response to skyrocketing rents and gridlocked freeways, a group of policy experts, developers and residents is pushing to transform downtowns and major thoroughfares along the Peninsula into transit-oriented projects like Bay Meadows.It\u2019s a modern take on how cities used to be designed: walkable communities of multi-story buildings, often with shops on the ground floor and apartments or office spaces above, clustered around Caltrain stations and other transit hubs. The goal is to add much-needed new housing in a way that encourages sustainable alternatives to driving.In a region built around car-oriented suburban neighborhoods, the approach is a big \u2014 and often controversial \u2014 shift. Still, supporters say transit-centered development is the best way to accommodate the region\u2019s population boom while keeping cars off congested roads and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\u201cDenser development is the new thing,\u201d said Bay Meadows developer Janice Thacher. \u201cWe think we can create a nice life for people in a 2,000-square foot condominium where they can be close to their work, be close to transportation, have all sorts of access to great opportunities to walk, to meet their neighbors, to use the parks, all of these things and that that is a better bet than putting another car on the freeway.\u201d\n\nWhen the owners of the Bay Meadows horse racing track began to think about redeveloping the site in 2003, Thacher\u2019s firm Wilson Meany saw a chance to apply its focus on urban mixed-use projects at a large scale. \u201cEighty-three acres of land to plan in a location like this with the Caltrain on site was a wonderful opportunity for us,\u201d she said.\n\nTackling job growth and jammed roads\n\nWorking with financier Stockbridge Capital, Wilson Meany came up with a design that prioritized community and easy access to the train. They interwove apartments, office space and compact townhouses with parks, cafes, bike paths and a community garden. The site is still under construction, but the approach seems to be working. According to surveys conducted by Wilson Meany, over a quarter of the residents who have moved in take Caltrain on a weekly basis, and 85 percent walk or bike to nearby shops and restaurants.Karen Luo is one of those residents. When she moved to Bay Meadows with her husband and young son two years ago, Luo developed a new morning routine. She makes the seven-minute walk from her home to the Caltrain station, catches the 7:28 a.m. train up to San Francisco, and then walks for 30 minutes to her office in the Financial District. \u201cI don\u2019t rely on a car at all, and I actually get some exercise out of my commute,\u201d she said.Luo\u2019s new townhouse is smaller than her previous home in Foster City, but she said the community garden \u2014 where her son loves to play with master gardener Mike Irvine \u2014 and other social activities more than make up for the lost space. \u201cWe downsized a lot, but it\u2019s just a much better experience.\u201d\n\nNot everyone\u2019s on board\n\nFor policy experts, getting more people to follow Luo\u2019s example is crucial to managing Silicon Valley\u2019s growth. As the booming tech economy has drawn more people to the Peninsula, housing construction hasn\u2019t kept pace.Between 2010 and 2014, Santa Clara County added 189,000 new jobs, but only built 36,414 more housing units. And Census Bureau data show that what housing has been added often isn\u2019t located in job centers like Palo Alto and the City of Santa Clara:This gulf between jobs and housing is driving up prices and forcing workers \u2014 especially lower income workers \u2014 to move further away from their jobs to find affordable places to live. In turn, that\u2019s straining the region\u2019s highways, which are carrying more cars for longer distances. Between 2010 and 2014, the number of daily vehicle miles traveled on freeways in the San Jose area increased 63 percent, from 16,922,000 to 27,553,000.And barring an unforeseen downturn in the tech sector, Silicon Valley is likely to keep growing \u2014 the California Department of Finance projects Santa Clara County will have nearly 300,000 more residents by 2030. \u201cThat\u2019s adding two more Sunnyvales to our existing population,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Mullendore, a housing and transportation policy specialist with the business-backed Silicon Valley Leadership Group.Building dense housing near transit is a key way to handle this growth and reduce congestion, said Ratna Amin with the urban policy think-tank SPUR. \u201cThere is no known solution to traffic besides other modes,\u201d she said, referencing a strong body of research showing that adding more capacity to roadways doesn\u2019t actually reduce congestion in the long-run, since the easier trip encourages people to drive more often.Mullendore and Amin have been pushing governments on the Peninsula to embrace transit-oriented development, and they\u2019re seeing success. In Sunnyvale, the Leadership Group worked with the city to develop a new transit-oriented development plan around Lawrence Caltrain Station. In San Jose, work is underway to turn the area around Diridon Station \u2014 which Mullendore called the future \u201cGrand Central Station of the West\u201d \u2014 into a high-density mix of housing and commercial space. In downtown Redwood City, the adoption of a new transit- and walkability-focused plan is already driving the construction of tall new apartments and office buildings.\u201cNo question, cities are trying to adopt the right kinds of plans,\u201d Amin said. But, she added, \u201cit\u2019s a real challenge when the rubber hits the road, when a real development project is proposed.\u201d\n\nOn stage at new product launches, Silicon Valley celebrates density \u2014 more pixels on an iPhone screen, more transistors on a microchip. But when it comes to dense development, the region\u2019s residents are often more hesitant.\n\n\u2018Density is not something to be scared of\u2019\n\nWhile the Peninsula originally grew up around the stops of the Southern Pacific Railroad (now the Caltrain line), the rise of cars and highways after World War II shifted the region to today\u2019s suburban pattern of office parks and single-family homes. Many residents like the small-town character of their communities and fear an influx of traffic from new development.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s incumbent upon those of us who have been longtime residents here in Redwood City to necessarily degrade the quality of our lifestyle in order to accommodate people who want to live or work here,\u201d said homeowner David Gahagen, who organized a \u201cResidents for Sensible Growth in Redwood City\u201d group. The group formed in response to the building boom in downtown Redwood City, concerned that construction would lead to a mass of people driving through residential neighborhoods to get to downtown. It\u2019s been pushing for a moratorium on new commercial buildings and backed sympathetic city council candidates in the Nov. 2015 election.That kind of pushback is common. \u201cI\u2019ve seen opposition many times in the past,\u201d said Mullendore, adding that while opposition is understandable, it makes it harder to solve the region\u2019s housing and traffic problems. Complaints from neighbors can delay project approvals, downsize development and cause design changes like extra parking that discourage transit use, said SPUR\u2019s Amin.At Bay Meadows, for example, architects had to contend with a voter-imposed 55-foot height limit. \u201cYou can look out the window and see how that shaped the design,\u201d Thacher said. Without the limit, she said they would have put taller office buildings next to the train station, and some of the housing would have been seven or eight stories instead of four.Beyond affecting specific projects, opposition from residents creates political obstacles, said Russell Hancock, an advocate for regional planning who runs the Joint Venture Silicon Valley think-tank. Local officials in the Peninsula\u2019s three-dozen cities are reluctant to approve development their constituents don\u2019t want, and so the region as a whole isn\u2019t meeting the demand for new housing. \u201cThere\u2019s this reluctant acknowledgement that growth is happening and it needs to be accommodated, but [residents] don\u2019t want it in their backyard, they want it in someone else\u2019s backyard.\u201d\n\nYet as the housing crisis worsens, some residents are starting to say they do want growth in their backyard. In the last year and a half, community groups in Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Redwood City have formed to advocate for new housing and transit options in their cities.\n\n\u201cA lot of people do feel like housing is an issue and we should be allowing different models, but the challenge is just that there haven\u2019t been opportunities for these people to connect,\u201d said Palo Alto resident Elaine Uang. An architect who was frustrated by what she saw as the community\u2019s focus on stopping growth instead of effectively managing it, Uang helped found Palo Alto Forward in September 2014. \u201cWe started out as forty,\u201d she said, \u201cand we just kept growing and growing and finding support and interest from lots of different corners.\u201dIn Menlo Park, \u201cit started with a beer in a backyard,\u201d said Imagine Menlo steering committee member Andrew Barnes. After voters in the city rejected Measure M \u2014 a 2014 ballot measure that would have restricted new development \u2014 a group of residents like Barnes were looking for a more \u201caspirational\u201d way to move forward. \u201cDensity is not something to be scared of,\u201d he said. When done right, \u201cdensity and vibrancy adds to the overall character of the community and makes it an even more desirable place to live.\u201dSo far, both groups have focused more on policy changes than specific development projects. Palo Alto Forward is pushing to reduce parking requirements that make housing more expensive (each space can cost $30,000 or more) and allow mixed-use buildings with housing and retail space near the city\u2019s Caltrain stations. Imagine Menlo is supporting Menlo Park\u2019s plan to add new development near the downtown train station and along El Camino Real.But Uang said that if they can implement policies that encourage denser development, Palo Alto Forward will be ready to rally community backing. \u201cWhen a good project comes up, a really important housing development on Cal. Ave. that is going to enable a range of incomes to live there, and it\u2019s going to enable a number of people to go car-light \u2026 heck yeah, we want to support that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In response to skyrocketing rents and gridlocked freeways, policy experts, developers, and residents are pushing for new transit-oriented construction.", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "In response to skyrocketing rents and gridlocked freeways, policy experts, developers, and residents are pushing for new transit-oriented construction.", "title": "Innovating Suburbia: Amid housing crunch, support grows for transit oriented development", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/icon-image.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-24T12:52:42+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/12/17/innovating-bay-area-suburbia-transit-oriented-development/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In response to skyrocketing rents and gridlocked freeways, policy experts, developers, and residents are pushing for new transit-oriented construction.", "creator": "@jeffrey_barrera", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/icon-image.jpg", "title": "Innovating Suburbia: Amid housing crunch, support grows for transit oriented development", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "News", "tag": "transportation", "published_time": "2015-12-17T07:06:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-24T12:52:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen a good project comes up, a really important housing development on Cal.\nIn Sunnyvale, the Leadership Group worked with the city to develop a new transit-oriented development plan around Lawrence Caltrain Station.\nA new model for the PeninsulaThis is the Bay Meadows development, and it may represent the future of Silicon Valley.\nConstruction crews bolt glass panels onto a row of half-finished office buildings next to the train tracks.\nBut when it comes to dense development, the region\u2019s residents are often more hesitant."}
