Jerry Brown\u2019s administration has refused to detail what it\u2019s offering, but legislation recently enacted to create a $420 million tax credit for Lockheed Martin also included language to help battery manufacturers, at his request.\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s office confirmed Friday that it\u2019s still in the hunt but declined further comment, citing \u201congoing negotiations.\u201d\n\nIn Arizona, Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild said he doesn\u2019t believe Thursday\u2019s announcement makes Nevada the front-runner. He said Tesla officials \u201cwere very clear that they\u2019ve chosen no site yet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nevada no lock for Tesla plant despite groundwork", "title": "Nevada no lock for Tesla plant despite groundwork", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/01/nevada-no-lock-for-tesla-plant-despite-groundwork/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140802__TESLA-1p1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140802__TESLA-1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-01T21:30:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:44:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTesla remains a prized economic development target, and we are still very much in the game.\u201dCalifornia Gov.\nHe said Tesla officials \u201cwere very clear that they\u2019ve chosen no site yet.\u201d\n\u201cIf you talk about a horse race, no one else I know of has even left the starting gate,\u201d he said.\nA sprawling industrial park near Reno, Nev., became the focus of the secretive site selection process for Tesla\u2019s $5 billion battery factory, but the groundwork taking place is no guarantee the plant and its 6,500 jobs are coming.\nRick Perry\u2019s office confirmed Friday that it\u2019s still in the hunt but declined further comment, citing \u201congoing negotiations.\u201dIn Arizona, Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild said he doesn\u2019t believe Thursday\u2019s announcement makes Nevada the front-runner."}
