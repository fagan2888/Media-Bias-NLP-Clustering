Mathew Hintz with the Avondale Police Department. Police are trying to determine if any foul play was involved, Sgt. Hintz said.\n\nThe body of the elderly man was fully clothed with shaggy graying hair, white Nike shoes and a dark T-shirt and shorts, the teens said.\n\n\"I casted out and I turned to my left and I saw a big -- like something white. And I saw hair. And I really freaked out,\" said 13-year-old Connor Brandtman.\n\nBrandtman and his friend Alex Moody ran back to inform two other friends of the find.\n\n\"At first we thought they were lying. But they weren't,\" said another 8th grader, Jacob.\n\nAll of the teens said they'll be taking their fishing trips elsewhere in the future.\n\n\"Like shock. Like scared. Like shaking,\" Brandtman said of his reaction to finding the body. \"I've never seen a dead body in my whole life.\"\n\nAvondale police are investigating after a body was found in a canal near Litchfied and Indian School. pic.twitter.com/Q07pEHdJvp \u2014 Derek Staahl (@DerekStaahl) February 8, 2016\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
