(RNS) The single largest community of Iraqi Kurds in the U.S. is right here in Music City, the buckle of the Bible Belt.\n\nThey are joined by significant numbers of Somalis, Bhutanese, Egyptians, Latinos and Asians. There are so many international newcomers to Nashville that in just five more years, non-whites will make up the majority of the population.\n\nYet all of Middle Tennessee\u2019s diverse voices are singing together in harmony, Karl Dean, the outgoing Democratic mayor, told our group of 17 international journalists traveling with on a fellowship organized by the East-West Center,\n\n\u201cOur city is changing rapidly and in my opinion that is a good thing,\u201d Dean said as he addressed us at the Mayor\u2019s Office in downtown Nashville. \u201cI think the city\u2019s increase in immigration has gone hand-in-hand with its rise in economic prominence and as an important city in the U.S. I have always taken the viewpoint that when an immigrant comes to the U.S. and chooses to live in Nashville to see out their dream that is the highest compliment they can give us.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one way of looking at the situation. But the newspapers tell a little bit of a different story. In 2008, a group of skinheads burned a mosque to the ground. One year later, the city tried to pass an English-only ordinance that was ultimately defeated. And when a Muslim family moved into a house next door to the one-time \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actress Victoria Jackson, she took to the blogosphere in an anti-Islamic, pro-Jesus rant.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this figure \u2014 Tennessee has 29 hate groups, the seventh-most in the nation. The largest chapter of Act for America, the hate group Dylan Roof is known to have encountered online prior to shooting nine people in a Charleston church, is in Tennessee.\n\nNot so harmonic. Yet at our next stop, we saw what the city has done to promote cooperation and reconciliation among its diverse groups. At the Metro Human Relations Commission a few blocks from the mayor\u2019s office, Melody Fowler-Green coordinates 17 volunteer commissioners from the city\u2019s different communities who work to iron out the wrinkles in the fabric of the city\u2019s life.\n\nThe commission works to make Nashville\u2019s civic life more inclusive, promotes multicultural education, has a \u201cTeaching Tolerance\u201d program for schools and operates a host of other pro-diversity programs and events.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been a rough road for us here in Middle Tennessee,\u201d Fowler-Green said. \u201cBut I think you will hear matters have improved. We have to make this a priority \u2014 to build bridges.\u201d\n\nNot only outsiders have faced discrimination here. In the afternoon we met with a group of editors, opinion writers and reporters from The Tennessean, the storied local paper where Al Gore was once a cub reporter, and the Associated Press.\n\nDuane Gang, The Tennessean\u2019s \u201ccontent strategist\u201d \u2014 sounded like he was its metro editor to me \u2014 told us the paper was running a story on the day of our visit about a \u201cwhisper campaign\u201d against Megan Barry, a front-runner in the current race for mayor. There were rumors circulating on the internet that Barry is an atheist. That\u2019s still a bad thing in a city with 700 churches \u2014 more than the larger city of Atlanta \u2014 and where The United Methodist Church, the Free Will Baptists, Lifeway Christian stores and Thomas Nelson, the giant Christian publisher, maintain their headquarters.\n\nAnd Tennessee is one of eight states that still have laws requiring anyone who holds public office be a religious believer \u2014 laws that are unconstitutional but somehow remain on the books.\n\nSo Barry tried to dispel the atheist rumors by going to a prayer breakfast with a group of local clergy. They prayed together, there was a laying on of hands by the clergy on the candidate and she felt she had to declare herself. \u201cI am a Christian,\u201d she told them.\n\n\u201cNashville is changing,\u201d said Bob Smietana, the paper\u2019s former religion reporter and current news editor at Christianity Today. \u201cWe have more people who don\u2019t believe and more people who believe different things.\u201d\n\nANOTHER VIEW: Kim Lawton\u2019s fellowship blog at Religion & Ethics Newsweekly\n\nTRAVEL ALONG:\n\nPOST 3: Walking through God\u2019s doors\n\nPOST 2: Terrorism, blashphemy \u2014 and cookies\n\nPOST 1: A wake-up call in Washington", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Bible Belt, Christian, Evangelical, Freethought (Atheist, Humanist, Agnostic), Interfaith, islam, Kurdish, Kurds, Megan Barry", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "NASHVILLE, Tenn.
