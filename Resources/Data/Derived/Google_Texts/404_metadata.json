Several older students and adults have also fallen ill.\n\nOn Friday, the Washington State Department of Health said it had asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for assistance in tracking the source of the outbreak, since it was unknown whether it was linked to food, milk, livestock, a petting zoo or another source.\n\nThere have been 22 confirmed cases and 20 probable cases linked to the festival, Whatcom County officials said.\n\nHelp from federal public health officials is standard in these kinds of outbreaks, said state health department spokeswoman Kelly Stowe.\n\nThe milk festival's organizers said in a statement they welcomed the CDC\u2019s participation.\n\nE. coli and Salmonella are the most common sources of food borne illness in the United States, according to the CDC.\n\nE. coli bacteria lives in the intestines of humans and animals and most types are harmless. But some strains can cause severe illness and even lead to kidney failure and death in some cases.\n\n(Reporting by Victoria Cavaliere; Editing by Cynthia Johnston and Christian Plumb)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cdc, help, washington, state, find, source, e, coli, outbreak, milk, fest", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Public health officials in Washington State asked for assistance from the CDC in finding the source of an E. coli outbreak that sickened over 40 people at a milk festival last month.", "title": "CDC To Help Washington State Find Source Of E.
