In 1996, the charter school bill passed, and the following year she opened a new school called LEAP in a vacant lot on the Camden waterfront.\n\nToday, the school occupies 5 buildings on Cooper Street, offering its students a cradle to college education, and it's the most successful school in the city. While the four-year graduation rate in Camden's traditional public schools is 61 percent, LEAP has a graduation rate of 98 percent, and every member of its 2014 graduating class got into college.\n\nThis profile of LEAP is the second in a three-part video series on Camden public schools. Click here to watch part one, which looks at a failed effort to fix Camden's schools by dramatically boosting spending. Click here watch part three, which looks at the recent initiative to remake public education in Camden by creating a hybrid model of traditional and charter schools.\n\nReason Foundation is a partner in National School Week, an annual event that draws attention to increasing educational options for K-12 students and their parents.
