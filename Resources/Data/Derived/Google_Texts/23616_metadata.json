Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.\n\nSo nice, thank you very much. That\u2019s really nice. Thank you. It\u2019s great to be at Trump Tower. It\u2019s great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it\u2019s an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody\u2019s expectations. There\u2019s been no crowd like this.\n\nAnd, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn\u2019t know the air-conditioner didn\u2019t work. They sweated like dogs.\n\nThey didn\u2019t know the room was too big, because they didn\u2019t have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna happen.\n\nOur country is in serious trouble. We don\u2019t have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don\u2019t have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let\u2019s say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.\n\nWhen did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn\u2019t exist, folks. They beat us all the time.\n\nWhen do we beat Mexico at the border? They\u2019re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they\u2019re killing us economically.\n\nThe U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else\u2019s problems.\n\nSign up for THE BRIEF and more view example\n\nThank you. It\u2019s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\n\nBut I speak to border guards and they tell us what we\u2019re getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They\u2019re sending us not the right people.\n\nIt\u2019s coming from more than Mexico. It\u2019s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it\u2019s coming probably\u2014 probably\u2014 from the Middle East. But we don\u2019t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s got to stop and it\u2019s got to stop fast.\n\nIslamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They\u2019ve become rich. I\u2019m in competition with them.\n\nThey just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don\u2019t have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should\u2019ve taken.\n\nSo now ISIS has the oil, and what they don\u2019t have, Iran has. And in 19\u2014 and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said\u2014 and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we\u2019ve ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, \u201cDon\u2019t hit Iraq,\u201d because you\u2019re going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they\u2019re taking it over big league.\n\nWe spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love \u2014 they\u2019re great \u2014 all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.\n\nAnd we have nothing. We can\u2019t even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.\n\nLast week, I read 2,300 Humvees\u2014 these are big vehicles\u2014 were left behind for the enemy. 2,000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.\n\nLast quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product\u2014 a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It\u2019s never below zero.\n\nOur labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.\n\nAnd our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don\u2019t believe the 5.6. Don\u2019t believe it.\n\nThat\u2019s right. A lot of people up there can\u2019t get jobs. They can\u2019t get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs.\n\nBut the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it\u2019s a statistic that\u2019s full of nonsense.\n\nOur enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn\u2019t work.\n\nIt came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don\u2019t know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, \u201cThat is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nWe have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.\n\nYesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it\u2019s virtually useless. It\u2019s virtually useless. It is a disaster.\n\nAnd remember the $5 billion website? $5 billion we spent on a website, and to this day it doesn\u2019t work. A $5 billion website.\n\nI have so many websites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a website. It costs me $3. $5 billion website.\n\nWell, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing\u2019s gonna get done. They will not bring us\u2014 believe me\u2014 to the promised land. They will not.\n\nAs an example, I\u2019ve been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they\u2019re wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don\u2019t know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I\u2019m meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don\u2019t know\u2014 \u201cAre you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it?\u201d\n\nI like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don\u2019t talk jobs and they don\u2019t talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They\u2019re devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn\u2019t believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They\u2019re killing us.\n\nBut you don\u2019t hear that from anybody else. You don\u2019t hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches.\n\nI watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don\u2019t need the rhetoric. I want a job.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in \u201916, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I\u2019d say, you what, if he wants to\u2014 I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he\u2019d like to play, that\u2019s fine.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019d love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.\n\nBut Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who\u2019s a doctor, and he said to me the other day, \u201cDonald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It\u2019s a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now.\u201d\n\nWe have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be\u2014 and\u2014 and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it.\n\nSo I\u2019ve watched the politicians. I\u2019ve dealt with them all my life. If you can\u2019t make a good deal with a politician, then there\u2019s something wrong with you. You\u2019re certainly not very good. And that\u2019s what we have representing us. They will never make America great again. They don\u2019t even have a chance. They\u2019re controlled fully\u2014 they\u2019re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.\n\nYes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They\u2019re great. But you know what? it won\u2019t happen. It won\u2019t happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it\u2019s destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now.\n\nNow, our country needs\u2014 our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\n\nWe need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned.\n\nAnd we also need a cheerleader.\n\nYou know, when President Obama was elected, I said, \u201cWell, the one thing, I think he\u2019ll do well. I think he\u2019ll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he\u2019d be a great spirit.\u201d\n\nHe was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.\n\nHe\u2019s not a leader. That\u2019s true. You\u2019re right about that.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t a cheerleader. He\u2019s actually a negative force. He\u2019s been a negative force. He wasn\u2019t a cheerleader; he was the opposite.\n\nWe need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It\u2019s not great again.\n\nWe need\u2014 we need somebody\u2014 we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that.\n\nAnd, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They\u2019re saying, \u201cDad, you\u2019re going to do something that\u2019s going to be so tough.\u201d\n\nYou know, all of my life, I\u2019ve heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can\u2019t happen. And yet that\u2019s the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.\n\nSo ladies and gentlemen\u2026I am officially running\u2026 for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.\n\nIt can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.\n\nWe have people that aren\u2019t working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they\u2019re going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they\u2019ll be proud, and they\u2019ll love it, and they\u2019ll make much more than they would\u2019ve ever made, and they\u2019ll be\u2014 they\u2019ll be doing so well, and we\u2019re going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen.\n\nI will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that.\n\nI\u2019ll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I\u2019ll bring back our jobs, and I\u2019ll bring back our money.\n\nRight now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal\u2019s even better.\n\nHow stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they?\n\nI\u2019m going to tell you\u2014 thank you. I\u2019m going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I\u2019m totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.\n\nNumber one, the people negotiating don\u2019t have a clue. Our president doesn\u2019t have a clue. He\u2019s a bad negotiator.\n\nHe\u2019s the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.\n\nWe get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That\u2019s the negotiator we have.\n\nTake a look at the deal he\u2019s making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won\u2019t exist very long. It\u2019s a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But\u2026\n\nSo we need people\u2014 I\u2019m a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don\u2019t have talented people, if you don\u2019t have great leadership, if you don\u2019t have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.\n\nFree trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren\u2019t smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it\u2019s just not going to work.\n\nSo, here\u2019s a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.\n\nBut with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything\u2014 everything, they got away with it again. And it\u2019s impossible for our people here to compete.\n\nSo I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who\u2019s a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He\u2019s very upset. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cYou know, I make great product.\u201d\n\nAnd I said, \u201cI know. I know that because I buy the product.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cI can\u2019t get it into China. They won\u2019t accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cOh, wait a minute, that\u2019s terrible. Does anyone know this?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cYeah, they do it all the time with other people.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cThey send it back?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing that. I told them.\u201d\n\nNow, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.\n\nAsk Boeing. They wanted Boeing\u2019s secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.\n\nHey, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for\u2014 I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable.\n\nI love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t like China?\u201d\n\nNo, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can\u2019t sustain ourself with that. There\u2019s too much\u2014 it\u2019s like\u2014 it\u2019s like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That\u2019s the difference between China\u2019s leaders and our leaders.\n\nThey are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We\u2019re rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they\u2019re all over the place.\n\nWe have all the cards, but we don\u2019t know how to use them. We don\u2019t even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don\u2019t understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.\n\nNow they\u2019re going militarily. They\u2019re building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we\u2019d have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn\u2019t let our country\u2014 we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port.\n\nThey\u2019re building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China.\n\nAnd, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.\n\nSo this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible story. I hate to hear it.\u201d\n\nBut I have another one, Ford.\n\nSo Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It\u2019s going in and that\u2019s going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people.\n\nAll of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they\u2019re not going to Tennessee. They\u2019re gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good.\n\nNow, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, it\u2019s going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company.\n\nSo I announced that I\u2019m running for president. I would\u2026\n\n\u2026 one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in\u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t even use\u2014 you know, I have\u2014 I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.\n\nYou get a lot of them that are overrated. They\u2019re not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed. But they\u2019re not good.\n\nBut I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I\u2019d say, \u201cCongratulations. I understand that you\u2019re building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you\u2019re going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border.\u201d\n\nAnd you say to yourself, \u201cHow does that help us,\u201d right? \u201cHow does that help us? Where is that good\u201d? It\u2019s not.\n\nSo I would say, \u201cCongratulations. That\u2019s the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we\u2019re going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that\u2019s it.\n\nNow, here\u2019s what is going to happen. If it\u2019s not me in the position, it\u2019s one of these politicians that we\u2019re running against, you know, the 400 people that we\u2019re (inaudible). And here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. They\u2019re not so stupid. They know it\u2019s not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they\u2019re going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can\u2019t do that to Ford.\u201d\n\nAnd guess what? No problem. They\u2019re going to build in Mexico. They\u2019re going to take away thousands of jobs. It\u2019s very bad for us.\n\nSo under President Trump, here\u2019s what would happen:\n\nThe head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he\u2019d want to be cool, and he\u2019ll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool.\n\nAnd he\u2019ll say, \u201cPlease, please, please.\u201d He\u2019ll beg for a little while, and I\u2019ll say, \u201cNo interest.\u201d Then he\u2019ll call all sorts of political people, and I\u2019ll say, \u201cSorry, fellas. No interest,\u201d because I don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s money. It\u2019s nice. I don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s money.\n\nI\u2019m using my own money. I\u2019m not using the lobbyists. I\u2019m not using donors. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m really rich. I (inaudible).\n\nAnd by the way, I\u2019m not even saying that\u2019s the kind of mindset, that\u2019s the kind of thinking you need for this country.\n\nSo\u2014 because we got to make the country rich.\n\nIt sounds crass. Somebody said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s crass.\u201d It\u2019s not crass.\n\nWe got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems.\n\nWe got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.\n\nWe\u2019ve got nothing. We\u2019ve got Social Security that\u2019s going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn\u2019t bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I\u2019m not going to cut it at all; I\u2019m going to bring money in, and we\u2019re going to save it.\n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen:\n\nAfter I\u2019m called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I\u2019m called by all of the special interests and by the\u2014 the donors and by the lobbyists\u2014 and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero\u2014 I\u2019ll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He\u2019ll say. \u201cPlease reconsider,\u201d I\u2019ll say no.\n\nHe\u2019ll say, \u201cMr. President, we\u2019ve decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we\u2019re not going to build it in Mexico.\u201d That\u2019s it. They have no choice. They have no choice.\n\nThere are hundreds of things like that. I\u2019ll give you another example.\n\nSaudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say \u201cwe\u2019re gonna protect.\u201d What are we doing? They\u2019ve got nothing but money.\n\nIf the right person asked them, they\u2019d pay a fortune. They wouldn\u2019t be there except for us.\n\nAnd believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out\u2014 and they kept our equipment.\n\nThey always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be\u2014 we ought to send our surplus. We\u2019re always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.\n\nBut look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They\u2019re gone.\n\nAnd I\u2019m the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I\u2019m running against now\u2014 it\u2019s so nice to say I\u2019m running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I\u2019m running.\n\nBut all of these politicians that I\u2019m running against now, they\u2019re trying to disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn\u2019t answer the question. He didn\u2019t know. I said, \u201cIs he intelligent?\u201d\n\nThen I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t answer the question.\n\nHow are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna\u2014 how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can\u2019t. They don\u2019t have a clue. They can\u2019t lead us. They can\u2019t. They can\u2019t even answer simple questions. It was terrible.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders.\n\nThere is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We\u2019re dying. We\u2019re dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people.\n\nSo Ford will come back. They\u2019ll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that\u2019s based on competence.\n\nSomebody said \u2014 thank you, darlin\u2019.\n\nSomebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, \u201cBut, Mr. Trump, you\u2019re not a nice person.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true. But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know me, like me. Does my family like me? I think so, right. Look at my family. I\u2019m proud of my family.\n\nBy the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job. Did she do a great job?\n\nGreat. Jared, Laura and Eric, I\u2019m very proud of my family. They\u2019re a great family.\n\nSo the reporter said to me the other day, \u201cBut, Mr. Trump, you\u2019re not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you?\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I said, \u201cI think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I\u2019m actually a very nice person.\u201d\n\nBut, I said, \u201cThis is going to be an election that\u2019s based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they\u2019re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they\u2019re tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we\u2019re becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll do it. Because a lot of people said, \u201cHe\u2019ll never run. Number one, he won\u2019t want to give up his lifestyle.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re right about that, but I\u2019m doing it.\n\nNumber two, I\u2019m a private company, so nobody knows what I\u2019m worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.\n\nSo I said, \u201cThat\u2019s OK.\u201d I\u2019m proud of my net worth. I\u2019ve done an amazing job.\n\nI started off\u2014 thank you\u2014 I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said \u2014 and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot.\n\nBut he used to say, \u201cDonald, don\u2019t go into Manhattan. That\u2019s the big leagues. We don\u2019t know anything about that. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cI gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I\u2019ve gotta do it.\u201d\n\nAnd after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals\u2014 the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I\u2019m building all over the world, and I love what I\u2019m doing.\n\nBut they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, \u201cWell, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he\u2019s private and he\u2019s probably not as successful as everybody thinks.\u201d\n\nSo I said to myself, you know, nobody\u2019s ever going to know unless I run, because I\u2019m really proud of my success. I really am.\n\nI\u2019ve employed\u2014 I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything.\n\nSo a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it\u2019s big and complex, and they\u2019ve put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don\u2019t [use] extensions or anything. We\u2019ll be filing it right on time. We don\u2019t need anything.\n\nAnd it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, \u201cHe had assets of $9 billion.\u201d So I said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s the wrong number. That\u2019s the wrong number. Not assets.\u201d\n\nSo they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old-fashioned way. It\u2019s real estate. You know, it\u2019s real estate.\n\nIt\u2019s labor, and it\u2019s unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren\u2019t in unions, and it\u2019s all over the place and building all over the world.\n\nAnd I have assets\u2014 big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected\u2014 9 billion 240 million dollars.\n\nAnd I have liabilities of about $500 million. That\u2019s long-term debt, very low interest rates.\n\nIn fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, \u201cDonald, you don\u2019t have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion\u201d? I said, \u201cI don\u2019t need it. I don\u2019t want it. And I\u2019ve been there. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d\n\nBut in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it\u2019ll be well-over $10 billion. But here, a total net worth of\u2014net worth, not assets, not\u2014 a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets\u2014 Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York\u2014 many other places all over the world.\n\nSo the total is $8,737,540,00.\n\nNow I\u2019m not doing that\u2026\n\nI\u2019m not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don\u2019t have to brag. I don\u2019t have to, believe it or not.\n\nI\u2019m doing that to say that that\u2019s the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking.\n\nWe have losers. We have losers. We have people that don\u2019t have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain.\n\nSo I put together this statement, and the only reason I\u2019m telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years\u2014 you know, we\u2019re at $8 trillion now. We\u2019re soon going to be at $20 trillion.\n\nAccording to the economists\u2014 who I\u2019m not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they\u2019re saying\u2014 that $24 trillion\u2014 we\u2019re very close\u2014 that\u2019s the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. That\u2019s when we become Greece. That\u2019s when we become a country that\u2019s unsalvageable. And we\u2019re gonna be there very soon. We\u2019re gonna be there very soon.\n\nSo, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.\n\nI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.\n\nMark my words.\n\nNobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody.\n\nI will find \u2014 within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that\u2019s going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.\n\nI will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won\u2019t be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who\u2019s making a horrible and laughable deal, who\u2019s just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won\u2019t be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you.\n\nI will immediately terminate President Obama\u2019s illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.\n\nFully support and back up the Second Amendment.\n\nNow, it\u2019s very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, \u201cYou know, Mr. Trump,\u201d and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, \u201cYou know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn\u2019t want guns. And now since this happened\u201d\u2014 it\u2019s up in the prison area\u2014 \u201cmy husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We\u2019re ready to start shooting.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cVery interesting.\u201d\n\nSo protect the Second Amendment.\n\nEnd\u2014 end Common Core. Common Core should\u2014 it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don\u2019t see how he can possibly get the nomination. He\u2019s weak on immigration. He\u2019s in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can\u2019t do it. We have to end education has to be local.\n\nRebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nNobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.\n\nI look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad.\n\nYou know, we\u2019re building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we\u2019re converting it into one of the world\u2019s great hotels. It\u2019s gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after\u2014 or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it.\n\nWell, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we\u2019re really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I\u2019ll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built.\n\nSo we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it\u2019s like we\u2019re in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw.\n\nYou look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure.\n\nSave Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it.\n\nGet rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that\u2019s being lost.\n\nRenegotiate our foreign trade deals.\n\nReduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we\u2019re in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what\u2019s happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.\n\nBe careful of a bubble because what you\u2019ve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.\n\nAnd strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important.\n\nSadly, the American dream is dead.\n\nBut if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.\n\nThank you. Thank you very much.\n\nRead next: How Donald Trump Stole Jeb Bush\u2019s Moment\n\nListen to the most important stories of the day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Full transcript of Donald Trump's speech announcing he was running for president", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "'Wow.
