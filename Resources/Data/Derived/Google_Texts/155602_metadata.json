That was due to a ten percent increase in math proficiency, according to the report.\n\nThe average composite ACT score also improved to a 19.8 from a 19.5 in 2014, according to the report.\n\nOn a scale of 1-5, Knox County is ranked 1, or least effective, in gains in literacy achievement for the 2013-2014 school year.\n\nWhile the gains were low in literature, that doesn\u2019t mean Knox County is necessarily falling behind in language arts studies. In fact, the school system is actually testing above average in the subject.\n\nKnox County received a 70 percentile score on the EOC English II section, which measures the percentage of 9-12th grade students within the district who scored proficient or advanced on the state\u2019s test. The average score for the test in Tennessee is 63 percent proficiency.\n\nWhen it comes to gains in math achievement, Knox County is on the polar opposite of the spectrum with a 5, or a most improved ranking.\n\nFor that test, Knox County scores a 61 percentile, one percent shy of the state average of 62 percent.\n\nThe report also finds that Knox County spends about $9,342 per student. Composite ACT scores were at 20.4 percent, more than half a point higher than the state average.\n\nFor a look at how you school did, visit the link here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State Collaborative on Reforming Education, or SCORE, released its annual State of Education in Tennessee report on Friday.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id= 511297956", "og": {"site_name": "WATE 6 On Your Side", "description": "KNOXVILLE (WATE) \u2013 Tennessee\u2019s annual report card has been released.
