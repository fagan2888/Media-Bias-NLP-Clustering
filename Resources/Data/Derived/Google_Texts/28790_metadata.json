Bob Goodlatte, R-Roanoke, who faces challenger Harry Griego in a June 14 primary, cited defeating likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton or nominating conservative Supreme Court justices as reasons to rally around the polarizing Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely essential that we be united and move forward as one in this critical election,\u201d Goodlatte said, naming Trump in his congressional candidacy speech.\n\nPrior to the Super Tuesday election he did not endorse a candidate.\n\nWhile many Republicans fought hard against naming Donald Trump the party\u2019s nominee and a few still continue the fight, many are falling in line behind the party\u2019s bombastic new standard bearer.\n\nWithout saying Trump\u2019s name, outgoing district Chairman Wendell Walker said party members should work together to elect the eventual nominee to be decided at the Republican National Convention in July.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s going to be great again, ladies and gentleman,\u201d Walker said in an opening speech, a reference to Trump\u2019s campaign slogan. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta start in this room.\u201d\n\nIn an interview leading up to Super Tuesday, Walker had said he hoped Trump would be knocked out.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s got the money to go a long time, but at some point people are not going to continue to tolerate his potty mouth, his intimidating, his bullying ways. That\u2019s just not America. I hope not,\u201d Walker said in an interview with The News & Advance in February.\n\nOn Saturday, he cited picking a conservative Supreme Court justice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia and other possible vacancies that would come up in the next term as reasons the party needs to unite.\n\nGriego, a pilot out of Roanoke County, said previously he supported Trump but used his congressional candidacy speech Saturday to continue his attack against Goodlatte, whom he hopes to unseat.\n\nIn his mostly quiet campaign, Griego has said the 20-year congressman has voted to pass budgets funding Planned Parenthood, the Affordable Care Act and the president\u2019s \u201camnesty\u201d policy toward immigration.\n\n\u201cOur incumbent has a long history of capitulation and compromise,\u201d Griego said.\n\nGoodlatte, who spoke first, said he has fought the above policies.\n\nTom Howarth, Warren County Democratic district chair, will take on the Republican nominee after receiving the nomination from the 6th Congressional District Democrats Saturday.\n\nAfter Ralph Smith, former state senator, dropped out of the race for district chairman, Scott Sayre, a Rockbridge County Republican, cruised to the nomination.\n\nSayre, whose platform focused on bringing voter data software to local committees to give them more autonomy, won strong local support throughout the district ahead of Saturday\u2019s convention.\n\nSmith was not on the ballot Saturday and Sayre, a former 6th District vice chair, was elected district chair without conflict.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "donald trump,bob goodlatte,wendell walker,harry griego,scott sayre,politics,politics,institutes", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "Several speakers at the 6th Congressional District Republican convention rallied around the Donald Trump banner Saturday.", "title": "6th District Republicans rallying around Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/th-district-republicans-rallying-around-donald-trump/article_54aaf5df-946c-52b5-ae93-4e802980ae62.html", "image": {"width": 510, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/e1/ae17aa19-4d23-5837-8c62-568550c92dc2/57413427b2f3f.image.jpg?resize=510%2C316", "height": 316}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@roanoketimes", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 251357365028982}, "keywords": "donald trump,bob goodlatte,wendell walker,harry griego,scott sayre,politics,politics,institutes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/roanoketimes"}, "description": "Several speakers at the 6th Congressional District Republican convention rallied around the Donald Trump banner Saturday."}, "article_summary": "Several speakers at the 6th Congressional District Republican convention rallied around the Donald Trump banner Saturday.\nTom Howarth, Warren County Democratic district chair, will take on the Republican nominee after receiving the nomination from the 6th Congressional District Democrats Saturday.\nSmith was not on the ballot Saturday and Sayre, a former 6th District vice chair, was elected district chair without conflict.\nAfter Ralph Smith, former state senator, dropped out of the race for district chairman, Scott Sayre, a Rockbridge County Republican, cruised to the nomination.\nWhile many Republicans fought hard against naming Donald Trump the party\u2019s nominee and a few still continue the fight, many are falling in line behind the party\u2019s bombastic new standard bearer."}
