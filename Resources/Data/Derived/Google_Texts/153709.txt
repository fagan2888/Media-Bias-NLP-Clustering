A former Boulder County deputy who survived a shootout with a gunman near Nederland in 2008 and won a medal of valor for his actions was found dead Thursday afternoon after a resident reported hearing a single gunshot from inside his home near Nederland.

The Boulder County Coroner identified the 51-year-old man as John Seifert, a former Boulder County deputy honored for valor after a shootout with a gunman who killed the general manager of the Eldora Mountain Resort on Dec. 30, 2008.

“Like so many heroes, he had a really difficult time handling that,” said Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle. He said the office worked with Seifert after the shootout to try to get him the help he needed.

Derik Bonestroo, who worked at the resort, shot and killed Brian Mahon after announcing at an employee meeting that he planned to kill anyone who did not share his religion. Seifert, a deputy who worked the Nederland area, responded to calls for help and saw Bonestroo speeding away from the resort. Bonestroo pulled over his car and, according to reports, rolled down a window and opened fire on the deputy.
