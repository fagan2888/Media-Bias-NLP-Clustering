Two teenagers tell police a man hit them with a gun during an early morning robbery Sunday in north Wichita.

It happened at about 1:40 a.m. in the 2100 block of N Market. That's just south of 21st St. and West of Broadway.

The 16-year-old boys told police a man came up to them from behind striking both on the head with a rifle. He then took a cellphone and wallet from one of the victims, before running off in an unknown direction.

No description of the suspect was given. Neither boy suffered serious injuries.
