In this case, any lies, corruption, abuses of power, financial payoffs, or associations with unsavory characters or organizations that involve President Obama or anyone in his administration are never to be treated as a scandal.\n\nThe ongoing incestuous relationship between the Obama administration and the media often tilts in favor of the administration, leaving many scandals uninvestigated, minimized, or outright ignored. For example, both CBS News president David Rhodes and former ABC News president Ben Sherwood have siblings working for the administration. CNN\u2019s deputy Washington bureau chief, Virginia Moseley, is married to Tom Nides, a former Obama staffer under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. And David Plouffe, Obama\u2019s former campaign manager, joined Bloomberg News, while MSNBC hired Axelrod.\n\nPresident Obama even joked in 2013 that \u201c\u2026 David Axelrod now works for MSNBC, which is a nice change of pace since MSNBC used to work for David Axelrod.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nWith so many members of the elite media in bed with the administration, Dartmouth College professor Brendan Nyhan\u2019s 2011 observation that \u201cthe current administration has not yet suffered a major scandal, which I define as a widespread elite perception of wrongdoing\u201d becomes essentially meaningless. Nyhan said that a scandal becomes a scandal \u201conce the S-word is used in a reporter\u2019s own voice in a story that runs on the front page of the [Washington] Post.\u201d\n\nIf Axelrod is using the same criteria, then, of course, President Obama probably can be considered scandal-free. But a real scandal involves actual administration wrongdoing or lies, regardless of the \u201cperceptions\u201d dished out by the media.\n\nAxelrod\u2019s comments ignore the presence of a number of real scandals which the mainstream media, including The Washington Post, continue to report on as phony\u2014including but not limited to:\n\nBenghazi:\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 were greeted with a concerted public relations campaign by the Obama administration blaming the attacks on a protest inspired by a YouTube video, as revealed in the smoking gun Ben Rhodes email. (Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor to President Obama, is CBS President David Rhodes\u2019 brother.) The media, including David Kirkpatrick of The New York Times, continue to dispute key facts of the case such as al-Qaeda\u2019s involvement, have championed erroneous Congressional reports, ignore evidence of a cover-up, and have generally covered for the administration by promoting the idea that this is one of many \u201cphony scandals.\u201d The interim report of the Citizens\u2019 Commission on Benghazi details the various failings and scandals related to Benghazi.\n\nIRS scandal:\n\nThe IRS targeted conservative groups applying for non-profit status from 2010 to 2012. In what some see as an attempt to influence elections, the IRS began requesting inappropriate information disproportionately from conservative groups and then delaying their approval, generally chilling free speech throughout the country. Lois Lerner, at the heart of the scandal, has refused to testify before Congress, pleading the Fifth Amendment. The media continue to argue that President Obama is not connected to this scandal, but it can be tied directly to the White House. The President has tried to assert that there isn\u2019t a \u201csmidgeon\u201d of corruption at the IRS.\n\nFast and Furious\n\nThe Obama Justice Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) encouraged gunwalking across the Mexican border of thousands of weapons, ultimately resulting in the murder of border agent Brian Terry. An ATF whistleblower, John Dodson, spoke out in 2011 about the problems with the ATF\u2019s decision to let guns go to Mexico. As I wrote about in 2011, Fast and Furious was a scandal that no longer could be denied, but the media continued to do so. Sharyl Attkisson recounts in Stonewalled, \u201cBut as outrageous and remarkable as the allegations are, most of the media don\u2019t pick up on the story. They\u2019re steering clear.\u201d As I wrote, the scandal \u201cinvolves some 1,500 guns, about 1,000 of which ended up in Mexico, and a Border agent\u2026who was murdered with weapons found near the scene of the crime in Arizona. The weapons were among 57 linked to Fast and Furious which have been tied to at least 11 violent crimes in the U.S., including the Terry murder.\u201d Like Benghazi, Fast and Furious resulted in real deaths\u2014but the media continue to ignore or downplay this scandal.\n\nVeterans Administration\n\nFollowing revelations in 2014 that there was widespread Veterans Administration falsification of health care wait times, and that certain locations had created secret waiting lists for veterans, the media finally declared this a scandal. But it\u2019s not Obama\u2019s scandal, it\u2019s a Veterans Affairs scandal. Hunter Schwarz writes for the Post that \u201cIt was a very significant scandal, to be sure, but perhaps not one that people laid directly at Obama\u2019s doorstep.\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker Glenn Kessler recently referred to this one as a scandal, noting that only eight people have lost their jobs so far as a result of this veterans care debacle, not 60 as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert McDonald said last week on Meet the Press. But as I have argued, there were really two scandals at the Veterans Administration at the time: health care wait times and the disability benefits backlog.\n\nSolyndra\n\nSolar panel business Solyndra received more than half a billion dollars as part of the administration\u2019s green energy program, before going bankrupt. Its executives took substantial bonuses before the layoffs began. And, a Solyndra investor was also a major bundler for Obama, demonstrating a conflict of interest when the administration refused to turn over more documents as part of a Congressional investigation. And yes, the Post reported on its front page that the Obama administration had asked the company to \u201cdelay announcing it would lay off workers until after the hotly contested November 2010 midterm elections that imperiled Democratic control of Congress.\u201d But NPR ran an article last year victoriously announcing that \u201cNow that the loan program is turning a profit, those critics are silent\u201d\u2014as if that had anything to do with the crony capitalism of the Solyndra scandal.\n\nObamacare\n\nObamacare is an ongoing debacle of premium increases and high deductibles coupled with crippling regulations. It leads to less, not more, health care access. While the focus has been on errors made within the \u201cObamacare rollout,\u201d the media continue to champion exaggerated statistics regarding the alleged 10 million who have received health insurance under President Obama\u2019s signature legislation. In reality, this program marks a rapid increase in Medicaid, and many enrollees are part of a \u201csubstitution effect\u201d by which people who previously had insurance have switched to Obamacare. The subsidies, which the media casts as essential to the law, are under dispute in the courts, and increase the burden on the American taxpayer. Even Politifact called President Obama\u2019s false assertion that Americans could keep their health plan if they liked it the 2013 \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d Meanwhile, the complicit media finds every chance it can to champion this legislation\u2019s \u201csuccesses.\u201d\n\nThis list just scratches the surface. Executive overreach has become standard fare, whether on immigration or environmental regulations. The Obama administration\u2019s penchant for controlling leaks, a lack of transparency, and a war on journalists has been noted by the likes of former Washington Post executive editor Len Downie Jr. who said, \u201cThe [Obama] administration\u2019s war on leaks and other efforts to control information are the most aggressive I\u2019ve seen since the Nixon administration leaks,\u201d and New York Times reporter David Sanger who said, \u201cThis is the most closed, control-freak administration I\u2019ve ever covered.\u201d James Risen of the Times added that the Obama administration has been \u201cthe greatest enemy of press freedom that we have encountered in at least a generation.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s Middle East policies have been a disaster, if not scandalous. Just look at the growing threat from the Islamic State (ISIS) and other radical jihadist Muslim groups. More than 200,000 have been killed in Syria, Libya has become a jihadist playground, described by former CIA officer Bob Baer as \u201cMad Max,\u201d and Yemen, as recently as September held up as an example of where Obama\u2019s foreign policy is working, has seen a coup by Iranian backed jihadists. And looming over all of this is the unfolding, outright appeasement of an Iran with nuclear aspirations.\n\nWhat unifies all of these scandals and lies is how our news media have looked past all the administration\u2019s corruption, treating these occurrences as discrete, minor grievances, gaffes\u2014or even conservative or Republican political maneuvering. This means that the constant lies by the administration, and President Obama himself, can be made with impunity. The media simply will not hold President Obama, or any of his associates who might tarnish his reputation, accountable.\n\nThis article originally appeared at AIM.org and is reprinted here with permission.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The media isn't defining \"scandal\" right...", "author": "Roger Aronoff", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "The media isn't defining \"scandal\" right...", "title": "Liberal Media Continues Incestuous Relationship With Obama, Washes Over Scandals", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/obamatongue.png", "height": 512}, "updated_time": "2015-02-20T12:25:05-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/liberal-media-continues-incestuous-relationship-obama-washes-scandals/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The media isn't defining \"scandal\" right...", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/obamatongue.png", "title": "Liberal Media Continues Incestuous Relationship With Obama, Washes Over Scandals", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-02-20T10:11:23-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2015-02-20T10:11:23-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-20T12:25:05-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "obama's scandals, scandals, administration scandals, obama administration's scandals, , barack obama, benghazi, department of veterans affairs va, fast and furious, internal revenue service irs, mainstream media, media bias, obamacare, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "The ongoing incestuous relationship between the Obama administration and the media often tilts in favor of the administration, leaving many scandals uninvestigated, minimized, or outright ignored.\n(Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor to President Obama, is CBS President David Rhodes\u2019 brother.)\nAxelrod, former senior advisor to President Obama, recently asserted something so patently untrue that it demands a response.\nThe media simply will not hold President Obama, or any of his associates who might tarnish his reputation, accountable.\nThis means that the constant lies by the administration, and President Obama himself, can be made with impunity."}
