However, a recent post unfortunately confirms she has fully entered the latter camp. The post itself is rather unremarkable. It's mostly a hodgepodge of others' quotes, with a little of her own commentary sprinkled throughout. But then\u2014at the end\u2014she makes two very, very concerning statements that reveal the depth of her denial. She claims that the Climategate emails were 'handled pretty responsibly' by the denier bloggers who released them. Yes, Curry believes the manufactured controversy\u2014wherein a trove of emails were quote-mined, with various snippets taken completely out of context and presented as damning evidence of climate science malfeasance\u2014was 'handled pretty responsibly.' Perhaps she has a unique definition of 'responsibly,' because NINE investigations cleared the scientists of wrongdoing and showed the bloggers were completely wrong in their portrayal. Not content to stop there, Curry pulls out what may be the single most misleading doctored quote: the combination of 'Mike's Nature trick' and 'hide the decline, which deniers trumpeted as evidence that scientists were cooking the books to turn a decline in temperatures into warming.\"\n\nAl Roker on Sen. Jim Inhofe's stunt \"What an Idiot! 'I got a snowball!\u2019 Are you crazy?\"\u2014by Lefty Coaster: \"Al Roker Slams 'Moron' Jim Inhofe For Bringing Snowball To Senate: During a conversation with host Josh Zepps about his new book The Storm Of The Century, Roker was direct about his impression of climate change deniers like Inhofe, who brought a snowball to the Senate floor earlier this year in an effort to disprove global warming. 'There was some senator [Inhofe] that got on the floor of the Senate this past winter, and holds up a snowball on the floor of the Senate. What a moron,' Roker said. '\"I got a snowball!\" Are you crazy? It\u2019s called climate change. Climate doesn\u2019t just happen outside your door, sir. It happens all around the world. And when I saw that I thought, \"I can\u2019t believe this.\"'\"\n\nReduce atmospheric carbon by turning it into nanofibers\u2014by Krotor: \"The BBC reported today that U.S. researchers have discovered a cheap and environmentally friendly method to convert carbon in the air into carbon nanofibers. Atmospheric carbon is one of the major contributors to global warming and we humans produce literally tons of it by burning fossil fuels as well as other activities; about 10 billion tons per year is released into the atmosphere. Professor Stuart Licht, of George Washington University, described the new process in a presentation for the American Chemical Society as a ... solar-powered system runs just a few volts of electricity through a vat full of a hot, molten salt; CO2 is absorbed and the nanofibres gradually assemble at one of the electrodes. At this point, the researchers are operating at a very small scale, producing only 10 grams (1/3 of an ounce) of carbon nanofibers per hour. However, he and his team believe that it can be scaled up dramatically and still maintain a low cost as well as an eco-friendly footprint since it is solar powered.\"\n\nDon't read this if you don't want to know how bad it is\u2014by rktect: \"Abrupt Climate Change forced by 30 some odd self reinforcing feedback loops is making it possible to observe what was projected by the IPCC to occur by the end of the century now. You may have missed this news as there is a lot going on with the Donald. These Methane releases are what Hansen warned of as the Clathrate Gun, or in other words the tipping points have tipped. Methane Hydrate releases in the arctic as warned of by Sam Carana are now reported by NOAA to be 150 miles across. You will remember that even slight releases of methane in the arctic were enough to cause polar researchers like Jason Box to freak out a little over a year ago. [...] Methane is orders of magnitude worse than CO2 and its being released in 50 Gigaton bursts farts that by themselves can cause an instant 1.3\u00b0 C global temperature rise.\"\n\nExtreme Weather & Natural Phenomena\n\nWashington Wildfires- A Way To Help and a View From Spokane\u2014by peagreen: \"Just wanted to share a small view from my window. Spokane is not going unscathed during these terrible terrible fires. Our air quality, which hasn't been the best over these days and weeks, today turned 'very unhealthy.' Going out of doors is, to say the least, uncomfortable. This smoke map gives you an idea. And the cold figures of the Washington fire incidents. It's nothing, to say the least, compared to what the firefighters are going through and the people of these communities. But it is a keen reminder of the enormity of this disaster. [...] Just got this email!! from the Joe Pakootas Campaign [...] Yesterday we launched a effort to help residents & firefighters who have been battling the wild fires throughout Eastern Washington. Working with the Red Cross, we've asked for donations of items for firefighters, pets & people who are under evacuation & have been relocated. (See list of items below) Donations can be dropped off at Campaign HQ at 1410 W. Dean Ave., Spokane.\"\n\nObama Declares Washington state Fire Emergency; Guard, Army, Canada, Australia, New Zealand inbound\u2014by e2247: \"The West has burned a patch 107 miles by 107 miles. It's getting worse as you read this so click here for Current Incidents. That is one realty we should all be discussing. Year-to-date statistics 2015 (1/1/15 - 8/21/15). Fires: 41,525. Acres: 7,293,666 (1 square mile = 640 acres) Oregon, Idaho, Washington states have National Guard and Army fighting fires with experts from Australia & New Zealand on the way to join Canadian and U.S. active fire fighters. Any questions? Climate Change. [...] President Obama signed a federal declaration of emergency for Washington state on Friday, authorizing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts in 11 counties and several Indian reservations hard hit by wildfires.\"\n\nCritters & the Great Outdoors\n\nDaily Bucket: California's resident grey wolves (with pups!)\u2014by Besame: \"We have grey wolves! The Shasta Pack was documented recently by California Dept of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) trail cameras. Earlier photos in May and July showed two adults and the new photos found five pups estimated to be a few months old. Wild wolves historically inhabited California, but were extirpated. Aside from these wolves and the famous wolf OR7 who entered California in December 2011, the last confirmed wolf in the state was here in 1924. OR7 has not been in California for more than a year and is currently the breeding male of the Rogue Pack in southern Oregon. Grey wolves are protected as Endangered by the California Endangered Species Act as of 2014, as well as under the federal ESA. CDFW is preparing a Draft Wolf Management Plan.\"\n\nThe Daily Bucket - rough water sightings: sea lions and a minke \u2014by: \"...a rough day out on the water. The weather was sunny and calm, but there was a confusion of currents as the water found its way around rocks, through narrow passages and over hidden reefs. This is typical when there's a big tidal exchange although not entirely predictable. We weren't able to get close to the rocks at all this time, too hazardous. But with my zoom lens I could see the earliest Steller sea lions resting there. A few have returned from the summer rookeries on the open coast. These are the vanguard. Soon the seals will decamp from these rocks.\" Off topic...Farmed Pheasants \u2014by: \"I moved into my current home almost two years ago, happy to have joined an agrarian community. What I didn't know was that there is a game bird farm that stretches for hundreds of acres adjoining the property. I began to see ring-necked pheasants in my yard, and thought nothing of it, until one Saturday morning I heard gunshots behind my house. [...] This farm raises pheasants, among other birds, and sells both eggs and young birds for the sole purpose of hunting them. They also invite hunters to pay for privileges of shooting the birds in my back yard. I mostly ignored this brutal practice, until this year, when I found several young birds wandering around the lawn with these funny little 'hoods' on. I thought at first they were tags, used to identify the birds. I would do my best to 'shoo' them back to the farm and hope that they would be ok. I was completely wrong on all accounts. The little 'hoods' were actually blinders, installed via a painful process of piercing the birds nasal septum and attaching a plastic shield so that the birds cannot see directly in front of them. This is supposedly to prevent them from pecking at each other, as they're apparently carnivorous (according to the salesmen of said blinders).\"\n\nThe Daily Bucket - Hummer Happenings!\u2014by Attack Gardener: \"What is summer without hummingbirds? [...] Depending on how you count them there are somewhere between 17 and lots living in North America and over 300 species worldwide. Being in the Northeast, the only one that visits us regularly is the ruby-throated hummingbird. [...] The incredible color of the hummers' feathers is actually a function of the structure of the feather, not a matter of pigmentation. Per Cornell's All About Birds: The iridescent colors of the gorget are the result of the refraction of incident light caused by the microscopic structure of the feathers. The refraction works like a prism, splitting the light into rich, component colors. At certain angles little or no light is reflected back to the viewer and the gorget can appear black. As the viewing angle changes, the refracted light becomes visible in a glowing, shimmering iridescent display.<...] This summer, I was fortunate enough to have a female and two chicks call my yard home. As is normal with hummers, the male had been around early in the season but, once his mating duties were completed, the female chased him off and raised the chicks by herself. I was never able to find her nest, no surprise considering it is about the size and shape of half a chicken egg and usually covered in moss for camouflage.\"\n\nDaily Bucket: A Walk at Griggs Nature Preserve\u2014by Lenny Flank: \"Griggs Nature Preserve is a small city park, consisting of a boardwalk about 200 yards long. It is located in Columbus OH, near the Scioto River.\"\n\nMonarch butterfly population has declined 90% in recent years. You can help bring them back\u2014by Jen Hayden: \"Since the 1990s, researchers estimate the monarch butterfly population has plummeted by a whopping 90%. What's caused the sharp drop in this beautiful species? Herbicides, logging, and modern farming: A big part of it is the way the United States farms. As the price of corn has soared in recent years, driven by federal subsidies for biofuels, farmers have expanded their fields. That has meant plowing every scrap of earth that can grow a corn plant, including millions of acres of land once reserved in a federal program for conservation purposes. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department wants to change that as soon as possible. They've launched an ambitious 'butterfly highway' between Minnesota and Texas.\"\n\nEnergy\n\nCoal, Oil, Gas & Nuclear\n\nClinton's opposition to Arctic drilling is as depressing as it is terrific\u2014by Sarge in Seattle: \"Hillary opposes Arctic drilling. Yay. 'The Arctic is a unique treasure. Given what we know, it\u2019s not worth the risk.' 'And I think we should not risk the potential catastrophes that could come about from accidents in looking for more oil in one of the last remaining pristine regions of the world.' This is a big deal, a step in the right direction from the current administration, and a shining example of how utterly stupid it would be to elect a Republican president. But she doesn't oppose drilling itself. Not that everyone didn't already know that. The message is that drilling for new oil sources is just fine and dandy so long as it takes place in wastelands nobody cares about, like North Dakota or most of Texas; or, for that matter, any non-'pristine' area like the Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nAstroturfing for dollars\u2014by jtinker53: \"There is a commercial running in California showing a very serious woman voicing some very serious concerns. She is urging citizens to contact their State Senators and Representatives to vote NO on a new set of regulations. But all is not as it seems. [...] In the aforementioned commercial, the woman is talking about The California Gas Restriction Act of 2015. She says the act will restrict the use of gas and diesel by 50% over the next 15 years.Shes says this will lead to mileage restrictions, gas rationing, higher costs, and driver penalties for using too much gas. The disclosure at the end reads \"Paid for by Western States Petroleum Association working with the California Drivers Alliance. The apostrophe-less California Drivers Alliance is a program of the Western States Petroleum Association, and this group gets it money from BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobile, and Shell. This is text-book astroturfing disguised as a grassroots group.\"\n\nRenewables & Conservation\n\nIndia's Cochin International Airport now runs on 100% solar power\u2014by Walter Einenkel: \"India has very big solar-powered aspirations. There are plans to build the world's largest floating solar farm. Cochin International Airport is India's fourth-largest airport, located in the southern city of Kochi. Cochin International was able to build a 46,150 paneled solar farm that will cover all of the airport's electric needs. The nearby solar farm responsible for powering the airport contains 46,150 solar panels. The farm itself covers 180,000 square meters (45 acres) of land. The project took six months to set up and cost $6 million (\u00a33.8 million) to complete. However, this is a cost that the airport is projected to make up in the next five years. Not bad when the solar panels themselves are expected to last 25 years. These solar panels are predicted to prevent the creation of around 300,000 tons worth of carbon emissions during their lifetime.\"\n\nRenewables are now the world's second-highest source of electricity \u2014by: \"The International Energy Agency (IEA) announced a couple of weeks ago that 2014 saw renewables, mostly wind and solar, had risen in use enough to become the second-largest source of electricity used on the planet earth.\n\nWSJ's D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu with Bryce on Birds\u2014by ClimateDenierRoundup : \"Never one to let a good faux scandal go to waste, the WSJ granted Robert Bryce (a fossil-fuel funded Manhattan Institute senior fellow) space to opine on a recent ruling about wind turbines and avian mortality. According to a federal ruling handed down on August 11th, the wind industry will not be granted a thirty-year exemption to the laws protecting eagles and must perform Environmental Impact Assessments for its turbines. While this adds a layer of red tape (generally despised by WSJ opinion writers, but now celebrated) to wind power deployment, it's by no means a death knell to the industry. Not to mention fossil fuel power plants kill far more birds than wind or solar. While wind farms kill 0.27 birds per gigawatt-hour (GWh), fossil-fuel powered plants kill a staggering 9.4 birds per GWh. When you factor in reports like Audubon's that show nearly half the birds in the US may be driven to extinction by climate change this century, the expansion of wind power doesn't look like the 'impending slaughter' described by Bryce. There's also the fact that research has shown eagle deaths are reduced dramatically over just a couple years as the birds learn to fly around the wind farms. Unsurprisingly, the piece is remarkably similar to a 2013 oped by Bryce in the WSJ about wind and birds. Though the 2013 oped (incorrectly) suggests wind power might be on the way out, the pieces are quite similar in style, tone and meaning.\"\n\nAgriculture, Food & Gardening\n\n\n\nSaturday Morning Garden Blogging: Harbingers of Fall \u2014by: \"Good morning, gardeners! Here on the High Plains, fall is in the air. Autumn has come earlier here this year, it seems, maybe because of the El Nino? We've also had great rainfall this summer, and everything is green and lush out on the prairie (all this moisture doesn't bode well for winter, though!).Temperatures at night have dropped into the 60's and the flocks of grackles and starlings and blackbirds are gathering in huge groups as they get ready for the migration to the south. This is always the sign that autumn is coming out here. Out over the fields of corn and milo and sunflowers, the 'murmurations' (the movement of the flock as one being) are quite disorganized as the younger birds have to learn how to follow the flock and often get left behind in the flock's sudden turns and dives. It really is incredible to watch!\"\n\nAnti-GMO activists and climate change deniers \u2013 no science\u2014by Skeptical Raptor: \"There is an evolving feeling that anti-GMO activists and climate change deniers are nearly the same. They both rely upon denialism (also known as pseudoskepticism), which is the culture of denying the established scientific consensus despite overwhelming evidence. Admittedly, some of the denialism is based on political expediency. Climate change denialism is a fundamental aspect of many politically conservative voters across the world, but especially in the United States, where Republican legislatures in the United States have passed anti-anthropogenic global warming legislation. But not to be outdone, the left-wing parties across the world have their own particular brand of science denialism\u2013GMOs. Some may argue that vaccine denialism has a political component which is supported by some liberals, there's also a lot of evidence that Republicans in the US have the same anti-vaccine belief. Setting aside the politically nuanced anti-vaccine groups, GMOs are the left's version of climate change denial.\"\n\nEco-Essays and Eco-Philosophy\n\nOpportunities to take action have an expiration date\u2014by rktect: \"Now its coming on fall. Its getting cooler but wetter as well. You can add to your to do list getting in some wood for winter and of course that means making some room to put it under cover because all your tarps are going to be up on the roof. Regarding Climate Change there is in fact so much to do that just building a global consensus to shift away from fossil fuels to solar and wind, getting China to agree to use Solar instead of coal, getting the G7 to agree to leave the carbon in the ground, taking away subsidies for BP and Shell to drill baby drill in the arctic and saying no to unions who want tube steel contracts from Trans Canada to build Keystone XL can be countered by a few lobbyists buying commercials telling us what a great thing fracking to bring us clean natural gas will be. So let's say you eventually do get started. You identify funding for new materials, get them delivered, build staging, get some pump jacks and staging planks, roof jacks, put some ladders up. You remove enough of the old rotted roof, sheathing boards, tar paper, molding, so you have room to shingle and you lay out a roll of copper flashing along your rake. Then you take the first load of the old stuff to recycling, and that's when the first thunder storm drenches your living room because you didn't rig the tarps yet.\"\n\nLaughing about Climate Change\u2014by Franksandbeans: \"So the other day, the Speaker of the House of a large country was asked about the increasing temperatures around the country. 'Last month was the hottest on record since records have been kept' they said, 'Do you think this is because of Climate Change?' To this he responded, 'Don\u2019t ask me, I\u2019m not scientist. I am just a man of faith' and that 'The jury is still out on this one, not all the experts agree.' He then was asked 'What about all of the fires around the country and the fact that they are larger and destroying more area than ever, could this be due to Climate Change?' His answer was short, 'I am a man of God not an expert, but the answer is not all the scientists agree on this issue. Let's just wait for the jury to come in.' Just as the next question was about to be asked, all of the sirens in the city started wailing. A hurricane approached, the size no one had seen before. With it came rain that went on for 40 days and nights and the official was consumed by the ensuing flood.\"\n\nForests, Wilderness & Public Lands\n\nWisconsin's treasures are up for sale!\u2014by JoryInWI : \"Wisconsin legislature wants to divest itself of land that was set aside for preservation and recreation by the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program. The state Department of Natural Resources has identified more than 1,000 acres of state-owned land in Langlade County that could go on the auction block \u2014 a move that has angered trout anglers because the properties contain a cache of ecologically significant spring ponds with native brook trout populations. [...] The ponds, gouged by glaciers thousands of years ago, are fed by rich sources of groundwater that sustain the fish and neighboring streams, rivers and lakes.[...]\n\nThe driving force is a directive by the Legislature to put 10,000 acres of state-owned land up for sale. The property must be made available to the public by June 30, 2017.
