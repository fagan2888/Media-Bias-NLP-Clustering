I think it's unfortunate. We are trying to keep everybody as safe as we can,\" Belmar told reporters.\n\nThe march toward the church was halted while police and ambulances rushed to an area behind the church where the shots were thought to have come from.\n\nBrown's shooting on Aug. 9, 2014, touched off months of protests nationwide about the treatment of minorities by police. Several other unarmed black men have since died in cities including New York, Cincinnati, Baltimore, and Arlington, Texas.\n\n(Reporting by Carey Gillam; Editing by Jill Serjeant and Lisa Shumaker)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It was unclear who fired the shots or the extent of any injuries, a police spokesman t", "title": "Shots fired during Ferguson police shooting anniversary", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/09/Shots-fired-during-march-Ferguson-mark-Michael-Brown-death-anniversary", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ferguson-anniversary_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/09/Shots-fired-during-march-Ferguson-mark-Michael-Brown-death-anniversary", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ferguson-anniversary_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It was unclear who fired the shots or the extent of any injuries, a police spokesman t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "We are trying to keep everybody as safe as we can,\" Belmar told reporters.\nSt. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said he was angry that a shooting had marred the weekend's events in Ferguson, which have so far gone off without major incidents or arrests.\nIt was unclear who fired the shots or the extent of any injuries, a police spokesman told reporters, but initial reports suggested they were not aimed at the marchers.\nBrown's shooting on Aug. 9, 2014, touched off months of protests nationwide about the treatment of minorities by police.\nThe march toward the church was halted while police and ambulances rushed to an area behind the church where the shots were thought to have come from."}
