The Democrat incumbent remains 3.7 points up in the RealClearPolitics polling average despite stories like this from Carolina Journal Online:\n\nSen. Kay Hagan\u2019s husband and son created a solar energy contracting company in August 2010, and then, using $250,644 in federal stimulus grant funds, her husband hired that same company to install solar panels at a building he owns. Public records show that Green State Power was formed seven weeks before JDC Manufacturing \u2014 a company owned in part by Greensboro attorney Charles \u201cChip\u201d Hagan III, Sen. Hagan\u2019s husband \u2014 received the stimulus grant for the solar project at a 300,000-square-foot facility in Reidsville, N.C. A story in late September on the Washington, D.C.-based website Politico revealed that JDC Manufacturing received \u201cnearly $390,000 in federal grants for energy projects and tax credits created by the 2009 stimulus law, according to public records and information provided by the company.\u201d\n\nWait, it gets even sleazier:\n\nGreen State Power\u2019s website claims the company was founded in 2008, before Hagan became a U.S. senator. But records from the Corporations Division of the N.C. Department of the Secretary of State show the company was formed on Aug. 10, 2010, under the name Solardyne. JDC Manufacturing\u2019s stimulus grant was awarded Sept. 29, 2010 \u2014 seven weeks after Chip Hagan filed papers with the secretary of state\u2019s office creating the company. Carolina Journal has been unable to determine on what date JDC applied for the stimulus grant. In May 2012, Chip Hagan filed papers changing the name of Solardyne to Green State Power.\n\nYou can see why none of this would matter to Democrat serfs \u2013 they think their rulers deserve great riches, especially if the loot is claimed in the name of something high-minded like \u201cgreen energy.\u201d But in this age of the Ineptocracy, with billions of dollars vanishing into thin air while Big Government delivers one fraud and catastrophe after another, you would think voters outside the hard Democrat base might find this disturbing, especially in light of Hagan\u2019s connection to the biggest mixture of government incompetence and cronyism in the land, ObamaCare. As the North Carolina GOP points out, Hagan delivered the \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan\u201d lie as often as Barack Obama did.\n\nSince national security is on everyone\u2019s mind right now, maybe North Carolina voters will react to Hagan finally admitting something that conservative news organizations unearthed a month ago: she blew off a Senate Armed Services committee hearing on ISIS to attend a fundraiser. She really is Barack Obama\u2019s Mini-Me, isn\u2019t she?\n\nAs the Washington Free Beacon reports:\n\nAfter weeks of avoiding questions on her whereabouts the day of the classified hearing, Hagan admitted to reporters in a post-debate press conference that she missed the Armed Services Committee hearing due to a fundraiser. When asked about the hearing after the debate, Hagan said that she was unable to attend because the hearing was postponed till the afternoon. \u201cThere was one and what had happened at that hearing, it was scheduled early in the day, and then votes were scheduled, and that hearing then had to be postponed later that day, so yes, I did miss that one,\u201d said Hagan. Hagan\u2019s office had previously refused multiple requests to set the record straight on whether she attended the hearing or the fundraiser.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to understand why her office wouldn\u2019t be eager to discuss the matter:\n\nOn the night of the hearing, a cocktail reception fundraiser was held for Hagan on Park Avenue in New York City, with tickets to the event going for as much as $5,200. Hagan officially began her campaign for senate earlier that same week. The North Carolina Republican Party quickly pounced on Hagan\u2019s admission, calling it a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d \u201cSenator Hagan has an embarrassing record of skipping important hearings at the Senate Armed Services Committee,\u201d said executive director Todd Poole. \u201cNow she has admitted the worst possible excuse is true: she skipped a committee hearing for a political fundraiser.\u201d \u201cAfter weeks of hiding the truth, she owes the people of North Carolina, the people who sign her paycheck, an explanation\u2013and an apology,\u201d added Poole. Tillis has attacked her attendance record as a member of the Armed Services Committee, stating that Hagan has missed half of the committee\u2019s meetings so far in 2014, and that \u201cwhile ISIS grew\u2026 Kay Hagan kept quiet.\u201d Politifact rated the claim that Hagan has missed half of the committee hearings as \u201cMostly True,\u201d finding that she had only attended 9 of 22 open hearings held by the committee in 2014.\n\n\u201cMostly True?\u201d If Tillis said she skipped half the meetings, and she actually missed 13 out of 22, shouldn\u2019t the fact-check rating be \u201cEven More True Than Tillis Thought?\u201d\n\nDuring the Tuesday debate, Hagan failed to name a single policy recommendation she would make to combat the rise of the Islamic State when asked whether there is \u201canything President Obama is not doing that you would do.\u201d Local reports confirmed that Hagan admitted that she attended a fundraiser instead of the Armed Services Committee, and seem to agree that the comment could be a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in the race. A reporter from ABC\u2019s Raleigh affiliate said that \u201cof all the things said\u201d on debate night, Hagan\u2019s comment made after the event is likely to have the biggest effect on the race \u201cin days and weeks to come.\u201d\n\nI guess we\u2019ll have to see about that. Tillis is trying to climb out from beneath the kind of massive negative ad blitz Democrats treat as a political crime when it\u2019s directed at them. The 2014 elections will feature several contests between the strategy of hitting the opponent early to define him, especially if he\u2019s a challenger, vs. keeping your powder dry until the home stretch when voters are paying closer attention.\n\nNorth Carolina voters have yet to meet a standard they weren\u2019t willing to lower for Kay Hagan. Will an Obama-style focus on fundraising be the game-changer, or is that a feature of American political life the voters have accepted, at least for Democrats? (Any Republican foolish enough to think he can get away with attending endless fundraisers while the world burns deserves the media evisceration he will receive.) Will it matter that Obama is actually losing the war against the Islamic State, with the enemy poised to score a major strategic victory, unless last-ditch efforts to save the Syrian Kurdish city of Kobani are successful? How\u2019s that new wave of ObamaCare insurance cancellations going to sit with people who remember Hagan repeating Obama\u2019s Big Lie about keeping your plan?\n\nMaybe it\u2019ll be all of the above, and then some, because last night\u2019s debate was Hagan dispensing Democrat boilerplate like a vending machine, while Tillis linked her to Obama\u2019s policies. From the Charlotte Observer debate recap:\n\nThe fast-paced and occasionally personal tone was set with Hagan\u2019s opening remarks: \u201cSpeaker Tillis has built a record of dividing our state, always putting the wealthy and big corporations first.\u201d Later in the debate, she called Tillis \u201cspineless\u201d for criticizing President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of the Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq while refusing to say what he would do. She also accused Tillis several times of not answering Stephanopoulos\u2019 questions. \u201cYou want to ask him your question again?\u201d she asked Stephanopoulos, who twice asked Tillis where he would part with Republican leadership in the Senate. (He later said he wouldn\u2019t have supported shutting down the federal government due to automatic budget cuts under sequestration last year. She said she parted ways with Democrats on the Keystone oil pipeline and on the budget over military cuts.) Tillis continued his theme tying Hagan to Obama, saying the November election will be a measure of the president\u2019s policies, quoting the now-familiar figure that she has voted with Obama 96 percent of the time. \u201cI assume you\u2019re proud you voted with him 96 percent of the time,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to make this election about his policies.\u201d Hagan\u2019s response: \u201cOne hundred percent of the time Speaker Tillis\u2019 policies have hurt North Carolina,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s gutted education, killed the equal pay bill, no Medicaid expansion.\u201d She said Tillis was erroneously trying to paint her as part of a liberal Washington establishment, reiterating her ranking as a moderate. \u201cI am smack dab in the middle,\u201d she said. \u201cSmack dab in the middle is exactly where North Carolina is.\u201d\n\nIs there anything more hollow than a modern Democrat \u2013 a perpetrator of ObamaCare, no less \u2013 claiming to be a \u201ccentrist,\u201d and citing something as transparently silly as claiming to be for the Keystone XL pipeline? Fat lot of good your alleged opposition to Obama\u2019s agenda 4 percent of the time has done for America, Senator. The hard truth is that nothing will change if Democrats retain control of the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is as much of an obstacle to American progress as President Obama is, so every Democrat is part of the problem. Tough break, guys, but that\u2019s what you get for marching in lockstep with a disastrous Administration\u2026 unless, of course, you can trick some voters into thinking you\u2019re a \u201ccentrist\u201d who has been silently appalled by Obama\u2019s policies for the last six years. I wish I could say it\u2019s silly for them to try, but the polls don\u2019t reflect that. Not yet, anyway.\n\nUpdate: The part of the debate where Hagan, despite the loads of chaff she\u2019s been dumping to distance herself from Obama, couldn\u2019t name a single point of disagreement with the President was illuminating for several other reasons:\n\nFor one thing, Tillis just objectively looks more reasoned and statesmanlike here. Hagan is visibly shaken by the question then flings taking points and dodges the question, while Tillis lays out a sensible case and explains why Hagan\u2019s fealty to Obama is out of step with North Carolina voters.\n\nThe exchange also leads one to think about the traditional balance between state and national issues during Senate campaigns, which can be an even livelier tango than what you see in House races. Obviously a candidate running in the shadow of an unpopular President wants to keep the focus local, but is that really the way voters should ever think about it? We don\u2019t have anything resembling a federalist system any more. The lines between local and national issues have become blurred. We should all be used to the way national Party leadership lines up votes and cuts a few members enough slack to pretend they\u2019re maverick renegades, for the benefit of state electorates who lean against the Party\u2019s ideology. I suppose those simple tricks are still used because they work, and they work because too many voters don\u2019t quite understand how these games are played in Washington. Neither party\u2019s leaders and power brokers are eager to educate them, but conservative politicians serious about changing the way this decrepit system works should expose the games at every opportunity.\n\nUpdate: The Drudge Report sums up the desperate attempts of Democrats like Kay Hagan to run away from Obama:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "From ObamaCare, to stimulus profiteering, to skipping an ISIS briefing for a fundraiser, it seems like there's nothing she can do to turn some people off.", "title": "Kay Hagan is shameful; does NC care? | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/uploads/2014/10/drudge_ebola.png", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/10/08/kay-hagan-puts-the-low-standards-of-north-carolina-voters-to-the-test/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "From ObamaCare, to stimulus profiteering, to skipping an ISIS briefing for a fundraiser, it seems like there's nothing she can do to turn some people off.", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hagan_tillis_debate.jpg", "description": "From ObamaCare, to stimulus profiteering, to skipping an ISIS briefing for a fundraiser, it seems like there's nothing she can do to turn some people off.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "article_summary": "North Carolina voters have yet to meet a standard they weren\u2019t willing to lower for Kay Hagan.\nUpdate: The Drudge Report sums up the desperate attempts of Democrats like Kay Hagan to run away from Obama:\nAs the North Carolina GOP points out, Hagan delivered the \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan\u201d lie as often as Barack Obama did.\nAs the Washington Free Beacon reports:After weeks of avoiding questions on her whereabouts the day of the classified hearing, Hagan admitted to reporters in a post-debate press conference that she missed the Armed Services Committee hearing due to a fundraiser.\nIn May 2012, Chip Hagan filed papers changing the name of Solardyne to Green State Power."}
