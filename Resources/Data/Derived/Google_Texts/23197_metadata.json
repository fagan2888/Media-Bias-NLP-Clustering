The raw institutional racism that prevailed before the civil rights movement ended the Jim Crow laws is gone, although subtler discrimination persists. Individual attitudes have changed, too, dramatically in some cases. For example, as recently as the 1980s half of Americans opposed interracial marriage, a position now held by only a tiny minority.\n\nYet racial hatred is still a potent force in US society, as we\u2019ve just been reminded to our horror. And I\u2019m sorry to say this, but the racial divide is still a defining feature of our political economy, the reason the US is unique among advanced nations in its harsh treatment of the less fortunate and its willingness to tolerate unnecessary suffering among its citizens.\n\nOf course, saying this brings angry denials from many conservatives, so let me try to be cool and careful here, and cite some of the overwhelming evidence for the continuing centrality of race in our national politics.\n\nMy understanding of the role of race in US exceptionalism was largely shaped by two academic papers.\n\nThe first, by political scientist Larry Bartels, analysed the move of the white working class away from Democrats, a move made famous in Thomas Frank\u2019s book What\u2019s the Matter with Kansas? Frank argued that working-class whites were being induced to vote against their own interests by the right\u2019s exploitation of cultural issues. But Bartels showed that the working-class turn against Democrats wasn\u2019t a national phenomenon \u2013 it was entirely restricted to the South, where whites turned overwhelmingly Republican after the passage of the Civil Rights Act and Richard Nixon\u2019s adoption of the so-called Southern strategy.\n\nAnd this party-switching, in turn, was what drove the rightward swing of American politics after 1980. Race made Reaganism possible. And to this day Southern whites overwhelmingly vote Republican, to the tune of 85 or even 90 per cent in the deep South.\n\nThe second paper, by economists Alberto Alesina, Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote, was titled Why Doesn\u2019t the United States Have a European-style Welfare State? Its authors \u2013 who are not, by the way, especially liberal \u2013 explored a number of hypotheses but eventually concluded that race is central, because in America programmes that help the needy are all too often seen as programmes that help Those People: \u201cWithin the United States, race is the single most important predictor of support for welfare. America\u2019s troubled race relations are clearly a major reason for the absence of an American welfare state.\u201d\n\nNow, that paper was published in 2001, and you might wonder if things have changed since then. Unfortunately, the answer is that they haven\u2019t, as you can see by looking at how states are implementing \u2013 or refusing to implement \u2013 Obamacare.\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t been following this issue, in 2012 the Supreme Court gave individual states the option, if they so chose, of blocking the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, a key part of the plan to provide health insurance to lower-income Americans.\n\nBut why would any state choose to exercise that option? After all, states were being offered a federally-funded programme that would provide major benefits to millions of their citizens, pour billions into their economies, and help support their healthcare providers. Who would turn down such an offer? The answer is: 22 states at this point, although some may eventually change their minds. And what do these states have in common? Mainly, a history of slaveholding: only one former member of the confederacy has expanded Medicaid, and while a few northern states are also part of the movement, more than 80 per cent of the population in Medicaid-refusing America lives in states that practiced slavery before the civil war.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just health reform: a history of slavery is a strong predictor of everything from gun control (or rather its absence) to low minimum wages, tax policy and hostility to unions.\n\nSo: will it always be thus? Is the US doomed to live forever politically in the shadow of slavery?\n\nI\u2019d like to think not. For one thing, our country is growing more ethnically diverse, and the old black-white polarity is slowly becoming outdated. For another, as I said, we really have become much less racist, and in general a much more tolerant society on many fronts. Over time we should expect to see the influence of dog-whistle politics decline.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t happened yet. Every once in a while you hear a chorus of voices declaring that race is no longer a problem in the US. That\u2019s wishful thinking; in the US we are still haunted by the our nation\u2019s original sin. \u2013 (New York Times service)", "article_metadata": {"description": "States\u2019 history of slavery is a strong predictor on a wide range of policy issues", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom12258912"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "States\u2019 history of slavery is a strong predictor on a wide range of policy issues", "title": "US still lives in the shadow of slavery, the nation\u2019s original sin", "url": "http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/us-still-lives-in-the-shadow-of-slavery-the-nation-s-original-sin-1.2258912", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.2258910.1434991105!/image/image.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 540}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "States\u2019 history of slavery is a strong predictor on a wide range of policy issues", "title": "US still lives in the shadow of slavery, the nation\u2019s original sin", "url": "http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/us-still-lives-in-the-shadow-of-slavery-the-nation-s-original-sin-1.2258912", "image": "http://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.2258910.1434991105!/image/image.jpg", "site": "@IrishTimesBiz", "card": "summary", "account_id": 15084853}, "robots": "all", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "news_keywords": "Business, Economy, World, Alberto Alesina, Bruce Sacerdote, Edward Glaeser, Larry Bartels, Paul Krugman, Richard Nixon, Thomas Frank, Supreme Court, White House, United States"}, "article_summary": "The raw institutional racism that prevailed before the civil rights movement ended the Jim Crow laws is gone, although subtler discrimination persists.\nFrank argued that working-class whites were being induced to vote against their own interests by the right\u2019s exploitation of cultural issues.\nThat\u2019s wishful thinking; in the US we are still haunted by the our nation\u2019s original sin.\nIs the US doomed to live forever politically in the shadow of slavery?\nYet racial hatred is still a potent force in US society, as we\u2019ve just been reminded to our horror."}
