Ted Cruz (R-Texas) appeared on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d yesterday, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) seemed gobsmacked. \u201cA lot of it\u2019s sort of Alice in Wonderland,\u201d Schumer said of Cruz\u2019s rhetoric.\n\nIt was a fair assessment, but there\u2019s arguably even more to it. Host Bob Schieffer, for example, asked Cruz if there were any circumstances that might lead Cruz to support another government shutdown. The Teas Republican responded:\n\n\u201cThroughout the government shutdown I opposed a government shutdown. I said we shouldn\u2019t shut the government down, I think it was a mistake that President Obama and the Democrats shut the government down this fall. [\u2026] \u201cRight now the Democrats are telling you that they want another shut down, because they think it benefits them politically. Why is it hard to understand that they forced the shut down when they think it benefits them politically.\u201d\n\nEventually, a slightly confused Schieffer asked, \u201cSenator, if you didn\u2019t threaten the shut down the government who was it that did?\u201d\n\nThe fact that the host seemed mystified was understandable; few politicians can convey up-is-down assurances with the kind of condescending certainty that Ted Cruz offers.\n\nBut watching the right-wing senator, it occurred to me we\u2019re not just seeing a senator pushing a version of reality from some alternate universe; we\u2019re also seeing the Republican id in its most pure form.\n\nIn the same interview, Cruz said it would \u201cirresponsible\u201d for the nation to simply pay its bills without far-right goodies attached. He went on to say President Obama ought to use the State of the Union to apologize for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe interview followed this gem from a few days ago.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz wants a special prosecutor to investigate misconduct at the IRS. The Texas Republican follows up on the first in a series of five questions that Cruz would like to see President Barack Obama address in next week\u2019s State of the Union address. Each of the questions hit on politically charged subject matter, ranging from the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, to claims made by the president about the health care overhaul. Cruz\u2019s IRS-related request comes in a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. He\u2019s looking for a special prosecutor to consider any potential criminal cases against IRS officials over the agency\u2019s controversial actions against tea party and conservative organizations.\n\nA few days before sending the letter, Cruz argued that helping working families afford medical care \u201cexacerbates income inequality. This is why the rich have gotten richer under President Obama.\u201d\n\nNone of this makes a lick of sense, but by all appearances, being sensible isn\u2019t the goal.
