The General Assembly on June 3 partially restored the funding for obstetrics and gynecology in the state budget, but they didn\u2019t restore the 42.5 percent cut to radiology services.\n\nDr. Robert Russo, president of the Connecticut State Medical Society, said that means instead of seeing five Medicaid patients per day, these radiology centers will have to see one. That essentially creates an access issue for those who need these preventative services, Russo said.\n\n\u201cWhy did you not restore us?\u201d Russo, a radiologist, wondered.\n\nThe General Assembly\u2019s budget adopted on June 3 annualized a cut in radiology rates for Medicaid patients by $4.45 million. It did restore a $500,000 cut to radiology rates for ultrasounds for high-risk pregnancies, but other radiology services will be reimbursed at 57.5 percent of the 2007 Medicare fee schedule.\n\nDr. Jean Weigert, director of women\u2019s imaging at Mandell and Blau, said she sees the cut creating an issue with access to care.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do a mammogram for $20,\u201d Weigert said. \u201cYou can\u2019t survive in an office performing $6 chest X-rays.\u201d\n\nShe said she understands everyone had to tighten their belts, but it\u2019s an issue of fairness. She said other specialties didn\u2019t take as big a hit.\n\n\u201cI see this as a problem for access to care,\u201d Weigert said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why the General Assembly would restore obstetrics and gynecology and maintain the cut to radiology. Or even why radiology was on a chopping block in the first place.\n\nHealthcare Advocate Victoria Veltri said she understands they are trying to cut down on the number of people seeing specialists when it\u2019s not necessary, but it is vital to make sure the rates are adequate to guarantee patients who need those services receive them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make sense of this cut,\u201d Veltri said Monday.\n\nShe said it seemed to be done with little regard for the impact it would have on the health of this population, which has grown under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nShe said instead of continuing to reduce reimbursement rates for services, the state needs to look maybe at increasing licensing fees.\n\n\u201cMedicaid and the providers of Medicaid have absorbed their fair share of cuts,\u201d Veltri said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to create access issues or we run the risk of undoing the good work that has been done to encourage people to use primary care. We will run the risk of higher-cost care when people cannot access providers.\u201d\n\nEllen Andrews, executive director of the Connecticut Health Policy Project, said \u201cIt\u2019s a very risky population and cutting things indiscriminately means you\u2019re going to see the cost go up somewhere else.\u201d\n\nSince these are mostly preventative services, the cost for certain types of cancers may increase because they\u2019re not detected in the early stages.\n\nRusso said they will be asking lawmakers to take another look at the Medicaid rates when they convene for a special session later this month. He said there\u2019s still time for them to correct this.\n\nIf they don\u2019t, Russo predicted that community radiology centers will go under or try and get bought up by one of the large hospital networks in the state.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re dropping out or getting bought up,\u201d Russo said.\n\nHe said it makes no sense to spend all this time talking about improving the system of healthcare delivery if no one will be able to access it.\n\nRep. Peggy Sayers, D-Windsor Locks, said there\u2019s been discussion about fixing it in a budget implementer, but there\u2019s been no promises made. She said nothing will be finalized until after the House Democratic caucus on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "CT News Junkie", "og": {"url": "http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/reduction_in_radiology_rates_will_limit_access_for_medicaid_patients/", "site_name": "CT News Junkie", "type": "article", "description": "Patients on the state\u2019s Medicaid program may have to wait a little longer for a chest x-ray or a mammogram, if the General Assembly doesn\u2019t restore cuts to radiology services.", "title": "Reduction In Radiology Rates Will Limit Access for Medicaid Patients | CT News Junkie"}, "robots": "index,follow,archive", "fb": {"admins": 100000516708778, "app_id": 625264840857145}, "google-site-verification": "xSWCEDPXS2srINlbzkJoWA5QowbCkai3awnZqgts9xc", "viewport": "width=1474"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42b0\"", "article_summary": "The General Assembly\u2019s budget adopted on June 3 annualized a cut in radiology rates for Medicaid patients by $4.45 million.\nEarlier this year, as part of a budget rescission, the state cut rates for radiology services and obstetrics and gynecology.\nIt did restore a $500,000 cut to radiology rates for ultrasounds for high-risk pregnancies, but other radiology services will be reimbursed at 57.5 percent of the 2007 Medicare fee schedule.\nThat essentially creates an access issue for those who need these preventative services, Russo said.\nRusso said they will be asking lawmakers to take another look at the Medicaid rates when they convene for a special session later this month."}
