Starting in 2012, McGraw has given 108 homes to veterans and their families from 30 different states.\n\n\u201cThe return to civilian life can be a challenging transition. We want to welcome veterans home to the community they sacrificed to protect. A mortgage-free home provides stability for their families and also allows them to start this new chapter of their life with one less worry,\u201d McGraw said in a press release as he prepared for the tour in Nashville.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling to see them receive something they so deeply deserve\u2014and to be able to share that experience with thousands of fans each night makes me proud to be a part of this program,\u201d he added.\n\nChase and Operation Homefront, along with several other non-profit organizations, have given over 800 mortgage-free homes to military families.\n\nBoth actively exercise military-friendly policies. Since 2011, Chase has hired more than 8,800 veterans. Likewise, Operation Homefront oversees 2,500 volunteers across the U.S. to offer assistance to the families of service members and wounded warriors.\n\n\u201cEveryone who is part of this program is working toward one goal\u2014ensuring a bright and successful future for veterans and their families,\u201d Ross Brown, director of Military and Veterans Affairs at Chase, said in a press release.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tim McGraw is grateful for veterans' service.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Tim McGraw is grateful for veterans' service.", "title": "Star Works to Provide Veterans Mortgage-Free Housing", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/TimMcGraw2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-01T18:10:11+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1FSj0lb"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Tim McGraw is grateful for veterans' service.", "title": "Star Works to Provide Veterans Mortgage-Free Housing", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/TimMcGraw2.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "veterans", "published_time": "2015-07-01T17:15:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-01T18:10:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Tim McGraw, Veterans, Mortgage-Free Housing, Operation HomeFront, Chase Bank"}, "article_summary": "Country singer Tim McGraw is giving mortgage-free homes to veterans.\nChase and Operation Homefront, along with several other non-profit organizations, have given over 800 mortgage-free homes to military families.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time McGraw has awarded veterans with mortgage-free homes.\nLikewise, Operation Homefront oversees 2,500 volunteers across the U.S. to offer assistance to the families of service members and wounded warriors.\nThe star, who is working in partnership with Operation Homefront and Chase Bank, has awarded six homes to veterans and their families so far during his Shotgun Rider 2015 Tour."}
