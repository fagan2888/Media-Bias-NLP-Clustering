Before you stash away your calculator and crack open your celebratory beverage, though, take a moment and consider whether you uncovered a credit or deduction you could have used before \u2014 or if you caught some error this year than went unnoticed in the past. If so, it may be worth redoing your older returns.\n\nThe IRS allows you to amend previous tax returns for a number of reasons: to correct your filing status or any errors claiming dependents; to change the amount of income you originally reported; or to add or get rid of any deduction or credit.\n\n\u201cSome people are in a big hurry to get their taxes done and get ahead of themselves,\u201d Robert Steen, director for retirement financial planning at USAA, noting that some taxpayers may not have all their forms, like 1099s reporting capital gains, when they first file their taxes. In that case, you might owe taxes on previously unreported income.\n\nBut there are other, more beneficial reasons to revisit your old returns. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t in a situation to have a normal tax return environment, say you got rushed, there was a death in the family, or you were pregnant,\u201d Steen says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s worth going back and looking at old returns.\u201d\n\nRelated: 6 Good Reasons to File a Tax Extension\n\nFilers may still be able to reduce their taxable income or lower their tax bracket for past years by making changes to older returns. For example, you might reverse a Roth IRA conversion or carry back a net operating loss for a business from this year to the previous year, says Steen. (You can also carry it forward.)\n\nSame-sex married couples who have been married since 2012 can refile old federal taxes to change their status to married filing jointly or married filing separately if they haven\u2019t done so already. The IRS only began recognizing gay unions after a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2013 and said these couples could amend earlier returns.\n\nGenerally, you have three years from the original filing date or two years from the date you paid the tax (whichever is later) to refile and get a refund. But don\u2019t rush to amend a tax return over a mathematical error. Typically, the IRS will catch these mistakes and notify you of any changes it makes to your tax return.\n\nRelated: Now You Can Pay Your Taxes While Buying a Slurpee\n\nTo amend older returns, complete the two-page Form 1040X. You can\u2019t do this electronically. On the form, you must correct the amounts that differ from what you originally reported on your tax return. The form also includes a section for you to explain your amendment. Attach any corrected schedules to the Form 1040X as well.\n\nRemember you\u2019re still liable for the interest and penalties on any additional taxes you didn\u2019t pay because of the incorrect return. However, the IRS may waive any interest and penalties if you have a good reason for underreporting your tax.\n\nTo check the status of your amended return, use the IRS tool \u201cWhere\u2019s My Amended Return?\u201d online.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Congratulations, you\u2019re done with your 2015 tax returns and it\u2019s time to have a beer.", "title": "When and How to Refile Your Old Taxes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/11/When-and-How-Refile-Your-Old-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04122012_Preparing_Taxes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/11/When-and-How-Refile-Your-Old-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04122012_Preparing_Taxes_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Congratulations, you\u2019re done with your 2015 tax returns and it\u2019s time to have a beer.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Same-sex married couples who have been married since 2012 can refile old federal taxes to change their status to married filing jointly or married filing separately if they haven\u2019t done so already.\nCongratulations, you\u2019re done with your 2015 tax returns and it\u2019s time to have a beer.\nRelated: Now You Can Pay Your Taxes While Buying a SlurpeeTo amend older returns, complete the two-page Form 1040X.\nRemember you\u2019re still liable for the interest and penalties on any additional taxes you didn\u2019t pay because of the incorrect return.\nTypically, the IRS will catch these mistakes and notify you of any changes it makes to your tax return."}
