The move is a setback for the Walker administration, which has made Medicaid expansion a top priority. But as APRN\u2019s Alexandra Gutierrez reports, the fight may not be over yet.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nThe House Finance committee room was so crowded and stuffy that the ceiling fans were actually needed. Walker administration officials, lobbyists, staffers, and reporters all packed in to see what the Health and Social Services subcommittee would do with Medicaid expansion.\n\nRep. Dan Saddler, an Anchorage Republican, didn\u2019t mince words.\n\n\u201cWe denied all requests related to Medicaid expansion,\u201d Saddler today the room.\n\nThe subcommittee proposal slashed nearly $150 million in federal money that would have gone toward expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program. Right now, Alaska\u2019s Medicaid primarily covers low-income families, pregnant women, and persons with disabilities. Expansion would cover people who make up to 138 percent of the poverty level \u2014 or about $20,000 for a single adult. In its first years, the federal government would pay for the expansion in full, and then ratchet that amount down to 90 percent.\n\nWhen it came to a vote, the subcommittee broke on caucus lines, with eight members of the Republican majority backing the removal.\n\nRep. Les Gara, of Anchorage, was one of three Democrats who tried to keep the money in.\n\n\u201cWhen the federal government offers 90 percent funding of roads, we grab that money without even thinking about it,\u201d said Gara. \u201cHere they\u2019re offering 100 percent funding that tapers down to 90 percent funding, and we\u2019re saying, \u2018Gosh, I don\u2019t know about the 4,000 jobs that will bring to the state. I disagree with that. I think we should accept it, and we have the information, and we\u2019ve been given the information.\u201d\n\nIn response, some members of the finance subcommittee expressed concern that accepting the federal money could put the state on the hook for Medicaid costs in the future. But most of the reasons given for removing the Medicaid money had less to do with the proposal than the process itself.\n\nRep. Mark Neuman, a Big Lake Republican who oversees the drafting of the operating budget, says Medicaid is too big of an issue to deal with as a simple line item.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about a $145 million question that we\u2019ve been trying to get answers on,\u201d said Neuman. \u201cThe co-chair and I spoke to the governor and asked him to introduce some legislation so we could put that in front of the public.\u201d\n\nHe and his fellow House Finance co-chair, Steve Thompson of Fairbanks, asked for a standalone Medicaid bill in a meeting in mid-February, and again through a formal letter sent on Thursday.\n\nSome Democrats on the subcommittee pushed back against that request. Rep. Scott Kawasaki of Fairbanks noted that members of his caucus have unsuccessfully tried to advance a standalone Medicaid bill since 2012.\n\n\u201cWe have gotten a cold shoulder,\u201d said Kawasaki. \u201cSo when people say we want to see a bill, it bothers me that we have a bill that has been blocked in a committee for the past three years.\u201d\n\nThe bill the Republican majority would like to see would reform the Medicaid delivery system to lower costs, in addition to expanding the program. Juneau Republican Cathy Mu\u00f1oz noted there was precedent for a case like this during the Parnell administration, where a policy that could have been implemented through the budget got its own standalone bill.\n\n\u201cLast session, we were in a very similar situation with the retirement issues,\u201d said Mu\u00f1oz, referring to an action that shifted $3 billion from the state\u2019s reserves to its pension obligation account. \u201cThere was legislation that had been filed by an individual member to deal with the retirement issues, but we all felt that it was important for the governor to lead on the issue. This is a very similar situation.\u201d\n\nThere are some procedural reasons that Medicaid expansion could get more traction as a bill than as a budget item. According to the majority caucus rules, all members are required to vote in favor of the budget, requiring some level of consensus on the issue. A bill would allow hard-line conservatives who oppose the Affordable Care Act wholesale to come out against expansion, while more moderate members of the caucus could support it.\n\nFor his part, Gov. Bill Walker is not planning to file a Medicaid expansion bill.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for us to file our own. There\u2019s already legislation there,\u201d Walker said at a press conference held in the Governor\u2019s Mansion.\n\nWalker did leave an opening to move forward on Medicaid, however. He said he is willing to work with the House Finance co-chairs on their questions about expansion and reform.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll sit down with them, and certainly we\u2019ll meet with them to try to find out why they can\u2019t use the bill that\u2019s currently there,\u201d said Walker.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what happens if compromise is not possible. The governor does have the authority to veto the budget if it does not include expansion and to call the Legislature into special session to deal with Medicaid, but Walker said it was too early to say if he would exercise those powers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "A House subcommittee has stripped Medicaid expansion language from the state\u2019s operating budget.
