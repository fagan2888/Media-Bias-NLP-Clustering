These include offshore lenders and those owned by Indian tribes, which say they aren\u2019t subject to state law due to their sovereign status.\n\nBut Florida-based LoanReverse and its founder, Alex Shogren, say online lenders that fail to comply with state law are making illegal loans that consumers need not repay. Mr. Shogren says banks that deduct money from consumers\u2019 accounts on behalf of many online lenders have the responsibility to refund payments under a Federal Reserve regulation governing unauthorized money transfers.\n\nOnline loans that don\u2019t comply with state laws are by definition unauthorized, even if the customer initially allowed a deduction from his or her account, Mr. Shogren says.\n\nLoanReverse helps borrowers issue strongly worded demands to banks for such refunds and takes 35% of any proceeds as a fee. Customers \u201cdon\u2019t know that the loans that they\u2019ve entered into are illegal,\u201d says Mr. Shogren.\n\nMessages crafted by LoanReverse also suggest litigation may be in the works. In one email drafted by LoanReverse and sent to a lender, a borrower threatened to \u201cpursue other ways and means of collecting money you may have illegally taken from me in the past.\u201d\n\nMr. Shogren, who once ran an online lending operation based in the British Virgin Islands, says his company has helped several thousand people obtain refunds through their banks, with an average refund of $800 to $1,000 a loan.\n\nMr. Shogren isn\u2019t alone in his view about the legal status of many online loans. Last year, New York\u2019s top banking regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, ordered 35 online lenders to stop doing business in his state, and federal officials have challenged the loans\u2019 legality in court cases. Earlier this month, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. indicted the leaders of a Tennessee-based lender on criminal charges of violating New York state\u2019s interest-rate caps.\n\nOnline lenders say their loans are perfectly legal. They dispute the legitimacy of LoanReverse, contending it is misleading consumers by making false promises that their debts will be relieved. \u201cWe are very concerned that this company is violating federal law by misrepresenting its services to consumers and failing to disclose their true cost,\u201d said Lisa McGreevy, chief executive of the Online Lenders Alliance, a trade group.\n\nThe CastlePayDay.com website\n\nThis month, a lawyer for the Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, which operates a website called CastlePayday.com, sent Mr. Shogren a letter threatening litigation against LoanReverse.\n\n\u201cCounseling consumers to file claims with their banks that such [transactions] were not authorized when the lender obtained proper written authorization is deceptive and harmful to consumers,\u201d the tribe wrote.\n\nSome banking-industry lawyers disagree with Mr. Shogren\u2019s argument. While banks have a duty to investigate whether transactions are authorized, they are \u201cnot required to determine whether the transfer was to repay a loan that may be illegal under state law,\u201d said Leonard Chanin, a former Federal Reserve and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau official now with law firm Morrison & Foerster, which does work for online lenders.\n\nConsumer advocates, however, see some promise in LoanReverse\u2019s approach.\n\nNathalie Martin, a consumer-law professor at the University of New Mexico, said the strategy employed by LoanReverse \u201ccould be promising to consumers if banks indeed respond.\u201d Consumers, she said, \u201cdo not need to repay loans made by online lenders that are not licensed in their state. Those are illegal loans.\u201d\n\nAndrew Fain, a television producer in Los Angeles, took out several loans from online lenders after he and his wife lost their jobs. By using LoanReverse to dispute loans made by several online lenders, Mr. Fain says he was able to get $1,400 in credits to his bank account for payments made to three online lenders and he is pursuing several more. For that, he paid LoanReverse $388.\n\nMr. Fain is still receiving collection calls but says he is optimistic that the debt will ultimately be gone. \u201cIf they\u2019re illegal, they\u2019re illegal, and I shouldn\u2019t have to pay,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "LoanReverse.com helps consumers request refunds of loans that don\u2019t comply with the laws of several states, while some online lenders say they are exempt from those rules.", "title": "Do Borrowers Really Need To Repay Online Loans?
