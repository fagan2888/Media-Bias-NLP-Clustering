Worse, just 18 percent of respondents think their healthcare options will get better in 2014 when Obamacare kicks in.\n\n\u201cWe found that Millennials are unlikely to buy something, invest in something, to vote for something from people and from things they don\u2019t necessarily trust and that\u2019s a serious concern today,\u201d Harvard Institute of Politics Polling Director John Della Volpe told reporters Wednesday morning.\n\nThe success of Generation Opportunity\u2019s Opt-Out program, which boasts more than 14,000 promises from Millenials to \u2018opt-out\u2019 of Obamacare, in addition to the slow rate of youth enrollment in Obamacare put President Obama on the attack Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAt the administration\u2019s first-ever White House Youth Summit, President Obama criticized Generation Opportunity\u2019s campaign to undercut his signature law.\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, there are actually organizations that are out there working to convince young people not to get insurance,\u201d President Obama told attendees. \u201cNow think about that. That\u2019s a really bizarre way to spend your money, to try to convince people not to get health insurance, not to get free preventive care, not to make sure that they\u2019re able to survive an accident or an illness.\u201d\n\nIn response, Generation Opportunity President Evan Feinburg invited Obama to attend one of its events.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to have that conversation so we can ask him why he wants Millennials to pay three times more for healthcare when there are better options available outside his expensive and creepy Obamacare exchanges,\u201d Feinberg told Red Alert Politics.\n\nWatch Generation Opportunity\u2019s new video below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "In a new Creepy Uncle Sam ad, Generation Opportunity proudly points out that their successful campaign to get young Americans to \"Opt-Out\" of Obamacare is proof that young people haven't lost their \"f**king minds.\"", "title": "New Creepy Uncle Sam video says young Americans are opting-out of...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/10/Creepy-Uncle-Sam-600x326.jpg", "height": 326}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/12/05/new-creepy-uncle-sam-video-says-young-americans-are-opting-out-of-obamcare-because-they-havent-lost-their-fking-minds/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "young-people-not-buying-obamacare", "published_time": "2013-12-05T12:49:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-05T13:13:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "New Creepy Uncle Sam video says young Americans are opting-out of Obamcare because they haven\u2019t lost their \u201cf**king minds\u201dEveryone\u2019s favorite big government mascot is back.\nBecause we haven\u2019t lost our f**king minds.\u201dMeanwhile, Creepy Uncle Sam can be seen hacking up Sam from the board game \u201cOperation\u201d in the background.\nAt the administration\u2019s first-ever White House Youth Summit, President Obama criticized Generation Opportunity\u2019s campaign to undercut his signature law.\n\u201cBelieve it or not, there are actually organizations that are out there working to convince young people not to get insurance,\u201d President Obama told attendees.\nWorse, just 18 percent of respondents think their healthcare options will get better in 2014 when Obamacare kicks in."}
