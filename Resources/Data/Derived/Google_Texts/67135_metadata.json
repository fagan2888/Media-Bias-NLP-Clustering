Our cities have a good feeling about it,\" said the bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Paul Muxlow of Brown City.\n\nThe agreement caps more than 2\u00bd years of work to update a 2008 anti-scrap metal theft law that detractors said wasn't working.\n\nScrapyards will have to take photos or video of metal they buy and the seller under the legislation. Sellers could only be paid by check or money order, or they could redeem their money at an onsite ATM. Knowingly selling or buying street light poles, guardrails, traffic signs, cemetery plaques and railroad equipment generally will be off limits, too.\n\nThe sticking point had been a proposal to make people wait for payment for copper wire, air conditioners and catalytic converters.\n\nThe House in October approved a three-day waiting period. The Senate, though, voted to make delayed payment unnecessary if the scrap/recycling industry instead created a real-time database of each purchase of the pertinent items.\n\nUnder the compromise, scrapyards will only be able to buy copper wire, air conditioning components and catalytic converters by mailing a check, money order or ATM-like card to sellers unless payment is less than $25. The database could still be established, but it won't be required.\n\nIn Michigan, especially Detroit, thieves are targeting abandoned dwellings, construction sites, railroads and utilities to strip copper wiring, air conditioners and other metal.\n\nThe state had the ninth-highest number of insurance claims for metal theft in the U.S. in recent years, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Metropolitan Detroit ranked fifth-worst among urban areas.\n\nDespite existing requirements that dealers maintain records and sellers show a driver's license, law enforcement officials have said successfully prosecuting cases is difficult.\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, a Detroit Democrat, voted for the bill while saying she has concerns because it allows payment on the spot \u2014 with the ATM cards \u2014 for the most-stolen items as long as it is for less than $25. She said thieves could stay below the threshold by visiting multiple scrapyards a day and later told reporters that groups representing police chiefs and sheriffs oppose the legislation as a result.\n\n\"I encourage my colleagues to support this bill today, but in a year \u2014 if it doesn't work \u2014 to continue to revisit this and do it right,\" Tlaib said.\n\nThe state police will have to report on the law's effectiveness to the governor and legislative leaders by July 2016.\n\nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan said the House vote was \"great news\" for his city and other communities struggling with illegal scrappers.\n\n\"Not only does it create an important paper trail for law enforcement, it removes many of the incentives, such as immediate cash payment, that have made it all too easy for scrappers to profit from the dismantling of our city,\" he said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legislation cracking down on illegal scrap metal sales is headed to Gov.
