At this point, the campaign is largely just performance art for the press and the donor class. This is the silly season, where partisans can dream and pundits can speculate wildly.\n\nMaybe this is the year, they theorize, that an independent billionaire enters the race and edges out the major-party nominees (even though nothing like it has ever happened, Ross Perot included), or that California goes Republican or Texas Democratic (even though there\u2019s no evidence either state will change its partisan hue in 2016). These fallacies will be exposed once the contest shifts into high gear next year and the factual grounding for this pontificating dwindles from meager to nonexistent.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s the less outrageous assertions we\u2019ve been hearing in Act I of the campaign, those that have congealed into conventional wisdom, that are in greater need of a debunking. Below we separate a few such myths from the underlying realities.\n\nMyth #1: The giant Republican field is unpredictable, almost anybody\u2019s game.\n\nWith 10 Republican presidential hats in the ring, and perhaps another 10 to come, we all know the GOP is going to have the largest field in living memory. Increasingly, surveys are showing 10 or more candidates bunched in the single or low double-digits. The most recent Quinnipiac poll headlined a finding that has no modern precedent: five contenders tied at 10 percent each.\n\nBut the closeness of the race is a mirage, a false projection of the reality that exists just below the surface. At this very early stage, when every week more candidates declare, the public is mainly not engaged\u2014not even the select contingent of voters that will turn up to cast ballots in the caucuses and primaries.\n\nRepublicans are hungry to reoccupy the White House, and the realistic among them understand the party won\u2019t win without pitching a bigger tent. There may be no single GOP frontrunner, but there are just a few politicians who have the resources, positioning and potential to expand the base. They are former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, not necessarily in that order.\n\nEveryone can see that Jeb Bush is doing poorly so far. He\u2019s in a much worse position than his father was in 1987 or his brother was in 1999. This Bush intimidates no one. His political skills are rusty, he\u2019s a pedestrian speaker and some of his views (immigration reform, Common Core, etc.) have made him many enemies among party ideologues.\n\nYet Bush is still undeniably among the frontrunners. The GOP\u2019s donor class is disproportionately for him, as his Super PAC fundraising total will soon reveal. The party\u2019s organizational leaders who care only about winning argue for him. The largest share of top elected Republicans back him openly or covertly. Four Republican senators are running, but private talks with GOP senators lead us to believe more Republican senators are rooting for Bush than for the quartet of their Senate colleagues combined.\n\nThen there\u2019s the experience factor. Jeb may not have been on a ballot himself since 2002, but he has been at the heart of six prior national campaigns, his father\u2019s four (1980, 1984, 1988 and 1992) and his brother\u2019s recent two. No other Republican candidate can boast more than one such trial by fire.\n\nAt the same time, Bush isn\u2019t a shoo-in for the nomination. Compared to earlier decades, today\u2019s GOP is considerably less hierarchical and deferential to the leadership. Political money can\u2019t be hoarded by the best-known name, nor by the candidates closest to the formal party leadership. Gobs of campaign cash are just a rich person away; so far there\u2019s seemingly a billionaire backing just about every major candidate. Finally, Jeb Bush is the early favorite in none of the gateway states, that is, the first four to vote (Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada).\n\nOn top of that, Bush has formidable company in the frontrunner\u2019s circle. One of the first big surprises of this cycle has been Marco Rubio\u2019s success. Few thought there would be a second Floridian in the race, or that Rubio could challenge Bush as an equal in the Sunshine State and elsewhere. There are many reasons for Rubio\u2019s rise, including his potential ability to shrink the Democratic advantage among Hispanics and the generational contrast he can offer against Hillary Clinton. It is true that Rubio\u2019s single term as U.S. senator presents a skimpy resume, but that didn\u2019t stop Barack Obama.\n\nWhile less charismatic than Rubio, Scott Walker undeniably makes the frontrunner list as well. He has strong domestic chops, plus the potential to create a Midwestern path to victory for both the nomination and the general election. Wisconsin is in Iowa\u2019s Midwest neighborhood, and that\u2019s part of why Walker is ahead in Iowa, but he also seems to be in the party\u2019s sweet spot on a host of economic and social issues. Foreign policy is a major weakness, yet he\u2019s drilling almost daily with his in-house experts to bone up. And Walker has already gone from an uninspiring orator to a competent and sometimes imposing stump speaker. There\u2019s still much work to do: Walker doesn\u2019t usually strike neutral observers as having the stature and bearing of a president (his lack of a college degree doesn\u2019t help in that regard). But he should not be underestimated.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a dark-horse entrant into the first tier, it might be John Kasich. Few would bet on him today, but no sensible party will easily dismiss a popular two-term governor of swing-state Ohio. And Kasich\u2019s federal, state and private sector experiences comprise impressive preparation for the presidency. The primary obstacle for Kasich are his positions on Obamacare and Common Core, which have earned him the RINO label. He also has to generate interest in a hurry so he can get into the upcoming debates, for which he currently does not qualify. And Kasich must make a convincing case that he\u2019s not just another Jon Huntsman, who won more plaudits from the media than votes from Republicans in 2012.\n\nKyle Kondik is managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan political newsletter produced by the University of Virginia Center for Politics.
