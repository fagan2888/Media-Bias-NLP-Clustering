The Leapfrog Group is drawing attention to the hospitals that do a really good job of preventing these errors -- along with the ones that need to improve. As Lottie Watts with Health News Florida reports, almost half of Florida's hospitals earned an \"A\" for safety from the group.\n\nThe latest Hospital Safety Scores released by the not-for-profit watchdog Leapfrog Group show almost half of general, acute-care hospitals in Florida earned an A.\n\nThe group calculates the grades twice a year on using data on errors, injuries, accidents and infections, and posts the results in a searchable database.\n\nOut of the 165 Florida hospitals they graded, 77 got an A.\n\n\"We think that patient safety is one of the first factors patients should consider when choose a hospital,\u201d said Erica Mobley, communications director for the Leapfrog Group. \"But we recognize that even with that, some patients may not have the choice of an A or B hospital in their community or one that's within their insurance plan or covered network.\"\n\nSeveral hospitals got Cs and Ds, but once again, no Florida hospitals failed.\n\nSeven Florida hospitals earned a \"D\" grade for spring 2015:\n\n\u00b7 Citrus Memorial Hospital, Inverness\n\n\u00b7 Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center, Davenport\n\n\u00b7 Highlands Regional Medical Center, Sebring\n\n\u00b7 Jackson Hospital, Marianna\n\n\u00b7 Putnam Community Medical Center, Palatka\n\n\u00b7 Sacred Heart Hospital, Pensacola\n\n\u00b7 University of Miami Hospital\n\nMedical experts say hospital errors kill about 400,000 people across the country each year. Over the past three years, the Leapfrog Group has issued grades, which are determined largely by Medicare data.\n\n\"Patient safety is something that really covers all areas of hospital care and is the first thing people should be thinking about.,\u201d Mobley said. \u201cAm I going to go to a hospital that will protect me from harm? Or am I going to go to a hospital where something bad might happen to me?\"\n\nWhile Mobley noted the most important grade for patients to consider is the most recent grade, looking at previous grades can show how a hospital is getting better or worse over time. The group has graded hospitals since spring 2012.\n\nThere are 16 Florida hospitals that have earned an \"A\" each time Leapfrog graded them:\n\n\u00b7 Baptist Health South Florida Baptist Hospital of Miami\n\n\u00b7 Baptist Health South Florida Doctors Hospital in Coral Gables\n\n\u00b7 Baptist Health South Florida Homestead Hospital\n\n\u00b7 Fawcett Memorial Hospital in Port Charlotte\n\n\u00b7 Florida Hospital Memorial Medical Center in Daytona Beach\n\n\u00b7 Gulf Breeze Hospital\n\n\u00b7 Lake City Medical Center\n\n\u00b7 Mayo Clinic Hospital Jacksonville\n\n\u00b7 Memorial Hospital Miramar\n\n\u00b7 Memorial Regional Hospital, Hollywood\n\n\u00b7 Memorial Regional Hospital, South Hollywood\n\n\u00b7 Parrish Medical Center, Titusville\n\n\u00b7 Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point, Hudson\n\n\u00b7 St. Lucie Medical Center\n\n\u00b7 West Boca Medical Center\n\n\u00b7 West Marion Community Hospital, Ocala\n\nEven though a hospital may have an \"A\" grade for safety, one of the things all patients should be asking staff is if they have washed their hands, the Leapfrog Group said.\n\nLottie Watts is a reporter for WUSF in Tampa.
