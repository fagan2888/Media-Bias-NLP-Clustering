The cemetery, on 10.5 acres at Ninth and Pleasant streets, originally was established a half mile from the city \u2014 and now would be considered near the city center.\n\nDuring the Victorian era, cemeteries were the first manicured \"green spaces\" available to the public, with families often picnicking on blankets at the grave sites of their deceased loved ones on Sundays, Reilly-McNellan said.\n\nReilly-McNellan, who also helps organize the popular biannual \"Meet the Spirits\" event at the cemetery around Halloween, talked about the cemetery's history as she led one of the tours.\n\n\"Cemeteries are marvelous teaching tools,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe pointed out fraternal order tombstones, including those of members of the Mason and Woodmen of the World members.\n\nThen there are the cemetery's refurbished cast-zinc \u2014 a.k.a. \"white bronze\" \u2014 grave markers that were manufactured by the Monumental Bronze Co. in Bridgeport, Conn., between 1874 and 1912.\n\nMarble also was popular for tombstones at the time, especially for children, she said. Rosebuds, lambs and other symbols of nature were often used on tombstones for children, representing innocence.

Among those dressed in Victorian garb were members of the Victorian Society of Colorado.\n\n\"It's our opportunity to dress up and show off our vintage outfits,\" said society member Janet Tucker, who lives in Aurora. \"And we love history.\"\n\nBoulder's Sally Powell-Ashby said she and her husband switched Mother's Day and Father's Day so he could go cross country skiing when it snowed on Mother's Day. She picked the cemetery picnic, she said, because she likes the celebration of life and death.\n\nPlus, she said, \"It's gorgeous now.\"\n\nBoulder's Michael Stack brought his wife and 3-year-old daughter, Odessa, for a picnic.\n\n\"We came to learn a little bit about Boulder's history, and we have a tradition of picnicking on Father's Day,\" he said.\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28357153/boulders-columbia-cemetery-hosts-inaugural-midsummers-eve-supper", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28357153:view"}, "startDate": "2015-06-21T22:14:10-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Boulder recreated the Victorian tradition of picnics among the gravestones with a Sunday supper fundraiser at the city's historic Columbia Cemetery.", "title": "Boulder's Columbia Cemetery hosts inaugural 'Midsummer's Eve Supper'", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28357153/boulders-columbia-cemetery-hosts-inaugural-midsummers-eve-supper", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0621/20150621__22DCACEMw~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "modificationDate": "2015-06-23T11:26:12-0600", "endDate": "2025-06-21T22:10:51-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "pubDate": "2015-06-21T22:18:19-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-21T22:14:10-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder's Columbia Cemetery hosts inaugural 'Midsummer's Eve Supper'", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0621/20150621__22DCACEMw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Boulder recreated the Victorian tradition of picnics among the gravestones with a Sunday supper fundraiser at the city's historic Columbia Cemetery.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28357153/boulders-columbia-cemetery-hosts-inaugural-midsummers-eve-supper", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Boulder recreated the Victorian tradition of picnics among the gravestones with a Sunday supper fundraiser at the city's historic Columbia Cemetery.", "title": "Boulder's Columbia Cemetery hosts inaugural 'Midsummer's Eve Supper'"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0621/20150621__22DCACEMw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd262c\"", "article_summary": "\"The cemetery is at the height of its beauty in June,\" said Mary Reilly-McNellan, Columbia Cemetery preservation manager.\nBoulder's Parks and Recreation Department and Historic Boulder, Inc., hosted a \"Midsummer's Eve Supper in the Cemetery: A Victorian Celebration of Life and Death,\" Sunday at Columbia Cemetery.\nBoulder recreated the Victorian tradition of picnics among the gravestones with a Sunday supper fundraiser at the city's historic Columbia Cemetery.\nMary Reilly-McNellan, center, gives a tour of Columbia Cemetery during the supper.\nThe event, sponsored by Boulder's Parks and Recreation Department and Historic Boulder, raised money cemetery preservation efforts."}
