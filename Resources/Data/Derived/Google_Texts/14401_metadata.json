Although his sprained left ankle forced him to miss the last 10 days of the season, it did not appear to be a high-grade sprain.\n\nYet several weeks after the injury, his ankle was still swollen.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was that bad, either, until seven weeks after it happened and I still couldn\u2019t run,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018I need to get this checked out.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNeither an X-ray nor an MRI showed any structural damage in the ankle, and Lawson was told to continue to rest it for the rest of June. Lawson expects to begin his full offseason conditioning in July, with a regimen that will include UFC-style workouts in California with Toronto Raptors DeMar DeRozan and Terrence Ross.\n\nLawson said he\u2019s taking charge of his conditioning this season in a way he had not done in previous years.\n\n\u201cNormally, I\u2019m not going to say I take it easy, but this summer I\u2019m going to go hard at it and see what happens this next season,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be in the gym 24/7 this summer. I want to come into training camp in better condition, better shape.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ty Lawson out until July with lingering ankle injury", "title": "Ty Lawson out until July with lingering ankle injury", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/02/ty-lawson-out-until-july-with-lingering-ankle-injury/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140602__nuggets-lawsonp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140602__nuggets-lawsonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-02T12:41:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:28:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd88fa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI still can\u2019t run,\u201d Lawson said by phone from Valencia, Spain, for NBA 3X, a 3-on-3 tournament sponsored by the league.\nThe left ankle injury that cost Nuggets guard Ty Lawson the last six games of the 2013-14 season has turned out to be worse than originally thought.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was that bad, either, until seven weeks after it happened and I still couldn\u2019t run,\u201d Lawson said.\n\u201cNormally, I\u2019m not going to say I take it easy, but this summer I\u2019m going to go hard at it and see what happens this next season,\u201d Lawson said.\nAlthough his sprained left ankle forced him to miss the last 10 days of the season, it did not appear to be a high-grade sprain."}
