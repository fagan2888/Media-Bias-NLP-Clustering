(Courtesy)\n\nModerately priced housing urged for NH\n\n\n\nThe Cotton Mill in Nashua began accepting tenants last summer, the Woodbury Mill in Dover was completed last spring, and the Townhomes at Whittemore Place in Londonderry just had a grand opening last month.\n\n..\n\nThe affordable housing they offer is desperately needed in New Hampshire, where high rents are crimping what would otherwise be more robust growth in the state's economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur members in the business community are telling us this lack of affordable and available housing is beginning to impact their ability to hire and retain employees,\u201d said David Juvet, senior vice president of the Business and Industry Association, New Hampshire's statewide chamber of commerce. \u201cIt has emerged as one of the number one employer issues in the state.\u201d\n\n..\n\nJuvet was kicking off the 2015 Housing Forum, hosted by the BIA in partnership with the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority, Housing Action New Hampshire and the Workforce Housing Coalition of the Greater Seacoast.\n\n..\n\nThe consensus of the panel gathered Friday at the Radisson in Manchester was that some progress is being made, but much more needs to be done to foster public-private partnerships, boost the state's Affordable Housing Trust Fund, ease restrictive zoning regulations and counter neighborhood opposition to mixed-use housing projects.\n\n..\n\n\u201cI think we're seeing some positive trends, both in terms of recognizing that this is a business need, and a community need, and that the developments that are being created are quality additions the community,\u201d said Elissa Margolin, director of Housing Action NH. \u201cThey are ascetically pleasing and they enhance our communities and our state as whole.\u201d\n\n..\n\nBut it's not nearly enough in a state where the average renter earns $13.91 an hour and the median 2-bedroom rent is affordable only at $20.50 an hour or higher, according to Housing Action. Despite the state's high level of home ownership, renters still make up 30 percent of the households.\n\n..\n\nMore importantly, the young professionals the state desperately needs to keep its economy humming are primarily renters, who will simply choose to take their talents elsewhere.\n\n\n\nDirect cost to business\n\n\n\nIn the Lebanon-Hanover area, the problem has become so severe that most renters have to commute 25 to 30 miles each way from apartments in Claremont or Newport, and in some cases still pay more than the recommended 30 percent of earnings on rent.\n\n..\n\n\u201cLack of affordable housing creates a big problem for us in recruiting top talent,\u201d said Carolyn Maloney, treasurer of Hypertherm, a manufacturer with 1,400 employees headquartered in Lebanon.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome of our engineering positions have been open for at least two years,\u201d she said. \u201cWe bring candidates up here, they get a taste of the housing costs, and how far they have to drive to find affordable housing, and they decline.\u201d\n\n..\n\nThe problem creates a direct cost to a business like Hyperthem.\n\n\n\n\u201cMost of the quality people we've hired \u2014 engineers, sales, finance \u2014 have to be recruited from the outside with large relocation packages of $50,000 to $100,000,\u201d said Maloney, \u201cmostly due to housing costs.\u201d\n\n..\n\nTough row\n\n\n\nThe state has the buildings and the available land to create more rental housing, but the construction industry, land-use regulations, and opposition from abutters have made it difficult to build anything except a \u201cMcMansion\u201d on a two-acre lot with 200 feet of road frontage.\n\n..\n\n\u201cNashua could create 1,000 units of affordable housing,\u201d said James Vayo, community liaison for the Visualize Nashua project. \u201cBut the industry builds this (pointing to a slide of a McMansion subdivision). \u201cIf you just build this, you really limit the kind of buyers you have.\u201d\n\n..\n\nThe hope for the future, he said, rests with people such as Rebecca Perkins, a young attorney who lives in Portsmouth and helped launch the \u201c603 Initiative,\u201d which is focused on issues critical to young professionals.\n\n..\n\n\u201cIf you want mill apartments in downtown Nashua, show up at meetings that are open to the public and talk about how that would be a positive thing for downtown Nashua,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nThe 603 group is planning a statewide summit this spring in the hope of bringing the issue to the forefront.\n\n..\n\n\u201cYoung people are starting to come back to New Hampshire. They are interested,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if we don't do something to move this issue forward, it's going to be the death of a thousand cuts to the spark of vitality we have here.\u201d\n\n..\n\nSeeking partnerships\n\n\n\nIn recognition of the problem, lawmakers added $800,000 to the New Hampshire Affordable Housing Trust Fund in the recently approved capital budget. The fund was launched under Gov. John H. Sununu in the 1980s, when housing costs first became an issue.\n\n..\n\nThe $800,000 contribution this year brings the fund, administered by the New Hampshire Housing Authority, to around $1.8 million. Maine just contributed $30 million to its moderately priced housing trust fund, which is financed through a portion of the real estate transfer tax.\n\n..\n\n\u201cThe real estate transfer tax is used in most states, but in New Hampshire it's funded through the capital budget process,\u201d said Margolin at Housing Action.\n\n\n\nShe called the recent appropriation \u201ca small amount but symbolically a step in the right direction\u201d and pointed out that every dollar in state money leverages, on average, seven other dollars in private and federal funds. Margolin said the business community is emerging as a powerful ally in the effort.\n\n..\n\n\u201cIf we can get the momentum of the business community understanding that we need affordable housing, to talk to policymakers about the need for the state to step up, we will make great progress,\u201d she said.\n\n..\n\nCliff Sinnott, executive director at Rockingham Planning Commission, says a change of heart is also needed at the grassroots. \u201cWe've understood this problem for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've also understood some of the solutions for a long time, but there's been relatively little progress.\n\n..\n\n\u201cThe opposition that typically comes with workforce housing projects comes when a planning board is reviewing the project and the only people in the audience are nine abutters, 10 of whom are vehemently, vocally, angrily opposed.\u201d\n\n..\n\nHe encouraged people such as Perkins and her associates in the 603 Initiative to press on. \u201cWe have to balance that negativity and the nimbyism with some positivity,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\ndsolomon@unionleader.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Cotton Mill in Nashua began accepting tenants last summer, the Woodbury Mill in Dover was completed last spring, and the Townhomes at Whittemore Place in Londonderry just had a grand opening last month.", "title": "Moderately priced housing urged for NH | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "The Cotton Mill in Nashua began accepting tenants last summer, the Woodbury Mill in Dover was completed last spring, and the Townhomes at Whittemore Place in Londonderry just had a grand opening last month.", "title": "Moderately priced housing urged for NH | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150913/NEWS0606/150919695/0/SPORTS19", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20150913/NEWS0606/150919695/AR/0/AR-150919695.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Local & County Government", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "Real estate, Politics,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-09-13 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "The Cotton Mill in Nashua began accepting tenants last summer, the Woodbury Mill in Dover was completed last spring, and the Townhomes at Whittemore Place in Londonderry just had a grand opening last month.", "title": "Moderately priced housing urged for NH | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150913/NEWS0606/150919695/0/SPORTS19", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20150913/NEWS0606/150919695/AR/0/AR-150919695.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6cbb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt has emerged as one of the number one employer issues in the state.\u201d..Juvet was kicking off the 2015 Housing Forum, hosted by the BIA in partnership with the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority, Housing Action New Hampshire and the Workforce Housing Coalition of the Greater Seacoast.\n\u201cWe bring candidates up here, they get a taste of the housing costs, and how far they have to drive to find affordable housing, and they decline.\u201d..\nMaine just contributed $30 million to its moderately priced housing trust fund, which is financed through a portion of the real estate transfer tax.\nThe $800,000 contribution this year brings the fund, administered by the New Hampshire Housing Authority, to around $1.8 million.\n..\u201cNashua could create 1,000 units of affordable housing,\u201d said James Vayo, community liaison for the Visualize Nashua project."}
