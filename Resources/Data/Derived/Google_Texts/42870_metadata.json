Sure, it was a good friend of van Vuuren\u2019s. But that\u2019s how many crowdfunding projects should start \u2014 with support from friends and family. Twelve hours later, the campaign was at 10 percent of its $50,000 goal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking a risk of launching on Black Friday. We know that. But people are in a buying state of mind,\u201d said van Vuuren, W\u00fcf\u2019s enthusiastic co-founder and chief marketing officer.\n\nShe and cofounder Sean Kelly will be glued to their MacBooks for the next 30 days.\n\nThe GPS-enabled collar can help find a runaway dog, talk to a pet when you\u2019re not near, and monitor nutrition and action with a mobile app. But this isn\u2019t just any Kickstarter. W\u00fcf has hordes of connections (van Vuuren founded Women who Startup and StartupDenver), expertise (graduated from Boulder\u2019s Boomtown Accelerator last spring) and even some funding of about $50,000. But can that sort of pedigree guarantee a crowdfunding success?\n\nOn Black Friday, the two met at the collaboration space Galvanize in Denver, where van Vuuren rents office space. Kelly works out of the Boulder Galvanize.\n\nIt was a quiet day at Galvanize. The bar and cafe were closed. No one was milling around or sitting in a lounge chair punching their laptops. Occasionally, a few passersby peered through the glass front door, some came inside. Two guys who work in the building walked in with their dogs and promised to check out the campaign.\n\n\u201cHopefully, there will be lots of excitement over the weekend with Monday giving us a huge boost,\u201d van Vuuren said. \u201d We want to meet our $50,000 funding goal today. We would love to be the most successful pet tech (on Kickstarter). And if we could, we\u2019d like to be the most funded project in Colorado,\u201d\n\nOne of the largest pet-related projects was One Fast Cat, a hamster wheel for cats. It raised nearly $350,000.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re trying to save lives,\u201d quipped van Vuuren.\n\nThe genesis came from Kelly\u2019s own dog, Roxie, who ran after a squirrel but never returned. She was hit by a car.\n\n\u201cThe technology is here, so why is this still an issue?\u201d Kelly said.\n\nW\u00fcf built in features like an invisible fence, so if the dog goes outside a boundary, the owner is alerted. With a GPS chip in the collar, the W\u00fcf app also tracks where the dog has run off to.\n\nA 5 a.m. e-mail sent to people who opted in to W\u00fcf\u2019s news, was opened by 40 percent of its recipients by early afternoon. It had snagged the top spot for \u201cMost Popular\u201d on the Colorado page. It was also climbing up the popular technology projects page \u2014 quite a feat since it was competing with about 950 other technology campaigns.\n\nKelly continued to tweak the page and follow up with questions from potential supporters. The company also decided to drop the price, down from last year\u2019s $250-plus price tag. Currently, the lowest price on Kickstarter is $99, which gets you a grey collar that ships next November.\n\n\u201cAt $250, people who wanted it would know it\u2019s a premium product. But that was counter productive to our plan to get this on millions of dogs,\u201d Kelly said, adding that W\u00fcf has four patents pending. \u201cThe idea was to make this at an affordable price point. We still make a margin on hardware, plus we have an open API and (developer platform).\u201d\n\nWhile at the early-stage Boomtown Accelerator last spring, W\u00fcf got its team in the same city \u2014 Azmat Bilal flew in from Pakistan and Tyesha Snow from Portland, Ore. The experience included hands-on mentoring from CEOs like Fernando Cardenas of Talent Riot and Brian Baker of The First User. Plus, they got $20,000.\n\nBoomtown\u2019s program manager Shaw Lathrop said that for consumer tech products, crowdfunding is still a good way to gain traction.\n\n\u201cFor early stage companies, crowdfunding can really show investors about the interest in a product. You can show there is demand,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Sean, it really makes a lot of sense because he knows the interest is there. But instead of just telling (investors), you have proof.\u201d\n\nBoomtown ended in June and Kelly said he spent the time looking for investors.\n\n\u201cWe probably should have done Kickstarter earlier,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cComing out of Boomtown, we had a funding goal of $1.4 million. We had big fans from Demo Day and there was a lot of interest from venture capitalists.\u201d\n\nBut a difference of opinion \u2014 an extremely interested investor wanted a simpler collar and Kelly wanted to build the smartest thing out there \u2014 made Kelly decide to try Kickstarter.\n\n\u201cWe said let\u2019s rethink our approach. Is $1.4 million the right raise for us right now? Is our valuation where it should be? Or can we bring it up higher by building more traction? We needed to build more traction and prove the market is here once and for all. And then we can go back and raise that million-dollar round,\u201d he said.\n\nThis week, the company says it is closing on further funding that will more than double what they\u2019ve taken in to date. But for the most part, the founders bootstrapped the effort, Kelly said.\n\n\u201cThe Kickstarter aided us in (getting more funding) because it gave us a deadline,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIf the Kickstarter does well, our valuation increases. For investors with a little more appetite for risk, they get a better deal.\u201d\n\nKelly actually tried crowdfunding the product 18 months ago on Indiegogo. Under the moniker Ridogulous Labs, the campaign failed to reach its goal, netting just $7,391 of its $40,000 goal. Returning to crowdfunding was something Kelly debated.\n\n\u201cI was hesitant. Should we put ourselves through this again? I experienced small successes but a failure of the funding goal. What happens if this screws up again? There\u2019s this nervousness to it,\u201d Kelly said.\n\n\u201cBut what I keep reminding myself of is where I am now compared to back then. I had just finished business school and was living with my parents. I had no network, no team and no community to build into but my business school friends. But they\u2019re not startup people. So I said, Okay, let me think about this from a mathematical standpoint. How much greater is my reach now compared to before. It\u2019s easily 50-times. so times that by $7,000 and we\u2019ve got a good chance to do something powerful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s already been 30 days of non-stop work, as the company created a video by hiring 27 Notch, a Hollywood-based studio.\n\nBy around 5 p.m. Friday, W\u00fcf had raised $5,700. Twenty nine more days to go.\n\nAccording to Kickstarter, projects that reach 20 percent of their goal are likely to to be fully funded. Not all reach 20 percent; 12 percent of projects don\u2019t receive a single pledge.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of today\u2019s efforts is by the time we get around to Monday, we\u2019re already at 10 percent of our goal,\u201d van Vuuren said.\n\nTamara Chuang: 303-954-1209, tchuang@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Gadgetress\n\nCool tech products currently crowdfunding:\n\nBluesmart suitcase \u2014 A tricked-out suitcase that comes with a mobile app to keep track of your luggage.
