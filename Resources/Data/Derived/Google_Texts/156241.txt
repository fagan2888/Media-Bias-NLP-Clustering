President Obama at a 2009 town hall meeting picked on the USPS for not being able to keep up with its private competitors, UPS and FedEx, a comparison that many Obamacare opponents point to now in 2013.

“If the private insurance companies are providing a good bargain, and if the public option has to be self-sustaining — meaning taxpayers aren’t subsidizing it, but it has to run on charging premiums and providing good services and a good network of doctors, just like any other private insurer would do — then I think private insurers should be able to compete. They do it all the time. I mean, if you think about — if you think about it, UPS and FedEx are doing just fine, right? No, they are. It’s the Post Office that’s always having problems. (emphasis added, BBJ The Dispatch)

The Obamacare mandate seems to point to a clear parallel to the USPS and now a successful private solution like UPS and FedEx; therefore, why would the government run plan even be an option?

Furthermore, it’s public knowledge that FedEx assists the USPS regularly with meeting their demands under the current conditions.

How long until private insurance companies have contracts with the government exchanges to keep up with the patient volume or demands?
