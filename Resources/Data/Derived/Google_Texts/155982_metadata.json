Pete Sessions\u2019 Republican primary challenger, is running to his right on promises to slash spending.\n\nBut a recent financial disclosure shows she has been the beneficiary of a social safety net program, receiving more than $11,000 in unemployment insurance from the Texas Workforce Commission not long before she began running for Congress.\n\n\u201cNot sure what the scandal is here,\u201d she told the Austin news website Quorum Report, which first reported the payments Sunday. \u201cA single mom getting child support loses her job because of Obamacare and had unemployment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when she received those payments but it was sometime from January 2012 to November 2013, the period covered by her mandatory candidate disclosure form.\n\nTexas allows up to 26 weeks of unemployment benefits.\n\nPierson\u2019s LinkedIn profile shows she worked at Florida-based ASG Software Solutions until December 2012, and opened a consulting firm in June 2013. Throughout the period covered by the disclosure form, she also lists work as a radio talk show host and as a political commentator for WFAA-TV.\n\nIt is unclear whether she received pay for those gigs. She did not respond to requests for details Monday.\n\nASG did not respond to calls to confirm whether it laid off anyone because of potential costs under the Affordable Care Act. A few weeks before the 2012 elections, owner David Siegel, a Florida billionaire, warned employees by email that he would have to consider layoffs if President Barack Obama were re-elected.\n\nIn June and July of last year, Pierson traveled to Washington for two tea party rallies. It\u2019s unclear whether she was collecting unemployment payments at the time.\n\nFollow Nick Swartsell on Twitter at @nswartsell.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The payments preceded her campaign; she says she lost a job due to Obamacare.", "og": {"description": "The payments preceded her campaign; she says she lost a job due to Obamacare.", "title": "Pierson disclosure shows jobless aid", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140224-pierson-disclosure-shows-jobless-aid.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-02-25T05:07:44Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-02-25T05:07:44Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Pierson disclosure shows jobless aid\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140224-pierson-disclosure-shows-jobless-aid.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1467607\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-25T05:07:44Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"NICK SWARTSELL\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-02-25T05:07:44Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Tea party activist Katrina Pierson, Rep.
