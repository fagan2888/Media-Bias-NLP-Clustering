Pope Francis wrote the preface to the book.\n\nKnow a recent high school graduate?

It is a mood of thought and action that begins with the community, giving priority to the life of all, as opposed to merely thinking in terms of the individual. It means fighting against the structural causes of poverty, inequality, the lack of work, the negation of rights.\n\n\"It means facing head-on the effects of a system that places profit at its center, not man, a system which leads to forced dislocation of peoples, human trafficking, drugs, war, violence and all of those realities suffered by many, which we are all called to transform in the light of man's true vocation, his true dignity.\"\n\nM\u00fcller also discussed the responsibility of wealthier countries to help those that are struggling, not through commercialization, but rather by genuine assistance that would honor the autonomy of the people as well as the historical and cultural structures of a country.\n\nThe other keynote address was presented by James Heckman of the University of Chicago, a Nobel laureate in economics. He spoke on \"Pre-distribution: A Strategy for Promoting Flourishing Lives.\"\n\nLike M\u00fcller, Heckman also stressed virtue as a remedy for poverty. He cited various statistics that show the inequality between people raised in poor households and those from wealthier homes. However, he said that financial assets alone do not explain this disparity, as other factors enter into the picture, such as culture and transmission of values.\n\nHeckman said that a traditional, biblical method is to alleviate poverty through giving alms to the poor. He proposed another \"dynamic strategy\" to approach poverty and generational inequality thought what he called \"pre-distribution,\" which he defined as \"a strategy of giving skills to people to avoid them being poor in the first place, to improve human dignity and to present what I think is a complementary strategy to redistribution.\"\n\nThis pre-distribution strategy, which would be economically efficient and is rooted in economic analysis, would build character, promote family values and create skills, Heckman contended. Skills he mentioned were motivation, self-regulation, and what he called the classical Christian virtues, all of which help people take greater control of their lives and have better outcomes such as better health and financial stability, less incarceration and stronger families.\n\nSkills often get overlooked in discussions of inequality, he continued, but skills are \"major determinants of inequality.\" Skills create agency, the capacity for people to act on their own to build their lives and work with others. Skills also promote the dignity of human beings, which he said is consistent with what Pope Francis has been saying.\n\nMost people are \"fixated\" on pure cognitive skills, Heckman continued, but recent research has shown that character skills play an important role in life success; and character skills can be fostered by families, taught in schools and acquired through social interactions.\n\nSince the early years of a child's life are so important, Heckman said more consideration should be given to nurturing family environments and mentoring children and parents. Not only would this benefit human flourishing and dignity, it also would be more effective and cheaper than simply giving alms to the poor.\n\nOne of the conference sessions dealt with the success of Catholic schools in bringing children out of poverty. Archbishop Fernando Chomali Garib of Concepcion, Chile, told the conference about the dramatic rise in per capita income in his country that is related directly to Catholic education.\n\nNicole Garnett, a professor in the Notre Dame School of Law, explained why Catholic schools matter. She is co-author with her colleague Margaret Brinig of the 2014 book Lost Classroom, Lost Community: Catholic Schools' Importance in Urban America.\n\nCatholic schools, Garnett said, model the joy of vocation and form children in the Catholic culture, they provide an excellent education to disadvantaged children, and they provide stability to neighborhoods.\n\nShavar Jeffries, a Newark, N.J., attorney and founder of a system of charter schools in Newark, explained how school choice and deregulated education have improved the life outcomes of poor children, and he argued for more school choice programs.\n\nThis year's event was the 15th annual conference of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture, which is dedicated to sharing the richness of the Catholic moral and intellectual tradition through teaching, research and dialogue across a range of disciplines.\n\n[Ann Carey writes for Today's Catholic, newspaper of the diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend.]", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=4, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07ea\"", "article_summary": "It means fighting against the structural causes of poverty, inequality, the lack of work, the negation of rights.\nShe is co-author with her colleague Margaret Brinig of the 2014 book Lost Classroom, Lost Community: Catholic Schools' Importance in Urban America.\n\"Going well beyond a merely economic conception of poverty, Pope Francis has tried to indicate to the world the true poverty of the human condition in our times: the poverty of body and soul, pointing out all the forces at work in the world further impoverishing mankind,\" said Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller.\nOne of the conference sessions dealt with the success of Catholic schools in bringing children out of poverty.\nNicole Garnett, a professor in the Notre Dame School of Law, explained why Catholic schools matter."}
