Since then, 12 horses have won the first two legs and failed to complete the sweep; the last was I\u2019ll Have Another, who was scratched on the eve of the Belmont two years ago.\n\nMaybe the horse with the modest pedigree and average Joe owners is the one.\n\nCalifornia Chrome defeated Ride On Curlin by 1 \u00bd lengths at Pimlico, covering 1 3/16 miles in 1:54.84. He\u2019s now won six straight races by a combined 27 \u00bd lengths for 77-year-old trainer Art Sherman.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a very good horse to win these three races,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping I\u2019ve got one right now.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Chrome\u2019s co-owner Steve Coburn shed tears after his colt crossed the finish line, dabbing them away with a blue-and-white bandanna.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be bold or cocky or arrogant,\u201d Coburn said. \u201cI saw this baby when he was a day old, I told my wife, \u201cCarolyn, this horse is going to do something big. I don\u2019t know what it is, but we\u2019re going to stay in the game to make sure this colt gets to be the best that he can be.\u2019\u201d\n\nQuite a statement from a guy with a one-horse stable.\n\nCoburn and partner Perry Martin bred an $8,000 mare to a $2,500 stallion to produce California Chrome. Based on the colt\u2019s humble breeding, he probably shouldn\u2019t be on the verge of making history.\n\nHis mother, named Love the Chase, won just one race.\n\nThe owners were long shots to get this far, too.\n\nCoburn and Martin named their operation DAP Racing, which stands for Dumb Ass Partners. Their silks include an image of a donkey. Coburn and Perry who live on each side of the California-Nevada border get up early for their jobs \u2014 Coburn working as a press operator and Martin running a lab that tests high-reliability equipment.\n\n\u201cWe just hope that this horse is letting America know that the little guy can win,\u201d Coburn said.\n\nSent off as the overwhelming favorite by a record crowd of 123,469 on a sunny and cool day, California Chrome bounced out of the gate running, with jockey Victor Espinoza moving the colt into the clear. Pablo Del Monte, a 34-1 shot, charged to the lead and was soon joined by filly Ria Antonia.\n\nEspinoza tucked California Chrome into third, an ideal spot behind the leaders. They stayed there until making their move approaching the final turn.\n\n\u201cI had so many cameras in my face that I actually couldn\u2019t see the race,\u201d Coburn said.\n\nCalifornia Chrome made a move for the lead, catching Pablo Del Monte while Social Inclusion joined the chase. Pablo Del Monte soon dropped back along the rail, and California Chrome sprinted away from Social Inclusion at the top of the stretch.\n\nBut there was one more challenge to come.\n\nRide On Curlin, next-to-last in the 10-horse field, ranged up and briefly appeared ready to overtake California Chrome. Once again showing his class, California Chrome denied the threat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an awesome feeling,\u201d Espinoza said. \u201cToday it was just a crazy race. I got more tired mentally than physically. I see another horse go to the front. I was going to sit second. .. I sit back, as soon as the other horse got clear of me, it worked out perfect.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Chrome paid $3, $3 and $2.40. Ride On Curlin returned $5.60 and $3.80, while Social Inclusion was another 6 \u00bd lengths back in third and paid $3.40 as the 5-1 second choice.\n\nGeneral a Rod was fourth, followed by Ring Weekend, Pablo Del Monte, Dynamic Impact, Kid Cruz, Bayern and Ria Antonia.\n\nEspinoza will get another crack at trying to complete the Triple Crown, after missing with War Emblem in 2002. He finished eighth in the Belmont that year.\n\n\u201cYou have to be a super horse to win,\u201d the jockey said. \u201cHopefully, California Chrome comes back good, and he\u2019s the one that hopefully can do it.\u201d\n\nBob Baffert trained War Emblem, one of his three Triple tries that ended in failure. He missed with Silver Charm in 1997 and again the following year with Real Quiet, who lost the Belmont by a nose.\n\n\u201cCalifornia Chrome is something. He\u2019s a cool customer,\u201d Baffert said after the race. \u201cHe does everything right. He\u2019s fast enough to stay out of trouble.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a follow-up to his victory in the Kentucky Derby, trainer Art Sherman's horse justified his stature as the overwhelming favorite by outrunning Ride On Curlin to the finish Saturday.", "Author": "Beth Harris", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "As a follow-up to his victory in the Kentucky Derby, trainer Art Sherman\u2019s horse justified his stature as the overwhelming favorite by outrunning Ride On Curlin to the finish Saturday.", "title": "Preakness: California Chrome Triple Crown hopes alive", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/17/preakness-california-chrome-triple-crown-hopes-ali/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/17/preakness-horse-racin_lanc1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/17/preakness-horse-racin_lanc1.jpg", "title": "Preakness: California Chrome Triple Crown hopes alive", "description": "As a follow-up to his victory in the Kentucky Derby, trainer Art Sherman's horse justified his stature as the overwhelming favorite by outrunning Ride On Curlin to the finish Saturday.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Victor Espinoza, Perry Martin"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf640\"", "article_summary": "California Chrome defeated Ride On Curlin by 1 \u00bd lengths at Pimlico, covering 1 3/16 miles in 1:54.84.\nBALTIMORE \u2014 California Chrome repelled one challenger and then put away another in the stretch to win the Preakness on Saturday, setting up a Triple Crown try in three weeks.\nCalifornia Chrome made a move for the lead, catching Pablo Del Monte while Social Inclusion joined the chase.\nRide On Curlin, next-to-last in the 10-horse field, ranged up and briefly appeared ready to overtake California Chrome.\nPablo Del Monte soon dropped back along the rail, and California Chrome sprinted away from Social Inclusion at the top of the stretch."}
