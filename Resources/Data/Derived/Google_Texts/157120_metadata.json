Eighty-five percent of workers took home a bonus this year, up from 81 percent last year. Nearly 90 percent of employees exempt from overtime were eligible for an annual or short-term bonus.\n\nThat study found that companies plan to give employees an average salary bump of 3 percent, with the best workers getting a 4.6 percent raise and the worst workers receiving a salary increase of less than 1 percent.\n\nA forecast by Aon Hewitt projected similar raises next year, noting that the historic raises of 4 percent or more won\u2019t be returning any time soon.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The news is not good for workers who were expecting their full bonus this year.", "title": "Why Your Bonus Will Probably Be Smaller This Year", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/17/Why-Your-Bonus-Will-Probably-Be-Smaller-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12132013_Money_Shell_Game.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/17/Why-Your-Bonus-Will-Probably-Be-Smaller-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12132013_Money_Shell_Game.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The news is not good for workers who were expecting their full bonus this year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEmployers are continuing to take a conservative approach to funding their bonus pool,\u201d Towers Watson managing director Laura Sejen said in a statement.\nNearly 90 percent of employees exempt from overtime were eligible for an annual or short-term bonus.\nFor the fifth year in a row, U.S. employers don\u2019t expect to fully fund employee bonuses, according to a new report from Towers Watson.\nThe average projected bonus funding for 2015 is 89 percent of target, down from 93 percent last year.\nThe news is not good for workers who were expecting their full bonus this year."}
