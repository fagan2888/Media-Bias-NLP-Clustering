And the University of South Florida was awarded one of the initial grants.\n\nUSF College of Nursing associate dean Rita D\u2019Aoust said the medics and corpsmen are an untapped pool of talented and medically trained veterans just going to waste.\n\n\u201cThere were over 11,000, in 2011, unemployed medics and corpsmen as they were leaving the service,\u201d D\u2019Aoust said. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re facing a nursing shortage.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Aoust, who is a nurse practitioner with a doctorate in teaching, took the lead creating USF\u2019s medic to nurse program after a sentinel event.\n\n\u201cA dear mentor, colleague and friend - her son lost his life in service to this country as an Air Force pilot. His tact - who also happened to be a medic - the best position he can get was working as an EMT in a state that actually pays minimum wage. I thought what a travesty of justice,\u201d D\u2019Aoust said.\n\nMedics and corpsmen have the skills to perform some medical procedures in the military that Registered Nurses and Nurse Practitioners do in civilian life. Yet, D\u2019Aoust said many of them are at a disadvantage when competing for admission into nursing programs because their GPAs tended to be a little lower.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking courses when they\u2019re deployed. They\u2019re taking courses while they\u2019re working 16 hours,\u201d D\u2019Aoust said. \u201cSofor these individuals, we\u2019ve discovered there\u2019s more than the GPA.\u201d\n\nThree of the original nine V-CARE programs are in Florida. The other two are at Jacksonville University and Florida International University.\n\nTo design USF\u2019s 16-month program, D\u2019Aoust held focus groups with veterans, educators and \u201cveteran friendly\u201d universities. She even looked at similar programs that failed to avoid their mistakes. And she reached out to Janet Davis, a senior vice president and chief of nursing for Tampa General Hospital.\n\n\u201cThe V-CARE program that USF started has been a great program. Number one they gave credit to the veterans for experience. That doesn\u2019t happen often in nursing education programs,\u201d Davis said.\n\nUSF gives their veteran nursing students up to 16 credits for their military medical experience and they don\u2019t have to take some of the introductory classes.\n\nThe V-CARE students also do their clinical training is at TGH which Davis said is a perfect match for the Level One hospital that handles trauma patients.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hard working individuals, know how to deal with stress, know how to deal with crisis and can keep things calm,\u201d Davis said.\n\nIn fact, TGH hired one of the first 10 who graduated from USF\u2019s V-CARE program in December.\n\nAir Force Reserve medic and registered nurse, Willamina Folks, still had a bounce in her step as she exited TGH after finishing a 12-hour shift in the ICU, Intensive Care Unit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just blessed with a job and something I really enjoy doing,\u201d Folks said. \u201cI get to help people.\u201d\n\nFolks liked that the program could be completed in just over a year, provided V-CARE students with supportive teachers and a military liaison, also called the sequence director, who was former military and talked their lingo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful they came up with this program. I think military medics are going to benefit from it,\u201d Folks said. \u201cThe military trains us well enough to be able to transition and do well in a BSN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing) program.\u201d\n\nOne of the many components contributing to the USF V-CARE program success at USF, said D\u2019Aoust, is a small study lounge established specifically for the medics and corpsmen.\n\nIt\u2019s furnished with lime green sofas and chairs, a bookcase, five computers and a separate study area with a whiteboard, microwave and refrigerator.\n\nD\u2019Aoust said the students are most proud of a quilt donated by the USO and an American Flag that flew over the Capital donated by U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n\nShe said it\u2019s critical to provide a restful setting for the veterans\u2019 some of whom may be recovering from combat injuries.\n\n\u201cThese individuals have had their buddies die in their arms,\u201d D\u2019Aoust said choking up a little. \u201cSo, these individuals come into our program having seen some of the worst atrocities that humans can do to each other. They have that sense of honor, that dedication, the service. And they come into the nursing program and they\u2019re just thrilled to have this chance.\u201d\n\nAnd taking a chance on the non-traditional nursing students is paying off. The first V-CARE class of 10 had a 100 percent graduation rate and the second class of 23 medics and corpsmen is on track to do the same this December.\n\nUSF also started a national webinar to share their V-CARE ideas and is consulting with other colleges who want to start a medic to nurse program.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/giving-medics-path-civilian-nursing", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201603/471909924.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Giving Medics A Path To Civilian Nursing"}, "story_id": 471907756, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Bobbie O'Brien", "org_id": 671, "dc": {"title": "Giving Medics A Path To Civilian Nursing"}, "nid": 14064, "datePublished": "2016-03-25", "keywords": "nursing, medic, Creating Access to Registered Nurse Education for Veterans, veteran, veterans", "wordCount": 1183, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "And they come into the nursing program and they\u2019re just thrilled to have this chance.\u201dAnd taking a chance on the non-traditional nursing students is paying off.\n\u201cSofor these individuals, we\u2019ve discovered there\u2019s more than the GPA.\u201dThree of the original nine V-CARE programs are in Florida.\nI think military medics are going to benefit from it,\u201d Folks said.\nIn fact, TGH hired one of the first 10 who graduated from USF\u2019s V-CARE program in December.\nSo in 2013, the federal government funded pilot programs at nine universities to create curriculums so veterans, medics and corpsmen can earn their Bachelor of Science in Nursing."}
