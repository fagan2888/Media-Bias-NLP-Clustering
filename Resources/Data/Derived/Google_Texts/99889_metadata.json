Associated Press\n\nU.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr., who successfully defended President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health-care law in 2012, is among the possible candidates to succeed Attorney General Eric Holder, who is expected to announce Thursday that he will step down.\n\nMr. Verrilli, 57 years old, is a veteran appellate lawyer who in private and government practice has argued numerous high-profile Supreme Court cases. In addition to defending the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Verrilli has represented the U.S. government in major cases before the high court on same-sex marriage, voting rights and this year\u2019s challenge to contraception-coverage requirements under the health law.\n\nHe was confirmed by the Senate as solicitor general, the chief advocate for the government before the high court, in June 2011 to succeed Elena Kagan after she was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Verrilli\u2019s most famous argument came in the main challenge to the health-care law before the high court in March 2012. It began awkwardly as he coughed and stuttered. But he was prepared when the justices asked him whether the law\u2019s requirement to buy health insurance could open the door for the federal government to mandate that people buy broccoli.\n\n\u201cA car or broccoli aren\u2019t purchased for their own sake,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts said to Mr. Verrilli. \u201cThey\u2019re purchased for the sake of transportation or, in broccoli, covering the need for food.\u201d\n\nMr. Verrilli replied, \u201cThe difference, Mr. Chief Justice, is that health insurance is the means of payment for health care, and broccoli is \u2026 not the means of payment for anything else.\u201d\n\nDespite his early stumbles in the arguments, Mr. Verrilli was redeemed when the Supreme Court ruled in the administration\u2019s favor and largely upheld the law.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr., who successfully defended President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health-care law in 2012, is among the possible candidates to succeed Attorney General Eric Holder.", "title": "With Holder Leaving, Verrilli Is Back in the Spotlight", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/09/25/with-holder-leaving-verrilli-is-back-in-the-spotlight/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ES350_Verril_P_20140925114859.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "With Holder Leaving, Verrilli Is Back in the Spotlight", "description": "U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr., who successfully defended President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health-care law in 2012, is among the possible candidates to succeed Attorney General Eric Holder.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Janet Adamy and Mark H.
