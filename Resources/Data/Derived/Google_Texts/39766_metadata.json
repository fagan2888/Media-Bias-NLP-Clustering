Like the president\u2014and, polls show, most Americans\u2014a bipartisan coalition in the Senate supports comprehensive reform. But House Republicans, fearful of their inflamed base, won\u2019t budge from an enforcement-only measure.\u201d\n\nOh, wait. Sorry. Morris wrote that in October. Of 2006.\n\nYes, that\u2019s really how long this has been going on and, in fact, one could argue that things are actually worse today than they were when her article was published eight and a half years ago.\n\nIn 2015, House Republicans don\u2019t even have an immigration bill to argue about. The closest they have come is the current fight over the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which Republicans are trying to load up with riders that would block enforcement of the president\u2019s executive actions lifting the threat of deportation from millions of illegal immigrants.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s Rand Paul at the Top of the CPAC Straw Poll; Scott Walker a Close Second\n\nThose millions of immigrants, members of both parties generally admit, aren\u2019t going to be deported anyway. Of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., the five million or so Obama would allow to come out of the shadows are the lowest priority for an already overloaded enforcement system.\n\nSo, they are staying, regardless of the president\u2019s executive order. The fight, in large part, seems to be over admitting that reality. And because the DHS funding bill has become the current loyalty test that the Republican base applies to its candidates, it has been taking up rather a lot of the oxygen in GOP policy discussions lately. That is particularly true among some GOP presidential hopefuls who have taken compromise positions on the issue in the past, most of whom could not be backpedalling harder or faster.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has quickly vaulted close to the top of the early running for the Republican nomination, turned 180 degrees from a position he had advocated as recently as 2013 when he told a newspaper reporter that offering illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship made sense.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Immigration Setback Is a Gift to GOP\n\n\u201cMy view has changed,\u201d Walker said when confronted with the statement by Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m flat-out saying it. Candidates can say that.\u201d\n\nHe told Wallace, \u201cI don't believe in amnesty, and part of the reason why I've made that a firm position is I look at the way this president has mishandled that issue. I think the better approach is to enforce the laws and to give employers \u2013 job creators \u2013 the tools\u2026to make sure the law is being upheld going forward.\u201d\n\nLast week at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was forced to ritually disown his former stance on immigration in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. Hannity reminded Rubio that he had admitted to \u201cregretting\u201d his support of a comprehensive immigration reform plan that allowed a path to legality for some immigrants.\n\nRubio readily agreed, and launched into full-throated appeal for ever more border enforcement. It turned out to be the beginning of a trend.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Immigration Order Blocked by Federal Judge\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has been criticized by fellow Republicans for supporting such things as in-state university tuition for illegals, used his time on stage at CPAC to talk tough about immigration border enforcement as well. He touted his decision to send 1,000 National Guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border last year, steering far clear of his more moderate policies while serving as governor.\n\nRubio and Perry alike used the alleged deficiency of current border enforcement as an excuse to forestall any discussion of substantive immigration reform.\n\nTo his credit, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush walked into the lion\u2019s den last and did admit at least one part of the obvious truth. \u201cThe simple fact is, there is no plan to deport 11 million people,\u201d he told the CPAC audience. \u201cWe should give them a path to legal status, where they work, where they don\u2019t receive government benefits, they don\u2019t break the law, they learn English, and they make a contribution to our society.\u201d\n\nHe quickly pivoted to a denunciation of the president\u2019s executive orders and a call for more border enforcement. Bush suggested that the unaccompanied minors who came to the U.S. in droves last year ought to have been turned back at the border.\n\nHis past comments on the issue suggest he really believes there ought to have been a system in place to return them safely to their families, but at CPAC, the comment was left hanging without elaboration.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Illegal immigration has been the subject of internecine Republican battles for nearly a decade, and recent events suggest the rift is far from being healed.", "title": "A GOP Minority Is Holding the Party Hostage Over Immigration", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/02/GOP-Minority-Holding-Party-Hostage-Over-Immigration", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06192012_GOP_Elephant_Congress_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/02/GOP-Minority-Holding-Party-Hostage-Over-Immigration", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06192012_GOP_Elephant_Congress_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Illegal immigration has been the subject of internecine Republican battles for nearly a decade, and recent events suggest the rift is far from being healed.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf52\"", "article_summary": "In 2015, House Republicans don\u2019t even have an immigration bill to argue about.\nBut House Republicans, fearful of their inflamed base, won\u2019t budge from an enforcement-only measure.\u201dOh, wait.\nRubio and Perry alike used the alleged deficiency of current border enforcement as an excuse to forestall any discussion of substantive immigration reform.\nRubio readily agreed, and launched into full-throated appeal for ever more border enforcement.\nRick Perry, who has been criticized by fellow Republicans for supporting such things as in-state university tuition for illegals, used his time on stage at CPAC to talk tough about immigration border enforcement as well."}
