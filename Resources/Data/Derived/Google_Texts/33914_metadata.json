Yes, this is how I\u2019ve been trying to spend my free time this year: getting to the bottom of one of the most parsed and discussed pieces of literature ever written. As opposed to giving it the \u201col\u2019 college try\u201d when I was actually in college, my goal, started back in the long winter of 2015, is to systematically break down this modernist opus into something resembling real meaning\u2014and even if I could not achieve that meaning on my own, at least I could tell my grandchildren about my faux-serious academic efforts during my mid-twenties (of course, if I spend the next two decades on this book, I won\u2019t get anywhere close to obtaining grandkids).\n\nAll self-deprecation aside, while I can certainly get mentally locked in to the task after a bit of effort, at times this off-hours initiative starts to feel a lot like what I\u2019m trying to avoid: Yes, sadly this project of mine sometimes seems like work. But is that really such a sin? After all, we spend approximately 35\u201340 hours a week doing our jobs, and it subsequently becomes hard to turn our brains off from that mindset. It\u2019s only natural to think about your industry of choice on evenings and weekends; in fact, sometimes insight into your vocational life pops up almost unannounced as you go about your favorite hobbies and activities.\n\nAs an editor in the content marketing realm, I feel that type of pull between my work life and my personal life all the time. No, this isn\u2019t a question of work-life balance. Think of it this way: if you work to foster quality, original content, then you\u2019re drawing on numerous areas, and if you\u2019re a bookish English major, then storytelling methodology falls right into the same wheelhouse as content marketing strategy. We\u2019re often prone to discussing media types, publishing cadence, and SEO optimization at work, but we can also benefit from the same brain activity that Joyce, Stephen King, Thomas Pynchon, and J.K. Rowling employ in their vocation: How do we reach\u2014and engage\u2014the prospective reader, the audience?\n\nNo right-minded marketer would seek inspiration from Joyce, but I would argue that the mechanics behind the intent is similar. A man as committed to his work as Joyce was certainly not dreaming of dollar signs, but he surely thought of his writing in terms of the effect on the audience, going so far as to say he had \u201cput in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant.\u201d In the marketing space\u2014content marketing or otherwise\u2014professionals would give several arms and legs to have their output stay in their audiences\u2019 minds for a year, let alone centuries.\n\nAs content marketers, we aren\u2019t wrapped up in the traditional point A to point B process of getting a product or service from store shelf to the consumer but are instead focused on engaging an audience of those would-be consumers in a meaningful way. This thinking isn\u2019t all that different from writing a work that people might want to read. What content marketing strategy, or strategies, are we using to pique the interest of a prospective group of consumers? You don\u2019t have to stick to industry literature to find the insight needed to create meaningful, original content, and if a work as vast and dense as Ulysses can prove this point, I\u2019m willing to bet that the rest of the literary universe can, too (OK, maybe not Finnegans Wake).\n\nLet\u2019s dive into some of the specific lessons that I\u2019ve gleaned from Joyce that relate both to storytelling in general and\u2014believe it or not\u2014the content marketing industry.\n\nEmbrace the Mundane\n\nWhat makes Ulysses stand out from so many other works is its devotion to the finest details of one single, unremarkable day. Whether it\u2019s bathroom breaks, meals, daydreams, or purchasing a bar of soap, the events of June 16, 1904, aren\u2019t terribly important, but what Joyce achieves through the frame of the everyday goes beyond that: The work is a classic example of being more than the sum of its parts. The main characters may not travel far within the city limits of Dublin, but the mental miles logged (both by the characters and by the reader) add up to so much more.\n\nIt isn\u2019t a stretch to link this thinking to content marketing strategy; In fact, if content isn\u2019t reflecting the everyday, small victories and struggles we go through, it won\u2019t reach anybody. Consumers are engaged when they identify with a problem or a solution. While the storytelling technique of Ulysses is almost purposefully complex and confusing, the conflicts that the story\u2019s protagonist, Leopold Bloom, faces are easily relatable: marital problems, struggles at work, small purchasing decisions. Content creators should take the same approach. If you\u2019re talking about something dense or technical, always tie it back to a universal point\u2014an answer people are searching for or a problem they\u2019re looking to solve.\n\nHealth Matters, Dignity Health\u2019s blog (a Skyword client), takes this thinking to heart by tying what would otherwise be dense, medically-focused content to a tone that speaks directly to consumers at a basic level. This direction has really helped Dignity separate itself from the pack; while there is certainly a wealth of health information available online, Health Matters translates complicated health information by honing in on the everyday battles that people\u2014and their loved ones\u2014face due to health issues. By leaning on a person-to-person tone rather than speaking from a distantly authoritative perspective, the blog is far better equipped to connect with its readers. It\u2019s not a medical encyclopedia; it\u2019s a person-to-person dialogue, and it\u2019s no surprise that this approach engages readers more successfully.\n\nTell It Three Different Ways\n\nUlysses is famous for encapsulating the modernist movement in literature. Simply put, modernism encouraged writers to experiment with literary form, and no one took this further than Joyce, who applied a different approach to storytelling in every chapter of Ulysses. For a few examples, the seventh chapter is broken into segments headed by newspaper-style headlines, while the fifteenth is written in the form of a play script. Most famously, the final chapter of the novel is written in stream-of-consciousness form and dispenses with punctuation entirely.\n\nHow do we translate this seemingly haphazard approach to our content marketing efforts? Rather than focusing on the experimental nature of this idea, think about it in terms of variety. Most content has an overarching audience to address and a specific topic area to cover. Sometimes, the ideation process hits a brick wall when we run out of ways to approach that area and audience\u2014as well as different ways to speak to that area/audience. The answer to this dilemma is to spice up your storytelling: Take the Joyce approach, and use different formats. There\u2019s more to content than short-form articles: make it a series of pieces about one big, multifaceted topic. Or dispense with articles altogether; different types of media might resonate better with your audience. Simply providing that level of variety will keep loyal readers coming back for more.\n\nAnthem, Inc. has a health care reform blog that is a great example of what multiple formats of content can do within one topic area. While the site leans heavily on short-form articles to discuss Affordable Care Act requirements and the nuances of employee health plans, there\u2019s also great variety on show: longer-form pieces and more visually oriented content types such as infographics and videos. The blog\u2019s main topic area is complicated, dense material, but by making use of different formats, there\u2019s a far better chance that readers seeking expertise on health care reform topics will find the explanation they need through a medium that works best for their understanding.\n\nSign o\u2019 the Times\n\nPerhaps more than any novel ever written, Ulysses is inextricably linked to its setting, as Joyce takes the concept of setting to a whole other level. Yes, most people are aware that the story takes place in Dublin on a specific day, but Joyce goes beyond the basic elements of setting by packing his work to the brim with details\u2014big and small\u2014of what it means to live in that time and place. Life in Dublin, life in Ireland (particularly the country\u2019s relationship with the British), and life in Europe is revealed through countless historical minutia. Furthermore, religion\u2014addressed through the predominant faith of Catholicism, as contrasted with the protagonist\u2019s Jewish ancestry\u2014reverberates throughout. The accumulation of these numerous facts and allusions creates an unmistakably clear vision of the world Joyce created.\n\nContent works the same way. Just as we want to link original content to an audience\u2019s everyday experiences, we also want to keep up with what people are thinking about in their world. This is easier said than done when addressing a large audience, but by focusing on the hot news stories of the day and the ongoing debates and trends that dominate common discourse, you\u2019re attaching heightened relevancy to the material you\u2019re putting out there. The means of identifying those hot stories, debates, and trends are as accessible as they\u2019ve ever been thanks to search engine data. What are people searching for in your space, and what has people talking? If you can tie your content to what\u2019s gluing eyeballs to screens across the Internet, you\u2019ll draw your own fair share of those views.\n\nAnother Skyword client, IBM\u2019s Security Intelligence news stream leads the way in its topic area by offering insight and analysis that\u2019s tied to relevant news stories. Information security is an evolving landscape, with many new developments occurring weekly that affect best practices and techniques. What better way to link information to what\u2019s relevant today than by using news as a launching point for further analysis? In an area where things are fluid, Security Intelligence positions itself as an up-to-date resource that goes beyond simply curating news content; instead, it takes that content and draws lessons and insights from it to add further value to readers.\n\nFighting Content Drought\n\nContent never rests, and to keep readers coming back to your site, you need to keep it coming. But we can\u2019t always rely on inspiration. Sure, those moments are valuable, but they\u2019re also fleeting, and when you\u2019re running a blog that publishes on a regular basis, you have to work hard to find relevant topics and approaches. Where can you turn when ideas are running dry?\n\nTo again lean on the literary world, let\u2019s think about a quote from another great, T.S. Eliot: \u201cGood writers borrow, great writers steal.\u201d In the world of online content, you don\u2019t have to worry so much about plagiarism. Your industry/topic area will set you apart from other sites, but what you should aim to borrow or steal isn\u2019t their actual original content\u2014it\u2019s their approach. How are sites connecting and engaging with their respective audiences? Whether you draw upon their format types, publishing cadence, or specific design elements, you can take a specific approach and apply it in a different way for your own blog without being a copycat. You\u2019re already differentiating yourself from others by your focus and intended audience, so rather than cribbing content, you\u2019re deriving inspiration from another site that excels at reaching its own specific readers.\n\nNo matter what inspires you\u2014what you read or watch or hear, what you experience, what sites you visit\u2014the beauty of content marketing is how you can apply all that inspiration to work specifically for your blog. The versatility within this industry is what makes it always feel new and relevant. So get out there, do what you love, and let that inspiration come to you. Don\u2019t be ashamed when your mind turns to work during your free time; in a world where content can mean literally anything, you never know when you\u2019ll be hit with a content epiphany. Embrace those moments, and your readers will embrace it with you.\n\nTo read more stories about content marketing strategy, subscribe to the Content Standard Newsletter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Inspiration for original content pops up when we least expect it\u2014even in hobbies that have nothing to do with our jobs (like making sense of Ulysses).", "og": {"site_name": "The Content Standard by Skyword", "description": "Inspiration for original content pops up when we least expect it\u2014even in hobbies that have nothing to do with our jobs (like making sense of Ulysses).", "title": "Where Do We Find Original Content?
