But it\u2019s par for the course, I guess, when you\u2019re a female Steelers fan.\n\nI\u2019ve navigated through the sea of \u201cRapistberger\u201d jokes that burned my ears after multiple allegations. And a year after writing about them, I\u2019ve cemented my position that Big Ben should no longer be playing for the Steelers, and since retired his jersey to the back of my closet in favor of men like Joe Greene and Hines Ward who have represented the team in a positive way. Last summer I watched as 49er Ahmad Brooks, released from the Bengals in 2008 following an incident where he punched a woman in the face, allegedly went on to assault teammate Lamar Divens, but was not charged as Divens decided \u201cit would be bad for both their careers.\u201d Now the Ray Rice spectacle \u2014 and accompanying video evidence \u2014 unfolds before my eyes, and Roger Goodell answers with a two-game suspension. To be clear, that is two games less than Odell Thurman received for failing to show up for a drug test in 2006. Thirteen games less than Browns receiver Josh Gordon\u2019s punishment for smoking some grass.\n\nI\u2019m tired of supporting a league that does not support its female fan base. And I\u2019m not alone. Lifelong Bengals fan Lisa Schare Johnson recently addressed an open letter to the NFL on why she will no longer be attending games, buying merchandise, or otherwise supporting an organization whose commissioner refuses to condemn domestic violence:\n\nI have griped and grumbled while watching the evolution of the cheerleading uniform until it\u2019s virtually non-existent \u2014 proving that NFL \u201ccheerleading\u201d isn\u2019t really much about cheering, but more about the objectification of young women on the sideline. I have been horrified at the racism allowed to occur in the locker rooms and dismayed at the slow response to the detrimental long-term effects of sustained head injuries. However, this last decision has officially done me in as a fan.\n\nWhile I applaud Lisa for her letter and decision not to put any more money in Goodell\u2019s pocket, hers is a choice that no female fan \u2013 or any fan who condones violence against women \u2014 should have to make.\n\nAs it was for Lisa, football was an integral part of my upbringing and sense of family. We lived, breathed, and bled black and gold in an area populated by disgruntled ex-Colts fans who would later don purple and propagate the fiercest divisional rivalry the NFL had ever seen. My favorite present on Christmas Day 1997 was a Kordell Stewart jersey, which, though it swallowed my bony ten year old frame, I happily wore every Sunday for the remainder of the season.\n\nBut 2008 was the year that took me from admiration to total immersion. My friend Eric had broken his foot in late August and would be laid up for the duration of football season. I kept him company on lazy Sunday afternoons and through his pain, he patiently and diligently taught me the names of plays, positions, and penalties until I felt like a certified expert. What had been mere appreciation had developed into an understanding of the intricate ins and outs that would make that year\u2019s Super Bowl win all the sweeter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I'm sick and tired of dealing with the sexism that is seemingly attached to being a female fan of the NFL", "title": "I should not have to reconcile being an NFL fan with being a woman", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "I'm sick and tired of dealing with the sexism that is seemingly attached to being a female fan of the NFL", "title": "I should not have to reconcile being an NFL fan with being a woman", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/17/i_should_not_have_to_reconcile_being_an_nfl_fan_with_being_a_woman/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/ravens-rice-football.jpeg1-620x412.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I'm sick and tired of dealing with the sexism that is seemingly attached to being a female fan of the NFL", "title": "I should not have to reconcile being an NFL fan with being a woman", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/ravens-rice-football.jpeg1-620x412.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chelsea Cristene", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ben Roethlisberger, Keith Olbermann, NFL, ray rice, The Good Men Project, Violence Against Women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m tired of supporting a league that does not support its female fan base.\nBut it\u2019s par for the course, I guess, when you\u2019re a female Steelers fan.\nWhile I applaud Lisa for her letter and decision not to put any more money in Goodell\u2019s pocket, hers is a choice that no female fan \u2013 or any fan who condones violence against women \u2014 should have to make.\nHowever, this last decision has officially done me in as a fan.\nTo be clear, that is two games less than Odell Thurman received for failing to show up for a drug test in 2006."}
