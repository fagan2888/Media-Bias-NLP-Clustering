As part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), everyone is required to sign up for health-care coverage, or face a penalty that increases each year for non-compliance.\n\nHome Office Deduction: In its second year, small business owners who work from their home can now claim a streamlined, standardized home-office deduction rather than completing a complicated IRS form.\n\nMileage Rate: If you use your automobile for business, you also can deduct a standard mileage rate on your return at 56 cents per mile for 2014 (and expected even higher at 57.5 cents for 2015).\n\nRetirement Contributions: Limits for retirement contributions have also increased for most Americans. SEPs, IRAs and 401k plans, all allow you to contribute to your own future and take a tax deduction on your 2014 tax return.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nHealth Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs): As an unintended consequence of ACA implementation, small businesses lost the ability to provide their employees small amounts of financial support for health-care related expenses through HRAs.\n\nWhen it comes to tax equity, comprehensive tax reform is needed to ensure that all small businesses \u2013 from those with 499 employees to the sole entrepreneur \u2013 are treated equally and fairly. Not only should adjustments be made to the corporate tax rate, but also the individual rate \u2013 the rate at which the majority of the self-employed and small business owners\u2019 taxes are calculated.\n\nAs Congress considers tax reform, there are three easy ways they can support the Main Street, small-business community: amending the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d to include the owner of a sole proprietorship to take advantage of additional benefits; simplifying the definition of an independent contractor to clarify a worker\u2019s status; and streamlining the deduction process, much like the home-office rule, by creating a schedule C-Z to expand as many deductions as possible for business expenses. These small, common sense changes will help the small business community in a big way.\n\nOur nation\u2019s smallest businesses, from the self-employed to micro-businesses with nine employees or less, are part of the largest small business demographic -- and it is growing each and every day. According to the latest U.S. Census figures, small businesses account for 78% of the entire business community, representing over 27 million entities nationwide. In fact, the self-employed are growing at a top rate of 2.8% over the last ten years \u2013 more than any other small business group.\n\nThis year\u2019s tax deadline is only weeks away. If you haven\u2019t gathered your documents, now is the time to get prepared. Remember, you are not alone, there are a host of resources -- from your local small business development center to the IRS and the Small Business Administration -- available to help you. Educating yourself about the changes and adjustments to the tax code could save you money, and filing electronically can help you avoid errors.\n\nAnd remember, if you still can\u2019t get your taxes done on time, you can ask for more time from the IRS via an extension.\n\nKeith Hall is the president and CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE),the nation\u2019s leading advocate and resource for the self-employed and micro-businesses. He is also the association\u2019s National Tax Advisor and is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/TAXES,/FOX BUSINESS/Small Business",
