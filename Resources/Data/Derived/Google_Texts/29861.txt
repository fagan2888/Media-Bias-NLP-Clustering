A late night fire at a southwest Wichita strip mall has been ruled arson.

The fire broke out around 11:30 P.M. Wednesday night at the Southwest Centers mall near 31st Street South and Seneca. When crews arrived, they saw heavy smoke coming from the door of the Chiropractic Care Center.

The fire was so large that 12 fire crews were called out to help extinguish the flames.

After the fire was out, investigators found signs that someone had forced entry to the back door.

The fire caused $350,000 damage. Most of the damage was done to the clinic, but adjacent businesses were also damaged by smoke and water.

Investigators will now conduct interviews with other business owners and neighbors, hoping someone has information on possible suspects. Right now, no security video of the incident is available.

If you have information on the crime, you're asked to call Wichita fire investigators at (316) 337-9146.
