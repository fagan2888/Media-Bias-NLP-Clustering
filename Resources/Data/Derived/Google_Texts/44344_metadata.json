Roberts Jr.\u2019s surprise decision three years ago saying that while Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate wasn\u2019t allowed under Congress\u2019s powers to control interstate commerce, it was valid as an exercise of its taxing power.\n\nThe Pacific Legal Foundation had said its plaintiff in the case, Matt Sissel, doesn\u2019t want health insurance but is being forced to get it under the mandate, which imposes an increasingly painful tax penalty on those who shirk coverage.\n\nMr. Sissel is an Iraq War veteran and small business owner who pays his own medical bills and \u201cobjects on financial, philosophical, and constitutional grounds to being ordered to purchase a health plan he does not need or want,\u201d the foundation said.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected his suit in August, saying the primary purpose of the law wasn\u2019t to raise money. Other judges on the panel said Obamacare should be labeled a revenue bill, but that Congress didn\u2019t violate the origination clause, because the Senate inserted text into a legislative shell from the House.\n\nSo far, the overhaul\u2019s opponents haven\u2019t had much luck before the high court. The justices upheld the law as constitutional in 2012, although the court said states could choose not to expand Medicaid under the law.\n\nLast year, plaintiffs in King v. Burwell said the law\u2019s text limited the subsidies to the handful of states that set up their own exchanges.\n\nBut Chief Justice Roberts reasoned the law, when read in its entirety, allowed qualified Americans to qualify for the tax credits no matter where they live.\n\nThe Constitutional Accountability Center said Tuesday \u201cthe ultimate outcome of challenges like this one aren\u2019t in doubt,\u201d so Obamacare\u2019s opponents should give it a rest.\n\n\u201cThey are simply meritless,\u201d its chief counsel, Elizabeth Wydra, said of the challenges. \u201cThe Court upheld the ACA for the second time just last June, with Chief Justice Roberts picking up a sixth vote to send a clear signal that he\u2019s had enough of what has become a blatant ideological crusade. One questions whether anti-Obamacare legal activists have gotten the message.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to take up an appeal that says Congress flouted the Constitution by kick-starting Obamacare in the wrong chamber.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to take up an appeal that says Congress flouted the Constitution by kick-starting Obamacare in the wrong chamber.", "title": "Supreme Court refuses to take another Obamacare case", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/19/supreme-court-refuses-take-another-obamacare-case/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/25/5888d46af7dbd42f850f6a706700b1e6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/25/5888d46af7dbd42f850f6a706700b1e6.jpg", "description": "The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to take up an appeal that says Congress flouted the Constitution by kick-starting Obamacare in the wrong chamber.", "card": "summary", "title": "Supreme Court refuses to take another Obamacare case"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime"}, "article_summary": "The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to take up an appeal that says Congress flouted the Constitution by kick-starting Obamacare in the wrong chamber.\nBut Chief Justice Roberts reasoned the law, when read in its entirety, allowed qualified Americans to qualify for the tax credits no matter where they live.\nThe Pacific Legal Foundation said the Affordable Care Act of 2010 raises hundreds of billions in taxes, making it a revenue bill subject to the founders\u2019 vision for which chamber should act first.\nThe justices upheld the law as constitutional in 2012, although the court said states could choose not to expand Medicaid under the law.\n\u201cThe Court upheld the ACA for the second time just last June, with Chief Justice Roberts picking up a sixth vote to send a clear signal that he\u2019s had enough of what has become a blatant ideological crusade."}
