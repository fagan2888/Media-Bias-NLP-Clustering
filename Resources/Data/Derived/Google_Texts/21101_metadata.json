Larry Taylor of Friendswood that passed a Senate committee Monday.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 575, private health insurance plans and those offered through the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace could only provide coverage for abortions in cases of medical emergencies. Women seeking coverage for what Taylor calls \u201celective\u201d abortions would be required to purchase supplemental health insurance plans.\n\n\u201cThis bill is not a ban on elective abortions. In fact, this bill is all about choice,\u201d Taylor told the Senate State Affairs Committee on Monday as it considered his proposal.\n\nThe bill intends to keep premiums being paid to an insurance provider from underwriting abortion coverage, Taylor said. \u201cUnder this bill, you can choose to pay for abortions or you can choose not to pay for the abortions of others,\u201d Taylor added.\n\nTen states now prohibit all health plans from covering abortion, and 15 prohibit abortion coverage on federal marketplace plans, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Texas currently allows health plans to offer abortion coverage.\n\nUnder the federal reform law, states can set their own rules for abortion coverage on insurance plans sold through the federal marketplace. In states where abortion coverage is permitted on marketplace plans, the insurance providers must separate funds that go toward abortion coverage from money that consumers pay for other medical care.\n\nState Sen. Judith Zaffirini, a Democrat from Laredo, said she had heard concerns that requiring women to purchase supplemental plans could lead to high premium rates and questioned whether \u201cthe practical effect of this bill would make abortion uninsurable.\u201d\n\nWithout insurance coverage for abortions, opponents of Taylor\u2019s bill said they also worried women may seek cheap and unsafe abortion methods and providers.\n\n\u201cWe believe every woman should be able to make the personal decision she thinks is best for her and her family and privately purchase the insurance plan that is best for her and her family,\u201d said Ana Rodriguez DeFrates, state policy and advocacy director for the Texas Latina Advocacy Network.\n\nShe added that the measure does not provide exceptions for rape, incest and severe fetal abnormalities.\n\nLawmakers in the House are considering a similar proposal by state Rep. Marsha Farney, R-Georgetown, that would ban abortion coverage from federal marketplace health insurance plans. The House State Affairs Committee considered the measure earlier this month and has not voted on it.\n\nSome anti-abortion advocates have said Farney\u2019s measure doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nDuring the Senate hearing, supporters of Taylor\u2019s measure told the committee that it would better protect Texans who oppose abortion from subsidizing the procedure for others by banning it in all health plans.\n\nElizabeth Graham, director of the anti-abortion Texas Right to Life, added that insurance is not necessary to pay for the procedure because abortion providers often offer payment plans to women seeking abortions.\n\n\u201cSo no woman goes to a clinic without being able to pay for an abortion,\u201d Graham said.\n\nTaylor\u2019s proposal is among several bills making their way through the Legislature that would further restrict abortion in the state two years after lawmakers passed one of the strictest abortion laws in the country. Texas\u2019 abortion law, also known as House Bill 2, requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of an abortion clinic. It also requires facilities that perform abortions to meet the same hospital-like standards as ambulatory surgical centers, including pipelines for anesthesia and larger hallway sizes.\n\nThe passage of HB 2 has led to the closure of dozens of clinics in the state and could leave Texas with fewer than 10 clinics \u2014 all in major metropolitan areas \u2014 if the abortion law holds up against an ongoing legal challenge.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
