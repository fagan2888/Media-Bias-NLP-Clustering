An affable, laid-back lawmaker with a pragmatic streak, Cole was an ally of John Boehner, then the House speaker, and a skilled operative.\n\nHe had run the GOP organization in charge of reelecting House Republicans, and was the chief of staff at the Republican National Committee in 2000. But no one would have named Cole as a particularly influential lawmaker on health care.\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\nNow, however, as the head of the House Appropriations subcommittee on labor, health, and human services, Cole is one of the most important Republican advocates of medical research. He\u2019s also one of the key reasons that the National Institutes of Health is probably about to get a big boost in funding for the first time in 12 years.\n\nThat proposed increase is part of a huge spending bill to keep the federal government running after its funding runs out on Friday. The bill is tied up right now with fights over other issues, so Congress is set to pass a short-term extension to keep the government open into next week. But if those fights can be resolved, NIH is almost certain to end up with more money \u2014 anywhere from $1 billion to $2 billion more than last year.\n\nOver the past year, Cole gave himself a crash course in medical research and public health. He visited the NIH campus in Bethesda, Md., in January and spent hours talking to Director Francis Collins and the leaders of some of the individual institutes. He flew to Atlanta in February to visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHe also talked with medical research experts from his home state and with lobbyists from some of the most vocal disease advocacy groups, including the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, which helped convince him to include a $300 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s research in his bill.\n\nCole is candid about how much influence the Alzheimer\u2019s advocates had on his thinking: \u201cWe just adopted the proposal of the Alzheimer\u2019s advocates because we thought it made a lot of sense.\u201d\n\nThe personal side\n\nBut Cole also had two important personal experiences that helped open his eyes to the impact that serious diseases can have on people\u2019s lives. His father, John Cole, had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, he said \u2014 serious enough that the father was institutionalized in a veterans\u2019 nursing facility for the last 12 years of his life. And Cole\u2019s wife, Ellen, has multiple sclerosis, a disease she has struggled with for more than 20 years.\n\nCole insisted he hasn\u2019t let his family\u2019s experiences influence the amount of funding he is steering toward specific diseases, or medical research in general, as the House subcommittee chairman.\n\nWhen he brings up Alzheimer\u2019s, he mostly talks about it in pure dollar-and-cents terms. He\u2019s interested in how much health care spending will rise as retiring baby boomers develop the disease, and how much money the federal government could save if a cure can be found \u2014 arguments that sound remarkably similar to the ones used by the Alzheimer\u2019s advocates.\n\n\u201cI am cognizant of the fact that you can\u2019t allow the things that have touched you personally to drive your decision making,\u201d Cole said in an interview. \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s, to me, makes a lot of sense just from everything I know about entitlement spending and the baby boomers and the aging of America \u2014 the statistics are pretty clear.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also clear, though, that Cole\u2019s experiences have provided him with a more personal frame of reference for what people with serious diseases, and their caregivers, go through.\n\n\u201cWe ought to be doing this because it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Cole said of the proposed Alzheimer\u2019s increase. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve watched the human consequences of this disease inside my own family, what it did to my father, what it did to my mom as both a caregiver and then a spouse, what it did to the whole family.\u201d\n\nWhen a Texas woman wrote to him about her husband\u2019s diagnosis with the disease, he said, it was a sign that the extra Alzheimer\u2019s research money would be meaningful to people like her. \u201cThis woman was in an extraordinarily difficult moment of her life. I watched my mother go through that,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI understand what that means, when someone you love and spent your life with is now going to be taken away from you one day at a time, literally, as their personality is just stripped away, and their memories lost, and everything else.\u201d\n\nAnd even though Cole didn\u2019t propose an increase in research funding for multiple sclerosis, he acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s something that\u2019s obviously very personal to me.\u201d His wife has progressive MS, which, of the two major types, is the harder one to treat. It\u2019s the kind that doesn\u2019t have flareups \u2014 just a slow, steady deterioration.\n\nCole said he thinks that precision medicine \u2014 individualized therapies based on a patient\u2019s genetic profile \u2014 \u201cmay hold the key here. But again, I don\u2019t pretend to be an expert in MS. All I am is an expert in watching my wife deal with it. She\u2019s done that exceptionally well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very slow and gradual. I mean, she still can drive a car, but she can\u2019t walk any distance \u2014 she has to have a walker and things like that,\u201d Cole said. \u201cShe\u2019s gotten excellent care \u2026 but it\u2019s a hard disease. It\u2019s a very, very hard disease.\u201d\n\nCrash course in medical science\n\nThere have been other prominent Republicans who have called for an increase in NIH funding after more than a decade of backsliding, notably Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who helped launch the doubling of the agency\u2019s budget between 1998 and 2003. But Cole, as the subcommittee chairman, was in a unique position to do something about it.\n\nDuring his visit to NIH, Cole brought several of his House colleagues along. The group talked with Collins, the NIH director, about how NIH sets its priorities, distributes funds, and develops its strategic plan.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very modest fellow,\u201d Collins said of Cole, and, therefore, probably \u201cunderplayed the level of sophistication he might have already had. But he certainly acquired a lot more in a short time.\u201d\n\nCollins recalled that Cole was \u201cparticularly impressed and engaged\u201d during a visit to the NIH Vaccine Research Center, and especially during his discussion with Nancy Sullivan, the biodefense research section chief who had been working to develop an Ebola vaccine since the 1990s. The discussion was timely, since it came right after the height of the outbreak in Africa and the scare about the Dallas Ebola patient.\n\n\u201cHe asked a lot of great questions about that in terms of, how do you actually go about taking a scary disease like this and turning it into an effective vaccine? Everything from very basic immunology to how do you design clinical trials,\u201d Collins said.\n\nCole also developed an appreciation for the importance of federal medical research funding in conversations with Oklahoma medical researchers, and learned not to assume that private support would take care of all of their needs.\n\n\u201cHe has become a more forceful defender of the role of public funding than he was at the beginning,\u201d said Stephen Prescott, president of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. \u201cHe puts this legitimately in the category of an investment and not a cost.\u201d\n\nCole also had a close working relationship with his Senate counterpart, Roy Blunt of Missouri, a former House colleague who now heads that chamber\u2019s subcommittee on health funding.\n\nBlunt is also a big booster of NIH funding, and his version of the spending bill pushed for even more money than Cole\u2019s. But Cole has a tougher audience. House Republicans, to a greater extent than Senate Republicans, are perpetually at the mercy of combative Tea Party supporters who want to cut government spending, not increase it. That\u2019s the audience Cole and his allies will have to satisfy before the final spending bill can pass.\n\nClosing the sale\n\nCole acknowledged that the estimated savings if an effective Alzheimer\u2019s treatment can be found \u2014 $220 billion in the first five years, with 60 percent going to Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 is an argument he has to use with \u201cgreen-eyeshade Republicans.\u201d\n\nYet Cole says the Republicans on his subcommittee were actually easy to sell on a funding increase for NIH. It was the Democrats who took more convincing to back a big increase, Cole said \u2014 not because they didn\u2019t like the idea, but because they had so many other funding priorities that were competing with it.\n\n\u201cI remember talking to one of my Democratic colleagues [who] made the point that \u2018We have different priorities.\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, we don\u2019t have different priorities. We just have fewer priorities. To you guys, everything\u2019s a priority,\u2019\u201d Cole recalled.\n\nOne of the Democratic priorities, however, was a big one: funding to implement Obamacare, which Cole\u2019s original bill would have cut off. Cole is, after all, still a Republican, and his party is still fighting President Obama\u2019s health care law. That fight has to get resolved before Obama would sign the funding bill into law, and as of now, Democrats say, it still hasn\u2019t been resolved.\n\nCole saw medical research funding as a rare bipartisan goal that would allow Republicans and Democrats to get past those Obamacare battles, as well as the other fights over social issues that happen every year.\n\nStill, officials at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, the group he consulted on funding for that disease, said he wasn\u2019t immediately sold on an increase. He pushed for evidence that the medical science was far enough along to make good use of extra funds.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to know, from a science-driven perspective, if there were new resources, could they be used well?\u201d said Robert Egge, the association\u2019s chief public policy officer. It helped their case, he said, when NIH released a detailed proposal this summer that outlined the milestones that could be achieved with a $323 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s research.\n\n\u201cOn a cost-reward basis, is it worth it? Yeah, it really is,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI mean, if anything, we should be doing more than we proposed in our bill. But I think you\u2019ve got to build capacity over time and go at this step by step.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oklahoma Republican Tom Cole had little connection to health care policy before being appointed to lead a panel that funds medical research programs.", "og": {"site_name": "STAT", "description": "Oklahoma Republican Tom Cole had little connection to health care policy before being appointed to lead a panel that funds medical research programs.", "title": "How a top Republican became a champion for the NIH", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/TOMCOLE002-1024x576.jpg", "height": 576}, "updated_time": "2016-03-09T16:22:31-04:00", "url": "https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/11/tom-cole-nih-funding-alzheimers/", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "twitter": {"description": "Oklahoma Republican Tom Cole had little connection to health care policy before being appointed to lead a panel that funds medical research programs.", "creator": "@DavidNather", "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/TOMCOLE002-1024x576.jpg", "title": "How a top Republican became a champion for the NIH", "site": "@statnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 933808010032702, "pages": 1456948254627841}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/statnews/", "section": "Politics", "tag": "research", "published_time": "2015-12-11T09:00:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-09T16:22:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "alzheimer\u2019s, cdc, congress, funding, nih, research"}, "article_summary": "Blunt is also a big booster of NIH funding, and his version of the spending bill pushed for even more money than Cole\u2019s.\nThe group talked with Collins, the NIH director, about how NIH sets its priorities, distributes funds, and develops its strategic plan.\nDuring his visit to NIH, Cole brought several of his House colleagues along.\n\u201cWe ought to be doing this because it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Cole said of the proposed Alzheimer\u2019s increase.\nIt helped their case, he said, when NIH released a detailed proposal this summer that outlined the milestones that could be achieved with a $323 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s research."}
