But what are they? On the right, the influx of children from the region is said to be the predictable result of our allegedly lenient immigration policy; mass deportation, therefore, is supposedly the obvious solution. \u201c[I]mmediately deport these families, these children,\u201d demands Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador, R-Idaho, in \u201cplane loads,\u201d specifies Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Closer to the center, the causes of immigration from the region are typically said to be rising gang violence, the drug trade and the drug war and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 poverty.\n\nWith the exception of our immigration policy, it\u2019s obvious these factors are playing a major role in encouraging emigration from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. But if we are to speak of true \u201croot causes,\u201d we have to look deeper still: first, to the gross inequality from which these social maladies arise, and second, to the political forces that have maintained and enforced this economic status quo, decade after decade. The implications of Thomas Piketty\u2019s \u201cCapital\u201d for the developed world have been much discussed, but the meaning of inequality for poor countries is no less: The crisis of Central American immigration, I would argue, is a crisis of inequality, tragically manifested.\n\nClearly, inequality in Central America has been, to some degree, the brutal legacy of colonialism. Yet even today, the countries of Central America are among the most unequal not only in the hemisphere, but also on the globe: Honduras is the eighth most unequal country worldwide, and Guatemala isn\u2019t far behind. Income distribution aside, Central American nations are also the most impoverished in Latin America. Using a multidimensional index, the U.N. estimates that 79.9% of children in Guatemala, 78.9% in El Salvador and 63.1% in Honduras live in poverty (compared to 31.8% in Venezuela and 15.7% in Chile). In Honduras, rates of malnutrition reach 48.5% in rural areas, while almost half of Guatemalan children are moderately or severely stunted in growth. Superimposed on this poverty has been a devastating wave of gang violence. El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have some of the highest homicide rates in the world.\n\nBut why is the region so underdeveloped, why is poverty so entrenched, and why has the colonial legacy of inequality proven so resistant to social and political change? Though the situation is admittedly complex, the dismal state of affairs in Central America is in no small part the result of the failure of social democratic and left-of-center governments to maintain power and enact socioeconomic change; this failure, in turn, is sadly (in part) the consequence of the ironic \u201csuccess\u201d of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nConsider the case of Guatemala. As it did elsewhere, the legacy of the colonial and postcolonial era meant massive inequalities in land ownership in Guatemala, with large numbers of dispossessed peasants condemned to lives of severe poverty. This status quo was maintained in the 1930s and \u201940s by the U.S.-supported dictator Jorge Ubico, but it was challenged following his overthrow in 1944, particularly after the election of Jacobo \u00c1rbenz in 1951. \u201cAll the riches of Guatemala,\u201d \u00c1rbenz announced at his inauguration, \u201care not as important as the life, the freedom, the dignity, the health and the happiness of the most humble of its people.\u201d And he delivered: In seeking to take Guatemala out of feudalism, \u00c1rbenz redistributed lands of the United Fruit Company (with full compensation) to landless peasants.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly \u2013 in the context of the reductionist zero-sum politics of the Cold War \u2013 \u00c1rbenz was soon deemed a communist threat; however strong his democratic credentials and however nonexistent Soviet involvement might be, his days were numbered.\n\nIn Operation PBSUCCESS, the CIA achieved the overthrow of \u00c1rbenz by destabilizing the Guatemalan economy, engaging in various innovative forms of psychological warfare and ultimately orchestrating an invasion of the country from Honduras in 1954. Following his overthrow, a military dictatorship was installed, and variably supported, for decades. But this status quo could only be maintained with violence and authoritarianism; insurgency would follow, while inequality and social deprivation would remain largely untouched. The logic of support for \u201canticommunist\u201d dictatorship in Guatemala reached a bloody apex during the Reagan administration, when the U.S.-supported military regime went on an unprecedented killing spree. During the reign of General Rios Montt (called by Reagan \u201ca man of great personal integrity,\u201d though recently tried in Guatemala on charges of genocide), the military embarked on a \u201cscorched earth\u201d counterinsurgency operation. Some 100,000 Mayan peasants were murdered by the army between 1981 and 1983 alone, through unspeakable acts of brutality, torture and sexual violence. An international Truth Commission would later appropriately call this genocide.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If we want to understand the immigration crisis, we need to revisit Reagan and the violence we brought the region", "author": "Adam Gaffney", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If we want to understand the immigration crisis, we need to revisit Reagan and the violence we brought the region", "title": "Debunking the myths about immigration: Ronald Reagan, Central America and everything Ted Cruz doesn\u2019t understand", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/02/debunking_the_myths_about_immigration_ronald_reagan_central_america_and_everything_ted_cruz_doesnt_understand/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/reagan_north.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If we want to understand the immigration crisis, we need to revisit Reagan and the violence we brought the region", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/reagan_north.jpg", "title": "Debunking the myths about immigration: Ronald Reagan, Central America and everything Ted Cruz doesn\u2019t understand", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Debunking the myths about immigration: Ronald Reagan, Central America and everything Ted Cruz doesn\u2019t understand", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, capital, Central America, Costa rica, Crisis, Economics, Editor's Picks, Honduras, Immigration, Inequality, Nicaragua, Ronald Reagan, Thomas Piketty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ce8\"", "article_summary": "Clearly, inequality in Central America has been, to some degree, the brutal legacy of colonialism.\nWith the exception of our immigration policy, it\u2019s obvious these factors are playing a major role in encouraging emigration from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.\nTopics: Barack Obama, capital, Central America, Costa rica, Crisis, Economics, Editor's Picks, Honduras, Immigration, Inequality, Nicaragua, Ronald Reagan, Thomas Piketty, Business News, Politics NewsThere seems to be a general consensus that we should be addressing not only the symptoms, but also the \u201croot causes\u201d of rising emigration from Central America.\nIncome distribution aside, Central American nations are also the most impoverished in Latin America.\nEl Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have some of the highest homicide rates in the world."}
