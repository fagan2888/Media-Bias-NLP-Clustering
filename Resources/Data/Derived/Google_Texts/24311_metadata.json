As long as the Federal Reserve keeps pumping money into the financial system via this form of quantitative easing, the thinking goes, there\u2019s a greater risk of inflation, or at least a weaker dollar. Either might make gold a great investment.\n\nIf you\u2019re skeptical about the odds of inflation taking hold in an economy so sluggish that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke doesn\u2019t want to risk drawing down support for the long-term fixed income market, there\u2019s another argument to throw into the mix: the ultra-low interest rates made possible by the quantitative easing make gold, which doesn\u2019t generate any kind of a yield and in fact costs money to own, a more appealing investment.\n\nOn top of that, there\u2019s the uncertainty argument: At times when the political or economic outlook is unpredictable, gold is still seen as a safe haven. Look around. The Fed certainly has been sending some muddled signals with respect to its intentions; the economy can\u2019t seem to decide whether it\u2019s growing at a muted but sustainable way or on the verge of slowing down again; and as for Congress, well, the less said the better. Uncertainty seems to be an understatement.\n\nNot enough reasons to own gold? There\u2019s the granddaddy of them all to consider, a factor that had already helped propel gold higher in the days and weeks leading up the Fed\u2019s announcement of its non-action. That is the possibility of the conflict in Syria broadening thanks to allegations that the Assad government used chemical weapons in its battle against rebel forces. The last-minute U.S.-Russia deal in which Syria agreed to destroy its existing chemical weapons may have averted a real crisis for now, but I, for one, wouldn\u2019t be against a resurgence in geopolitical tensions for one reason or another between now and the end of the year.\n\nThat said, I wouldn\u2019t bet on gold\u2019s rally taking it back to record levels any time soon, either. And it\u2019s hard to recommend chasing gold prices higher when a combination of short-covering and speculation in response to an unexpected turn of events is what\u2019s caused the buying. But the odds are that unless Bernanke is drastically misreading the state of the U.S. economy, and that it is in a far more dire state than even he believes, gold prices may linger in their current range for a few months, and perhaps have a few more big leaps as the wrangling over the debt ceiling intensifies in Congress.\n\nTo be a long-term gold bull \u2013 or a dedicated gold bug, one of that breed that is convinced that the only possible answer to any investment question is, \u201cbuy gold!\u201d \u2013 you\u2019d need to feel certain that the economy is likely to slip back into a recession, that we\u2019re on the verge of another financial crisis, or that the political and geopolitical crises will become more severe. That\u2019s a minority position.\n\nOf course, as this week\u2019s speculation surrounding the Fed\u2019s likely course of action shows, sometimes the minority view turns out to be the right one. But in this case, a lot would have to happen for gold to embark on another multi-year bull run, and the risk you\u2019d be taking might outweigh your possible return. After all, Bernanke and his fellow policymakers didn\u2019t rule out tapering; they simply postponed their decision until the data was more supportive.\n\nAwaiting that day, gold is likely to prove a volatile investment. The move up in the 24 hours following the Fed\u2019s announcement was dramatic, but that was, in part, because the news was so unexpected. Absent more high profile drama, look for gold prices to generally drift lower and spike higher only on specific headlines that will make investors feel like dashing for shelter.\n\nAbove all, you may want to steer clear of gold mining stocks. While the precious metal was glittering, many spent heavily to expand their output, only to find that, as prices turned south after peaking in 2011, they can\u2019t earn enough from their production to cover their expenses. In the much longer term, this may represent an investment opportunity, to the extent that the decision by the likes of Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) to cut back on exploration activities today may lead to a supply shortage down the road.
