More than 460,000 people signed up for health insurance on the federal government\u2019s website during the first week of open enrollment, officials said Wednesday. And there were no outages or other technical glitches.\n\nMore than 3 million people visited Healthcare.gov during that first week, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told reporters. \u201cWe have seen more than one million people speak with one of our call center representatives,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re off to a solid start.\u201d\n\nAbout half of those signing up so far are renewals, Burwell said. Open enrollment \u2014 the time when people can sign up for health insurance or change their policies \u2014 runs through Feb. 15.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re off to a solid start.\u201d\n\nThis time last year the site, open for the first time ever, was barely creeping along. It crashed on the first day. The government ended up having to widen the enrollment window until it extended into April. In the end, just under 7 million people enrolled in private health insurance offered on the website.\n\nThe health exchanges are a centerpiece of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. They are meant to be a mechanism for getting more Americans covered by health insurance and in turn, getting regular medical care. This year, 37 states use the federal exchange. The others are operating their own.\n\nThe disastrous rollout of the federal exchange, and many of the state exchanges also, turned into a political crisis for the Obama administration. HHS ended up firing the main vendor who put together the site and a whole new team is in charge of the revamped rollout, from the secretary \u2014 Burwell has replaced Kathleen Sebelius \u2014 to the new role of exchange chief executive. Kevin Counihan, who headed up Connecticut\u2019s successful health insurance exchange, is CEO of Healthcare.gov.\n\nHHS says this time around about 25 percent more private insurance companies are offering policies. Because insurance is regulated by the states, each state has different offerings and policies usually vary county by county within a state.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Obamacare enrollment mistake 0:46 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nMore than a million people have submitted applications for policies, HHS says. The federal government expects about 9 million people to sign up for health insurance on the new online exchanges this year \u2014 four million fewer than projected by the Congressional Budget Office just this spring.\n\n\"Every day we are making progress,\" Burwell said.\n\nBut the law\u2019s already started to have its intended effect. HHS says 32 million Americans now lack health insurance, about a quarter fewer than this time last year. The percentage of the population lacking health insurance plummeted from an all-time high of 18 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 15.6 percent at the start of this year.\n\n\"Every day we are making progress.\"\n\nThe law\u2019s changes are getting people covered not only by helping them buy insurance on the exchanges \u2014often with hefty federal subsidies \u2014 but with the expansion of Medicaid in 27 states plus Washington, D.C. Governors of 21 states have said they\u2019re definitely not expanding Medicaid, while Indiana and Utah are debating it.\n\nIn addition, it requires big employers to offer health insurance, and prevents health insurers from dumping patients because they\u2019re sick or have used up too many benefits.\n\nRepublicans have pledged to repeal the law, although most experts say they really cannot, even with new GOP control of the Senate after the midterm elections.\n\nEvery day we\u2019re making progress. These #\u2019s provide point-in-time-estimates as we continue the work. #GetCovered \u2014 Sylvia Burwell (@SecBurwell) November 26, 2014", "article_metadata": {"description": "What a difference a year makes.
