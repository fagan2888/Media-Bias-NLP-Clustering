They got testy with each other, shouted a lot, and Cunningham ended up shouting, \u201cKnow your role and shut your mouth!\u201d Both of them returned to Sean Hannity\u2018s desk tonight, and Holder tried to smooth things over with a peace offering of \u201chappy candy.\u201d Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work out so well and they ended up fighting again.\n\nReacting to their last joint appearance, Holder asked Cunningham to apologize to her, saying \u201cWe owe it to the viewers to talk about the issues ant not be so angry.\u201d That stuck for all of about one minute, when Cunningham declared \u201cthis woman has lost her mind!\u201d in response to her defense of President Obama over perceived hypocrisy on the debt limit.\n\nHolder shot back, asking \u201cAre you talking to me like I\u2019m an alien?\u201d followed by \u201cWhat do I look like?\u201d Cunningham answered, \u201cA Farrah Fawcett wannabe.\u201d This derailed the conversation yet again, with Holder lamenting to Hannity, \u201cThis is the problem with your show!\u201d\n\nThey kept going, with Cunningham and Hannity arguing that Obama\u2019s a blatant hypocrite for railing against the debt limit under George W. Bush. Cunningham called Holder \u201cinsane\u201d and amped up his tone, leading Holder to cry, \u201cGet your finger out of my face!\u201d\n\nAfter quite a bit of crosstalk over the gigantic debt, Cunningham shouted, \u201cPeople like you are helping to destroy this country fiscally, grow up!\u201d Holder shot back, \u201cAll you do is call names, that\u2019s it!\u201d\n\nWatch the reunion below, via Fox News:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the original segment that set all this off in the first place:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tamara Holder and Bill Cunningham faced off on Sean Hannity's show again, and even with Holder's piece offering of \"happy candy,\" it got heated quickly.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Capture24.jpg", "title": "Holder and Cunningham Blow Up: \u2018Farrah Fawcett Wannabe!\u2019 \u2018Get Your Finger Out of My Face!\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "The last time Tamara Holder and Bill Cunningham faced off on Hannity, well, it didn't go so well.
