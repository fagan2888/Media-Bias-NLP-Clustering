They threaded ropes through the holes to con\u00adnect the wo\u00admen to\u00adgeth\u00ader in a long line, and made them march ahead of the Mon\u00adgol sol\u00addiers as a hu\u00adman shield, lead\u00ading in\u00adto Ja\u00adpan\u2019s fort\u00adresses.\n\nThis is said to have taken place in the late 13th cen\u00adtury. But the ter\u00adrible story of hu\u00adman shields doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nThere are new re\u00adports this week that the As\u00adsad re\u00adgime in Syr\u00adia is mov\u00ading troops in\u00adto ci\u00advil\u00adian areas ahead of a pos\u00adsible U.S. mis\u00adsile strike, and pos\u00adsibly pla\u00adcing pris\u00adon\u00aders in mil\u00adit\u00adary sites. It\u2019s the kind of jaw-drop\u00adping mil\u00adit\u00adary tac\u00adtic that is typ\u00adic\u00adally scorned by the in\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtion\u00adal com\u00admunity, and ex\u00adpli\u00adcitly banned by the Fourth Geneva Con\u00adven\u00adtion (of which Syr\u00adia is a party). It\u2019s also the kind of tac\u00adtic that, if used dur\u00ading a pos\u00adsible U.S. strike, has the po\u00adten\u00adtial to com\u00adpletely de\u00adter and de\u00adgrade the Obama ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion\u2019s plans for quick, re\u00adl\u00adat\u00adively pain\u00adless, and lim\u00adited ac\u00adtion.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard of the Syr\u00adi\u00adan re\u00adgime pos\u00adsibly us\u00ading hu\u00adman shields. The U.N. an\u00adnu\u00adal re\u00adport on Chil\u00addren and Armed Con\u00adflict re\u00adleased in June 2012 in\u00adcluded the Syr\u00adi\u00adan armed forces on the list of parties that re\u00adcruit, use, or ab\u00aduse chil\u00addren in armed con\u00adflict. The re\u00adport spe\u00adcific\u00adally ac\u00adcused Syr\u00adi\u00adan troops of us\u00ading chil\u00addren as young as 8 as hu\u00adman shields dur\u00ading raids. In March, based on wit\u00adness re\u00adports, Hu\u00adman Rights Watch ac\u00adcused the Syr\u00adi\u00adan gov\u00adern\u00adment of hav\u00ading \u201cen\u00addangered loc\u00adal res\u00adid\u00adents by for\u00adcing them to march in front of the army dur\u00ading re\u00adcent ar\u00adrest op\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtions, troop move\u00adments, and at\u00adtacks on towns and vil\u00adlages in north\u00adern Syr\u00adia.\u201d\n\nAmong tyr\u00adan\u00adnic\u00adal re\u00adgimes, the use of hu\u00adman shields has an in\u00adfam\u00adous re\u00adcent his\u00adtory. NATO wor\u00adried that forces loy\u00adal to Libya\u2019s Muam\u00admar el-Qad\u00addafi were us\u00ading ci\u00advil\u00adians to pro\u00adtect them\u00adselves in April 2011. Liby\u00adan rebels claimed that Au\u00adgust that the gov\u00adern\u00adment was us\u00ading hu\u00adman shields in Qad\u00addafi\u2019s birth\u00adplace of Sirte.\n\nBut per\u00adhaps the most no\u00adtori\u00adous re\u00adcent pro\u00adponent of hu\u00adman shields was Ir\u00adaq\u2019s Sad\u00addam Hus\u00adsein. Hus\u00adsein used \u201cthou\u00adsands of for\u00adeign and Ir\u00adaqi ci\u00advil\u00adians as hu\u00adman shields in bids to ma\u00adnip\u00adu\u00adlate do\u00admest\u00adic and in\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtion\u00adal opin\u00adion and de\u00adter mil\u00adit\u00adary ac\u00adtion against his re\u00adgime\u201d when he was in con\u00adflict with the West, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to a Janu\u00adary 2003 CIA re\u00adport. The CIA al\u00adleges that in 1990, Hus\u00adsein \u201cheld more than 800 West\u00adern, Ja\u00adpan\u00adese, and Kuwaiti na\u00adtion\u00adals\u201d in Ir\u00adaq and Kuwait to de\u00adfend his re\u00adgime from an at\u00adtack to end its in\u00adva\u00adsion of Kuwait. In 1997, Hus\u00adsein \u201cen\u00adticed or co\u00aderced\u201d thou\u00adsands of Ir\u00adaqi ci\u00advil\u00adians to act as vol\u00adun\u00adtary hu\u00adman shields to ward against an at\u00adtack after Ir\u00adaq re\u00adfused to let U.N. in\u00adspect\u00adors in\u00adto some sites. Ir\u00adaqi men, wo\u00admen, and chil\u00addren served as hu\u00adman shields at roughly 80 palaces and fa\u00adcil\u00adit\u00adies dur\u00ading the crisis.\n\nThe CIA re\u00adport was re\u00adleased at a sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adant time, just months ahead of \u201cshock and awe\u201d and the be\u00adgin\u00adning of Amer\u00adica\u2019s war with Ir\u00adaq. For his part, Pres\u00adid\u00adent Bush warned in a Feb\u00adru\u00adary 2003 speech that Hus\u00adsein \u201cre\u00adgards the Ir\u00adaqi people as hu\u00adman shields.\u201d The CIA re\u00adport ex\u00adpressed con\u00adcern that the Ir\u00adaqi re\u00adgime was again pre\u00adpar\u00ading to use hu\u00adman shields ahead of a co\u00adali\u00adtion strike, and was act\u00adively court\u00ading vo\u00adlun\u00adteers from in\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtion\u00adal an\u00adti\u00adwar groups.\n\nThose vo\u00adlun\u00adteers, in\u00adclud\u00ading Amer\u00adic\u00adan and Brit\u00adish act\u00adiv\u00adists, showed up and were wel\u00adcomed with open arms. They stayed in cushy Bagh\u00addad ho\u00adtels, and it was \u201cal\u00admost like be\u00ading on hol\u00adi\u00adday,\u201d one of the act\u00adiv\u00adists said in a March 2013 BBC in\u00adter\u00adview. To their chag\u00adrin, the act\u00adiv\u00adists wound up be\u00ading moved by an Ir\u00adaqi li\u00adais\u00adon to in\u00adfra\u00adstruc\u00adture sites, not big ci\u00advil\u00adian areas. By the time the bomb\u00adings oc\u00adcurred, there were between 25 and 100 hu\u00adman-shield act\u00adiv\u00adists in the coun\u00adtry, and none of the sites they were pro\u00adtect\u00ading were hit.\n\nNow act\u00adiv\u00adists have ar\u00adrived in Syr\u00adia, too. Ac\u00adcord\u00ading to Ir\u00adan\u2019s PressTV and Rus\u00adsia\u2019s RT, Syr\u00adi\u00adans call\u00ading them\u00adselves a hu\u00adman shield have crowded around some mil\u00adit\u00adary build\u00adings in the coun\u00adtry. \u201cI\u2019m a nor\u00admal cit\u00adizen, I\u2019m not a gov\u00adern\u00adment em\u00adploy\u00adee, and I do not do any\u00adthing in the gov\u00adern\u00adment,\u201d a wo\u00adman says in an in\u00adter\u00adview with PressTV. \u201cWhen I heard about this cam\u00adpaign, I came with my fam\u00adily.\u201d\n\nAn\u00adti\u00adwar pro\u00adtest\u00aders with du\u00adbi\u00adous back\u00ading and re\u00adports of re\u00adgime use of hu\u00adman shields didn\u2019t work to halt a U.S. at\u00adtack on Ir\u00adaq in 2003. With a po\u00adten\u00adtial hu\u00adman-shield crisis on our hands again, we\u2019ll soon see if a pos\u00adsible ci\u00advil\u00adian dis\u00adaster can be avoided.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "The possible use of human shields in Syria has a long precedent in some miserable history.", "title": "The Terrible History of Human Shields", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/71380/terrible-history-human-shields", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2013/09/04/AP24780878130.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"site": "@nationaljournal", "image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2013/09/04/AP24780878130.jpg"}, "description": "The possible use of human shields in Syria has a long precedent in some miserable history.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Terrible History of Human Shields"}, "description": "The possible use of human shields in Syria has a long precedent in some miserable history.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But the ter\u00adrible story of hu\u00adman shields doesn\u2019t end there.\nLiby\u00adan rebels claimed that Au\u00adgust that the gov\u00adern\u00adment was us\u00ading hu\u00adman shields in Qad\u00addafi\u2019s birth\u00adplace of Sirte.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard of the Syr\u00adi\u00adan re\u00adgime pos\u00adsibly us\u00ading hu\u00adman shields.\nIr\u00adaqi men, wo\u00admen, and chil\u00addren served as hu\u00adman shields at roughly 80 palaces and fa\u00adcil\u00adit\u00adies dur\u00ading the crisis.\nThe re\u00adport spe\u00adcific\u00adally ac\u00adcused Syr\u00adi\u00adan troops of us\u00ading chil\u00addren as young as 8 as hu\u00adman shields dur\u00ading raids."}
