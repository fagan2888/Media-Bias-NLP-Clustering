(WOOD) \u2014 The shift to electronic medical records has some experts questioning the security of the new systems.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act \u2014 also known as Obamacare \u2014 provides incentives to shift medical records from paper to electronic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013, \u201c78% of office-based physicians used any type of electronic health record (EHR) system, up from 18% in 2001.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 study, the Ponemon Institute \u2014 a Michigan-based research center dedicated to privacy, data protection and information security policy \u2014 surveyed 80 health care organizations and found that 94 percent reported having at least one data breach in the past two years, while the average number of breaches was four.\n\nThe study estimated that the average data breach compromised nearly 3,000 records and that the average economic impact of a breach is $2.4 million.\n\nThe study cited the top three causes of a breach as lost or stolen computing devices, employee mistakes and \u201cthird party snafus.\u201d\n\nThat was the case in Indiana. There, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office for Civil Rights settled with Cancer Care Group, P.C., a radiation oncology group, for $750,000 to \u201csettle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).\u201d\n\nA press release from HHS said that \u201cnames, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, insurance information and clinical information of approximately 55,000 current and former Cancer Care patients\u201d were compromised after a laptop was stolen from an employee\u2019s car.\n\nThere are other ways that personal health information can be compromised, unintentionally.\n\n\u201cJust think of all the different places where your health care information may eventually end up. It\u2019s not secure. You should assume that at this point,\u201d said Jim VanderMey.\n\nThe innovation officer for Open Systems Technology, VanderMey has been studying health care and its technology for about 30 years.\n\n\u201cThe information is spread across so many places and people,\u201d he said. \u201cYour providers, your pharmacist, the website you posted your information to, your Facebook updates, your family members who are asking them to pray for them at church.\u201d\n\nVanderMey also pointed out that people not only provide their information in many places, but that people also access it from many different places, like computers, cellphones and tablets.\n\nThe Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology quoted information saying that 85 percent of U.S. adults have a cellphone, one fifth of all smartphone users have downloaded a health app and half of smartphone users \u201cseek health information from their mobile devices.\u201d\n\nVanderMey pointed to the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology\u2019s website, healthit.gov, for tips on how to keep your information as safe as possible. They include creating a strong password and updating it often, not sharing your password with anyone, and thinking before you post about health issues on social media.\n\nVanderMey said the nature of health information \u2014 that it has to be accessible to many different people \u2014 means it likely can\u2019t be 100 percent secure.\n\n\u201cWe have this tension in our society about wanting doctors to know everything about us, wanting to know everything about us to provide care, but then having this tension with privacy as well,\u201d VanderMey said.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nOnline:\n\nHow to keep your health information private and secure (PDF)\n\nWhat you can do to protect your health information (PDF)", "article_metadata": {"description": "A study by a health care technology security company shows online health information is never completely safe.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=380703612", "og": {"site_name": "NBC4i.com", "description": "A study by a health care technology security company shows online health information is never completely safe.", "title": "How secure are your electronic medical records?", "url": "http://nbc4i.com/2015/09/03/how-secure-are-your-electronic-medical-records/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/medical_records.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A study by a health care technology security company shows online health information is never completely safe.", "title": "How secure are your electronic medical records?", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/medical_records.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@nbc4i", "site": "nbc4i", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "National, News, Top Videos", "msapplication-tooltip": "Columbus, Ohio News, Weather and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_09ba3f0df1447f40e98674ba9d62c747", "fb": {"pages": 38342932750}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nbc4i.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6f1d97944cdcea2214c0f42e5738057f?s=16", "application-name": "NBC4i.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NBC4Columbus", "published_time": "2015-09-03T09:12:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-03T09:12:50+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "Y7Un57nax7y1Nq_Ap5-4MFnKkuvSsOsEzQ67vpVKTFQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca40b\"", "article_summary": "\u2014\u2013Online:How to keep your health information private and secure (PDF)What you can do to protect your health information (PDF)\nGRAND RAPIDS, Mich.
