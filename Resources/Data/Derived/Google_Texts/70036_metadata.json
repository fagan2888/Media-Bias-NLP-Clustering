Car companies are eager to get involved, and we spoke with the man who quit Deutsche Bank to set up the first Iranian private-equity firm that's able to take foreign investment.\n\nRelated: How Iran Is Taking Over the Middle East\n\nPart of the anticipation is due to Iran's massive fossil-fuel reserves. Beyond that, however, Iran is also a middle-income country with a huge potential that has been (deliberately) restrained by sanctions. Before the Islamic Revolution in 1979, the country had a thriving middle class with a taste for Western fashions and consumerism.\n\nOn top of that, it's the most literate nation in the region, a largely urbanised country where 60% of the population is under 30. The potential for an economic upswing when the sanctions are lifted is pretty clear.\n\nIn many respects, there is no direct comparator for Iran, given its economic size, the scale of the sanctions imposed and its political structure. In particular, the potential reintegration of Iran into the global economy is arguably uncharted territory in that there is no other hydrocarbon frontier economy that has been subjected to comparable economic and political sanctions.\n\nIn the next few years, there are some pretty rapid growth forecasts for Iran \u2014 the World Bank expects gross-domestic-product growth to rise to 6.7% in 2017, largely on the back of increased production of oil and natural gas.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Busiess Insider.
