But it doesn\u2019t have to. And there is a real argument that if there is any possibility that the Treasury might be unable to pay the nation\u2019s bills by mid-March or sooner, it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nOn Monday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew once again warned Congress that it needs to act quickly to raise the country\u2019s borrowing limit or risk a catastrophic default \u2013 but he\u2019s not discussing publicly the option that could buy him extra time, though it would almost certainly create an epic political firestorm.\n\nRelated: Business Groups Warn GOP to Drop Debt Ceiling Battle\n\nA little-understood fact about the tax code is that there is no statutory requirement that the Treasury pay out tax refunds by a specific date. The tax code\u2019s only deadline related to refunds relates to interest payments. It requires that if the government holds off paying refunds until 45 days after the filing deadline, it must start paying interest on the money from that day forward. That means that Treasury is under no legal obligation to pay out tax refunds before May 31 \u2013 and even that isn\u2019t a deadline, but simply when interest starts to accrue.\n\nIn practice, Treasury has made a point of sending tax refund payments out pretty quickly. Many checks and electronic funds transfers go out within days of a return being filed. This is good politics, because nobody likes the idea of the government holding onto money it owes taxpayers. And it\u2019s good economics, as the refunds are a potent economic stimulus. But it may be bad fiscal management for a Treasury Secretary concerned about imminent default.\n\nIn remarks delivered at the Bipartisan Policy Center on Monday morning, Lew reminded the audience that the federal debt limit has been suspended through February 7, after which Treasury will be unable to borrow any more money. By deferring certain payments and taking other so-called \u201cextraordinary measures,\u201d Lew estimated that the Treasury will be able to continue meeting the country\u2019s obligations for at least a few more weeks.\n\nBut after that, he said \u201cwe will be left with only the cash we have on hand and any incoming revenues to meet our country\u2019s commitments. Notably, we expect our outlays over the coming weeks to exceed our net inflows\u2014largely due to the payment of tax refunds\u2014so we will draw down our cash balance faster than at other times of the year. Without borrowing authority, at some point very soon, it would not be possible to meet all of the obligations of the federal government.\u201d\n\nRelated: Did Debt Ceiling Fever Break, or Go Into Remission?\n\nSo, why would Lew make all those tax payments if he doesn\u2019t have to?\n\nThink of it this way: Nobody would pay their electric bill three months in advance if it meant defaulting on their mortgage this month. Secretary Lew may find himself in a similar position if the debt limit is not raised soon. If Congress were to take the country to the brink of disaster once again and miscalculate on the timing of a final deal \u2013 as President Obama publicly fretted during the debt limit crisis of 2011 \u2013 Treasury might find itself unable to make a required payment, placing the country in default.\n\nWere that to happen, Lew could face some very difficult questions. Among them: Why did you pay out tax refunds months before you had to, leaving no money to pay obligations coming due much sooner?\n\nThe amount of money involved is not trivial. In a letter to House Speaker John Boehner on January 22, Lew pointed out that because of tax refund payments, Treasury\u2019s outlays in February 2013 were $230 billion, compared to an average $45 billion for the other months of the year.\n\nRelated: Mitch McConnell Hints at Another Debt Ceiling Showdown\n\nLew was asked on CNBC last month whether Treasury had considered delaying refund payments to protect the country against possible default, and dodged the question, saying only that the Treasury had never taken that action in the past.\n\n\u201cThat's something we've never -- we have not done,\u201d he told host Becky Quick, without actually addressing whether it was an option being considered.\n\nTo be sure, delaying tax refund payments would be a monumentally hard sell politically. Many taxpayers count on those payments, using them as a sort of forced-savings account and plan major expenditures around them. Republicans would, no doubt, pounce on such a move.\n\nExperts also warn that, short of shutting down the entire tax return-processing system, it might be logistically impossible to stop refund payments from going out. Treasury\u2019s computer systems are designed to process many payments automatically, especially for electronically-filed tax returns.\n\nBut if the choice Lew faces is between making default even a little less likely at the cost of political fallout, and being accused of failing in his fiduciary duty to the United States, it may be no choice at all.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Treasury Department isn\u2019t obligated to pay out tax refunds until 45 days after the filing deadline \u2013 and Secretary Jack Lew may have an obligation to hang on to that money.", "title": "Debt Ceiling Drama: Will You Get Your Tax Refund on Time?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/04/Debt-Ceiling-Drama-Will-You-Get-Your-Tax-Refund-Time", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04152010_spend_taxes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/04/Debt-Ceiling-Drama-Will-You-Get-Your-Tax-Refund-Time", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04152010_spend_taxes_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Treasury Department isn\u2019t obligated to pay out tax refunds until 45 days after the filing deadline \u2013 and Secretary Jack Lew may have an obligation to hang on to that money.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd831d\"", "article_summary": "To be sure, delaying tax refund payments would be a monumentally hard sell politically.\nRelated: Business Groups Warn GOP to Drop Debt Ceiling BattleA little-understood fact about the tax code is that there is no statutory requirement that the Treasury pay out tax refunds by a specific date.\nIn practice, Treasury has made a point of sending tax refund payments out pretty quickly.\nThis month, the Internal Revenue Service will start sending out income tax refunds totaling hundreds of billions of dollars.\nExperts also warn that, short of shutting down the entire tax return-processing system, it might be logistically impossible to stop refund payments from going out."}
