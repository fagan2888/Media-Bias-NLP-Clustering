Marijuana plants were discovered growing in a Far East Dallas home during a house fire on Sunday afternoon, fire officials said. A dog was killed and a firefighter suffered a minor burn in the blaze.

Dallas Fire-Rescue and Dallas police narcotics detectives were called to the 9900 block of Carnegie Drive, near Peavy Road, about 2:50 p.m. Smoke was coming from the eaves of a one-story house.

No people were at home at the time of the fire. Two dogs were in the house, and one died. A firefighter also had a minor burn injury, but was treated at the scene and continued working, Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans said.

The fire was extinguished in about 30 minutes and the majority of fire damage was contained to the attic, but Evans said there was smoke damage throughout the house.

Investigators determined the fire started from an unspecified electrical short in the attic, above the garage.

Evans said it appeared that the homeâ€™s circuits were overloaded by multiple power inverters that were being used to run growing lights and a ventilation system for the marijuana plants.

The plants were turned over to law enforcement, he said.

A Dallas police spokeswoman said she was not aware of any arrests late Sunday.
