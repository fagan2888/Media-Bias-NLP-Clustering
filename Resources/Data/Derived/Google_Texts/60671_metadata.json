His actions represent a blatant case of overreach and clear abuse of power.\u201d\n\nSome states \u2014 12 in addition to Washington, D.C., to be precise \u2014 have alternatively expressed their support of Obama\u2019s executive action by filing an amicus brief. A group of 30 mayors have done the same.\n\nHowever, the president certainly does not have the support of the Republican-led Congress on the issue. In fact, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told GOP members of the House Tuesday that the government body will also pursue a lawsuit against Obama over his immigration action, as reports CNN.\n\n\u201cWe are finalizing a plan to authorize litigation on this issue \u2014 one we believe gives us the best chance of success,\u201d he reportedly said, according to a source.\n\nThis comes just months after the House filed a suit against the president over his executive action on Obamacare, which was itself seen by many as the House GOP\u2019s response to Obama\u2019s immigration announcement in November.\n\nThe 26 states that have joined in the immigration lawsuit are as follows: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "A grand total of 26 states have joined a lawsuit led by Texas against Obama for the executive action he announced last November, according to the Huffington Post.", "title": "26 states suing Obama over immigration executive action as Boehner...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/08/Obama-unhappy-August-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/01/27/26-states-suing-obama-immigration-executive-action-boehner-plans-legal-action/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "states-lawsuit-obama-immigration", "published_time": "2015-01-27T14:31:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-27T14:31:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "It appears the majority of states believe President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration to be illegal.\nA grand total of 26 states have joined a lawsuit led by Texas against Obama for the executive action he announced last November, according to the Huffington Post.\n\u201cAs President Obama himself has said numerous times, he lacks the authority to impose amnesty.\nIn fact, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told GOP members of the House Tuesday that the government body will also pursue a lawsuit against Obama over his immigration action, as reports CNN.\nThis comes just months after the House filed a suit against the president over his executive action on Obamacare, which was itself seen by many as the House GOP\u2019s response to Obama\u2019s immigration announcement in November."}
