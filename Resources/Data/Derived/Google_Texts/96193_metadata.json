He\u2019s pressuring me. What should I do?\n\nA: Don\u2019t sign anything until you check on what\u2019s being offered on the Obamacare public exchanges, which opened for business in every state and the District of Columbia last week and will continue enrolling members until March 31 of next year.\n\nWith several exchanges off to rocky starts due to computer breakdowns and overwhelming traffic, some agents may see an opportunity to take advantage of the confusion surrounding Obamacare before exchange staffers are readily available to answer your questions. Your agent may be pressuring you to renew your individual health plan because he knows two things you ought to know\u2014and may eventually learn on your exchange.\n\nFirst, some rival plans on your state exchange may be better than what you have now. All \u201cqualified\u201d Obamacare health plans offer extensive benefits, including maternity, prescriptions, mental health treatment and more.\n\nGenerally, subsidized exchange plans are at least as good as many company-sponsored plans and far superior to virtually all individual plans on the market today.\n\nSecond, you and your family may qualify for sizable federal subsidies to help you pay for an exchange plan\u2019s premiums. Experts estimate that about 80 percent of individuals who buy their own health insurance on the exchange will qualify for subsidies\u2014including individuals making up to $47,000 and families of four earning up to $94,000 a year.\n\nHere are three falsehoods you may hear in the coming weeks as Obamacare is rolled out on your state\u2019s exchange:\n\nYou must renew your health plan with us right away. While insurers and companies can set their own deadlines for enrolling in their plans, you have until March 31 to enroll in an Obamacare plan for 2014 on your state exchange. That should give you plenty of time to compare insurance policies and make an informed choice.\n\nYour premium is going to skyrocket. Most of the scary stories about premiums skyrocketing under Obamacare are quoting prices before subsidies. And those federal subsidies are massive. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that, on average, subsidies will slash monthly premiums by 67 percent.\n\nThe subsidies can amount to around a thousand of dollars or more a month, according to Families USA, a leading consumer advocacy organization. It will be possible, for example, for a family of four earning $40,000 and paying $1,000 a month today to see their premiums cut to around $165 after subsidies. Contact your exchange through HealthCare.gov or call the Health Insurance Marketplace at 800-318-2596 and find out if you\u2019re eligible for subsidies, or perhaps qualify for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program for your children under 19.\n\nYou can trust what I say because I\u2019m from a big-name insurance company. Generally, you can, but not always. For example, the Kentucky Department of Insurance recently fined giant Humana for \u201cmisleading\u201d 6,500 existing customers with a marketing letter that failed to mention that some of them might be eligible for subsidies to buy rival insurance on the exchanges.\n\nKentucky\u2019s insurance commissioner Sharon P. Clark told the Wall Street Journal: \u201cThis letter was preying on people\u2019s lack of knowledge about their consumer protections, their rights.\u201d\n\nAnd in another example, Arizona\u2019s Department of Insurance recently rejected one of Aetna\u2019s advertising brochures touting a \u201cone-time opportunity\u201d for savings with an Aetna plan. The ad read: \u201cHealth Care Reform is here.
