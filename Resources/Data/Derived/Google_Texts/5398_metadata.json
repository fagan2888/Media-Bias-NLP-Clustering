We dubbed these bogus messages \u201cmis-tweets.\u201d We also regularly use Twitter to spread our own findings about false or misleading political claims, as do other journalistic fact-checkers.\n\nNow a study by political scientist Andrew Guess of Columbia University finds that \u201ctweets correcting falsehoods or pointing to a correction are completely swamped by tweets making or repeating the [false] claim.\u201d\n\nObamacare: Guess analyzed tweets about a false claim that 2 million Americans would \u201close their jobs\u201d because of Obamacare. He found that 93 percent of the tweets endorsed the bogus claim, while only 7 percent attempted to correct it during the first three months of 2014, a ratio of 13 to 1.\n\nGuess analyzed tweets about a false claim that 2 million Americans would \u201close their jobs\u201d because of Obamacare. He found that 93 percent of the tweets endorsed the bogus claim, while only 7 percent attempted to correct it during the first three months of 2014, a ratio of 13 to 1. Ebola: He also looked at tweets about a false claim that the Ebola virus could be spread by a cough or a sneeze. And during September, October and November 2014, he found that \u201c[t]weets making the claim outnumbered tweets with corrective information by more then 2.7 to 1.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Guess also found that the relative share of corrective tweets increases as these social-media \u201cfrenzies\u201d eventually fizzle. \u201cThe role of fact checkers in this process is clear: they provide much of the source material with which Twitter users confront mistaken beliefs,\u201d he wrote. \u201c[T]he messages they promote appear to help make debate on the platform more accurate.\u201d\n\nConfidently Wrong\n\nAnother study documented that many Americans not only believe things that aren\u2019t true, but are \u201cvery confident\u201d that their false notions are correct.\n\nEmily Thorson, an assistant professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, used a combination of survey data and personal interviews to probe several commonly held but incorrect perceptions. What she found:\n\nU.S. Debt: Over 68 percent of those surveyed believed \u2014 wrongly \u2014 that China holds the majority of the U.S. government\u2019s debt, and 29 percent said they were \u201cvery confident\u201d that this false belief was correct. But any way you measure it, China has never held close to half the debt.\n\nAs of the most recent report by the Treasury Department, China held just over $1.2 trillion in U.S. debt at the end of February, which was only 9.4 percent of all U.S. debt held by the public on that date.\n\nThe fraction is even smaller when measured as a portion of total debt, including money the government owes to itself. That fraction is under 7 percent now, down from 8 percent as of late 2013 when we posted an \u201cAsk FactCheck\u201d item identifying the major holders of U.S. debt. Since then, China has fallen behind Japan as the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt.\n\nOver 68 percent of those surveyed believed \u2014 wrongly \u2014 that China holds the majority of the U.S. government\u2019s debt, and 29 percent said they were \u201cvery confident\u201d that this false belief was correct.

Welfare: Nearly 52 percent believed \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that there isn\u2019t any federal limit on how long a person can receive welfare (TANF) benefits, and 14 percent were \u201cvery confident\u201d that their false belief was accurate.\n\nIn fact, TANF stands for \u201cTemporary Assistance for Needy Families.\u201d A five-year time limit was a key provision of the major welfare restructuring act passed in 1996, replacing the old system, which had no time limit. Furthermore, according to the study\u2019s author, many states have imposed even stricter time limits.\n\nNearly 52 percent believed \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that there isn\u2019t any federal limit on how long a person can receive welfare (TANF) benefits, and 14 percent were \u201cvery confident\u201d that their false belief was accurate.

Furthermore, according to the study\u2019s author, many states have imposed even stricter time limits. Social Security: Just over 40 percent said they believed Social Security benefits are paid from some sort of nonexistent \u201csavings account\u201d rather than from \u201ctaxes on people who are currently employed.\u201d Over 23 percent were confident they were correct about that. But they all are mistaken.\n\nIn fact, as the National Academy of Social Insurance states: \u201cSocial Security is largely a pay-as-you-go program.\u201d As a practical matter, benefits for current beneficiaries are financed primarily by the payroll taxes collected from those currently working. Since 2010, Social Security has been paying out more in benefits than it collects in payroll tax revenue, as we first noted four years ago.\n\nNo money is put into \u201csavings accounts\u201d for individuals. President George W. Bush proposed to allow a portion of those taxes to be put into personal accounts, but his efforts failed in 2005.\n\nThis study also tested whether fact-checking could correct these mistaken beliefs, and we found the results somewhat encouraging. About a month after the initial survey, the study gave the correct answers once, \u201conly briefly\u201d and \u201cwith no justifying information,\u201d to most of those who had answered incorrectly. And the study found \u201ca significant decrease in misperceptions\u201d in those who were told the correct information.\n\nThe API said the two most recent studies \u201csuggest that people\u2019s erroneous beliefs can be changed; and that, with persistence, journalists have the ability to successfully battle bad information in social media.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cBoth findings are a cause for optimism that fact checking in journalism can lead to a better-informed public.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Brooks Jackson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "This study also tested whether fact-checking could correct these mistaken beliefs, and we found the results somewhat encouraging.\nGuess analyzed tweets about a false claim that 2 million Americans would \u201close their jobs\u201d because of Obamacare.\nAs of the most recent report by the Treasury Department, China held just over $1.2 trillion in U.S. debt at the end of February, which was only 9.4 percent of all U.S. debt held by the public on that date.\nEbola: He also looked at tweets about a false claim that the Ebola virus could be spread by a cough or a sneeze.\nAnd the study found \u201ca significant decrease in misperceptions\u201d in those who were told the correct information."}
