The partnership brings BCBSNC members a range of primary care-focused services, including chronic disease support, online communications and hospital and specialty care navigation, and is helping the health system scale and extend its participation in the Medicare Shared Savings Program.\n\nVarious other Blue Cross companies are making a torrid push into value-based care, among them greater Philadelphia\u2019s Independence Blue Cross and Washington State's Regence Blue Shield. On the national front, Aetna has its own internal ACO strategy that involves provider revenue stability, while Humana is working with Evolent and leveraging the consulting company\u2019s provider clientele.\n\nEvolent\u2019s \u201cpayer value alliance\u201d has three broad aims: aligned contract templates for creating and capturing value, establishing network of payer and provider relationships, and \u201cbuilt-for-purpose infrastructure including technological, financial and risk management, and population health platforms,\u201d the organization said.\n\n\u201cWe're able to streamline the process of value-sharing contracting with these leading providers,\u201d said Renee Buckingham, Humana\u2019s enterprise vice president.\n\nEvolent\u2019s Frazier said that health systems\u2019 opportunities vary across the country. In some regions they can set up long-term stable payer partnerships, while in other places they may be well-served by launching their own health plan, \u201cbut we don\u2019t see that as a necessary part,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for scaling the population health model across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid patients, Frazier said the larger the population the easier it may be to innovate, especially when it comes to technology. For example, Cleveland Clinic and UT Houston are testing mobile stroke units to speed up treatment.\n\n\u201cWe need to change the delivery of care,\u201d Frazier said, specifically targeting primary care for chronic disease. \u201c10 minute office visits don\u2019t have that capacity,\u201d for diabetes, heart failure, asthma and numerous other conditions. Giving primary care practices the resources to work in teams and consult patients longer, as well as opening walk-in clinics and establishing on-site clinics for large employers are all be viable options health systems are trying out.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/payer-provider-partnerships-eyed-population-health", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Philly-skyline-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Despite the marketing buzz carried by terms like \"population health\" and \"integration,\" experts say this kind of regionalization works best with partnerships between providers and commercial payers.", "title": "The huge need for more payer-provider collaboration"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Philly-skyline-feature.gif"}, "title": "The huge need for more payer-provider collaboration", "description": "Despite the marketing buzz carried by terms like \"population health\" and \"integration,\" experts say this kind of regionalization works best with partnerships between providers and commercial payers.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "&#13; Despite the marketing buzz carried by terms like \u201cpopulation health\u201d and \u201cintegration,\u201d experts say this kind of regionalization works best with partnerships between providers and commercial payers.&#13; &#13; \u00a0&#13; &#13;", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a8d\"", "article_summary": "Despite the marketing buzz carried by terms like \u201cpopulation health\u201d and \u201cintegration,\u201d experts say this kind of regionalization works best with partnerships between providers and commercial payers.\nAs for scaling the population health model across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid patients, Frazier said the larger the population the easier it may be to innovate, especially when it comes to technology.\n\u201cWe need to change the delivery of care,\u201d Frazier said, specifically targeting primary care for chronic disease.\nEvolent\u2019s Frazier said that health systems\u2019 opportunities vary across the country.\nThat\u2019s especially true if health systems want to reduce the reliance on fee-for-service reimbursement, said Seth Frazier, chief transformation officer at Evolent Health, a joint venture of UPMC Health Plan and The Advisory Board Company that consults with payers and providers."}
