Louisiana has joined Texas and Kansas in a federal lawsuit aimed at blocking a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires states to pay taxes when Medicaid dollars are used to fund managed care health care plans.

Louisiana uses Medicaid dollars to fund Bayou Health, which provides health care to pregnant women and children through five managed care plans serving 969,000 people. But the Affordable Care Act includes a tax on such managed care plans, which can be passed onto state.

Since Bayou Health was implemented three years ago, the tax has cost Louisiana $31.3 million, according to the lawsuit. The tax, implemented through a "provider fee," can be passed on to whoever ultimately pays for the plan -- in this case the state.

The tax was created to help cover the costs of the Affordable Care Act, said Jeff Myers, the CEO of Medicaid Health Plans of America, a trade group that supports managed care plans. His organization is watching the lawsuit carefully because he believes it could make it to the U.S. Supreme Court.

"It's terrible ultimately for beneficiaries because (millions of dollars) will get siphoned out of the Medicaid program to fund this overall structure," Myers said. "We've suggested repeatedly that this tax is completely counterintuitive and absolutely counter to what the ACA was trying to do."

The lawsuit asks a judge to declare Congress acted unconstitutionally in levying the fee on Louisiana, Kansas and Texas and refund the money they've already paid for the fee.
