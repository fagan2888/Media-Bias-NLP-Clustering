NEW YORK (MainStreet) -- Good news, retirement savers: the market’s crashing. Finally. Last week, the Dow dropped more than 1,000 points. It did so again yesterday morning, before recovering most of the loss by midday. The financial reporters were chasing their tails faster than ever. “The market is down! What does it mean?!” And then, hours later: “The market is recovering! What does it mean?!”

But counterintuitively, what working Americans saving for retirement really need is a market crash that lasts.

A little behind saving for retirement? You need a grizzly bear market

If you’ve been diligently saving for retirement, say in your 401(k) or IRA, you’ve been buying into a rising market for the past six and half years. And that’s fine, but you could really use a good, solid break in the market. A deep sustained bear market.

That’s when your retirement savings gets turbocharged. You’ll be buying the market at a discount for the first time in years. With each paycheck-deducted contribution into your retirement savings, you’ll be snapping up shares at a faster than ever pace. You deserve more bang for your buck. With a really horrible stock market, you’ll finally be getting caught up a bit with your life-after-work nest egg.
