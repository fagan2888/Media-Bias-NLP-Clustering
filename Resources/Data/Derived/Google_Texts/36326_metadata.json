Officials told the newspaper they were unsure how many guns were seized.\n\nAfter the 2012 elementary-school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, New York began requiring mental health professionals to give county officials reports on patients seen as likely to cause serious harm to themselves or others. If county officials agree, the patients go on the list for five years and can\u2019t get handgun permits while on it. Patients can challenge the decision in court.\n\nThe patients\u2019 names and circumstances aren\u2019t public, but the Times cited examples described by a county health commissioner. They included two people who had attempted suicide with guns and a man whom it took six police officers to take to a hospital after he threatened a housing office worker.\n\nFederal and many other state laws require an involuntary commitment or a legal designation of mental illness or incompetence before a person can lose gun rights.\n\nNew York officials say the state\u2019s law is potentially life-saving and properly focused. They note that 144,000 people were admitted to mental hospitals and psychiatric centers statewide in 2012 alone. The state has about 20 million residents, the U.S. Census Bureau says.\n\nKeeping guns from 34,500 people \u201csounds really reasonable if you know the size of the system,\u201d state Office of Mental Health deputy commissioner John Tauriello told the Times.\n\nYet some mental health advocates fear that too many people are being deemed dangerous and that the law could discourage people from seeking help. The threshold for reporting could be seen as encompassing \u201canybody who expresses any kind of dangerousness,\u201d said Dr. Mark J. Russ, director of acute care psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Queens.\n\nGun control advocates say the potential consequences merit casting a wide net. If a gun has been taken from any dangerous person, \u201cthat\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said Brian Malte, a policy director at the Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nThe National Rifle Association wants a process to ensure \u201cthese decisions are not being made capriciously and maliciously,\u201d spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The New York Times, http://www.nytimes.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some 34,500 people are now listed as too mentally unstable to have guns in New York state under a less than 2-year-old law that is one of the nation's toughest concerning mental health and firearms, a news report Sunday found.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/19/report-34500-on-nys-mental-health-no-gun-list/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Some 34,500 people are now listed as too mentally unstable to have guns in New York state under a less than 2-year-old law that is one of the nation\u2019s toughest concerning mental health and firearms, a news report Sunday found.", "title": "Report: 34,500 on NY\u2019s mental health no-gun list"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some 34,500 people are now listed as too mentally unstable to have guns in New York state under a less than 2-year-old law that is one of the nation's toughest concerning mental health and firearms, a", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Report: 34,500 on NY\u2019s mental health no-gun list"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa40\"", "article_summary": "Yet some mental health advocates fear that too many people are being deemed dangerous and that the law could discourage people from seeking help.\nKeeping guns from 34,500 people \u201csounds really reasonable if you know the size of the system,\u201d state Office of Mental Health deputy commissioner John Tauriello told the Times.\n___Information from: The New York Times, http://www.nytimes.com\nIf county officials agree, the patients go on the list for five years and can\u2019t get handgun permits while on it.\nNew York officials say the state\u2019s law is potentially life-saving and properly focused."}
