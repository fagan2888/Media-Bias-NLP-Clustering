(KOIN 6) \u2014 For 10 years, the Salem Free Clinics has provided free care and medicine to an average of 500 people a month. They recently treated their 30,000th patient.\n\nVolunteer dentists, doctors, nurses and specialists have helped the uninsured and underinsured for a decade.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s John McConville told KOIN 6 News they have at times been so packed with people needing free care their waiting time was sometimes three weeks.\n\nBut the implementation of the Affordable Care Act provided a welcome change, he said.\n\n\u201cBy more people being insured now and able to access healthcare in other areas, that has freed up the backlog here at our clinics so we can see people in a more timely fashion,\u201d McConville said.\n\nStill, many need to be seen. In Polk County alone, 4000 people still have no health insurance. As long as that\u2019s the case, Salem Free Clinics will be there.\n\n\u201cCase by case, we love the individuals and the patients that are served,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"norton-safeweb-site-verification": "46bykeo2i0s-akw2xw95c4niny8dm8q2hq2q--p6sq9m44il5276m4e6zl3aewxb9eje2k-8ahjwqf4l2xznzs7ryf88y3cugtu9sy16hu69onbc-aftcwjs4pwj7f74", "zipcodes": "97201, 97203, 97204, 97205, 97206, 97207, 97208, 97209, 97210, 97211, 97212, 97213, 97214, 97215, 97216, 97227, 97266, 97005, 97225, 97015, 98661, 97030", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.koin", "og": {"site_name": "KOIN 6", "description": "For 10 years, the Salem Free Clinics has provided free care and medicine to an average of 500 people a month.
