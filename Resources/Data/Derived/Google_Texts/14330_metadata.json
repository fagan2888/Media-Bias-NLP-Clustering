On February 17, Musick told her followers she was filming. Unfortunately, she stayed mum in regard to what it was she was taping.\n\n\u201cExcited to finish filming and get out of this snow and to Cali @howiewood #California.\u201d\n\nBrittany Musick has been in the public eye since last year, when messages exchanged between her and Calvert hit the web. In the messages, which were published by Radar Online, Calvert proclaimed he was single after splitting from Leah Messer. Even after Musick questioned Calvert, claiming his wife was publicly speaking as if they were still together, Calvert insisted he was no longer married.\n\nWhile things started out friendly between Musick and Calvert, they quickly became flirty, with Calvert complimenting Musick on her looks and telling her she was \u201cspecial.\u201d Musick and Calvert eventually spoke of the possibility of chatting on video, and meeting in person.\n\n\u201cOkay, long as u got clothes on,\u201d Calvert joked of their FaceTime plans. \u201cjkjk u don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nIn messages exchanged via text, the couple planned to meet while Calvert was out of town working. In one series of messages, he was seen asking Musick if he needed to get a room or if she planned to stay the night. However, they couple don\u2019t appear to have actually met, and weeks later, Calvert was back with Messer.\n\nAfter Messer told fans on Facebook that she and Calvert were still married, the Teen Mom 2 pair attended a New Year\u2019s Eve party and shared plenty of kissing photos to prove their love.\n\nAs the Inquisitr reported, Messer\u2019s Facebook message was as follows.\n\n\u201cYes Jeremy Lynn and I are still together(: I was with him the night before close to his job. He had to work and could not make it to the girls birthday party. ): We were thinking of him as he was thinking of us and we missed him dearly but knew he was doing what he had to for us! xoxo.\u201d\n\nAfter his and Brittany Musick\u2019s messages were posted online, Calvert deactivated his Twitter account and remained silent for several weeks before returning to social media last month.\n\nWhile Messer claims she and Calvert are still happily married, Calvert raised questions about the issue when he favorited one of Brittany Musick\u2019s tweets on the first day of his Twitter return.\n\n[Photo via Twitter]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brittany Musick says she's filming, but will she be seen on 'Teen Mom 2?'", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Brittany Musick says she\u2019s filming, but will she be seen on \u2018Teen Mom 2?\u2019", "title": "Brittany Musick Says She\u2019s \u2018Filming:\u2019 Could It Be For \u2018Teen Mom 2?\u2019", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1855710/brittany-musick-says-shes-filming-could-it-be-for-teen-mom-2/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/brittany2.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-19T12:01:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-19T13:30:44+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/brittany2.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-02-19T12:01:24+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "brittany musick,jeremy calvert,leah calvert,leah messer,teen mom 2,celebrity news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/brittany2.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Brittany Musick says she\u2019s filming, but will she be seen on \u2018Teen Mom 2?\u2019"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca05b\"", "article_summary": "While things started out friendly between Musick and Calvert, they quickly became flirty, with Calvert complimenting Musick on her looks and telling her she was \u201cspecial.\u201d Musick and Calvert eventually spoke of the possibility of chatting on video, and meeting in person.\nWill Brittany Musick be seen on Teen Mom 2?\nEven after Musick questioned Calvert, claiming his wife was publicly speaking as if they were still together, Calvert insisted he was no longer married.\nAlthough the former online friend of Jeremy Calvert denied filming with MTV weeks ago, it now appears that things have changed.\nIn the messages, which were published by Radar Online, Calvert proclaimed he was single after splitting from Leah Messer."}
