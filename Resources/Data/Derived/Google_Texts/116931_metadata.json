Unfortunately, usually a person affected by this type of spinal injury seldom recovers the ability to walk normally,\" study author and rehabilitation specialist Dr. Randy Trumbower, of Emory University in Atlanta, said in a statement. \"Our research proposes a promising new way for the spinal cord to make the connections needed to walk better.\u201d\n\nPrior studies in rodents showed that sporadic hypoxia caused cells lining the walls of arteries to release chemicals that travel to the damaged spine, and strengthen the connections between the remaining neurons. An earlier trial in humans showed that this therapy could improve ankle strength in spinal injury patients, but it was unknown if these gains produced a noticeable difference in walking ability.\n\nFor the current study, 19 patients received hypoxia treatments in one of two ways. The first group breathed low-oxygen from a tank, administered at 15-second intervals with normal air, over the course of 30 minutes. This half-hour training session was repeated once a day, and after the fifth consecutive day, they took a walking test. The second group received the same 30-minute periods of hypoxia, but had a short walkabout after each session, before taking the longer walking test at the end of the week. Both groups went through the experiment a second time, but with normal oxygen throughout, as a control.\n\nAll of the participants witnessed an improvement in their ability to walk, with regards to speed and distance. The biggest gains were seen with patients given hypoxia plus cross-training everyday. They were able to walk nearly 300 feet further than normal. Though the authors posit that the improvements were due to changes in the behavior of spinal neurons, it is possible that the therapy promotes \u201ca greater capacity to tolerate fatigue\u201d, according to a commentary written by Dr. Ela Plow, of the Cleveland Clinic, and Dr. Michael Fehlings, of the University of Toronto in Canada.\n\nNeither was involved in the project, and both argue that more research is needed to understand why breathing less oxygen, a seemingly negative action, helps patients with these injuries.\"One question this research brings to light is how a treatment that requires people to take in low levels of oxygen can help movement, let alone in those with compromised lung function and motor abilities,\" Dr. Fehlings said. \"A possible answer is that spinal serotonin, a neurotransmitter, sets off a cascade of changes in proteins that help restore connections in the spine.\"\n\nThe study\u2019s authors emphasize that hypoxia treatments should not be attempted without a physican, as \u201cchronic or sustained hypoxia in untrained hands may cause serious injury.\u201d But they expect the approach to open new directions for \u201cimproving function in persons with spinal cord injuries,\u201d and that low doses of intermittent hypoxia may \u201cbe a safe, effective treatment to promote meaningful recovery from these injuries and possibly motor deficits seen with other clinical disorders\u201d.\n\nSource: Heather B.
