ROCKFORD (WIFR) -- A big step for people with disabilities comes on the 25th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Over 2,000 pages of current legislation have been revised. The word "handicapped" will no longer be politically correct in Illinois. Instead the term "persons with disabilities" will take the place of the other word.

State Representative John Cabello and Senator Steve Stadelman signed the bill for a local and regional access and mobilization project. Governor Rauner was not able to attend because of on-going budget work.

Eric Brown has cerebral palsy and believes the new title is a small step towards speaking up for those who have disabilities. He says, "We are looking at it as we're changing the language, and then we're going and talking to businesses and the cities that we work in, saying 'make your communities accessible, minimize the barriers facing individuals with disabilities. We're 25 years after the signing of the ADA. Let's have a completely accessible society."

Brown says to be able to pass another landmark in legislation on the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act is a great step towards having a barrier-free society.
