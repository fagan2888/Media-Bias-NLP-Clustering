Some time ago in this column I asked the question, “Where are all the good candidates?” I think members of both political parties are probably still asking themselves that question, in spite of the fact both have chosen their presidential candidates, flawed though they may be. It all comes down to, we get what we deserve.

The Democrats have trotted out the old political hack, the embodiment of a Washington political insider, Hillary Clinton, to be their standard bearer in the next presidential election. That is, if she survives the current 150-plus FBI agents looking into her emails on a private server and some questionable foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation.

Her loyal supporters point to her vast experience as First Lady, New York senator and Secretary of State, which should help her in foreign affairs. Her detractors say she has made things worse wherever she has traveled as Secretary of State. They say the Middle East is in turmoil because of her questionable policies.

Clinton vows to continue the great progress and programs Barack Obama has instigated in this country. Her supporters say this is a good thing because Obama is so popular. Her detractors say she is taking a chance with this strategy because things are not as rosy as Obama and Clinton may think. They seem to be in their own little world.

By continuing to support Obama’s legacy legislation, The Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) Clinton is taking an enormous chance. All indications are that those who have this insurance will continue to see their premiums increase annually.
