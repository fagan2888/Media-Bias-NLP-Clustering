As more people get insurance because of the Affordable Care Act, the medical community gets stretched thinner, especially when a doctor leaves the area or retires.\n\nDr. Hal Grotke, a family doctor and owner of Redwood Family Practice in Eureka, addressed the doctor shortage in an op-ed piece in The Times-Standard last month. Grotke was trying to marshal community support for the creation of a family medicine residency program in Humboldt County.\n\n\u201cMost doctors practice their entire careers near where they train,\u201d Grotke said in an interview. \u201cEvery doctor currently in Humboldt County is an example of those who don\u2019t do that. We are the rare exceptions.\u201d\n\nDr. Kiki Nocella, CEO of Believe Health, is a consultant whom officials in the Open Door clinic system have retained to investigate the feasibility of creating such a program in Humboldt County. She will be meeting later this month with doctors and administrators at Open Door, other clinics, area hospitals and Eureka City Councilwoman Natalie Arroyo, who is interested in the city having a role in the creation of a residency program.\n\nA residency program requires years of planning, analysis and effort just to get the stage where a proposal can be submitted to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. The officials in Humboldt County studying the issue are in the infancy stages of the effort.\n\n\u201cResidency programs are a very long-term strategy that communities can use to increase doctors,\u201d said Connie Stewart, executive director of the California Center of Rural Policy at Humboldt State University. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s never too soon to start working on such a program.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany areas of the country have a shortage of doctors, especially in primary care. Most doctors (68 percent) who attend medical school and complete their residencies in a single state tend to stay to practice medicine, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\nThe closest residency programs to Humboldt County are in Redding and Santa Rosa, and a family practice residency program is in the planning stages in Ukiah.\n\nEvery year, county health rankings are released by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to raise awareness about regional factors that influence health. One of the measures is the ratio of population to primary care physicians.\n\nHumboldt County\u2019s ratio of 1,390-to-1 is worse than the state average of 1,294-to-1 and the top U.S. performers in the health rankings at 1,045-to-1. Other similarly sized counties in California were Napa (1,015:1), Nevada (1,346:1), Sutter (1,131:1) and Kings (2,656:1). Those counties are closer to other population centers than the communities of the North Coast.\n\nThe counties bordering Humboldt, Mendocino (1,053:1), Del Norte (1,286:1), Trinity (2,254:1) and Siskiyous (1,424:1), present a mixed bag because of remoteness and small populations.\n\nIn Shasta County where the ratio of population to primary care physician is 1,294-to-1, a residency program is in its third year with two graduates to its credit. The Shasta Community Health Center in Redding sponsors a Family Medicine Residency Center affiliated with UC Davis.\n\nProgram Director Dr. Debra Lupeika said the effort was started because the region had more patients than could be accommodated by the existing number of providers. Recruitment efforts can only go so far in attracting talent.\n\nThe goal is for graduates of the program to remain in the community, but simply having a program provides another incentive for doctors to move there, she said.\n\n\u201cIn Shasta County, we\u2019re still in need of physicians,\u201d Lupeika said. \u201cBy training the residents in our system, they establish bonds. They get to know the specialists. They get to know the hospitals. They get to know the community.\u201d\n\nNocella was the consultant Shasta Community Health Center officials used to help establish the Redding-based program, and CEO Dean Germano said Humboldt County officials couldn\u2019t be in better hands.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the right person to find the pathway to make it happen,\u201d Germano said.\n\nWhile a residency program would take several years to come to fruition, a more immediate option might be with nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Susan Adams, a nurse practitioner and former Marin County supervisor, will be in Eureka on Tuesday to talk about the Nurse Practitioner and Physician Assistant Dual-Track Program at Davis.\n\nAdams is an assistant clinical professor in the nursing school at Davis, will be presenting information to the supervisors about a potential partnerships between her program and Humboldt health care providers who agree to precept the students.\n\nSupervisor Virginia Bass asked for the presentation because she knows how her constituents continue to struggle to find medical care.\n\nNearly two dozen medical schools have recently opened or are in the planning stages across the country, the most at any time since the 1960s and \u201970s. Graduates of those programs will need places to train, and many states are looking at ways of expanding graduate medical education to attract those newly minted doctors. The quality of life in the North Coast always will be a major recruitment tool for trying to attract medical practitioners to the area, Grotke said, but more creative solutions to the doctor shortage are needed.\n\n\u201cWe need more doctors,\u201d Grotke said. \u201cWe\u2019re always going to need more doctors.\u201d\n\nSteven Moore can be reached at 707-441-0510.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New efforts to address the shortage of medical providers in Humboldt County go beyond traditional recruitment methods.Officials are reaching out to sources outside the area to advise them on whether Humboldt County is well-suited for a residenc", "title": "Officials seek new ways to address shortage primary care practitioners", "og": {"url": "http://www.times-standard.com/article/NJ/20160109/NEWS/160109865", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.times-standard.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/times-standard.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Officials seek new ways to address shortage primary care practitioners"}, "twitter": {"domain": "times-standard.com", "description": "New efforts to address the shortage of medical providers in Humboldt County go beyond traditional recruitment methods.Officials are reaching out to sources outside the area to advise them on whether Humboldt County is well-suited for a residenc", "title": "Officials seek new ways to address shortage primary care practitioners", "url": "http://www.times-standard.com/article/NJ/20160109/NEWS/160109865", "image": {"src": "http://local.times-standard.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/times-standard.png?052016"}, "site": "@eurekaTS", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551779828?mt=8", "iphone": "id499669816?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.eurekatimesstandard"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "News, Eureka news, CA news, US news, world news.", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Eureka news, CA news, US news, world news."}, "article_summary": "Supervisor Virginia Bass asked for the presentation because she knows how her constituents continue to struggle to find medical care.\nGrotke was trying to marshal community support for the creation of a family medicine residency program in Humboldt County.\nNew efforts to address the shortage of medical providers in Humboldt County go beyond traditional recruitment methods.\nThat ratio confirms what Humboldt County residents already know: It\u2019s hard to find a primary care practitioner.\nThe officials in Humboldt County studying the issue are in the infancy stages of the effort."}
