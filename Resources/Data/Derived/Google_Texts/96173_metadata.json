The eBay listing shows a photo of a woman posing with the diploma, which Ritter says is in mint condition.\n\nThe FSU grad says if you fork out 50 grand to make the diploma your own, you will get much more than just a piece of paper.

I will rent a car and show you the best view of the capitol building A walking tour of the theatre where I performed How I Learned to Drive.
