Both California and Kentucky have been touted as a national model, though Vermont has had a documented history of issues with its exchange.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe GAO\u2019s investigation was released in March, but it did not name the states. That information was reported Thursday by The Associated Press , which obtained it through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nFederal officials said their findings in the investigation, which was initially limited to those three states, likely means that other states\u2019 websites have faced similar issues.\n\nState officials in California and Kentucky told the AP that no breaches had been reported, while officials in Vermont declined to discuss the findings.\n\nOnly about a dozen states have opted to run their own healthcare exchanges under ObamaCare, with most choosing to use the federal version, HealthCare.gov.\n\nBoth the state and federal versions of the healthcare website have ran into unexpected technological problems. The federal HealthCare.gov website took weeks to become fully functioning after crashing during its initial launch in 2013.\n\nMany states have since struggled with maintaining their marketplace\u2019s online infrastructure, with dwindling budgets each year.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Flaws found in California, Kentucky and Vermont.", "description": "Flaws found in California, Kentucky and Vermont.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Flaws found in California, Kentucky and Vermont.", "title": "Watchdog: Security flaws plague state ObamaCare exchanges", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/275554-watchdog-security-flaws-plague-state-obamacare-exchanges", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/seniorhealthcare_021011getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-08T10:29:11-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-08T10:29-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/275554-watchdog-security-flaws-plague-state-obamacare-exchanges", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-07T18:01-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-07T18:01:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-08T10:29:11-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/275554-watchdog-security-flaws-plague-state-obamacare-exchanges", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Flaws found in California, Kentucky and Vermont.", "card": "summary", "title": "Watchdog: Security flaws plague state ObamaCare exchanges"}, "dcterms.title": "Watchdog: Security flaws plague state ObamaCare exchanges"}, "article_summary": "A federal watchdog has found security flaws in state-run ObamaCare exchanges in California, Kentucky and Vermont, potentially putting millions of customers\u2019 data at risk.\nState officials in California and Kentucky told the AP that no breaches had been reported, while officials in Vermont declined to discuss the findings.\nFederal officials said their findings in the investigation, which was initially limited to those three states, likely means that other states\u2019 websites have faced similar issues.\nOnly about a dozen states have opted to run their own healthcare exchanges under ObamaCare, with most choosing to use the federal version, HealthCare.gov.\nThe federal HealthCare.gov website took weeks to become fully functioning after crashing during its initial launch in 2013."}
