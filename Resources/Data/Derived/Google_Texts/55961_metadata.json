Joseph Bennett, an African American gentleman in his early 60\u2019s, was sitting in his usual seat, wearing his customary Indian headdress and burgundy Washington team jacket with its \u201cRedskin\u201d emblems. Joe noticed that the seat next to him was unusually empty.\n\nAnother fan sitting a few rows behind Joe shouted \u201cHey Joe, when are you going to get some real feathers in that bonnet and look like a real fighting Indian Chief?\u201d Joe hollered--- \u201cTommy, wish I could, but the government has outlawed the use of real eagle feathers!\u201d\n\nAt that moment, a gentleman, who was bundled in a heavy jacket with a hood that virtually covered his face, eased into the seat next to Joe. He quickly removed the covering exposing his painted black face, and hastened to introduce himself as Waya of the Cherokee Nation and extended his hand to Joe. Joe looked at Waya, put his hands on his hips and demanded to know, firstly, how he got a ticket to sit next to him and, secondly, how he could be so damn insensitive to paint his face black. Joe continued to speak harshly and said \u201cJust get the hell out of here, NOW!\u201d Waya quickly responded \u201chow can you be so insensitive to wear an Indian headdress?\u201d Joe was taken aback. Joe said, in a less harsh voice, \u201cI have worn this headdress to REDSKINS games for 30 years. I\u2019m considered the team\u2019s unofficial mascot.\u201d Waya responded \u201cNo one asked me how I felt and I\u2019m likely one of the few people at this game who could really tell others how it feels seeing you with your headdress, your Washington team jacket and hearing the \u201cR\u201d word.\u201d\n\nJoe looked rather perplexed and responded, \u201cListen man, Redskins has been used as a term of honor and pride of Native Americans for 80 years and wearing an Indian headdress has been acceptable for as long as I can remember\u201d. Waya said \u201cBlack faced minstrel shows and painted black faces began in the 1840s and continued in this country until the 1960s\u201d.\n\nWaya continued, \u201cPeople are constantly telling me that the \u2018R\u2019 word means honor, but they have no idea how it really feels to an American Indian who associates the term with its history of being derogatory. Indeed, its history is deeply rooted in hatred; it\u2019s even defined in the dictionary as a racial slur to American Indians.\u201d Waya paused then continued. Waya proceeded. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that the affected party is the one who really decides what is racist and what isn\u2019t?\u201d Joe interrupted and, in a more consoling tone, said \u201cWaya, I\u2019d like to hear more of what you are talking about. The crowd is beginning to come in. Let\u2019s slip out where there is less noise and I want to hear more. But PLEASE WIPE THAT CHARCOAL OFF YOUR FACE!\u201d Waya took a towel from his coat and began to wipe his face. Joe, to the amazement of everyone sitting around him, removed his headdress. The two gentlemen began walking towards an exit, while Waya continued wiping the blackness from his face.\n\nThe two gentlemen found a quiet place somewhat away from the incoming crowd. Joe said \u201cGo on Waya, you\u2019ve got the floor and this better be good for me to miss part of my game.\u201d\n\nWaya continued \u201cJoe, what you guys experienced is what we are going through now. If I\u2019m not mistaken, in the early civil rights movement, the major emphasis of Black America was confronting many hardships like voting, education and unemployment inequalities, having to ride at the back of buses, separate eating, restroom and theater facilities, that were common place in the South. When the 1964 Civil Rights Act began taking affect and the unconscionable ways of treating African Americans were changing, your leaders turned their attention to addressing issues, such as stereotyping. Just think of the names and caricatures like the \u2018N\u2019 word, \u2018boy\u2019, \u2018spade\u2019, \u2018jig\u2019, \u2018Sambo\u2019, \u2018Aunt Jemima\u2019, \u2018Jim Crow\u2019, \u2018Sapphire\u2019 and \u2018the Mammy\u2019, and public spectacles, such as, painted black faces and black faced minstrel shows that your people said were demeaning. Many whites claimed that this was the way of life in America and it had been that way for years, many said they were only having some good, clean fun, meant no harm and there was no racism intended. But fortunately for blacks, much of white society realized the injustices of how Black America had been treated and they accepted that these acts that you,\u201c Waya pointed gently at Joe and continued \u201cthe affected party, said were stereotyping, and change occurred.\u201d The two men looked at each other and Joe rubbed his head. \u201cWaya, I have to agree with a lot you have said, please go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Joe!\u201d and Waya continued, \u201cThese changes did not come overnight and typecasting of blacks had been a way of life in America for many, many years. To my knowledge, there were no polls taken to see what percentage of blacks, or for that matter, other Americans, were opposed to these uses of derogatory words or stereotyping in general. But, Joe, there were many polls that have been conducted to see how many American Indians or Washington team fans think the \u2018R\u2019 word is racist.\u201d\n\nWaya realized that Joe was beginning to see his point and proceeded \u201cI have often wondered if a poll had been taken among blacks, primarily living in the Deep South in the mid to late 1960\u2019s, whether they cared that much about typecasting or the many other issues that Black America was facing. Recall that virtually all of the blacks in the South depended on whites for their jobs and livelihood. I would guess that the vast majority would have said these issues are not that important ---- wouldn\u2019t they more likely have said that our jobs and livelihood depend on whites and we have to survive!\u201d\n\nWaya again paused then began speaking slowly \u201cWeren\u2019t the \u2018preachings\u2019, if I can use the word \u2018preachings\u2019, of the Rap Browns, Huey P. Newtons and the Stokely Carmichaels really about shaming blacks into ascertaining their own identity that was totally independent of white society? I\u2019ve always looked at this as if these activists wanted Black America to realize that they could not depend on whites anymore, but had to depend on themselves.\u201d\n\nThe two men were quiet for a few moments and Joe said \u201cWaya, I never equated our previous pain of going through our \u2018stereotyping\u2019, as you call it, with that of Native Americans. I wonder why we haven\u2019t seen your pain more clearly.\u201d\n\nWaya continued, \u201cJoe, look at what most other minorities have experienced. Virtually all of them have been typecast at one time or another. If I\u2019m not mistaken, Jewish Americans were stereotyped in cartoons and depicted in caricatures with large hook noses, curly hair, olive brown skin and being miserly with money in the early part of the 20th Century. Let\u2019s take Asian Americans and look at the subsequent fallout they felt from the typecasting of Japanese during and after the Second World War. They were illustrated in cartoons with exaggerated slanted eyes and buck teeth, and referred to as \u2018Japs\u2019. Chinese were often depicted in Asiatic Hordes, while Asians in general were referred to in terms of the \u2018Yellow Peril\u2019. During the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese were called \u2018gooks\u2019, \u2018Charlie\u2019 and \u2018zipper heads\u2019, Mexican Americans have been stereotyped in advertising, such as, \u2018The Frito Bandito\u2019, depicted in cartoons as lazy and referred to as \u2018wet backs\u2019. Even Italian, German and Irish Americans have also felt the sting of the whip at one time or another, being stereotyped in society and the news media.\u201d\n\nThe crowd roared and Waya stopped talking. After a brief pause, he continued. \u201cJoe, you\u2019ve listened to me enough. I think the Washington team may have scored. Why don\u2019t you go back to your game? I do appreciate our conversation and you taking time to listen to me. You are an important participant of the Washington team game.\u201d Joe shook his head and said \u201cI can\u2019t leave this conversation. I\u2019ve always thought of myself as a compassionate person; let\u2019s see what more you want to say. Please.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe, I appreciate your time and you listening to me. Each of those examples of past racial insensitivities is easily comprehensible and acceptable as racially derogatory, and politically incorrect in today\u2019s society. The harbinger of change in all cases began with the affected party, the only one who could rightfully feel the depth of the pain of stereotyping, their concerns were heard and others in society ultimately agreed. Claims of historical uses by the perpetrators, the reasons given for using a specific term, and the number of affected individuals involved as motives for continuing to use the name were of no consequence; don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Joe only listened and did not respond.\n\n\u201cJoe, I blame America as a whole for not responding to our problem, but listen, virtually every minority has been through the same thing.\u2019 Waya paused and then continued, emphasizing each word. \u201cWe are currently the most stereotyped minority in sports and advertising, much, much more than just the \u2018R\u2019 word and the accompanying Washington team\u2019s and fans\u2019 Indian paraphernalia. I\u2019ll give you many other examples in sports - the Cleveland Indians and their mascot, Chief Wahoo. The Atlanta Braves and their tomahawk chop, the Chicago Blackhawks with their logo of an American Indian, the Kansas City Chiefs and Arrowhead Stadium, and the colleges, high schools and other professional teams with their monikers, mascots and Indian images. Examples in advertising are Pontiac, Winnebago, Dodge Dakota, Jeep CHEROKEE\u201d, Waya paused, as he had perhaps overly emphasized Cherokee, but quickly went on. \u201cCrazy Horse Malt Liquor, Hamm\u2019s Beer, Gray Owl Rice, Umpqua Diary Products, Sue Bee Honey, Land O\u2019 Lakes and Arrowhead Bottled Water.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop this, Waya. Now I\u2019ve heard enough.\u201d Joe said. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me you object to Jeep Cherokee? Man, that, if anything, is an honor! You\u2019re way off base and way too sensitive.\u201d\n\nJoe said \u201cOK, Waya, go on and this better be good.\u201d Waya continued. \u201cJoe, I look at things a bit differently. Remember, we Cherokees are a nation of people. You\u2019ve heard of the Cherokee Nation. Right?\u201d Waya said \u201cJoe, I also look at Mexico as a nation of people, and would anyone dare make a Jeep\u2026.\u201d Waya paused, as if to say to Joe, you complete the \u2018Jeep ____\u2019. Joe looked sternly at Waya and nodded indicating for him to continue.\n\n\u201cI think the reason that other minorities don\u2019t identify with our feelings, even though they experienced similar types of typecasting, is that it is a characteristic of humans that we see the things that affect us and not the things that affect others. We really only feel our own pain!\u201d Waya paused momentarily. Joe tilted his head slightly, nodded while raising his eyebrows indicating that Waya had made a good point.\n\nThe two men became quiet. Joe slowly shook his head and said \u201cYou have thought about this a lot, Waya, and I know you have much more to say. But I\u2019ve learned a lot and have a lot to think about. Shall we stop?\u201d\n\nWaya also sensed that it was time to close. He smiled, cocked his head slightly to one side, gave a slight bow indicating to Joe how much he appreciated the talk and offered his hand. Joe enthusiastically shook Waya\u2019s hand and said \u201cI will never wear this headdress again. That will tell so many of the fans that a big change has occurred. I will have to do some explaining, but will handle that.
