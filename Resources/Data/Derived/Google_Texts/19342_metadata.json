Health Link \u2014 generating frustration among professionals who say their patience in navigating the changes wrought by the Affordable Care Act has not been rewarded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very supportive, I put a lot of work into it, and I\u2019ve gotten nothing,\u201d said Steve Nearman, a Virginia-based broker who says he has helped nearly 100 city residents find and buy insurance through the exchange and is owed thousands of dollars in commissions.\n\nThe unpaid brokers represent an additional set of hiccups for D.C. Health Link, one of the many state exchanges established pursuant to the federal health-care overhaul. Under city law, with few exceptions, individuals and small businesses are required to buy their health coverage through the exchange, which is meant to foster transparency and competition.\n\nThe District\u2019s glitches have paled in comparison to those faced in Maryland and by the federal exchange, which is used in 36 states, including Virginia. But many District consumers have encountered problems using their hometown exchange. The Washington Post recently reported that some consumers have encountered significant delays in securing coverage because of apparent technology faults.\n\nMila Kofman, D.C. Health Link\u2019s executive director, acknowledged that broker commissions have been an issue for months but said the exchange is committed to fixing the situation soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really big problem,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople should be paid for what they do.\u201d\n\nInsurance consumers are not required to use brokers, also known as agents or producers, to buy policies through the exchange. But many small businesses and individuals, particularly families with complex coverage needs, use them to sort through the dozens of plans offered.\n\nThe payment issue, Kofman said, appears to be rooted in whether broker information is included in an electronic enrollment form passed from the exchange to the carrier and used to write the customer\u2019s policy.\n\nSome of those transmissions, Kofman said, did not include complete broker information \u2014 particularly applications that may have been partially filled out by a consumer directly instead of by a broker.\n\nUsing his personal records, Nearman last month compiled a spreadsheet listing his clients and their policy details in hopes of getting his commissions. \u201cIt still wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d he said; the exchange wanted him to get signed paper forms from his clients designating him as their broker.\n\nRob Poli is president and chief operating officer of the Rockville-based Insurance Marketing Center, a \u201cgeneral agent\u201d that serves as a middleman between brokers such as Nearman and the carriers \u2014 CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Kaiser Permanente \u2014 that sell policies through the exchange.\n\nHe said of the more than 100 brokers he represents, most had not been paid as of late June for the policies they\u2019ve written through the D.C. exchange, many of which started in January. \u201cMaryland, with all its problems, the brokers have still gotten paid,\u201d Poli said.\n\nD.C. Health Link does not record how many of those applying for insurance use a broker, but Kofman estimated that about one-quarter of households shopping for individual plans do, while about half of small businesses do. More than 12,300 are currently covered under individual plans sold through the exchange, and an additional 13,700 are covered through group plans.\n\nA fix rolled out in February, Kofman said, was not as effective as planned, and in recent weeks, a team was assembled to scour exchange applications to find broker information that was not forwarded to carriers. That information has been gathered, she said, and brokers can expect payments as soon as this month.\n\nBut Poli said Friday that not all brokers will be made whole. Some have not been able to compile lists of their clients to match against the exchange data, like Nearman did, and for the rest, the information retrieved from the exchange\u2019s system was not complete.\n\nFor those cases \u2014 about 20 percent of the unpaid accounts, in Poli\u2019s estimation \u2014 brokers will have to get signed forms from their clients to get paid \u2014 an \u201cembarrassing\u201d prospect, Poli said: \u201cIt leaves some doubt in the client\u2019s mind. Do you know how to do your job?\u201d\n\nFor exchange officials, the irony is that D.C. Health Link went above and beyond to accommodate brokers in a system that some advocates hoped would help cut out middlemen.\n\nJanet Trautwein, chief executive of the National Association of Health Underwriters, a trade association for insurance agents and brokers, said the District was an outlier among the exchanges.\n\n\u201cI have not seen anything anywhere that approached how broker-friendly D.C. is,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying people don\u2019t get frustrated with it \u2014 they do \u2014 but I can\u2019t say it\u2019s because D.C. doesn\u2019t want to work with brokers.\u201d\n\nProblems transmitting broker information from exchanges to carriers has \u201chappened in all the exchanges,\u201d Troutwein said. \u201cSometimes it drops off and we can\u2019t figure out why that occurs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tech glitch means broker information has not gone to insurance carriers, delaying commissions for many.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Tech glitch means broker information has not gone to insurance carriers, delaying commissions for many.", "title": "Six months into Obamacare, some D.C. insurance brokers still wait to be paid", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/six-months-into-obamacare-some-dc-insurance-brokers-still-wait-to-be-paid/2014/07/07/5ff33dda-021b-11e4-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/Images/201310/website1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mikedebonis"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, DC Health Link, DC health insurance exchange, DC exchange, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, DC obamacare, insurance brokers Obamacare, insurance agents Obamacare, DC HEalth Link brokers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis"}, "news_keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, DC Health Link, DC health insurance exchange, DC exchange, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, DC obamacare, insurance brokers Obamacare, insurance agents Obamacare, DC HEalth Link brokers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "5ff33dda-021b-11e4-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc99d\"", "article_summary": "The unpaid brokers represent an additional set of hiccups for D.C.
