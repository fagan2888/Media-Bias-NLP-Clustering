The current leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) had some chilling words upon his release from a U.S. detention camp in Iraq in 2009.

“I’ll see you guys in New York,” said Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, Army Col. Kenneth King told reporters at the Daily Beast Saturday.

Al-Baghdadi now leads the extremist ISIS group responsible for insurgencies in Iraq this week. The group has already claimed large portions of land in Iraq, including it’s second largest city, Mosul, and Tikrit.

The chairman of the House intelligence committee, Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday Americans should be wary of the group, which aims to create an Islamic caliphate in the heart of the Middle East.

“Guess what? These people will come home eventually and they are going to come home with, I believe, intentions to fulfill al Qaeda’s dream for another attack on our homeland and, certainly, another attack on our Western European allies,” Mr. Rogers said.
