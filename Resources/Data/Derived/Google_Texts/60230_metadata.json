However, a recent study carried out by Spanish researchers has revealed that when it comes to illnesses, some types of illnesses are less likely to evoke empathy and more likely to evoke shame than others. Specifically, the research suggests that mental health conditions such as alcoholism and depression are more likely to be accompanied not by familial support but by family shame and embarrassment.\n\nThe study, which was published in Psychological Medicine, is based on mental health surveys conducted by the World Health Organization, which assessed attitudes regarding illness in more than 16 countries including Spain. The study estimates the degree to which a family member might feel embarrassed when a close relative is suffering from a general medical health condition versus their level of embarrassment when a close relative is suffering from alcoholism, drug addiction, or a mental health condition.\n\nThe study found that both mental and physical illnesses take a toll on a family, but that mental illness was significantly more likely to feel a stigma associated with their family member's illness. The study is unique in that most previous studies have focused on how the sick individual felt, or the overall society's attitude towards illness. This is the first study of its kind to look at attitudes on the family level.\n\nThe authors say that based on the study's conclusions \u2014 which take into account the cultural context of each country surveyed \u2014 that anti-stigma campaigns around mental illnesses should include relatives within their target audience.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "stigma, mental, illness, families, embarrassed, mentally, ill", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An analysis of data from the World Mental Health Surveys found that mental health disorders were more likely to be accompanied by stigma from family members than physical illnesses.", "title": "Families Often Embarrassed By Mentally Ill Relatives", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stigma-mental-illness-families-are-often-embarrassed-mentally-ill-relatives-says-new-study-264116", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/02/shattered-woman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An analysis of data from the World Mental Health Surveys found that mental health disorders were more likely to be accompanied by stigma from family members than physical illnesses.", "title": "Families Often Embarrassed By Mentally Ill Relatives", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stigma-mental-illness-families-are-often-embarrassed-mentally-ill-relatives-says-new-study-264116", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/02/shattered-woman.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/02/shattered-woman.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-12-02T10:42:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-02T10:42:02-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An analysis of data from the World Mental Health Surveys found that mental health disorders were more likely to be accompanied by stigma from family members than physical illnesses."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce472\"", "article_summary": "Family support is widely discussed as a beneficial factor in helping people with illnesses cope and even recover from serious illnesses.\nThe authors say that based on the study's conclusions \u2014 which take into account the cultural context of each country surveyed \u2014 that anti-stigma campaigns around mental illnesses should include relatives within their target audience.\nThe study found that both mental and physical illnesses take a toll on a family, but that mental illness was significantly more likely to feel a stigma associated with their family member's illness.\nSpecifically, the research suggests that mental health conditions such as alcoholism and depression are more likely to be accompanied not by familial support but by family shame and embarrassment.\nThe study, which was published in Psychological Medicine, is based on mental health surveys conducted by the World Health Organization, which assessed attitudes regarding illness in more than 16 countries including Spain."}
