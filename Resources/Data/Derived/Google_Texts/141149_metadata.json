At the Brown Palace and Oxford hotels and elsewhere, they continue to radiate the classic details of an age of optimism, when young Denver strove to become a city to be taken seriously.\n\nToday, it seems strange to me that most local architects, who have lent their names to highly commendable projects, don\u2019t seem to be taken seriously, or get the recognition they deserve.\n\nWith Curt Fentress\u2019 design of Denver International Airport\u2019s main terminal that opened in 1995 a notable exception, Denver has for decades seldom been self-assured enough to trust its own architects with the major and high-visibility commissions that help define a city.\n\nInstead, \u201cstarchitects\u201d with international reputations were almost always imported. Their projects include the 1971 Denver Art Museum (Gio Ponti from Milan); Coors Field in 1995 (HOK Architects of Kansas City); the 1995 Denver Public Library addition (Michael Graves from Princeton, N.J.); and the 2006 Denver Art Museum\u2019s Hamilton Wing (Daniel Libeskind, from New York). The 2007 Museum of Contemporary Art was by London-based David Adaye.\n\nSpanish starchitect Santiago Calatrava was originally chosen for an addition to Fentress\u2019 Jeppesen terminal at Denver International Airport, but withdrew when Denver couldn\u2019t meet the estimated $650 million cost. The project is now directed by the San Francisco-headquartered Gensler Architects, with a 500-room hotel and RTD rail terminal scheduled to open in 2015.\n\nCritics have pointed out that the still-rising hotel at DIA is already obscuring Fentress\u2019 mountain-peaks roof that has become a Denver signature.\n\nThe outsiders-only model for major Denver projects has become less rigid in recent years. The $136 million Lindsey-Flanigan judicial center that opened downtown on West Colfax in 2010 was designed by the Denver firm of klipp Architecture (now klipp/GKKwork). The adjacent Van Cise-Simonet detention center was done by Denver-based OZ Architecture. Both projects went to local talent after international starchitect Steven Holl was fired over vaguely defined design issues.\n\nThe $258 million Ralph Carr judicial center opened in 2013 just south of Civic Center and was designed by the Fentress firm. Nearby, the $111 million History Colorado Center, opened in 2012, was by Denver-based Tryba Architects, who had earlier done the 2002 Wellington Webb Denver Municipal building with RNL Architecture.\n\nDespite this progress, local architects remain little-known.\n\nIn business stories, priorities are clear. First mentioned are the corporate firm\u2019s principals, along with the project\u2019s cost. Next come the developers and money men, followed by a cast of lesser luminaries. If the project\u2019s architect is mentioned at all, he or she comes in near the end.\n\n\u201cArchitects don\u2019t get respect because we don\u2019t do a very good job of promoting ourselves,\u201d said architect Dennis Humphries, principal of Humphries Poli. \u201cBut that\u2019s part of what Doors Open Denver is about: to create an awareness that architects are important,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cDenver architects seem to do much better abroad than at home,\u201d said architect Hans Morgenthaler, who teaches architecture at the University of Colorado\u2019s Denver campus.\n\nBrit Probst, principal with the Davis Partnership firm, said \u201cDenver isn\u2019t among American \u2018first-tier\u2019 cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago or even Houston and there\u2019s less building of major projects here. So when a client plans a 50-story skyscraper, how many Denver architects have experience with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cDenver architects still get no respect,\u201d said Alan Gass, who has worked on downtown Denver projects since the 1950s and is a fellow of the American Institute of Architects. \u201cThe general public doesn\u2019t know what we do and, often, neither do clients. Aside from Fentress, local architects don\u2019t get the recognition they deserve.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTrends taking place in other American cities are ignored here. While other cities are eliminating urban freeways by placing them below ground, Denver plans to expand and widen Interstate 70 through the city.\u201d\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be that way. Certainly, Denver is today far more sophisticated \u2014 architecturally and otherwise \u2014 than when Denver Mayor Robert Speer suggest a Greek theater a century ago for a planned Civic Center and a city councilman supposedly asked, \u201cWhat for? Denver doesn\u2019t even have that many Greeks.\u201d\n\nJ.
