That\u2019s Coach Bobo\u2019s idea. For him to put in a different quarterback, that\u2019s on him. We have the timing down with both quarterbacks, so it really doesn\u2019t make a big difference.\u201d\n\nHiggins said the season isn\u2019t lost for the 2-4 Rams.\n\n\u201cWe have to execute,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to watch more film. I\u2019m frustrated myself. I\u2019ve never been part of a losing team back to back. I\u2019m always used to winning. I have to pick my head up and encourage these guys to come on, let\u2019s do this, it\u2019s not over, we have a lot of ball left to play.\u201d\n\nTraffic snarl. Fans driving from Denver to Hughes Stadium early Saturday afternoon for the 5 p.m. game encountered overhead message boards advising that Interstate 25 was closed ahead because of an accident.\n\nIt turned out that the accident happened at 12:03 p.m., near Mead at mile marker 243 and Colorado 66, and the Colorado Department of Transportation said the northbound side of the freeway was closed until about 1:30 p.m.\n\nHeeding the message boards, many travelers planning to get to the game early for pregame tailgating or for other reasons left the freeway at the Colorado 52 or 119 exits, headed west to Longmont and then came up U.S. 287 to Fort Collins.\n\nOthers got caught in the long backup south of the accident.\n\nNo details about the accident were available.\n\nNo full house. Announced attendance was 26,117, a little more than 6,000 short of a sellout. CSU is averaging 27,729 through three home games.
