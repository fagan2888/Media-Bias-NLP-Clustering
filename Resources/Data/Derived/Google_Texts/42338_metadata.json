As reported by the New York Times, the GAO\u2019s investigators found that the government was making significant errors in determining people\u2019s eligibility for coverage. As with so many things the government does, these errors led to spending more money \u2013 a lot more.\n\nIn some cases, the government was paying for unnecessary, duplicate coverage by providing subsidies for people to get private health insurance policies on the exchange even though they were already enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nEven for those people who were just enrolled in Medicaid, overpayments were a widespread problem. When Obamacare expanded Medicaid to cover able-bodied working age adults, the law also provided that the federal government would cover 100 percent of the cost for the newly eligible people. For those who were previously eligible for Medicaid, the feds were supposed to cover an average of 57 percent of costs. What has ended up happening is that the categories are getting confused and the feds are paying the entire cost for some of the older accounts as well.\n\nThe states shouldn\u2019t think they are off the hook if the feds are overpaying for Medicaid coverage. We\u2019ve reported extensively on how the costs of Medicaid expansion borne by the states are far greater than estimated and are threatening to overwhelm many state budgets.\n\nCarolyn L. Yocom, a director of health care studies at the GAO, confirmed the risk of overpayments when she testified before a House committee earlier this month. Even worse, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which run the federal marketplace, lack adequate safeguards to prevent overpayments.\n\n\u201cThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services cannot identify erroneous expenditures due to incorrect eligibility determinations,\u201d said Yocum. \u201cThe federal government could be paying twice \u2014 subsidizing exchange coverage and reimbursing states for Medicaid spending \u2014 for individuals enrolled in both types of coverage.\u201d\n\nMoreover, GAO investigators found, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \u201cdoes not have procedures to automatically terminate subsidized exchange coverage when individuals are determined eligible for Medicaid.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it seems that the most basic efforts, like verifying Social Security Numbers, are not being taken. GAO investigators created eighteen fake identities, and all but one of them were approved for subsidized private health insurance or Medicaid coverage. The falsified information used for the fake applicants included \u201cnonexistent Social Security numbers, invalid immigration document numbers, fictitious birth certificates and other counterfeit documents,\u201d according to the Times.\n\nIn June of 2015, I reported on bogus re-enrollments found during another audit by the GAO. At that time, the chief of audits and investigations for the GAO, Seto Bagdoyan told the Senate Finance Committee that \u201cHealthCare.gov does not appear to be set up to detect fraud,\u201d and that \u201cHealthCare.gov\u2019s document-processing contractor \u2018is not required to seek to detect fraud.\u2019\u201d Bagdoyan continued,\n\n\u201cThe contractor personnel involved in the document-verification process are not trained as fraud experts and do not perform antifraud duties.\u201d\n\nApparently not much has changed since then.\n\nThis rampant fraud and mismanagement is being reported on the eve of the new enrollment period for Americans to sign up for Obamacare coverage again. Starting November 1, people will be able to enroll in new coverage or change their existing plans.\n\nWith enrollment numbers still far below the Obama administration\u2019s goals, millions of Americans still lack health insurance and are expected to attempt to sign up for coverage during this upcoming open enrollment period. I\u2019m not optimistic that they will be able to fix these errors in the next few days, so once again, the federal government will be spending more than they promised while Americans remain frustrated with their increasingly expensive insurance policies.\n\n________________________________\n\nKristina Ribali is the Senior Coalitions Director for the Foundation for Government Accountability.
