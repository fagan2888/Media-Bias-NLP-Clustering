(CNN) Donald Trump officially added John Kasich to his list of "no-action, all-talk politicians" Friday afternoon, hitting the Ohio governor harder than usual in his first attack ad against him.

The 30-second spot, first tweeted out by Trump, will air throughout the Buckeye State, according to the Trump campaign. The ad comes just days before Ohio's primary on Tuesday and claims Kasich "helped Wall Street predator Lehman Brothers destroy the world economy" and criticizes the Ohio governor for spending time in states other than his own.

Kasich joined Lehman's investment banking division as managing director in 2001, working there until the firm's collapse in September 2008, which unleashed global panic and served as a catalyst for the financial crisis.
