Clients expect, need, demand, robust client service.\u201d\n\nCornerstone opened its doors in 2002 with fewer than 10 staffers and has grown to about 50 employees. Its client sheet includes blue-chip companies, such as Boeing, Nike, Microsoft, Chobani and the spirits manufacturer Beam Inc., in addition to several industry associations and municipal clients.\n\nThe firm already has offices in Baton Rouge, La.; Des Moines, Iowa; Jackson, Miss.; and Austin and Houston in Texas, and is \u201cactively considering\u201d opening offices in Annapolis, Md.; Frankfort, Ky.; and Atlanta over the next 12-18 months.\n\n\u201cPart of the vision that we had [for the firm], was that this was going to take place,\u201d said Geoff Gonella, a president at Cornerstone.\n\nThe firm says that strategy is more helpful than ever, now that Congress has cut back the amount of money that businesses are spending in Washington.\n\nCornerstone also bucked other industry trends over the years, including the merger craze that created combinations of lobbying and PR firms.\n\n\u201cWe looked at the idea of doing public relations, advertising, grassroots and so forth \u2014 as a lot of firms around town have done \u2014 and ultimately decided not to do that,\u201d said Camp Kaufman, the managing partner for state government relations at Cornerstone, saying that the firm wanted to keep its strength in lobbying as the focus.\n\nOne client, for example, hired Cornerstone two years ago, solely for federal lobbying work. But at a recent meeting, the client asked Cornerstone to manage its entire state advocacy operation \u2014 proof, the firm says, that a national portfolio can be built from K Street.\n\nAlthough the state offices have their own teams, each outpost is based around existing connections that lobbyists in the Washington headquarters already have in that location, which expands the firm\u2019s reach for both state-level and federal clients.\n\n\u201cClients more and more are recognizing that, if they can\u2019t get something done \u2014 particularly on big issues \u2014 [that they can] go do it state by state,\u201d Kaufman said.\n\nHaving a national reach is particularly important when clients find themselves embroiled in controversies far from the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cAn industry sector that we work for has been under attack in D.C., but because the activists haven\u2019t been able to get legislation done, they\u2019ve taken their game to cities and states to do it. So, the defensive game has moved from one place to hundreds of places,\u201d said Hunt Shipman, a former Department of Agriculture official and congressional aide. \u201cThey\u2019re having to fight it in states and also in cities.\u201d\n\nThe state offices also have a major upside for Cornerstone\u2019s Washington team, as they can help their clients build relationships with lawmakers on their home turf.\n\n\u201cWe probably have a stronger relationship with the congressional delegations in the states where we have an office,\u201d says Gonella, \u201cin part because of our business in the state, our work in the state, our clients in the state, our advocacy in the state.\u201d\n\nCornerstone says it is projecting total revenue for 2014 of about $19.5 million, with about 20 percent coming from the state offices. And the local number is growing.\n\nThe firm also dabbles in international work, representing the South Korean Embassy and LNG Allies, a coalition of European countries that wants to open up U.S. exports of natural gas.\n\nWhile no formal plans are in the works, Kaufman says that the firm has considered setting up partnerships in places like London or Brussels.\n\nNo matter what comes next, Gonella said Cornerstone intends to stay loyal to its roots as a firm focused on teamwork.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what distinguishes us from other firms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has become a part of the way the firm is organized \u2014 how we compensate people, how we service clients, how we market ourselves, how we brand ourselves, is all centered on that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Cornerstone Government Affairs is in expansion mode.", "description": "Cornerstone Government Affairs is in expansion mode.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
