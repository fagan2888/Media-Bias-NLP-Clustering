But allow me to offer a few cautionary thoughts.\n\nDe Blasio is clearly trying to pressure the Democrats to move to the left. But that is the exact opposite of the Contract with America model. The purpose of the Contract was not to pick a fight within the Republican Party. It was to define a center-right majority with a platform that commanded the broad support of the American people.\n\nBefore he writes his Contract with America from the Left, Mayor de Blasio should call Ed Miliband, who resigned as leader of the British Labour Party after the party was wiped out in elections last week.\n\nThe stunning and totally unexpected victory for Prime Minister David Cameron and the Conservatives holds lessons for both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe historic collapse of the Labour Party and its dramatic underperformance is a warning for those who believe a \u201ctrue\u201d left-wing agenda is the key to electoral victory.\n\nThe historic collapse of the Labour Party \u2026 is a warning for those who believe a \u2018true\u2019 left-wing agenda is the key to electoral victory.\n\nFrom Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\u2019s first victory in 1979, the Conservatives dominated British politics for 18 years until Tony Blair deliberately and methodically moved the Labour Party to the center and won the election in 1997. Blair was so decisive in remodeling the formerly hard-left party that historian Paul Johnson called him Thatcher\u2019s adopted son and said he understood her policies better than her Conservative successor John Major.\n\nThe Labour Party governed from the center under Blair and was amazingly popular. After a decade in office, Blair was succeeded by Gordon Brown in 2007, who moved the party back toward the left. Hammered by the economic crisis in 2010, the Labour Party suffered its biggest loss in 79 years and Brown resigned.\n\nYet the lesson Labour learned from this defeat was the de Blasio lesson. Ed Miliband became leader and moved Labour toward its militant left, redistributionist, big-government base.\n\nThe result is that Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron has governed a center-right coalition that the British people decisively reaffirmed this week.\n\nMayor de Blasio has to come to grips with some powerful realities that will increasingly dominate American politics and government. None of them come from the left.\n\nBritish Conservatives emphasized their concerns for \u201cworking Britons.\u201d In the United States, Maine Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, won reelection last year on similar themes.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan won big in a blue state by emphasizing high taxes and the needs of working Marylanders.\n\nMayor de Blasio wants higher taxes and bigger governments.\n\nPolls indicate Americans want more take-home pay and smaller government.\n\nMayor de Blasio wants to blame the rest of America for the Baltimore disaster. Most Americans know that the Baltimore mayor telling the police to let people have \u201cspace to destroy\u201d is the real disaster.\n\nMayor de Blasio wants government to take more from some Americans to give it to others.\n\nMost Americans want government to quit killing jobs and opportunity. They want to join in creating wealth, not in redistributing it.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible for Mayor de Blasio to create a document in the mold of the Contract with America \u2014 ideas supported by large majorities of Americans \u2014 if it is based on far-left ideas.\n\nIn addition, the 1994 Contract with America was a very specific document committing to specific steps we promised to take.\n\nHouse Republicans had already written implementing legislation for every pledge.\n\nAs President Obama taught us with the stimulus and ObamaCare, the Left can\u2019t write its bills out in the open because the American people would repudiate them as soon as they understand them.\n\nI look forward to Mayor de Blasio\u2019s effort to practice the self-destruction and self-delusion of the British Labour Party, and I would be delighted to debate the merits of our conservative Contract with America compared to his Contract from the Left.\n\nPerhaps we could charge admission for the debate and give the money to our favorite charity or nonprofit. My charity would be the American Museum of Natural History in New York \u2014 so Mayor de Blasio could help raise money for his own city by accepting the challenge.\n\nNewt Gingrich is a former speaker of the US House of Representatives and a CNN contributor.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "New York Mayor de Blasio plans to release a \u201cLiberal Contract with America.\u201d He said he was inspired by the 1994 Contract with America, of which I was the lead architect, and which led to the", "title": "Newt Gingrich blasts de Blasio and his 'Liberal Contract with America'", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/split1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@nypost", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-9672580\"}", "sailthru.tags": "bill-de-blasio,conservatives,liberals,newt-gingrich,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-09 17:00:34", "sailthru.title": "Newt Gingrich blasts de Blasio and his \u2018Liberal Contract with\u00a0America\u2019", "nypost-section": "Metro", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/split1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "New York Mayor de Blasio plans to release a \u201cLiberal Contract with America.\u201d He said he was inspired by the 1994 Contract with America, of which I was the lead architect, and which led to the first House Republican majority in 40 years.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m flattered, Mr. Mayor.
