Maybe the best week.\n\nA trade bill passed in a Republican-led Congress. Massively important Supreme Court decisions on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage. A healing eulogy for slain black church members, toward the end of which \u2013 astonishingly, to many of the thousands who listened at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and the millions who watched on live TV or later on YouTube \u2013 the president led those assembled in the singing of \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d\n\nMuch of Obama\u2019s presidency has been a grind, during which he\u2019s been criticized from both political directions.\n\nThe right never liked him in the first place, and as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell famously said during Obama\u2019s first term, Republicans\u2019 main priority was \u2013 not cooperating to fix a damaged economy the new president had inherited from a Republican administration \u2013 but working to see that Obama was not reelected. The left \u2013 enamored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other liberals \u2013 thought he hewed too much to the political center. The tea party (especially its racist element), the powerful National Rifle Association, \u201cbirthers,\u201d and others mocked and reviled him.\n\nBut by Friday night, at least, the impression \u2013 or at least the imagery \u2013 had changed as the White House was bathed in rainbow lighting, a celebration of Obama\u2019s recent political wins as well as the US Supreme Court\u2019s legalizing same-sex marriage for all Americans no matter where they lived.\n\nIn his daily wrap-up Saturday morning, Politico\u2019s Mike Allen called it \u201cone of the most momentous news days and weeks you \u2013 or even your children \u2013 will ever see.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama aides and former aides, who have been with him from the beginning, tell us this is the biggest week of the eight years,\u201d Allen wrote.\n\nAfter noting the two big court cases (Obamacare and gay marriage) and Obama\u2019s powerful eulogy in Charleston \u201cwhere he spoke as freely, and as emotionally, as he ever has about race during his Presidency,\u201d David Remnick, The New Yorker\u2019s editor, wrote: \u201cIn recent months Obama has also, through executive action, made solid gains on immigration, wage discrimination, climate change, and foreign-policy issues, including an opening, after more than a half century of Cold War and embargo, to Cuba.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese accomplishments \u2013 and potential accomplishments, like a rigorous, well-regulated nuclear arrangement with Iran \u2013 will help shape the coming election,\u201d Remnick wrote. \u201cIn no small measure, Obama, and what he has achieved, will determine the parameters of the debate.\u201d\n\nPresidential legacies must be left to historians, as they have been in recent years regarding Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. And the current reading of Obama\u2019s accomplishments and political strength at this moment may be ephemeral.\n\nBut to journalists who write \u201cthe first rough draft of history,\u201d it\u2019s been a remarkable week for the nation\u2019s first African-American president, who\u2019s had some major political setbacks \u2013 including the last two congressional elections.\n\nWashington Post political blogger Chris Cillizza wrote that Obama\u2019s leading a congregation in Amazing Grace \u201cserved as the coda to Obama's single best week as president \u2013 a week filled with developments, both practical and symbolic, that will reverberate well beyond not only this week or month but his entire presidency.\u201d\n\nNPR\u2019s Ron Elving said Obama\u2019s \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d eulogy in South Carolina, where Gov. Nikki Haley joined other Republicans (including the state\u2019s two US senators) in calling for removal of the Confederate battle flag from Capitol grounds, \u201cconcluded the most shining week of his second term.\u201d\n\nKen Walsh at US News & World report said, \u201cIt was one of the best weeks of President Obama's second term, putting to rest, at least for now, serious talk that he is becoming a lame duck as his presidency enters its final phase.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust eight months ago, people were hanging crepe on the White House, saying \u2018The Obama era is over,\u2019\u201d former Obama senior advisor David Axelrod told The Wall Street Journal. The last several months have been one of the most productive periods at the White House, he said, as Obama has resolved to \u201cmake every day count.\u201d\n\nIn his weekend radio address Saturday, Obama took a victory lap on what is seen as his signature legislative accomplishment, Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThis week, after more than fifty votes in Congress to repeal or weaken this law; after a Presidential election based in part on preserving or repealing this law; after multiple challenges to this law before the Supreme Court, we can now say this for certain: the Affordable Care Act still stands, it is working, and it is here to stay,\u201d Obama said.\n\nNo doubt there will be bumps and ruts in Obama\u2019s political road toward retirement.\n\n\u201cOne can just as easily point to issues that remain of tremendous concern \u2013 the consequences of painting (and revising) \u2018red lines\u2019 with Syria and the early underestimation of ISIS, among others,\u201d The New Yorker\u2019s Remnick writes. \u201cBut the idea that Obama would play out his Presidency, after the political defeat of the midterm elections, as a professorial lame duck turns out to be without basis.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "1e43ccc81d530215897528b6ed062e23", "sailthru.author": "Brad Knickerbocker", "description": "In Congress, at the Supreme Court, and in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, President Obama had an extraordinary week, advancing his agenda on trade, health care, gay rights, and race in America.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/06/917487_1_0627-obama-best-week.jpg_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "In Congress, at the Supreme Court, and in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, President Obama had an extraordinary week, advancing his agenda on trade, health care, gay rights, and race in America.", "title": "Obama\u2019s \u2018best week\u2019 likely to advance his legacy (+video)", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2015/0627/Obama-s-best-week-likely-to-advance-his-legacy-video", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/06/917487_1_0627-obama-best-week.jpg_standard.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/06/917487_1_0627-obama-best-week.jpg_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "description": "In Congress, at the Supreme Court, and in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, President Obama had an extraordinary week, advancing his agenda on trade, health care, gay rights, and race in America.", "site": "@csmonitor", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama\u2019s \u2018best week\u2019 likely to advance his legacy (+video)"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-27", "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-27T12:20:44-04:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/USA/Politics/2015/0627/Obama-s-best-week-likely-to-advance-his-legacy-video", "sailthru.tags": "section-politics,section-usa,class-article,storysource-monitor", "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-06-27T12:20-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "Carolyn Kaster/AP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef35\"", "article_summary": "Maybe the best week.\nNo doubt there will be bumps and ruts in Obama\u2019s political road toward retirement.\nMassively important Supreme Court decisions on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage.\nYears from now, as he thinks back over his presidency, Barack Obama is likely to remember this as one of his best weeks.\nIn Congress, at the Supreme Court, and in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, President Obama had an extraordinary week, advancing his agenda on trade, health care, gay rights, and race in America."}
