And research shows that UV exposure from artificial sources is more damaging and more likely to cause melanoma--the most dangerous skin cancer--when started at young ages.\n\nTo reduce the risk of skin cancer, the FDA proposed a ban that would prevent people from using them before their 18th birthday. On Monday, the proposal was opened for a 90-day public comment period.\n\n\u201cThere haven\u2019t been too many steps the FDA has taken that are probably as important as this one. This really has the potential for saving a lot of lives,\u201d said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research. \u201cOf course, if it\u2019s effective it\u2019ll have a huge impact on the business.\u201d\n\nThe proposed ban, a part of a package of new industry regulations, has been praised by public health groups, but could punish an already an industry that has already been hurt by increased equipment regulation announced last year and the burden placed by a 10% excise tax on the industry imposed by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already heavily regulated\u2026 and now we\u2019ve got two more layers of regulation,\u201d John Overstreet, a spokesperson for the Indoor Tanning Association, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. \u201cWhen you start taking away groups of people like that\u2026 It\u2019s pure profit that goes away when you take customers away.\u201d\n\nThe FDA will work with state and local authorities to enforce the rule, according to the proposal, which doesn\u2019t specify whether resources might be allocated towards an enforcement effort.\n\nThat is the \u201cbig question\u201d right now said DeAnn Lazovich, an associate professor at University of Minnesota\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the actual effect is going to be,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see what would happen.\u201d\n\nBut doctors who treat patients with cancer say the ban would be an important step in the right direction. Dermatologist Dr. Elizabeth Tanzi said her young patients often ask her, \u201cIf it\u2019s so bad for me, why am I allowed to do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis sends a huge message,\u201d she said.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"parsely-author": "Emma Court", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The new regulation for the tanning industry, unveiled Friday, was praised by many doctors groups, though tanning industry groups said it would harm their bottom line.", "creator": "@emmarcourt", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EB866_Tannin_ZG_20151222151625.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-the-fda-wants-to-ban-tanning-beds-for-minors-2015-12-22", "author": "Emma Court", "parsely-title": "Why the FDA wants to ban tanning beds for minors", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-12-22T15:32:00-05:00", "description": "The new regulation for the tanning industry, unveiled Friday, was praised by many doctors groups, though tanning industry groups said it would harm their bottom line.", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The new regulation for the tanning industry, unveiled Friday, was praised by many doctors groups, though tanning industry groups said it would harm their bottom line.", "title": "Why the FDA wants to ban tanning beds for minors", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-the-fda-wants-to-ban-tanning-beds-for-minors-2015-12-22", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EB866_Tannin_ZG_20151222151625.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EB866_Tannin_ZG_20151222151625.jpg"}, "article.id": "B4C159D4-A830-11E5-8F58-F7B780F5883A", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "The skin damage caused by tanning beds doesn\u2019t disappear like a Snapchat...that\u2019s why the Food and Drug Administration wants to ban minors from using them.\nTo reduce the risk of skin cancer, the FDA proposed a ban that would prevent people from using them before their 18th birthday.\nThat is the \u201cbig question\u201d right now said DeAnn Lazovich, an associate professor at University of Minnesota\u2019s School of Public Health.\n\u201cThere haven\u2019t been too many steps the FDA has taken that are probably as important as this one.\n\u201cI\u2019m curious to see what would happen.\u201dBut doctors who treat patients with cancer say the ban would be an important step in the right direction."}
