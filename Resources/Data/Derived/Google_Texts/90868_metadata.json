Hundreds, if not thousands, of people in 17 states got very sick from eating processed chickens, slaughtered in filthy and flawed U.S. poultry plants that remain open and unchanged.\n\nBig deal, you might say, tired of all the media squawking about the astounding number of people who get sick every year from food-borne illness (48 million and rising). It\u2019s just another salmonella scare. It happens to spinach, too.\n\nYes, but what\u2019s happening to chickens shouldn\u2019t happen to a dog.\n\n\u201cBetween slaughter and nugget-ization, chicken carcasses endure a host of perversions, making chicken less of a food and more of a food-like substance,\u201d Deena Shanker wrote in Salon recently.\n\nNever mind that the vast majority or the 300 million egg-laying hens raised in the U.S. are kept in cages too tiny for them to spread their wings. Or that 87 percent of all chickens test positive for E. coli before they\u2019re sent to stores. Or that chickens are known to break their own bones struggling to escape from slaughterhouses, where they live in chronic pain and disease.\n\nNothing new here. Big Chicken has been getting away with murder for a long time. But conditions are now so bad, and so many antibiotics are being fed to the chickens, that they are coming to us laced with antibiotic resistant pathogens.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why a whopping 42 percent of the people who got sick in the October outbreak ended up in the hospital. The normal antibiotics usually effective against salmonella in chickens aren\u2019t working so well anymore.\n\nIn short, the salmonella strains are getting smarter, the number of food and safety inspectors is declining, and eating a chicken leg \u2014 even a kosher one \u2014 is getting to be a real crapshoot.\n\nBut wait! We\u2019ve always been told that if you heat a contaminated chicken to 165 degrees, it kills the bacteria and you\u2019re safe. Probably not. This new super strain of salmonella reportedly survives higher cooking temperatures.\n\nSo the home cook can do everything right: wash it clean; cook it well; and still, you can wind up in the hospital with a serious blood infection that can\u2019t be stopped and can leave you brain damaged. Or dead. Yikes.\n\nAll this is scary stuff, but the perils and pitfalls of eating factory-farmed chicken have been well-known for ages. If you haven\u2019t read Michael Pollan\u2019s \u201cIn Defense of Food,\u201d please do.\n\nWhat is news this October, is that for the first time the USDA is going to allow chickens slaughtered in the U.S. to be processed in China, then returned to the U.S. be sold to, and eaten by, Americans. The word \u201cChina\u201d won\u2019t appear on any label.\n\nThink about it. Poultry processing plants in the U. S are bad enough. Now we\u2019re outsourcing it to plants in China that are notorious for an anything-goes business ethic, where we have no authority, no regulation at all.\n\n\u201cNo USDA officials will be onsite at the Chinese chicken processing plants,\u201d reports Martha Rosenberg in a hair-raising article on AlterNet. org called \u201c7 Horrifying Things About the Chicken You Eat.\u201d\n\nInstead, the Chinese chicken plants will \u201cself-verify\u201d that conditions are up to snuff. Hmmm\u2026 this from a country where a recent bird flu outbreak has already caused 44 deaths and tainted pet treats have killed thousands of dogs and cats.\n\nThis new and controversial policy leaves the Obama administration with a ton of egg on its face. The Center for Science in the Public Interest already considers chicken to be the No. 1 riskiest meat.\n\nWhich brings us to the worst of the worst: chicken nuggets. Rosenberg calls them \u201cchicken yuckets,\u201d reporting that even now, before the Chinese have their way with them, many nuggets are a gross mix of fat, guts, blood vessels, cartilage, nerves, and bone, with only 40 percent actual chicken meat.\n\nWhat else is in chicken nuggets? There\u2019s a video making the rounds this October that is astonishing. Try watching \u201cMcDonald\u2019s Chicken McNuggets revealed under the microscope\u201d on www.Minds.com. Corral your kids into watching, too. If this doesn\u2019t make you all go cold turkey, nothing will.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "New disease straings and fewer inspectors make eating chicken a crapshoot"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0913\"", "article_summary": "org called \u201c7 Horrifying Things About the Chicken You Eat.\u201dInstead, the Chinese chicken plants will \u201cself-verify\u201d that conditions are up to snuff.\n\u201cNo USDA officials will be onsite at the Chinese chicken processing plants,\u201d reports Martha Rosenberg in a hair-raising article on AlterNet.\nWhat else is in chicken nuggets?\nWhich brings us to the worst of the worst: chicken nuggets.\nThe normal antibiotics usually effective against salmonella in chickens aren\u2019t working so well anymore."}
