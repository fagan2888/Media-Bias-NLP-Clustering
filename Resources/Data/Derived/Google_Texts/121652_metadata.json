And during the 2014 debate to do just that, some major US businesses petitioned Congress to terminate the bank, while others fought fiercely to preserve it.\n\nCongress kicked the can down the road by offering a one-year reprieve, a stay of execution that expires on June 30. If lawmakers don\u2019t act in the next few days, the bank and its US$140 billion in financing firepower will be lost.\n\nDelta and Boeing are leading the fight in corporate America on both sides of the issue. Delta stands opposed, arguing the bank gives its foreign rivals an unfair advantage. Boeing, whose customers get the lion\u2019s share of Ex-Im loans, says the bank is essential to support American jobs. The bank doesn\u2019t cost taxpayers a dime; indeed, it makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\n\nSo is the bank a boondoggle that subsidizes risky foreign companies, picking winners and losers at the expense of domestic businesses, or an important (and very profitable) generator of US jobs and exports?\n\nWhat the Ex-Im Bank does\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt established the Ex-Im Bank\u2019s foundations in the 1930s to provide loans and export support to Depression-era American exporters by reducing barriers to trade.\n\nIn 2014, the bank supported $27.4 billion in US exports, issued $20.5 billion in loans and sustained 164,000 jobs, while generating $675 million in profit, according to its latest annual report. This support comes in the form of loans to foreign buyers, insurance for American sellers, and loan guarantees for exporters working with private lenders.\n\nInsurance is actually one of its most important functions. When US companies do business abroad, they take on several types of risk unfamiliar to purely domestic operations. Some are easy to manage, such as foreign exchange risk, which can be hedged in financial markets.\n\nOther types, such as political risk, are much more difficult to insure against because of the many uncertainties surrounding it. Political risk includes things like instability, war, regulatory changes, expropriation and other legal and extralegal changes that affect in-country business operations.\n\nThe Ex-Im Bank thus steps into this breach, encouraging export sales by reducing the riskiness of selling overseas.\n\nThe case for the Ex-Im Bank\n\nProponents of the bank, such as the US Chamber of Commerce, claim the it supports jobs, small businesses and manufacturing in the United States.\n\nAlmost 90% of its loans support small businesses, which generated $10.7 billion in exports from these companies last year, according to the bank. That\u2019s helped it support 1.3 million private sector jobs since 2009.\n\nWithout this support, many small businesses wouldn\u2019t be able to compete with foreign competitors in overseas markets. Governments in many countries subsidize local businesses, while potential US customers often have a hard time securing financing to buy American products.\n\nMost of the bank\u2019s loans and guarantees go toward large companies like Boeing and General Electric, ensuring there\u2019s plenty of financing for expensive and infrequently purchased items like airplanes and boats. But even that support trickles down and helps support many small- and medium-sized businesses that supply the likes of Boeing.\n\nThe case against\n\nOpponents of the bank claim its more like \u201ccrony capitalism,\u201d distorting free markets and picking winners and losers as taxpayers pick up all the risks.\n\nOne way they make this case is by taking aim at the Ex-Im Bank\u2019s claimed profitability, citing a Congressional Budget Office report from 2014 that showed the Ex-Im Bank losing $2 billion over the next decade after adjusting the accounting method used, a sharp contrast with the bank\u2019s projected $14 billion profit.\n\nThey also note that an independent Government Accountability Office reported concerns in 2013 that the overall risk of the bank\u2019s loan portfolio could be higher than estimated and recommended changes to its forecasting model.\n\nOpponents also suggest that if the government were not propping up these businesses, the market would redeploy resources more usefully in the classic economic sense.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board declared, the fight over the Ex-Im bank is part of a larger battle over economic freedom:\n\n\"Commercial activities today are increasingly driven neither by customer wants nor by entrepreneurial judgments but by bureaucratic directives and political preferences.\"\n\nAnother charge is that given the amount of money on the line, its economic contribution is very small. While the 164,000 jobs the bank says it supports seems large, it\u2019s fewer than the number of new unemployment claims filed in the last week of May alone (230,055).\n\nIn addition, the Ex-Im Bank supports only about one-tenth of 1% of the United States economy, while Apple\u2019s 2014 revenue was more than six times the size of the bank\u2019s loan portfolio.\n\nKeeping the bank alive\n\nLike other Washington debates, the reality lies between the competing narratives, and the numbers justify continuing the bank\u2019s charter.\n\nIn terms of risk, the Ex-Im Bank has a remarkably low default rate of less 0.2%. Because so few foreign companies have defaulted on their loans, the bank has returned billions of dollars to taxpayers in interest income, $7 billion since 1992 alone. The bank expects to make another $14 billion in the next nine years.\n\nAnd the CBO report uses a flawed analysis to show the bank will lose money rather than make a tidy profit. It overweights near-term losses while underweighting long-term gains by using a higher discount rate than it should. The \u201cdiscount\u201d interest rate is used to figure the net present value of future cash flows. The analysis leaves the outflows, or loans, untouched, yet reduces the value of future payments, so that even if a borrower repays in full, it would show up as a loss in the present.\n\nAs long as the Ex-Im Bank charges interest rates higher than its own borrowing rate and keeps default rates low, the bank will remain profitable for the government.\n\nIn sum, the Ex-Im Bank provides a benefit to the US economy by supporting big businesses and small ones alike and bolstering employment, especially endangered manufacturing jobs. By providing investment guarantees, the bank encourages both foreign buyers and domestic manufacturers to work together when private insurance solutions are unavailable.\n\nOther industrialized nations provide similar services to support their own manufacturers. Cutting off an essential financial security layer will harm American businesses.\n\nThis success, at no expense to taxpayers, shows why Congress should keep the bank alive.\n\nJames P Howard, II is Adjunct Faculty, Public Administration at University of Baltimore.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.
