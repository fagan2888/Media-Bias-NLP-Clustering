A Fort Walton Beach teen is behind bars and being charged with fleeing from officers, and DUI with property damage in Jackson County early Sunday morning.

Officers arrested 19-year-old Matthew Riley Teems when officers say they saw his vehicle coming off Interstate 10 and onto the on ramp for Highway 231, traveling against traffic.

Officials say the vehicle passed Dilmore Road in Cottondale, stopped on Highway 231, backed up and turned eastbound on Dilmore Road at a high rate of speed.

The pursuit continued down Dilmore Road to the dead end at Stanland Road, where the suspect's vehicle crashed into a telephone pole.

The suspect jumped from the vehicle and attempted to flee on foot but the deputy was able to grab him and then Teems began striking the officer.

The suspect then got away from the officer and fled from one wooded area across a pasture into another wooded area.

After another short foot pursuit, the suspect was taken into custody by the K-9 tracking teams.

During this foot pursuit the suspect did damage a privacy fence of a home in the area.

Teems is being charged with fleeing attempting to elude, resisting with violence, battery of a law enforcement officer, five traffic citations, DUI with property damage, leaving the scene of the accident, and reckless driving.
