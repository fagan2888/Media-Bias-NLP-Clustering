(AP) - Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was hired as a consultant for a mechanical contractor after his conviction in a federal corruption case.\n\nBay Mechanical Inc. CEO Rod Rodriguez tells The Virginian-Pilot (http://bit.ly/1BIXoKg) he offered McDonnell the job in September. It was about a week after the former governor and his wife, Maureen, were found guilty of taking gifts and loans from a vitamin executive in exchange for promoting his products.\n\nRodriguez, who has known McDonnell for about a decade, said he simply wanted to help a friend in need.\n\n\u201cI just said, \u2018What can I do to help?\u2019\u201d Rodriguez said Friday. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say, \u2018Give me a job.\u2019\u201d\n\nMcDonnell started the new job in October. Rodriguez said McDonnell has worked 24 to 30 hours a week at the company\u2019s Virginia Beach headquarters.\n\nRodriguez said the former governor\u2019s monthly salary is around $5,000.\n\nMcDonnell\u2019s work has yet to produce new contracts, but \u201cwe are getting more and more calls from people he met with,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nThere\u2019s been no backlash over the hiring, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people in this area that feel about Bob like I do that I knew it would not hurt me,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nThe job offered occurred at the home of McDonnell\u2019s sister, Maureen Carney McDonnell.\n\nAlthough he had other consulting job offers, Bob McDonnell \u201cdecided working with Rod would be the best fit for him,\u201d she said. \u201cRod is a great business leader, Bob is a great businessman himself, and so the two got along.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell was sentenced earlier this month and is scheduled to begin his two-year prison term Feb. 9. McDonnell\u2019s wife will be sentenced Feb. 20.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Virginia Gov.
