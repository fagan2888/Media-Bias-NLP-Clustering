They have a sparkling new ace after signing former Dodgers star Zack Greinke, a right-hander, to a six-year contract worth $206.5 million. In Shelby Miller and Patrick Corbin, the D-backs also have two more pitchers who would qualify as an ace \u2014 at least if they pitched for the Rockies.\n\nSan Francisco has Madison Bumgarner. San Diego has James Shields, although he disappointed in his first season as a Padre when he gave up 33 home runs.\n\nThat leaves the Rockies as the only team in the National League West without a pitcher who has shown he can consistently be counted on to start a winning streak, stop a losing streak and give his teammates a rush of confidence every time he takes the mound.\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d I can hear some of you scream, \u201cwhat about Jorge De La Rosa?!\u201d\n\nI admire De La Rosa as much as anybody, and at times last season he was very good. His 8.1 strikeouts per nine innings were his most since 2010, and his 3.26 road ERA was solid.\n\nBut De La Rosa turns 35 at the beginning of this season, and keep in mind that assorted injuries limited him to just 149 innings across 26 starts in 2015. Finally, throw in the fact that he\u2019s in the final year of his contract and will almost certainly be trade bait by July. So it\u2019s tough to count on him for the entire season.\n\nAssuming the Rockies don\u2019t trade for a front-line pitcher \u2014 and that\u2019s beginning to look like a solid assumption \u2014 who will be their quasi-ace in 2016?\n\nMy money is on right-hander Chad Bettis.\n\nAfter revamping his delivery during spring training last year, Bettis went 8-6 with a 4.23 ERA in 20 starts. A cleaner delivery helped his fastball command, which in turn set up a nasty curveball and changeup. He effectively worked the bottom of the strike zone in the final portion of the season, going 3-2 with a 2.97 ERA in his last seven starts.\n\nJust as important, Bettis has a warrior\u2019s mentality. Jon Gray might be the Rockies\u2019 most talented pitcher, but he\u2019s still trying to fit into his major-league jersey.\n\n\u201cChad\u2019s got an adult mentality and seriousness about his craft, and a desire to be part of something bigger than himself,\u201d general manager Jeff Bridich said during the winter meetings.\n\nBettis, of course, can\u2019t solve all of the Rockies\u2019 pitching woes, but I\u2019m betting he is their best starter in 2016.\n\nWar of words between Roy Halladay and Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds\n\nIn case you missed it, two-time Cy Young Award winner Roy Halladay, a graduate of Arvada West High School, fired a verbal fastball at Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds last week as the Hall of Fame vote came down.\n\nTweeted Halladay: \u201cWhen you use PEDs you admit your not good enough to compete fairly! Our nation\u2019s pasttime should have higher standards! No Clemens no Bonds!\u201d\n\nI have two thoughts. One, good for Halladay. Two, don\u2019t we wish the players \u2014 and the media \u2014 had spoken out during the steroid era?\n\nFactoid of the week\n\nAs ESPN\u2019s Jayson Stark noted, after 51 years of the MLB draft, Ken Griffey Jr. last week became the first overall No. 1 pick to make it to the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe NFL, meanwhile, has sent 12 No. 1 picks to Canton \u2014 seven of them since the baseball draft came into existence. They are Troy Aikman, Earl Campbell, Lee Roy Selmon, Terry Bradshaw, Ron Yary, O.J. Simpson and some guy named Elway.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders @denverpost.com or @psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saunders: Chad Bettis needs to pitch like an ace for 2016 Rockies", "title": "Saunders: Chad Bettis needs to pitch like an ace for 2016 Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/09/saunders-chad-bettis-needs-to-pitch-like-an-ace-for-2016-rockies/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T13:56:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:31:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Patrick Saunders"}, "article_summary": "The Rockies don\u2019t have an ace, at least not in the Clayton Kershaw sense of the term.\nAssuming the Rockies don\u2019t trade for a front-line pitcher \u2014 and that\u2019s beginning to look like a solid assumption \u2014 who will be their quasi-ace in 2016?\nBettis, of course, can\u2019t solve all of the Rockies\u2019 pitching woes, but I\u2019m betting he is their best starter in 2016.\nJon Gray might be the Rockies\u2019 most talented pitcher, but he\u2019s still trying to fit into his major-league jersey.\nIn Shelby Miller and Patrick Corbin, the D-backs also have two more pitchers who would qualify as an ace \u2014 at least if they pitched for the Rockies."}
