Deval Patrick's administration may have exaggerated its progress in building Massachusetts' new Obamacare website to avoid losing federal funds \u2014 and even tried to hide gaping holes in the Health Connector portal \u2014 according to a local think tank that has released a bombshell report.\n\nThe Pioneer Institute report contends the Patrick administration \u201cvastly overstated\u201d the progress in building the massive website to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and that project leaders failed to hold vendor CGI accountable for \u201cshoddy work\u201d and missed deadlines.\n\nCiting internal documents and whistleblower accounts from former project officials at UMass Medical Center, who came forward in early 2014, Pioneer also sent its findings in an October 2014 letter to the head of the FBI and other federal watchdog agencies. One of the whistleblowers told the Herald he has already been questioned by the FBI.\n\n\u201cAlthough the state knew as early as September 2012 that the project was behind schedule and off track, the UMass Medical team chose to conceal CGI\u2019s deficiencies rather than remedy them,\u201d reads the report authored by health care expert Joshua Archambault of Pioneer. The \u201cCommonwealth misrepresented the project\u2019s progress, both in a March 2013 connectivity test with the Federal Data Services Hub, and in a May 2013 presentation to CMS.\u201d\n\nThe October 2014 letter from Pioneer to the FBI claims \u201cthe Commonwealth appears to lie about progress on project to keep funds.\u201d\n\nThe case could put two political allies in an awkward position, with the administration of President Obama investigating the inner workings of the administration of longtime friend former Gov. Deval Patrick. Patrick could not be reached for comment yesterday. His former secretary of Health and Human Services, John Polanowicz, declined to comment, saying he had not seen the report.\n\nThe report states that in a May 2013 presentation to CMS, the state team \u201cmade claims about the HIX project (the Obamacare website) that vastly overstated the amount of work that had been successfully completed.\u201d\n\nThe state system was in such bad shape ahead of a critical test with the federal Obamacare portal that it tried to simply use free outside software \u2014 not developed by state officials \u2014 to quickly plug sections of the site and make it look completed, the report states.\n\nOne of the whistleblowers cited in the report, in an interview with the Herald, claimed he was fired by a supervisor in early 2013 after objecting to several time-saving shortcuts proposed by CGI.\n\n\u201cHe pulled me into his office,\u201d the whistleblower, who spoke to the Herald on condition of anonymity, said of the supervisor, \u201cand said, \u2018We have to let you go. It\u2019s not my decision, but the opinion is you\u2019re being too hard on CGI.\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice in January issued subpoenas for Health Connector documents dating back to 2010.\n\nCGI said in a statement to the Herald that the problems leading up to the website were beyond the company\u2019s control, but that it continued to help the state even after a new developer was brought in.\n\n\u201cCGI repeatedly warned the commonwealth regarding a number of the points raised in the Pioneer Institute\u2019s report, including the facts that delays in critical decision-making, changing priorities, and a lack of technical requirements from the Connector threatened the goal of a successful launch on Oct. 1, 2013,\u201d said CGI spokeswoman Linda Odorisio. \u201cDespite these hurdles, CGI conducted itself professionally and ethically throughout the project, and unequivocally rejects any suggestion that it performed otherwise.\u201d\n\nUMass Medical Center said in a statement it \u201cacted appropriately at all times during its work with the Connector. We have been assisting and fully cooperating with the Attorney General, the US Attorney and the EOHHS Office of Inspector General.\u201d\n\nBaker administration spokeswoman Elizabeth Guyton said, \u201cWhen it comes to the Health Connector, the Baker-Polito administration\u2019s sole focus is fixing the broken system it inherited so that people can access the health care they need. The administration is cooperating with the (Department of Justice) subpoena regarding the Health Connector\u2019s difficulties dating back to 2010.\u201d\n\nThe Pioneer Institute estimates the Health Connector website disaster ultimately will cost taxpayers $1 billion.\n\n\u00a92015 the Boston Herald.
