The decision to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act was an issue in gubernatorial races across the country, including six where party switches could have meant insurance coverage for at least a million Americans.\n\nBut it was not to be. On Tuesday, voters cast their ballots in favor of Republican governors in five of those states.\n\nVoters in Maine, Wisconsin, Kansas and Georgia backed candidates who do not support accepting the federal money to expand Medicaid. In Florida, they re-elected Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who paid lip service to the idea but added enough caveats to put it in doubt.\n\n\n\nThe one exception could be Alaska, where Independent Bill Walker leads against Republican incumbent Sean Parnell.\n\nAnd after Tuesday\u2019s rough night for Democrats nationwide, one state may even drop off the list. Arkansas was one of 27 states and D.C. to expand access to coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but newly elected Gov. Asa Hutchinson may reverse course. His campaign website says he will assess the benefit and long-term costs of the states expansion program, and \u201cdetermine whether the program should be terminated or continued.\u201d\n\nRon Pollack, executive director of health care reform advocacy group FamiliesUSA says though the \u201cincremental opportunities\u201d for expansion they were hoping would result from elections are essentially dashed, he believes there will be continued progress in states.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a number of states get serious about getting to yes about the medicaid expansion,\u201d Pollack says. \u201cThe task in front of us is not a whole lot different than it was 24 or 48 hours ago.\u201d\n\nExpansion is still likely in some states including Tennessee, Wyoming, and Utah, where governors have signaled real interest in expanding coverage. Re-elected Republican Gov. Matt Mead in Wyoming has shifted his views on accepting federal funds for Medicaid, which in 2013 he all-out rejected.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Voters' decisions in five governors' races dampened the hopes of Affordable Care Act boosters.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Voters' decisions in five governors' races dampened the hopes of Affordable Care Act boosters.", "title": "Medicaid Expansion Likely Off the Table in 5 States", "url": "http://time.com/3558691/medicaid-expansion-obamacare-elections/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/lepage-governor.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/lepage-governor.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Voters' decisions in five governors' races dampened the hopes of Affordable Care Act boosters.", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Medicaid Expansion Likely Off the Table in 5 States"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "204 election, governor, medicaid, medicaid expansion, obamacare, affordable care act, health care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "204 election, governor, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, health care"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7fb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a number of states get serious about getting to yes about the medicaid expansion,\u201d Pollack says.\nRe-elected Republican Gov.\nVoters in Maine, Wisconsin, Kansas and Georgia backed candidates who do not support accepting the federal money to expand Medicaid.\nIn Florida, they re-elected Republican Gov.\nThe decision to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act was an issue in gubernatorial races across the country, including six where party switches could have meant insurance coverage for at least a million Americans."}
