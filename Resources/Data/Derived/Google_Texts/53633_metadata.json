Bush and who was a high-ranking immigration official overseeing the 1986 amnesty in the Reagan administration, declared his campaign in March, as reported first by The Washington Times.\n\nHe has not appeared to have gained significant traction, but he is listed among the 18 candidates on the Republican National Committee\u2019s website straw poll.\n\nFox News has one debate and one forum scheduled for Thursday. The prime time debate, limited to the top 10 candidates, will be decided by who\u2019s polling the best. The forum, which will run earlier in the day and is open to others who don\u2019t make the top stage, is open to those who are regularly included in pollsters\u2019 lists \u2014 a concession to allow those who don\u2019t score even 1 percent of the vote to make it.\n\nMr. Everson said it\u2019s the fourth set of rules Fox has announced, and he said they are acting arbitrarily and using \u201cinexcusably exclusionary tactics.\u201d\n\n\u201cFox News has missed the boat,\u201d he said.\n\nHis complaint to the FEC argues that Fox is giving unfair candidate promotion by changing its criteria to allow other poor-showing candidates entry into the forum, but still keeping him off the stage.\n\nMr. Everson said in scrapping the 1 percent threshold for the forum, Fox is admitting that polls are irrelevant, but yet is still relying on the list of names pollsters are asking.\n\n\u201cOur position is that there are 18 candidates,\u201d he told The Times.\n\nMichael Clemente, executive vice president of Fox News, said they\u2019ve always had set rules for the debate.\n\n\u201cAll candidates who meet our criteria and are included in the five most recent national polls will be eligible for the debates,\u201d Mr. Clemente said in a statement.\n\nThere are more than 100 candidates registered with the FEC as Republicans, though most of those have little government experience and are considered to have little bearing on next year\u2019s election.\n\nUsing polls to determine who gets on stage is standard practice, and Fox and other networks used them as part of selection criteria in determining debate participation in 2012.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mark Everson, a former chief of the IRS who is making a long shot bid for the GOP's presidential nomination, said he is filing a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Monday challenging the method Fox News is using to pick the candidates on stage for Thursday's first primary debates.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Mark Everson, a former chief of the IRS who is making a long shot bid for the GOP\u2019s presidential nomination, said he is filing a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Monday challenging the method Fox News is using to pick the candidates on stage for Thursday\u2019s first primary debates.", "title": "Mark Everson, former IRS chief, challenges Fox News debate", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/3/mark-everson-former-irs-chief-challenges-fox-news-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/05/6d9fead75011e70a6f0f6a706700478f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/05/6d9fead75011e70a6f0f6a706700478f.jpg", "description": "Mark Everson, a former chief of the IRS who is making a long shot bid for the GOP's presidential nomination, said he is filing a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Monday challenging th", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mark Everson, former IRS chief, challenges Fox News debate"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Federal Election Commission, Mark W Everson, Fox News Channel"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc430\"", "article_summary": "Using polls to determine who gets on stage is standard practice, and Fox and other networks used them as part of selection criteria in determining debate participation in 2012.\nMichael Clemente, executive vice president of Fox News, said they\u2019ve always had set rules for the debate.\nFox News has one debate and one forum scheduled for Thursday.\nMr. Everson said in scrapping the 1 percent threshold for the forum, Fox is admitting that polls are irrelevant, but yet is still relying on the list of names pollsters are asking.\nThe prime time debate, limited to the top 10 candidates, will be decided by who\u2019s polling the best."}
