Perhaps they should try that line on the producers of \u201cIron Man 3\u201d and \u201cFast Furious 6,\u201d which have earned more than 2 billion American dollars from paying customers in movie theaters around the world.\n\nDo the doomsayers mean that moviegoing isn\u2019t what it used to be, as a central ritual of culture, and that all too often (as with going to see the movies mentioned above) it involves the charm, ambiance and quality control of dining at Burger King? Inarguably true. But the old model of buying a ticket and sitting in the dark among strangers has proven remarkably robust, even in what\u2019s been called a \u201cpost-cinematic\u201d age. Of course many people will end up seeing this year\u2019s three leading Oscar contenders \u2014 \u201cAmerican Hustle,\u201d \u201cGravity\u201d and \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d \u2014 on TVs and computer monitors and mobile devices. But all three of those invigorating and remarkably different movies are fundamentally big-screen adventures, belonging to a tradition that stretches from D.W. Griffith to Hitchcock to Kubrick to Scorsese, and they will most reward those who actually leave the house to go see them.\n\nWhen it comes to lower-budget independent film, the specialty of the Sundance Film Festival \u2014 which kicked off on Thursday in the Utah mountains, with founder Robert Redford fending off questions about his Oscar snub \u2014 the \u201cdeath of cinema\u201d pronouncements have a more complicated resonance. This year\u2019s opening-night premieres included Damien Chazelle\u2019s feature \u201cWhiplash,\u201d with Miles Teller of \u201cThe Spectacular Now\u201d as a tormented young jazz drummer, and the documentary \u201cDinosaur 13,\u201d about the complicated turf battles that followed the historic discovery of an intact T-rex skeleton in South Dakota. Those may be absolutely terrific films (I haven\u2019t seen either yet), but they\u2019re exactly the kind of movie that will play briefly in a few dozen to a few hundred theaters (at best) and that people are likeliest to catch on VOD or iTunes or Netflix.\n\nBut does that mean that Sundance, and the entire indie-film ecology it represents, has become irrelevant, a second-rate stepcousin to all the hot cable dramas people actually watch and care about? Not at all. Without question, Sundance has retrenched since its years of maximum cultural hotness (from the mid-\u201890s through the mid-\u201800s), when the place was packed wall-to-snowbank with random celebrities \u2014 I once ran into Tom Brady, Paris Hilton and David Bowie during the course of a single afternoon \u2014 and product-launch parties. Redford and his festival director, John Cooper, have shifted the focus back to actual movies \u2014 and the actual movies have gotten a hell of a lot better.\n\nRedford has genuinely never thought of Sundance as a launching pad for movies that would make a ton of money, but I think both he and former head honcho Geoff Gilmore got a bit distracted by the glitz and glamour of the festival\u2019s trendiest years. Now Sundance has returned to being an artistic incubator for young or unorthodox or innovative talent of the sort that defies ordinary storytelling conventions and isn\u2019t likely to get a three-season dramatic miniseries deal with HBO or Showtime. Try to imagine pitching a cable network or a mainstream Hollywood producer on the premise behind \u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild.\u201d (\u201cWell, so the main character is this little girl who speaks only in voice-over. Her dad is played by a guy we met in a bakery, and her mom works in a floating brothel. I think. And then there are these giant boars, or tusked hamsters, or something. I\u2019m not really sure what they are, or if they\u2019re real.\u201d)\n\nYou could say pretty much the same about \u201cUpstream Color\u201d or \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d or \u201cAin\u2019t Them Bodies Saints,\u201d to mention just three of the premieres in last year\u2019s memorable Sundance lineup. That 2013 festival, likely one of the best ever, also included \u201cBefore Midnight,\u201d \u201cConcussion,\u201d \u201cDon Jon,\u201d \u201cIn a World \u2026,\u201d \u201cKill Your Darlings,\u201d \u201cMother of George\u201d and \u201cThe Way, Way Back,\u201d along with three of this year\u2019s five Oscar-nominated documentaries (\u201cCutie and the Boxer,\u201d \u201cDirty Wars\u201d and \u201c20 Feet From Stardom\u201d) and at least two others that should have been (\u201cAfter Tiller\u201d and \u201cBlackfish\u201d). That\u2019s the kind of cultural mojo I can get behind, post-cinematic age or not.\n\nSometimes those movies will connect with mainstream audiences and academy voters and so forth \u2014 although no one in their right mind would have predicted such a fate for Benh Zeitlin\u2019s \u201cBeasts,\u201d the big hit of Sundance 2012. But more often they won\u2019t, or won\u2019t quite. Some of those directors will be making the Hollywood thrillers and Showtime dramas of the future, following after Steve McQueen and David O. Russell and Vince Gilligan and David Chase. Others will remain on the cultural margins, on purpose or by happenstance, pushing at the boundaries of artistic possibility and reminding us that the three-act structure, the boy-and-girl-kept-apart and the pseudo-unexpected character kill-off at the end of Season 3 are not the only means of seduction.\n\nAre the movies dead? Well, they long ago lost their high-minded claim on cultural primacy and supremacy, and it was about time too. A lot of movies are terrible-looking junk made for bad reasons, definitely not worth spending 13 bucks on so that some kid can spill a Mountain Dew on your loafers and the couple next to you can text their dinner plans during the sex scene. I\u2019ve heard it all before. But there were always terrible movies in abundance; more good ones are made around the world today than ever before, and American independent cinema is in the middle of a barely noticed boomlet. If that\u2019s the death of movies. I\u2019ll take it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Oscar nominees are sensational and Sundance is better than ever.
