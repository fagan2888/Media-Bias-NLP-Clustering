California will do the same in March. And now, health care organizations in Illinois are working with state legislators to increase access to birth control methods without additional costs, possibly making it available over the counter.\n\n\u201cNo specific steps have been taken so far to introduce over-the-counter birth control, but the conversation is starting to bubble up,\u201d said Kathy Waligora, director of the Health Reform Initiative at EverThrive Illinois, an organization advocating for the health of women, children and families. \u201cThe issue is really being considered by a lot of people.\u201d\n\nThe new legislation in Oregon and California does not technically make birth control available over the counter. While women can bypass a visit to their doctor, they will still have to fill out a questionnaire with a pharmacist before purchasing birth control.\n\nLifting the requirement for a prescription to purchase oral contraceptives altogether would certainly benefit women\u2019s reproductive health, likely resulting in a decreased number of unintended pregnancies. However, offering over-the-counter birth control does present its hurdles, according to Brigid Leahy, director of government relations at Planned Parenthood Illinois Action.\n\nLeahy explained that over-the-counter birth control might increase costs for women who do not have medical insurance. Currently, under the Affordable Care Act, women with appropriate medical coverage can purchase oral contraceptives without any additional copayment. However, most insurance plans do not cover the costs of over-the-counter drugs. This might inadvertently turn over-the-counter birth control into a barrier to women\u2019s access to contraception, considering that according to Planned Parenthood estimates, a birth control pack can cost as much as $50 a month or $600 a year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d Leahy said.\n\nThat\u2019s why Planned Parenthood Illinois Action, EverThrive Illinois and other organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union are working with lawmakers to pass legislation to increase coverage of oral contraceptives.\n\nUnder the proposed Illinois Contraceptive Coverage Act, insurance companies would be required to cover all forms of oral contraceptives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including over-the-counter birth control and emergency contraception, Waligora said.\n\nEverThrive Illinois recently partnered with the Section of Family Planning and Contraceptive Research at the University of Chicago to conduct a review of birth control coverage among health insurance plans in Illinois.\n\n\u201cMany insurance companies were not covering as wide a range of contraceptives as we would like to see,\u201d said Lee Hasselbacher, policy coordinator at the Section. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act guidelines reflect the understanding that women should have access to the birth control that works best for them without additional costs \u2014 the legislation introduced in Illinois would try to make that a reality for women at a practical level.\u201d\n\nWaligora said it is still too early in the process to know whether women in Illinois can eventually purchase birth control through a pharmacist or directly over the counter. Plus, only the FDA can ultimately approve over-the-counter birth control \u201cso the hurdles there are at the federal level,\u201d Hasselbacher said.\n\nFor now, EverThrive Illinois and other organizations committed to women\u2019s health are watching Oregon and California closely to see what happens, especially as health care providers in the two progressive states are assessing potential risks associated with the new regulations.\n\nHowever, Waligora said that because birth control is a safe, low-risk medication, women can feel comfortable seeking guidance and explanations directly from pharmacists upon purchasing oral contraceptives, though that does not substitute regular medical checkups. She added that EverThrive Illinois has been directing its efforts at educating legislators and the general public about the benefits of over-the-counter birth control.\n\n\u201cResearch shows that any time you can remove barriers to birth control, it\u2019s more used and more effectively,\u201d Waligora said. \u201cWomen have busy lives, and this is about decreasing any barrier, whether in costs or time.\u201d\n\nPhoto at top: Over-the-counter birth control would increase access to oral contraceptives, but health care organizations fear extra costs for women who do not have medical coverage.
