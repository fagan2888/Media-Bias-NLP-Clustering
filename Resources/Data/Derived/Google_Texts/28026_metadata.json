For much of the political world, the two months of healthcare.gov troubles were \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina,\u201d Watergate, and the end of progressive governance, rolled up into a single package.\n\nA year later, the great start to the open-enrollment process has largely been treated as an afterthought, though the successes are hard for anyone to deny.\n\nMore than 1 million people used the U.S. healthcare.gov system to sign up for Obamacare plans in the seven days ending Dec. 12, the best week yet for enrollment in the program\u2019s second year. In total, 2.5 million Americans have signed up for health insurance plans since Nov. 15, when the online system opened for business, the government said today in a statement. The Obama administration\u2019s goal for 2015 is to get 9.1 million paying customers in plans sold under the law. Of people who have enrolled so far using healthcare.gov, 52 percent already had coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and 48 percent were new customers.\n\nTo provide some additional context, last year, after three months, 2.2 million consumers had signed up for coverage through healthcare.gov. This year, after one month, it\u2019s 2.5 million.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this figure understates the national total because it doesn\u2019t include Americans who\u2019ve enrolled in state-based exchange marketplaces.\n\nCharles Gaba, whose projections are eerily good \u2013 and have actually been slightly more accurate that HHS\u2019s own figures on occasion \u2013 has revised his projections and believes total ACA enrollments should reach 12.5 million by the end of the open-enrollment period.\n\nEven many \u201cObamacare\u201d optimists didn\u2019t expect to see this much success at this point.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Even many ACA optimists didn't expect to see this much success at this point in the process.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obamacare-enrollments-continue-impress", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Even many ACA optimists didn't expect to see this much success at this point in the process.", "title": "Obamacare enrollments continue to impress", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obamacare-enrollments-continue-impress", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/obama.jpeg-04540_2.jpg?itok=KMT1N_kH", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obamacare-enrollments-continue-impress", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/obama.jpeg-04540_2.jpg?itok=CKR9aHIL", "height": 553}, "title": "Obamacare enrollments continue to impress", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Even many ACA optimists didn't expect to see this much success at this point in the process."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-17T09:27:44-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care,health-care-policy,health-care-reform,obamacare,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Obamacare enrollments continue to impress", "published": 1, "date": "12/17/2014 09:27:44 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obamacare-enrollments-continue-impress"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Even many ACA optimists didn't expect to see this much success at this point in the process.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Health Care, Health Care Policy, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4f0\"", "article_summary": "A year later, the great start to the open-enrollment process has largely been treated as an afterthought, though the successes are hard for anyone to deny.\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s open-enrollment process got off to a genuinely awful start last year, and was, for a time, one of the biggest news stories in the country.\nTo provide some additional context, last year, after three months, 2.2 million consumers had signed up for coverage through healthcare.gov.\nMore than 1 million people used the U.S. healthcare.gov system to sign up for Obamacare plans in the seven days ending Dec. 12, the best week yet for enrollment in the program\u2019s second year.\nEven many \u201cObamacare\u201d optimists didn\u2019t expect to see this much success at this point."}
