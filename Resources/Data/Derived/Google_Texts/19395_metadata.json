(AP) \u2014 No one around the Washington Redskins harbors doubt about whether DeAngelo Hall has the know-how and competitive spirit necessary to come back from two \u2014 count \u2019em, two! \u2014 operations on a torn Achilles tendon.\n\nLeast of all the ever-confident Hall himself, of course, who answered with a simple \u201cYeah\u201d and a chuckle when asked whether he can regain his starting job. He is, don\u2019t forget, second among active NFL players with 43 interceptions.\n\nThe question, really, for the cornerback, who turns 32 in November, and the team is whether he\u2019ll be able to fully recover physically.\n\n\u201cThe mental part of the game, he has. And I still see his skills. Does he need to clean up his footwoork? Does he need to get his angles correct? Does he need technique work? Yes, he does. But that\u2019ll all return with time,\u201d defensive backs coach Perry Fewell said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it slow with DeAngelo. A lot of people are not able to get back and play at a high level after that type of injury.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Hall sat out Saturday\u2019s walkthrough and practice \u2014 the first of training camp with full pads \u2014 after participating with the first-team defense during Days 1 and 2. Fewell said Hall will follow that pattern for now: work two days, then take a day off.\n\n\u201cNot being in football in 10 months, I\u2019m going to need some monitoring, as far as reps and things like that, just to make sure I don\u2019t kill myself in the first two weeks,\u201d Hall said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a little bit of anxiety \u2014 kind of anxiousness, nervousness, excitement \u2014 so it felt a little different. But once you get on the field, it\u2019s still football. My leg still worked. Still not quite as explosive as I want to be, and they say that\u2019s going to take some time, but I feel good.\u201d\n\nHaving Hall ready for the regular season took on increased importance for Washington when defensive back Bashaud Breeland was suspended for Week 1\u2019s game against Miami. In addition, Breeland injured a ligament in his right knee at practice on Friday and is expected to miss the next four to six weeks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Redskins CB DeAngelo Hall returns from 2 Achilles operations", "title": "Redskins CB DeAngelo Hall returns from 2 Achilles operations", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Redskins CB DeAngelo Hall returns from 2 Achilles operations", "title": "Redskins CB DeAngelo Hall returns from 2 Achilles operations", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/08/01/redskins_cb_deangelo_hall_returns_from_2_achilles_operations/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/redskins-camp-football.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Redskins CB DeAngelo Hall returns from 2 Achilles operations", "title": "Redskins CB DeAngelo Hall returns from 2 Achilles operations", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/redskins-camp-football.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Howard Fendrich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bc6\"", "article_summary": "Fewell said Hall will follow that pattern for now: work two days, then take a day off.\nDoes he need technique work?\nLeast of all the ever-confident Hall himself, of course, who answered with a simple \u201cYeah\u201d and a chuckle when asked whether he can regain his starting job.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsRICHMOND, Va.
