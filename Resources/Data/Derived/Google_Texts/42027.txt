To save the cost of renovations and to take advantage of the value of its prime Boston location, the 118-bed New England Baptist Hospital is moving within 10 years, according to the Boston Globe.

The hospital, known for orthopedics, is leaving its 19-acre campus atop Mission Hill in Boston, where it has been treating patients for 119 years.

Relocation is expected to take as long as a decade. It may be combined with a new facility for Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, according to the source. Both hospitals belong to CareGroup and signed a partnership agreement last year.

“Over the next several years, we will be undertaking a review of all options including potentially on or near BIDMC’s campus as part of our joint venture partnership,” said Lisa Rand, spokesperson for New England Baptist Hospital. “At the present time, no site has been identified for consideration.”

The Baptist campus is valued at about $170 million.
