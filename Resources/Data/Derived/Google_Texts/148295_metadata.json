It\u2019s easy to fall into a trap of victim-blaming, suggesting that those hit were visiting unseemly websites, hadn\u2019t updated all their add-ons, or \u2014 the worst of all possible sins \u2014 were using Internet Explorer.\n\nAnd you\u2019d be at least be somewhat right, especially on the third point. The browser of choice for those who don\u2019t know any better, Internet Explorer is a prime target for exploiters, hackers and identity thieves. IE\u2019s demographic skews older and less tech-savvy, cementing it as an easy target.\n\nThe name itself has such a stigma that Microsoft\u2019s newest browser initiative, codenamed Project Spartan, seeks to distance itself from the sins of its predecessor as much as possible.\n\nRelated: 10 Biggest Tech Flops of the Century\u200b\n\nStill though, if the results of the latest Pwn2Own hacking competition are any indication, the other options aren\u2019t quite as infallible as your office IT guy might like to think.\n\nThe contest, hosted annually by HP\u2019s Zero Day Initiative and Google\u2019s Project Zero, invites professional and amateur \u201cwhite hat\u201d hackers to find vulnerabilities in operating systems and software. It\u2019s a win-win for the participants and the hosts \u2014 the victorious hackers get a nice hunk of legal cash while software developers have critical security flaws brought to their attention.\n\nIn the browser test, administered last Thursday, the hosts challenged hackers to find their way into a remote computer by way of a series of browser exploits. At the end of the day, Internet Explorer ranked the worst, with four found exploits, while three were found for Mozilla\u2019s Firefox and one for Google Chrome.\n\nThese exploits allowed hackers to access the system, elevate permissions and modify other settings.\n\nRelated: Will Regulators Take Your Passwords Away?\u200b\u200b\n\nThe runaway winner of this year\u2019s Pwn2Own was JungHoon Lee, an extremely talented lone wolf with the online handle \u201clokihardt.\u201d He found major exploits in the four most popular browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and Safari. For his efforts, he took home $225,000 in total prize money. Of that, $110,000 was from his two-minute hack of Chrome, the biggest payout in competition history.\n\nThis means that during his hack of Google Chrome, he was earning $833 a second.\n\nBy this point, most of the flaws exposed ibn the contest have been \u2014 or soon will be \u2014 patched, but if a teenager can unearth one in a couple of minutes, there\u2019s almost certainly more out there. While Lee\u2019s skills were definitely impressive, the contest also draws attention to the fact that no browser is foolproof, even if it may be safer than IE.\n\nThe best advice, as always, is to practice safe browsing, avoid suspicious sites and keep both your browser and your third-party add-ons religiously up-to-date.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s easy to scoff at anyone who has the unfortunate luck to suffer a browser exploit,", "title": "If You're Reading This, Your Browser Could be Hacked", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/26/If-Youre-Reading-Your-Browser-Could-be-Hacked", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06182012_Hacked_Money_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/26/If-Youre-Reading-Your-Browser-Could-be-Hacked", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06182012_Hacked_Money_article.jpg", "creator": "@lumbology", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s easy to scoff at anyone who has the unfortunate luck to suffer a browser exploit,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In the browser test, administered last Thursday, the hosts challenged hackers to find their way into a remote computer by way of a series of browser exploits.\nThe browser of choice for those who don\u2019t know any better, Internet Explorer is a prime target for exploiters, hackers and identity thieves.\nIt\u2019s easy to scoff at anyone who has the unfortunate luck to suffer a browser exploit, the term for a website-based attack that uses weaknesses in your browser software to gain control over your computer.\nThe best advice, as always, is to practice safe browsing, avoid suspicious sites and keep both your browser and your third-party add-ons religiously up-to-date.\nAt the end of the day, Internet Explorer ranked the worst, with four found exploits, while three were found for Mozilla\u2019s Firefox and one for Google Chrome."}
