Mark Udall\u2019s office in a dispute over Affordable Care Act cancellations, failed Friday to provide information about the panel\u2019s makeup or its review.\n\nThe Department of Regulatory Agencies, through a Colorado Open Records Act request submitted by The Denver Post, was asked for names and job titles of individuals on the panel, as well as lists of people interviewed in the review. The department received a similar CORA request from The Colorado Observer, a conservative news outlet.\n\nThe regulatory agency, overseen by Gov. John Hickenlooper, did not provide the information. Instead, agency officials responded to the records request by providing several pages of e-mails between division of insurance staffers and Udall\u2019s staff.\n\nSome of those e-mails played a key role in earlier reports from The Post and several news outlets. Others did not include information about an investigative panel or suggest that an investigation was taking place.\n\nThe e-mails showed correspondence in mid-November between the division of insurance and Udall\u2019s office. After media reports of the conflict earlier this month, state Rep. Amy Stephens, R-Monument, who is vying to unseat Udall, a Democrat, in his 2014 re-election bid, called for an investigation.\n\nIn stating that DORA had concluded its review on Jan. 14, the department\u2019s executive director, Barbara Kelley, a Hickenlooper appointee, sent a letter to Stephens just days after her request for an investigation.\n\nKelley wrote that \u201cupon learning of your letter through the media, a comprehensive fact-finding review was conducted.\u201d Kelley added that the review by \u201ca neutral and objective panel\u201d from her office \u201cinterviewed a number of Division of Insurance staff, collected and reviewed e-mails and other correspondence\u201d to make its findings.\n\nBut this week, Kelley wrote to The Post and other media: \u201cFor clarification purposes, the Department first conducted a fact-finding review, focused exclusively on DORA (which includes the division of insurance) staff and processes, actions and perceptions during and after the e-mail exchanges in early to mid-November, with Sen. Udall\u2019s staff. Having found no evidence of any intimidation or coercion \u2026 there was no need to proceed with any further investigation.\u201d\n\nIn the November e-mails that started the conflict, a director at the division of insurance, Jo Donlin, felt Udall\u2019s staff was unjustly trashing its report that nearly 250,000 Colorado residents received insurance policy cancellations due to Obamacare. Udall\u2019s office has stressed that because the majority of those individuals received renewal options, the figure was misleading to the public.\n\nKelley\u2019s response to Stephens\u2019 letter was direct: a \u201cneutral and objective panel\u201d found \u201cno evidence of any intimidation and \u2018the level of coercion by Sen. Udall and/or his staff\u2019 was zero.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman from DORA on Friday said only that the department \u201cfully complied\u201d with the CORA requests and did not respond to additional inquiries about the panel.\n\nA spokesman for Hickenlooper directed all inquiries to DORA.\n\nUdall\u2019s spokesman said the senator\u2019s office played no role in DORA\u2019s review.\n\nIn the weeks since the issue came to the forefront, DORA staffers, including Division of Insurance Commissioner Marguerite Salazar, have lauded Udall\u2019s office and said only \u201cheated conversations\u201d between the offices occurred.\n\nDonlin has never spoken publicly about the conflict.\n\nThe initial reports of the CORA response created a firestorm on social media Friday with Republicans on the attack, assailing Kelley, Udall and Hickenlooper.\n\nThe \u201clack of honesty and accountability\u201d is \u201castonishing,\u201d Colorado GOP Party Chairman Ryan Call, said in a statement.\n\nKurtis Lee: 303-954-1655, klee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kurtisalee\n\nRead the letter: DORA\u2019s response to an open records request. denverpost.com/extras", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado regulators fail to provide info on panel in Sen.
