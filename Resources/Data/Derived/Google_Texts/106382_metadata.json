If the option is available, the council will hold a special meeting before April to amend the plan.\n\nThe city\u2019s health insurance has to be renewed before April to prevent risking a loss of coverage, albeit temporarily, City Treasurer Angela Orr said.\n\nLast week\u2019s action came less than seven months after the carrier threatened to cancel the plan. In September, Regence sent a letter to the city objecting to a system of payments that three members of the City Council received to purchase their own health insurance outside the city\u2019s group plans.\n\nThe issue created a dispute between former Mayor Dewayne Briscoe and the council, including council members Keith Saks, Michelle Griffith and Jane Conard, who received the payments.\n\nThe three said they ended the payments after getting clarification on their legality from an outside law firm hired by the city. Under guidelines enacted with the Affordable Care Act, local governments and other organizations are barred from offering employees cash compensation to buy individual plans.\n\nThe council members disputed that they should be considered employees. However, they agreed to stop the payments, and Regence dropped the threat to cancel the plan.\n\nConard said the city has been in compliance since then, but officials plan to sit down with a company about potentially resuming a similar form of payments.\n\nConard said payments could continue for retired council members through a type of health reimbursement account called a \u201cvoluntary employees beneficiary association plan.\u201d Those plans are available to retirees to pay for medical costs, and Conard said city officials plan to meet with representatives from Gallagher VEBA to discuss setting up the accounts.\n\nConard said Regence helped set up the meeting and has no problem with the accounts, which are allowed under section 501(c)(9) of the IRS code to municipal governments.\n\nConard said the city\u2019s premiums have risen since last year. In 2015, the city paid a monthly premium of $21,457. To renew the plan for this year would cost $25,158 per month.\n\nBroken down to a per-employee basis, the premiums for the $21,475 plan cost $476 per month for an individual and $570.90 for an employee and spouse, according to the city\u2019s insurance broker, Starley Leavitt.\n\nConard said she recommended renewing with Regence versus finding a different insurance carrier. She said the cost increases are minor when broken down to a per-employee basis, and Idaho municipalities have limited options because the market is so small.\n\nIn shopping for insurance companies, Conard said, she expected to find six to 10 options, when it was actually three to four.\n\n\u201cThis is a message to our city employees,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to pay a little bit more for your health insurance. It\u2019s not the good old days. Times are tough.\u201d\n\nMayor Peter Hendricks said the Regence plan offers more providers and more access to complementary care such as visits to a chiropractor or acupuncturist.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Idaho Mountain Express Newspaper", "description": "While it will have to swallow some cost increases, the city of Sun Valley will renew its health insurance plan with Regence BlueShield of Idaho.", "title": "Sun Valley to renew Regence health plan", "url": "http://www.mtexpress.com/news/sun_valley/sun-valley-to-renew-regence-health-plan/article_a95f5730-e589-11e5-8b80-9722a52ad94a.html", "image": "http://mtexpress.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/og_image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IdahoMtExpress", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "While it will have to swallow some cost increases, the city of Sun Valley will renew its health insurance plan with Regence BlueShield of Idaho.", "fb": {"app_id": 135817296433862}, "keywords": "sun_valley", "news_keywords": "sun_valley"}, "article_summary": "While it will have to swallow some cost increases, the city of Sun Valley will renew its health insurance plan with Regence BlueShield of Idaho.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to pay a little bit more for your health insurance.\nTimes are tough.\u201dMayor Peter Hendricks said the Regence plan offers more providers and more access to complementary care such as visits to a chiropractor or acupuncturist.\nAt its meeting last Thursday, March 3, the City Council tentatively voted 4-0 to approve renewing the plan.\nThe city\u2019s health insurance has to be renewed before April to prevent risking a loss of coverage, albeit temporarily, City Treasurer Angela Orr said."}
