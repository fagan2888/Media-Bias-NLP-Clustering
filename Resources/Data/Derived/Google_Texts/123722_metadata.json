Coyle has covered the court for the past 28 years.\n\nMarcia Coyle, chief Washington correspondent for the National Law Journal, discussed \u201cThe Impact of Recent Supreme Court Decisions\u201d at the Morning Forum of Los Altos Nov. 17.\n\nCoyle has covered the U.S. Supreme Court for 28 years. She regularly appears on \u201cThe PBS News Hour\u201d and has received many awards for her work, including the George Polk Award, the Investigative Reporters and Editors Award and the Scripps Howard Foundation Award.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is an institution of government that despite deep ideological differences never shuts down and gets the job done on time,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, it comes back the next year to do it all over again. Obviously, this is not the United States Congress.\u201d\n\nCoyle\u2019s most recent book, \u201cThe Roberts Court: The Struggle for the Constitution,\u201d provides candid insight into the court and its nine justices.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito make up the conservative majority, while justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan represent the liberal minority.\n\nOne justice said the high court should be named after the president who appointed the most recent justice rather than after the chief justice.\n\n\u201cThis would make this court \u2018The Obama Court,\u2019\u201d Coyle said. \u201cThis would surprise the president, because even though there have been victories for the president in upholding major parts of the Affordable Care Act and in legalizing gay marriage, there have been serious defeats in contraception health insurance coverage for women, campaign finance, union rights, the environment and voting rights.\u201d\n\nIdeological lines\n\nThe media focus on the Supreme Court\u2019s cases of major significance and high drama, which often result in 5-4 decisions.\n\nWhile the court routinely splits along ideological lines, the last term proved that the voting blocs are not always monolithic.\n\nEach justice would deny practicing politics, according to Coyle. Indeed, many times the court found consensus \u2013 for example, in cases concerning social media, free speech, employment discrimination and religious freedom in prisons.\n\nCoyle said nearly all significant questions in the U.S. are ultimately resolved judicially. Since 2005, conservative and libertarian lawyers have made concerted efforts to move cases onto the Supreme Court\u2019s docket because they think that they will have a better chance to change the law than in Congress.\n\nLiberals have also used the Supreme Court to change the law. The process, she said, is called \u201ccause litigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court is facing new challenges in cases about law and technology and its implications for personal privacy, and in cases concerning international relations and the roles of Congress, the president and the Court,\u201d she said. \u201cThese cases require knowledge of other countries\u2019 laws and customs as well as our own. There are no easy cases in the Supreme Court. The most insignificant case can be the toughest.\u201d\n\nThe Morning Forum of Los Altos is a members-only lecture series that meets at Los Altos United Methodist Church, 655 Magdalena Avenue.
