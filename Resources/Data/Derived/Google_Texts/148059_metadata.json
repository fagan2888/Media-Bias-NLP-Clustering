Reuters\n\nFlorida State University football coach Jimbo Fisher has had a remarkable year. His team, the FSU Seminoles, is undefeated at 13-0. The team\u2019s quarterback, Jameis Winston, won the 2013 Heisman trophy. And the Seminoles are headed to the BCS National Championship game on Jan. 6. But amid all of these successes, Fisher sees another opportunity: the team\u2019s winning streak can help bring attention to the rare blood disorder Fanconi Anemia, which his 8-year-old son, Ethan, suffers from.\n\n\"I love what I do,\" said Fisher, according to CNN. \"The more success I have, the more awareness I can bring to this disease.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Ethan was diagnosed with Fanconi anemia after a bad bout with the flu. Doctors initially told the Fishers that Ethan\u2019s platelet count was low, but it wasn\u2019t anything to worry about. Then, at a check up a few months later, Ethan received his diagnosis. The family was devastated. \"All we knew about the disease was what we looked up online,\" said Fisher. \"It was all the worse-case scenario. We thought it was a complete death sentence.\u201d\n\nAccording to the University of Maryland Medical Center, Fanconi anemia is an inherited blood disease that results in a decreased production of all blood cells, including platelets. The disease occurs most often in children between the ages of 2 and 15. Symptoms of Fanconi anemia include short height, abnormal heart, fatigue, and changes in skin coloration. Fanconi anemia patients are at increased risk for acquiring acute myeloid leukemia as well as neck, breast, and brain cancers, according to CNN. There\u2019s no cure for the disease, but with treatment it can be managed.\n\n\"We're committed to finding a cure,\" Fisher said during an interview with ESPN. \"Anything can be cured and that's our commitment. We're going to find a cure. We're on a quest to find a cure.\"\n\nEthan\u2019s mom, Candi Fisher, said the family is keeping a close eye on his condition. \"Right now, there's not any treatment,\" she said. \"It's just kind of a waiting game right now. He'll have to have his blood work redone every three months, and he'll have to do an updated bone marrow biopsy once a year. They'll just keep watching his counts and when he starts showing a decline, then he'll have to advance to treatment.\"\n\nThe Fishers created the \u201cKidz 1st Fund\u201d shortly after Ethan\u2019s diagnosis to raise awareness and funds to support Fanconi amemia research.
