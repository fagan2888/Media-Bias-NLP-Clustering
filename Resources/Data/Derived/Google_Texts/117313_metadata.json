The Rutgers Health Group will become a state-wide faculty practice that is made up of more than 1.000 Rutgers-based physicians, dentists, psychologists, nurses, pharmacists and other clinicians. The network will include the teaching hospitals, community centers, medical groups, wellness centers and other affiliated entities and partners.\n\nThe new approach will provide patients with access to multidisciplinary teams of care providers, which officials said will minimize the number of hospital admissions, reduce paperwork, eliminate unnecessary duplication of service and prevent medical errors. It will also allow the network to leverage its statewide presence to negotiate with vendors to obtain better healthcare costs.\n\n\"Ultimately, all Rutgers Health locations will represent a place patients can go to receive all of their care--to get well and to stay well,\" Brian Strom, executive vice president for health affairs and chancellor of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, said in the announcement.\n\nHe also told the Courier-Post the move will give Rutgers \"the ability to give a kind of medical care that hasn't been available in the state of New Jersey before.\"\n\nRutgers President Robert Barchi told the publication the decision was one of necessity. If the university didn't create an integrated clinical entity, he said the organization would have likely lost millions of dollars in reimbursement as the industry moves away from fee-for-service to value-based payments.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the announcement\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n20 schools join AMA effort to bring medical education into the future\n\nUniversity of Kansas launches clinical integration after 3 years' planning--and 6-month delay\n\n6 principles to integrate leadership between physicians and hospitals\n\n4 steps for successful hospital-physician integration", "article_metadata": {"description": "As part of a new team-based approach to healthcare, Rutgers University plans to create a new clinical branch that will put its medical school faculty and clinical staff into one health provider network--a move that officials say will revolutionize patient care across New Jersey.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As part of a new team-based approach to healthcare, Rutgers University plans to create a new clinical branch that will put its medical school faculty and clinical staff into one health provider network--a move that officials say will revolutionize patient care across New Jersey.", "title": "New Jersey state university takes new team approach to healthcare", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/new-jersey-state-university-takes-new-team-approach-healthcare/2016-04-08", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,clinical integration,Operations & Business Management,Rutgers University,team-based care,value-based care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34e8\"", "article_summary": "The plan calls for Rutgers Health to serve as the clinical arm of the university, becoming the single brand for all Rutgers patient care and patient services.\nHe also told the Courier-Post the move will give Rutgers \"the ability to give a kind of medical care that hasn't been available in the state of New Jersey before.\"\nAs part of a new team-based approach to healthcare, Rutgers University plans to create a new clinical branch that will put its medical school faculty and clinical staff into one health provider network--a move that officials say will revolutionize patient care across New Jersey.\nThe Rutgers Health Group will become a state-wide faculty practice that is made up of more than 1.000 Rutgers-based physicians, dentists, psychologists, nurses, pharmacists and other clinicians.\nIt will also allow the network to leverage its statewide presence to negotiate with vendors to obtain better healthcare costs."}
