It is, after all, supposed to be a season of reflection and joy. How to do this? Let families take their education tax dollars to religious schools.\n\nIt sounds counterintuitive. How do we promote social harmony if people who believe different things are allowed to separate themselves along religious and philosophical lines? Aren\u2019t schools supposed to foster the quintessential American melting pot by bringing children with different beliefs together?\n\nEmerging research on private and government schools shows giving people the freedom to educate children according to their beliefs actually promotes tolerance better than forcing people of vastly diverging views into conflict with each other over school policies. The irreligious are often offended at schools that let children hold prayer services, sing Christmas carols at assemblies, or post nativity scenes. The United States has long revered its tradition and laws regarding government support for religion, and for good reason: The idea is to allow everyone to believe as he wishes, and express those beliefs, without government endorsing or censuring those beliefs.\n\nPublic schools as they are now structured have the utterly impossible task of trying to please everyone. Obviously, they can\u2019t. Calling the break \u201cwinter solstice\u201d censors those who revere this season, yet calling it \u201cChristmas break\u201d assumes everyone who attends the school celebrates (or should celebrate) the religious tradition of a particular faith. Even if a certain faith is dominant in a particular community, U.S. law and tradition rightly protect those who practice minority religions. Government should not arbitrate religion. It should, instead, get out of religion\u2019s way.\n\nIn April, the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice published a review of all the high-quality research comparing private and government schools on a variety of measures, including social harmony. The research shows private schools foster more desegregation, social harmony, and civic engagement. Such studies typically ask students to name the group of people they dislike the most \u2013 such as the KKK, Nazis, or religious minorities \u2013 and then say whether they would let such groups exercise legally protected rights such as voting, publicly demonstrating, or letting libraries stock books sympathetic to their views. A study that examined a private voucher program in Washington, DC found voucher students were more likely than similar public school students to agree they would \u201cdefinitely permit\u201d the group they liked least to perform civic actions such as giving a public speech or running for president, reports study author Greg Forster. Studies that control for selection bias of children attending private schools confirm these results for all private school students, not just voucher students.\n\nThese Christmastide disputes are only a reminder that the system of public schools fosters intolerance and conflict in myriad areas. If we want more joyful seasons all year \u2019round, we have to stop demanding public schools attempt the impossible by forcing everyone to do the same thing, and instead set families free to celebrate their beliefs both in and outside of their kids\u2019 schools.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/12/how-to-end-the-tiresome-christmas-debate-in-schools/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/a-charlie-brown-christmas.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "How to End the Tiresome Christmas Debate in Schools"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0884\"", "article_summary": "Studies that control for selection bias of children attending private schools confirm these results for all private school students, not just voucher students.\nThese Christmastide disputes are only a reminder that the system of public schools fosters intolerance and conflict in myriad areas.\nPublic schools as they are now structured have the utterly impossible task of trying to please everyone.\nLet families take their education tax dollars to religious schools.\nThe research shows private schools foster more desegregation, social harmony, and civic engagement."}
