For example:\n\nAugusta Health in Fishersville, 23.28 percent.\n\nMartha Jefferson in Charlottesville, 10.57 percent.\n\nRockingham Memorial Hospital in Harrisonburg, 7.69 percent.\n\nUVA Medical Center, 7.43 percent.\n\nAugusta has since placed its margin is between 8.5 percent and 13.5 percent. All four facilities are \u201cnot for profit.\u201d\n\nA Washington Post editorial Sunday declared that Fredericksburg-based University of Mary Washington Healthcare is in dire straits:\n\n\u201cIt lost $30 million over the past two years and, having borrowed heavily to finance an expansion, is burdened by debt. Its $185 million in reserves represents less than half a year\u2019s operating capital.\u201d\n\nEchoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe and fellow Democrats in the General Assembly, the Post prescribed Medicaid expansion as the cure.\n\n\u201c(Expansion) would give the state an enormous economic lift, generate thousands of jobs and provide health-care coverage to at least 250,000 Virginians. In the process, it would sustain hospitals whose financial health depends on unlocking federal funding,\u201d the Post opined.\n\nA local Republican leader mocked the hospitals\u2019 Medicaid campaign as corporate \u201crent-seeking\u201d from the public purse.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think a system that can afford to lavish bonuses and nearly seven-figure salaries on its senior executives is in any danger of bankruptcy, or of having to cut back drastically on the services they offer,\u201d said Steve Albertson, GOP chairman in neighboring Stafford County, referring to UMW Healthcare.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that hospitals, and lots of other large corporations, often carry debt strategically, often manage balance sheets strategically, and can be in excellent financial health even while posting an operating loss,\u201d Albertson, a lawyer, told Watchdog.org.\n\nA tax document obtained by Watchdog revealed that the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association paid its president, Laurens Sartoris, $553,082 in 2011. The industry lobbying group\u2019s top three executives earned more than $1 million combined that year, the latest year for which data is available.\n\nHospitals in Virginia are not required to provide their audited financials to the public.\n\nHouse Republicans \u2014 led by Speaker Bill Howell, R-Falmouth, and state Delegate Steve Landes, R-Verona \u2014 see no need for Virginia to rush into Medicaid expansion when Washington continues to delay Obamacare rules.\n\nThe president has extended Medicaid reimbursement formulas through October 2015, meaning no reductions in indigent-care funding to hospitals for at least 18 months.\n\n\u201cThe whole reason we\u2019re having this discussion is that (Medicaid expansion) is a key part of Obamacare,\u201d said Nicole Riley, president of Virginia\u2019s 5,500-member National Federation of Independent Businesses.\n\n\u201cOur members have no faith that the federal government will make good on its promises,\u201d she said. NFIB wants a top-to-bottom audit of state Medicaid.\n\n\u201cInstead of advocating a massive increase in an entitlement program, it is time for hospitals to re-evaluate their dependence on federal dollars. They should look from within for ways to cut costs,\u201d said Craig DiSesa, director of legislation at the conservative Middle Resolution PAC.\n\nA recent study found that up to 39 percent of health-care spending could be eliminated without harming consumers or reducing quality of care at hospitals.\n\nLooking to the Medicaid-budget special session that starts Monday in Richmond, Albertson suggested, \u201cIt would be nice to see some language that reduces hospital payments by an amount similar to any compensation paid to their executives for lobbying or political activity.\u201d\n\nKathryn Watson contributed to this report.\n\nKenric Ward is chief of Watchdog.org\u2019s Virginia Bureau.
