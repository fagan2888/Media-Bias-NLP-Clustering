Donna Edwards (D-Md.) offered an amendment to the Interior Department spending bill to do away with the restrictions, but it failed on a 180-249 vote.\n\nEdwards cited potential dangers to public health and the environment if ozone standards are kept at the status quo.\n\n\u201cBreathing ozone is dangerous for everyone, but particularly for children, for the elderly and people of all ages who have lung diseases,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe need to allow the EPA -in fact, empower the EPA - to follow the science and create minimum standards necessary to protect public health.\u201d\n\nUnder the Clean Air Act, the EPA must review its ozone standards every five years, though it is not necessarily required to change them.\n\nRepublicans said that it would be premature and costly to make ozone standards even stricter after establishing a rule in 2008.\n\n\u201cBefore we finish that job, EPA wants to move the goalposts,\u201d said Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas). \u201cThis bill simply includes a pause button on new EPA rules until we can finish the job and reach our current mandates.\u201d\n\nThe House is expected to pass the underlying Interior Department appropriations bill on Thursday, after debating more than 100 amendments.\n\n- Devin Henry contributed.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A GOP spending bill limits the EPA's ability to regulate ozone.", "description": "A GOP spending bill limits the EPA's ability to regulate ozone.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A GOP spending bill limits the EPA's ability to regulate ozone.", "title": "House rejects lifting restrictions on ozone regulations", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/247241-house-rejects-lifting-restrictions-on-ozone-regulations", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/247241-house-rejects-lifting-restrictions-on-ozone-regulations", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-08T15:03-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cristina Marcos", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Cristina Marcos", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Environmental Protection Agency, ozone rule,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-08T15:03:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/247241-house-rejects-lifting-restrictions-on-ozone-regulations", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A GOP spending bill limits the EPA's ability to regulate ozone.", "card": "summary", "title": "House rejects lifting restrictions on ozone regulations"}, "dcterms.title": "House rejects lifting restrictions on ozone regulations"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18b5\"", "article_summary": "offered an amendment to the Interior Department spending bill to do away with the restrictions, but it failed on a 180-249 vote.\nEdwards cited potential dangers to public health and the environment if ozone standards are kept at the status quo.\nRepublicans said that it would be premature and costly to make ozone standards even stricter after establishing a rule in 2008.\nThe House rejected a proposal on Wednesday to eliminate a provision in a GOP spending bill that would restrict the Obama administration\u2019s ability to enforce air quality standards for ozone.\nUnder House Republicans\u2019 2016 spending bill for the Department of Interior, the Obama administration could not propose or implement ozone regulations below the current air quality standard unless 85 percent of counties that don\u2019t currently meet it are fully compliant."}
