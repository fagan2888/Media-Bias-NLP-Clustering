If the rumors are true, then HBO’s “On the Run Tour” special might be the last time that we see Jay Z and Beyoncé drunk in love. HBO has released a 50-second trailer for the concert special, which opens with a seductive Beyoncé serenading Jay Z in a smoky lounge, singing Sonny Bono’s “Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)” and then bursts with color and energy, showing clips from their North American tour. The special premieres Saturday, Sept. 20, at 9 p.m.
