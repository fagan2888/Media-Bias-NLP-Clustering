The VDLC has risks throughout the process but some of the highest risks come when a venture is moving from one capital raise phase (e.g. seed or angel) to another (e.g. VC, growth equity, or PE). Experienced investors already know that de-risking startups as they move from seed to angel to VC to later stage capital is necessary. Unfortunately, investors don\u2019t always work together in a strategically integrated approach throughout the VDLC, putting earlier stage capital at more risk than is necessary.\n\nTraditionally it\u2019s the entrepreneur that has had the job of understanding each investors\u2019 risk tolerance and de-risking approach. However, many entrepreneurs don\u2019t know really how to evaluate their product/market fit risk, capital risk, execution risk, and the myriad other problems they\u2019re likely to face. Entrepreneurs shouldn\u2019t be left to integrate the various investors on their own; instead, investors should form strategic partnerships with other investors where they formally form a vertically integrated supply chain throughout the VDLC.\n\nThis idea of a vertically integrated group of investors is nothing new. In fact, on March 10th at MedCity News\u2019s MidAmerica Healthcare Venture Forum in Chicago, the organizers plan to cover this topic in a great panel called \u201cAngel and Venture Partnerships Done Right\u201d. The speakers include:\n\nDon Ross, Managing Director and Founder, HealthTech Capital (@HealthTechCap)\n\nJan Garfinkle, Founder and Managing Director, Arboretum Ventures (@ArboretumVC)\n\nChris Seper, Vice President of Healthcare, Breaking Media (@chrisseper)\n\nDon, Jan, and Chris will talk about trends, deals and best practices when angels and VCs can work together. I\u2019m hoping they will discuss how angels and earlier stage capital can better collaborate with payer investors and VCs through more diverse and sophisticated syndications. When early and late stage capital get more involved in advisory roles with their investments throughout the VDLC, de-risking innovations becomes easier and more successful innovations will get to market faster.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Entrepreneurs shouldn\u2019t be left to integrate various investors on their own; instead, investors should form strategic partnerships with other investors where they formally form a vertically integrated supply chain.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Entrepreneurs shouldn\u2019t be left to integrate various investors on their own; instead, investors should form strategic partnerships with other investors where they formally form a vertically integrated supply chain.", "title": "Strategically integrated investors help de-risk innovations in the Venture Development Lifecycle", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Company-financing-lifecycle-chart.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-26T23:30:08-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/02/strategically-integrated-investors-help-de-risk-innovations-venture-development-lifecycle/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Company-financing-lifecycle-chart.jpg", "description": "Entrepreneurs shouldn\u2019t be left to integrate various investors on their own; instead, investors should form strategic partnerships with other investors where they formally form a vertically integrated supply chain.", "card": "summary", "title": "Strategically integrated investors help de-risk innovations in the Venture Development Lifecycle - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,midamerica healthcare venture forum, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "MedCitizens", "tag": "midamerica healthcare venture forum", "published_time": "2015-02-27T06:05:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-26T23:30:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "However, many entrepreneurs don\u2019t know really how to evaluate their product/market fit risk, capital risk, execution risk, and the myriad other problems they\u2019re likely to face.\nThis post is sponsored by the MidAmerica Healthcare Venture Forum.\nTraditionally it\u2019s the entrepreneur that has had the job of understanding each investors\u2019 risk tolerance and de-risking approach.\nUnfortunately, investors don\u2019t always work together in a strategically integrated approach throughout the VDLC, putting earlier stage capital at more risk than is necessary.\nWhen early and late stage capital get more involved in advisory roles with their investments throughout the VDLC, de-risking innovations becomes easier and more successful innovations will get to market faster."}
