A Wynnewood man was charged with two counts of first-degree manslaughter after a two-car crash back in October 2013 that resulted in the deaths of a mother and her unborn child.

Pauls Valley Police arrested 25-year-old Matthew Imotichey early Thursday morning.

Imotichey was charged for a crime that occurred on Oct. 23, 2013. On that date Pauls Valley police responded to a two-vehicle collision near Indian Meridian Rd. and Arrowhead Dr. At the scene, police found 21-year-old Tonia Pando severely injured. Pando, who was pregnant, died at the hospital on Nov. 3.

An investigation into the incident determined that Imotichey traveled left of center and collided with Pando's vehicle head on. At the time of the crash it was suspected that Imotichey was intoxicated, but because he was transported to the hospital as well, only a blood draw was performed.

Last Friday, Pauls Valley Police say they received the final piece of evidence that indicated Imotichey was indeed intoxicated at the time of the crash. With that evidence, police were able to obtain an arrest warrant and on Thursday Imotichey was taken into custody at a home in Sulphur.

Imotichey was booked into the Garvin County Jail on two felony counts of first-degree manslaughter. His bond was set at $50,000.
