The Russian leader\u2019s decision to send warplanes and naval vessels into the territory of his European neighbors, even as his troops are participating in what amounts to an invasion of eastern Ukraine, sparked the call on Sunday for the creation of a European Union Army, specifically designed to counter Russia.\n\nIn an interview published in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, European Union Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said, \u201cWith its own army, Europe could react more credibly to the threat to peace in a member state or in a neighboring state.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Dead Soldiers Are Evidence of His Deceit\n\nHe said there would be no intent to deploy such an army immediately, \u201cBut a common European army would convey a clear message to Russia that we are serious about defending our European values.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSuch an army would help us design a common foreign and security policy,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cEurope's image has suffered dramatically and also in terms of foreign policy, we don't seem to be taken entirely seriously.\u201d\n\nJuncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg, has long been an advocate of a common EU defense force \u2013 an idea that has not always been popular. These days, however, the idea appears to be gaining some traction.\n\nWelt am Sonntag also quoted Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the chairman of the German Bundestag\u2019s foreign affairs committee as saying, \u201cA common European army is a European vision, whose time has come.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin Throws Wrench in Iran Nuke Talks\n\nLate last month, a task force chaired by the Javier Solana, the EU\u2019s former High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and a one-time Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, came to a similar conclusion.\n\nWhile the task force found that EU countries face a number of threats, including radical jihadists and others, the military might of Moscow was arguably the most serious concern.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s infiltrations in Ukraine and provocations to member states\u2019 territorial water and air defenses have\u2026delivered a blow to Europe\u2019s post-Cold War security order and have revived awareness in the EU about the possibility of military attack and occupation in Europe,\u201d the task force report found.\n\nCalling for \u201cbold and concrete steps towards a more efficient and effective framework for military cooperation,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cWe firmly believe that the time has come for the creation of a European Defense Union that supports NATO in its task to provide territorial defense. An ambitious EU foreign policy aimed at reducing instability and state fragility at the Union\u2019s borders will take on and live up to security responsibilities in the strategic neighborhood through the use of military force and rapid response as needed.\u201d\n\nNot all EU member countries are interested in creating a collective army. The United Kingdom has been firmly against such a move, and a spokesperson for Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s government said in a statement Sunday that nothing has changed.\n\n\u201cOur position is crystal clear that defense is a national, not an EU responsibility and that there is no prospect of that position changing and no prospect of a European army,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The top official on the European Commission on Sunday called for the creation of a pan-European army, in large part to counter the aggression of Russian President Vladimir Putin.", "title": "Spooked by Putin, EU Brass Considers a European Army", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/09/Spooked-Putin-EU-Brass-Considers-European-Army", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03182014_Putin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/09/Spooked-Putin-EU-Brass-Considers-European-Army", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03182014_Putin.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The top official on the European Commission on Sunday called for the creation of a pan-European army, in large part to counter the aggression of Russian President Vladimir Putin.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf571\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOur position is crystal clear that defense is a national, not an EU responsibility and that there is no prospect of that position changing and no prospect of a European army,\u201d the statement said.\nIf Russian President Vladimir Putin has been trying to make his European neighbors nervous, he may have succeeded beyond his expectation.\nWhile the task force found that EU countries face a number of threats, including radical jihadists and others, the military might of Moscow was arguably the most serious concern.\nAn ambitious EU foreign policy aimed at reducing instability and state fragility at the Union\u2019s borders will take on and live up to security responsibilities in the strategic neighborhood through the use of military force and rapid response as needed.\u201dNot all EU member countries are interested in creating a collective army.\n\u201cEurope's image has suffered dramatically and also in terms of foreign policy, we don't seem to be taken entirely seriously.\u201dJuncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg, has long been an advocate of a common EU defense force \u2013 an idea that has not always been popular."}
