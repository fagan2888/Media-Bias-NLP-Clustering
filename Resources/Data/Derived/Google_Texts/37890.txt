Perry pens post-apocalyptic novel for teens

Wisconsin writer Michael Perry, who has amused, instructed and inspired adult readers with such books as "Population: 485" and "Truck: A Love Story," has turned to middle-grade readers with his new novel, "The Scavengers" (Harper).

In a glowing appraisal, Kirkus Reviews called it "a fast-paced, post-apocalyptic Laura Ingalls Wilder wilderness story, complete with morning chores and Ma's dreams of a cabin with windows."

Teen Maggie and her family have chosen to live outside the Bubble Cities, where they face the ravages of uncontrollable weather and zombielike freaks seeking genetically modified corn. One of the book's characters, Perry says, is inspired by Milwaukee urban farm pioneer Will Allen.

Perry will speak at 7 p.m. Thursday at Boswell Book Company, 2559 N. Downer Ave.
