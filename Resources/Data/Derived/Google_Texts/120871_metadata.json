Justices will hear arguments on October 14 to address questions having to do with federal jurisdiction over the fast-changing electricity business.\n\nRelated: Tesla Tries to Kick-Start an Energy Revolution\n\nAt issue is an obscure federal policy known in the dry language of the electricity business as \u201cOrder 745,\u201d which a lower court vacated last year.\n\nOrder 745 allowed electricity customers to be paid for reducing electricity usage from the grid \u2013 a practice known as \u201cdemand response.\u201d It also stipulated that demand response customers would be paid the market price for not using the grid \u2013 like the power industry\u2019s version of paying farmers not to grow corn.\n\nPaying people not to use electricity may sound preposterous \u2013 one critique of Order 745 was that it permitted overly generous prices and lax performance standards, basically making demand response a license for electricity consumers to print money.\n\nRelated: A Red-Hot Tesla Burns Rubber on Consumer Reports\n\nBut research, including some of my own, has shown that demand response can make markets operate more efficiently, temper the market power held by power generating companies and reduce the risk of blackouts.\n\nIn other words, as long as the prices and rules are right, paying people to use less electricity isn\u2019t such a crazy idea. Indeed, it\u2019s just one way that new technologies, including rooftop solar and batteries, could make the grid cleaner and lower prices.\n\nSmart grid on trial\n\nThe Order 745 case has already proven to be a major disruption in the US electricity market. It has thrown uncertainty into business models, market prices, and in some cases even the planning of the power grid to ensure reliability in the coming years.\n\nRelated: Tesla Promises a Battery-Powered Home. Really.\n\nThe case, however, ultimately goes far beyond demand response.\n\nThe issue at hand is all about the ability of the federal government to set market rules for local power systems \u2013 that is, the portion of the grid that reaches individual homes and businesses \u2013 versus the regional grid that transports power over long distances across the US. It therefore has implications for the value of rooftop solar systems, backup generators, and even Tesla\u2019s Powerwall battery \u2013 basically anything that would allow individual customers to supply energy to the power grid or reduce demands on an already strained infrastructure.\n\nIn fact, Order 745 could very well be the biggest energy-related Supreme Court case in decades.\n\nThe significance of this particular case is rooted in the two different and opposing directions in which technology, policy and good old consumer behavior are pushing and pulling the business of electricity.\n\nRelated: What Tesla\u2019s Home Battery Means for Your Electric Bill\n\nOn the one hand is a federal policy of playing a greater role in the business of managing the regional power grid, supplanting the traditional electric utility. Regional organizations now manage portions of the national grid for more than 70% of all electricity consumed in the US.\n\nThe other trend is the increasing democratization of electric power production through rooftop solar photovoltaics, small-scale energy storage devices (like Tesla\u2019s Powerwall) and increased interest in \u201cmicro-grids\u201d to produce, distribute and manage electricity on a localized scale. Local energy is rapidly becoming the new local food. (There has even been a buzzword \u2013 \u201cloca-volt\u201d \u2013 coined to capture this movement.)\n\nThe simultaneous trends of regional grid management and democratized electricity supply are now in tension with one another, not for any technological reason, but primarily for reasons of policy and economics.\n\nThe Federal Power Act, which was passed in 1935, attempts to draw a \u201cbright line\u201d between those elements of the electricity system that are under federal versus state jurisdiction.\n\nRelated: The Real Threat to the Electric Power Grid Is Not Terrorism\n\nThe federal role is to regulate the regional transmission grid \u2013 including the power lines that transport electricity long distances and across state lines \u2013 and wholesale markets for buying and selling power. The role of the states is limited to the local grid that delivers electricity to homes and businesses and to retail sales.\n\nMarket rules like Order 745 provided a pathway for these two trends to be complementary, rather than in opposition, without a patchwork of individual state regulations.\n\nWant solar panels on your house? Sure thing \u2013 and those solar panels could also provide power to the grid at a price, perhaps avoiding the need to build some new power plants. Or you could provide demand response by using less electricity from the grid during certain days, and more from your solar panels. Order 745 created rules to compensate people and businesses on the wholesale energy markets to lower power use, whether it was from a bank of giant batteries or highrise buildings in New York City.\n\nDistributed energy technologies\n\nDemand response and Order 745 are so significant because they have blurred the bright line between federal and state control over the electricity sector. This bright line is increasingly becoming an artifact of our federalist legal structure.\n\nRelated: Tesla\u2019s New Battery Can Be a Game Changer for Global Energy\n\nA regional grid operator\u2019s primary function is to ensure the lights stay on by having enough power to match the demand. But there is no technological reason that demand response, backup generators or energy storage banks, electric vehicles, and other emerging technologies that are all part of the \u201csmart grid\u201d could not serve the same function for regional power grids that large power plants do today.\n\nAnd there are good reasons to believe that harnessing loca-volt energy and energy efficiency will actually be cheaper than building new power plants for times when large-scale wind and solar plants aren\u2019t available (France and some places in the US already do this, through controllable hot water heaters).\n\nStriking down Order 745 would make the bright line ever so brighter, but it would also complicate the economic environment for one of the most innovative segments of the electricity sector.\n\nThis case, ultimately, is far more significant than getting paid for not using electricity. It\u2019s about who gets to set the rules of the road for emerging technology in the electricity sector \u2013 the states or the federal government \u2013 and whether the US will be able to modernize its energy policy the same way that it would like to modernize its power grid.
