If you thought the Obamas, who are everyone’s #relationshipgoals, couldn’t get any cuter then you were wrong.

President Obama sat down with Ellen Degeneres to share a super special Valentine’s message with his wife of 23 years.

According to People.com:

“Somebody call the situation room because things are about to get hot. Michelle, this Valentine’s Day, I’m going to treat you right. I’m going to make you some zucchini bread. Then I’ll spread out some veggies on a plate, just the way you like them. Then I’m going to give you a massage while you watch …Ellen’s Design Challenge on HGTV,” he said, looking confused as he apparently read from a teleprompter. “Because I love you so much, I Obamacare about you more than you even know. That’s right, Obama cares!”

“But Michelle, I’ve made a lot of great decisions as president, the best decision I’ve ever made was choosing you,” he continued. “Thanks for putting up with me, I love you.”

In case you couldn’t gather from this adorable exchange, the Obamas’ 23-year marriage is solid as a rock. So solid in fact, that the president told Ellen they don’t even fight anymore. Here’s why:

“You know, after about 15 years I finally figured out that she’s always right. So then surprisingly, we just stopped fighting after that.”
