Topics: Kanye West, Rosie O'Donnell, The View, Entertainment News

Today on “The View,” the panel engaged in the hottest political debate of 2005.

Rosie O’Donnell and former Bush administration communications chief Nicolle Wallace got into it over whether or not the rapper Kanye West was right to say, as he did during a telethon to help victims of Hurricane Katrina, that “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” The very, very outdated debate was prompted by Wallace suggesting that Barack Obama doesn’t particularly care for the gladhanding aspect of politics and O’Donnell misinterpreting it as an offense on par with West’s statement.

Then they were off to the races, recapping a debate that’s important, certainly, in understanding race relations in America (Bush only flew over devastated New Orleans! But he ended up helping after some initial missteps!) but one that most people have given up on having, both because no one will ever change their minds on this and because so many new offenses have cropped up in the intervening nine years. “The View,” a show about the way people with different perspectives metabolize the news, should have done a segment on Ferguson, but so far, a years-old remark provided the only heat the show’s had in recent memory. Wallace told O’Donnell, with genuine emotion, that Bush had been offended by West’s remark — something he wrote in his memoir, which came out four years ago. As far as the contemporary Republican Party goes, the events depicted in “Decision Points” took place generations ago, but to Wallace, they’re still fresh.
