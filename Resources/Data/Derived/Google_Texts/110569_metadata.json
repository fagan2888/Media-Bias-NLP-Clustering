However, the rural hospital is making strides when it comes to getting out of a financial bind.\n\nCheryl Miller has to come to Memorial Hospital and Manor every day. She says she's grateful for the hospital. She says, \"My Coumadin was 9.1 and it dropped down to 2.3. So, they're doing a really good job for me.\"\n\nAlso dropping down, is the hospital's financial deficit. Administrators report total expenses have dropped by $719. 741 for the month of April.\n\nLast fiscal year, which ended March 31st, hospital C.E.O. Billy Walker says the hospital was $1.5 million in the hole.\n\nWalker says it was partly due to the high rate of uninsured patients in Decatur County, and the Affordable Care Act. He says, \"The way they're paying for that is cutting reimbursement through the Medicare and Medicaid program to providers, both hospitals and physicians. Our hospital alone had our reimbursements reduced by $700,000 this past year.\"\n\nTo better improve the financial status administrators say they're improving staffing and investing in new software.\n\nGlennie Bench, the chairperson of the hospital authority, says, \"One of the strategies that we've implemented was to affiliate with Stratus. The goal of Stratus is to develop a clinical integration platform that will allow to be more efficient in the providing of care to our patients. All of that drives unnecessary costs out of the system without impacting the quality to the patient.\"\n\nAdministrators want to point out that Memorial received four out of five stars by CMS and is ranked in the top third hospital in Georgia for quality of care.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Memorial Hospital and Manor in Bainbridge is struggling financially, as is many rural hospitals across the country.", "language": "english", "author": "Lanetra Bennett", "og": {"description": "Memorial Hospital and Manor in Bainbridge is struggling financially, as is many rural hospitals across the country.", "title": "Memorial Hospital and Manor Improving Financially", "url": "http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Memorial-Hospital-and-Manor-Improving-Financially-305079191.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/680/F25/680F25E206FE465698E9331392E67FD7", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/4F3/273/4F327383E67F48859955819207864514.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wctv.tv", "description": "Memorial Hospital and Manor in Bainbridge is struggling financially, as is many rural hospitals across the country.", "title": "Memorial Hospital and Manor Improving Financially", "url": "http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Memorial-Hospital-and-Manor-Improving-Financially-305079191.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/memorial+hospital+and+manor.jpg", "creator": "@wctv", "site": "@wctv", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Memorial Hospital and Manor Improving Financially", "google-site-verification": "VLpGbxCsgs1871fd1G59F0FVrlUu5DfthTQ8LrtSaNQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Memorial Hospital and Manor Improving"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2954\"", "article_summary": "By: Lanetra BennettMay 26, 2015Bainbridge, GA - Memorial Hospital and Manor in Bainbridge continues to face financial challenges on a day-to-day basis.\nCheryl Miller has to come to Memorial Hospital and Manor every day.\nAlso dropping down, is the hospital's financial deficit.\nAdministrators want to point out that Memorial received four out of five stars by CMS and is ranked in the top third hospital in Georgia for quality of care.\nHowever, the rural hospital is making strides when it comes to getting out of a financial bind."}
