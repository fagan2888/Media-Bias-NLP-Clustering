They were asked, among other things, whether their doctors had ever told them they had Alzheimer\u2019s disease. When the researchers then matched the respondents\u2019 answers to their medical records, and the diagnostic codes that their doctors used to describe their care, only 45% of those who were billed for Alzheimer\u2019s-related care were told by their doctors of their disease.\n\nSign up for THE BRIEF and more view example\n\nMORE New Research on Understanding Alzheimer\u2019s\n\n\u201cWhat struck us was that physicians generally understand the positive benefits of disclosing the diagnosis, and agree with those benefits,\u201d says Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach at the Association, who oversaw the analysis of the survey data. \u201cBut many still don\u2019t do disclosure in their own practice.\u201d\n\nOne of the few papers investigating the phenomenon of Alzheimer\u2019s diagnoses found that as few as 36% of doctors said they usually told their patients if they had Alzheimer\u2019s. The main reasons for the intentional omission? Fear of causing emotional distress in their patients and the lack of time and resources to fully explain what the diagnosis means. This was true of both primary care doctors as well as neurology specialists who have more expertise in brain-related disorders.\n\nDr. Robert Wergin, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, advocates for transparency and honesty in disclosing diagnoses to his patients in his practice in Milford, Nebraska. But he understands why many physicians might be reluctant to use the word \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s\u201d with their patients. \u201cLabels are important,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I label you and say you\u2019ve got Alzheimer\u2019s disease, then you\u2019re likely to say, \u2018Well that\u2019s it for me, I better start looking for nursing homes.\u2019\u201d\n\nMORE This Alzheimer\u2019s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s is a challenging diagnosis to make on several levels. First, it can only be definitively diagnosed at autopsy, when doctors can see the hallmark amyloid plaques and tangles that cause the gradual loss of memory and cognitive function. There is no blood test or brain scan that can conclusively tell doctors that a patient does or does not have the condition; while promising versions are being developed, it\u2019s still a diagnosis that doctors make based on reports of the patients\u2019 changing intellectual abilities and on psychiatric tests that aren\u2019t specific for Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s also difficult to tell patients they likely have Alzheimer\u2019s because there are currently no effective drugs for the disease. Medications can slow the effects of the cognitive decline, but nothing can stop or reverse the march of worsening symptoms. Wergin notes that once a patient is labeled with Alzheimer\u2019s it could, at least before the Affordable Care Act, affect that patient\u2019s ability to get insurance for nursing home care. \u201cOnce I label you, it\u2019s in your chart. If an insurance company extracts your data, I\u2019m not going to insure you because you are at higher risk of drawing on your coverage,\u201d he says.\n\nMORE New Test May Predict Alzheimer\u2019s 10 Years Before Diagnosis\n\nWergin says that doctors may be over-anticipating the emotional distress that an Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis can bring. While the news is certainly difficult, most patients and their caregivers may already be aware that a neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer\u2019s may be present. And while there are no treatments that physicians can prescribe for their patients \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 Fargo and Beth Kallmyer, vice president of constituent services at the Association, note that it\u2019s particularly important for Alzheimer\u2019s patients and their families to know what to expect so they can begin planning. \u201cThere might not be a pill that slows the disease down or there might not be cures, but there are things people can do to impact their everyday quality of life,\u201d says Kallmyer. \u201cThey can build a care team, and prepare advanced directives. And if a caregiver has knowledge of the disease, they can make things better in the day to day world of the person with the disease. If they don\u2019t know about the diagnosis, they may not get that support.\u201d\n\nMORE Breakthrough Discoveries of Alzheimer\u2019s Genes\n\nBut making doctors more comfortable with the diagnosis will take more structural changes in the way we deliver health care. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association is supporting legislation that would reimburse doctors and their staff for a longer discussion about Alzheimer\u2019s and how to plan for the disease. More medical schools are also including discussion about such planning in their curricula, as doctors in coming decades will be increasingly called upon to make this difficult disclosure.\n\nRead next: A Simple 3-Part Test May Predict Alzheimer\u2019s\n\nListen to the most important stories of the day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s hard to believe in today\u2019s era of transparency in modern medicine, but there\u2019s a diagnosis that doctors still try to keep from their patients", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "It\u2019s hard to believe in today\u2019s era of transparency in modern medicine, but there\u2019s a diagnosis that doctors still try to keep from their patients", "title": "Why Doctors Don't Always Give Patients an Alzheimer's Diagnosis", "url": "http://time.com/3755176/doctors-diagnose-alzheimers-dont-tell/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/168835256.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/168835256.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "It\u2019s hard to believe in today\u2019s era of transparency in modern medicine, but there\u2019s a diagnosis that doctors still try to keep from their patients", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why Doctors Don't Always Give Patients an Alzheimer's Diagnosis"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "aging, alzheimer's, brain, diagnosing alzheimer's, medicine", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "alzheimer's, diagnosing alzheimer's alzheimer's disease, what are the signs of alzheimer's"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8953\"", "article_summary": "This was true of both primary care doctors as well as neurology specialists who have more expertise in brain-related disorders.\nIn a surprising new survey of patients who were asked about their interactions with their doctors, 45% of people whose doctors treated them for Alzheimer\u2019s never told these patients that they had the degenerative brain disorder.\nLed by researchers at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, the scientists looked at Medicare claim data from 2008 to 2010 for 16,000 people.\nThey were asked, among other things, whether their doctors had ever told them they had Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nIt\u2019s also difficult to tell patients they likely have Alzheimer\u2019s because there are currently no effective drugs for the disease."}
