But nestled in those floral arrangements may be tiny pests and diseases that can wreak havoc with domestic plants in the United States. The job of preventing those pests from entering the country falls to the United States Customs and Border Protection agents who inspect all plants that pass through the border crossings in Texas and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWhen it is an aggressive disease or insect that finds a preferred host on crops that are grown in specific states, if the condition and the environment is what it likes, the spread of disease or insect is quite quick,\u201d said Katherine Vasquez, a customs supervisor of agricultural inspectors in El Paso, where inspectors in 2013 made about 54,300 quarantine-eligible interceptions and found about 4,330 pests.\n\nIn 2013, agents processed more than 867 million cut flower stems nationally during what it considers Valentine\u2019s season (Jan. 1 to Feb. 14). That was an increase of about 3 percent from 2012.\n\nMost of the imported flowers are from South America, primarily Colombia and Ecuador. And while the ports at Miami and Los Angeles receive the greatest number of flowers, entry ports in Laredo and Pharr rank No. 4 and No. 8. Mexico\u2019s proximity to Texas presents an unusual challenge because flower shipments may also arrive at crossings in small bunches carried by shoppers \u2014 not just in large shipments \u2014 which increases the workload for inspectors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cStreet vendors from various parts in Mexico will arrive with truckloads of these products for sale on streets leading to the border crossings,\u201d Customs said in a statement released during a news media event showcasing the floral inspections in El Paso.\n\nMost of what comes through Texas ports is intended for regional markets and subject to quarantine if the flowers are thought to harbor spreadable diseases.\n\nA common foe is the Asian citrus psyllid, the vector for the disease commonly known as citrus greening, which destroys citrus trees and their fruit. In Florida alone, the disease has been responsible for about $3.6 billion in lost revenue since 2006, according to a University of Florida study.\n\nAgents within the agricultural inspection division of Customs must hold a bachelor\u2019s degree in one of several specialties, including botany, agricultural entomology, chemistry and natural resources management. A combination of study in those sciences and work experience in fields like environmental monitoring or pest control is also acceptable. Ruben Jauregui, a public affairs specialist with Customs, said that although advanced training requirements meant the inspectors were more difficult to hire, the ports were staffed with what they needed.\n\n\u201cLike any other corporation or government agency, can you use more? Absolutely,\u201d Mr. Jauregui said. \u201cBut we do have them in the pipeline within the new budget.\u201d\n\nOfficers added that even though plant life appeared to be a likely place to hide contraband, smugglers were smart enough to know that it was more likely to be scrutinized.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re guaranteed, almost 100 percent, an inspection,\u201d Ms. Vasquez said. \u201cSo usually it hasn\u2019t been one of the methods they prefer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140213184940, "twitter": {"description": "Flowers coming across the border from Mexico are being carefully scrutinized, but more for tiny pests and plant diseases than as hiding places for drugs.", "title": "A Closer Look at Valentine\u2019s Flowers", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/us/a-closer-look-at-valentines-flowers.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002711082"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/14/us/14ttFlowers/14ttFlowers-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/us/a-closer-look-at-valentines-flowers.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002711082", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/us/a-closer-look-at-valentines-flowers.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "A Closer Look at Valentine\u2019s Flowers", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 13, 2014", "edt": "AddTexas", "org": "Customs and Border Protection (US)", "keywords": "Valentine's Day,Flowers and Plants,Mexico,Texas,Customs and Border Protection (US)", "news_keywords": "Mexico,Texas", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Juli\u00e1n Aguilar", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/14/us/14ttFlowers/14ttFlowers-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JULI\u00c1N AGUILAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Flowers coming across the border from Mexico are being carefully scrutinized, but more for tiny pests and plant diseases than as hiding places for drugs.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/14/us/14ttFlowers/14ttFlowers-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Flowers coming across the border from Mexico are being carefully scrutinized, but more for tiny pests and plant diseases than as hiding places for drugs.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 13, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-02-13", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Customs and Border Protection (US)", "published": "2014-02-13", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Texas", "slug": "14ttflowers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140213213608, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/us/a-closer-look-at-valentines-flowers.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/14/us/14ttFlowers/14ttFlowers-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Flowers coming across the border from Mexico are being carefully scrutinized, but more for tiny pests and plant diseases than as hiding places for drugs.", "title": "A Closer Look at Valentine\u2019s Flowers"}, "pdate": 20140213, "des": "Flowers and Plants", "articleid": 100000002711082, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "A Closer Look at Valentine\u2019s Flowers", "col": "Texas Tribune", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3983\"", "article_summary": "In the weeks before Valentine\u2019s Day, flower shipments passing through Mexico and into the United States have surged.\nBut nestled in those floral arrangements may be tiny pests and diseases that can wreak havoc with domestic plants in the United States.\nMost of what comes through Texas ports is intended for regional markets and subject to quarantine if the flowers are thought to harbor spreadable diseases.\nAnd while the ports at Miami and Los Angeles receive the greatest number of flowers, entry ports in Laredo and Pharr rank No.\nThe job of preventing those pests from entering the country falls to the United States Customs and Border Protection agents who inspect all plants that pass through the border crossings in Texas and elsewhere."}
