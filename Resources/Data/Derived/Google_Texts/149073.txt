HONOLULU (AP) — President Barack Obama is starting his annual winter vacation in Hawaii on a quiet note — and hoping it stays that way.

The president and his wife, daughters and two dogs arrived late Friday and headed to a beachside home in the sleepy Honolulu suburb of Kailua.

Obama got a late start Saturday, and by early afternoon was still at home.

The Obamas vacation every year in Hawaii, where Obama was born. This is the first year that last-minute wrangling in Congress didn’t prevent them from departing on schedule.

Major news events have disrupted the vacation in previous years. This time the Obamas are hoping for some uninterrupted rest and relaxation.

Obama did spend part of Saturday morning conferring with top advisers about the tense situation in South Sudan.
