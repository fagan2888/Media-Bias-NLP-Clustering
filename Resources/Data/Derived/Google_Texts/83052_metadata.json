If you listened to NPR the next morning, you\u2019d have heard Olivo talk about the same thing. And then if you listened to a NPR a week later, you\u2019d have heard Olivo talking yet again about how Obamacare would prevent him from hiring and force him to lay off workers.\n\nAlso that June, Olivo made an appearance on John Stossel\u2019s Fox Business show. In the previous year, he made it into the Associated Press four times, appeared on Fox News, got hits in the Philadelphia Inquire and Financial Times. In 2009, he went on NPR\u2019s \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d to trash Obamacare.\n\nUndisclosed in any of these appearances: That Olivo is no regular Joe business owner, as the Times and WSJ would still have us believe after all these press clips. Olivo a very active member of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, a Koch-funded right-wing lobbying organization that fights minimum-wage increases and Obamacare among other things.\n\nI wrote about Olivo and another astroturf media favorite in July of last year. About three seconds of Internet sleuthing turned up that Olivo was \u201cvice chairman of the NFIB\u2019s New Jersey Leadership Council, starred in promo videos for it, and worked with lobbyists to influence state legislatures and Congress.\n\nAs I said then:\n\nHere\u2019s how you should assume this works, because it\u2019s how it very often does: A journalist is on deadline on a story and needs an anecdote to make it feel \u201creal\u201d with some color\u2014preferably someone who will add balance and/or support the journalist\u2019s thesis. A speed-dialed call is made to industry flacks to supply a quotable small-business person\u2026and, voil\u00e0!\n\nAnd in a subsequent post:\n\nIt\u2019s true that the line can be fuzzy, but that\u2019s why folks like Olivo are so valuable to groups like NFIB and why it\u2019s worth leaning toward abstention from rent-a-quotes and at least disclosing their ties if those deadline and/or balance pressures are too much.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s face it: Nobody trusts what some paid-to-say-it lobbyist thinks. The press knows it and the lobbyists for sure know it, which is why they seek to cloak their messages in the authenticity of the man on the street. The operating assumption should be that a lobby will only sends reporters to quote someone who\u2019ll reliably say most of the same things it would say. You wouldn\u2019t quote a spokesperson from an activist group without noting their affiliation. These lobbyist-supplied sources are proxy spokespeople.\n\nDon\u2019t become a victim of anecdote laundering.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nManufactured quotes.
