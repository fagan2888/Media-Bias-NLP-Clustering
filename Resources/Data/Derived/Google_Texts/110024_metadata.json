He is macho and confident, flashy and unapologetic, and he never compromises. But he\u2019s also rigid and arrogant, reckless and hurtful, and he refuses to adjust to changing circumstances. Don Draper has never really believed in small moments of grace. There is just winning and losing, with nothing in between.\n\nWe have come to expect big gestures of showy, misguided heroism from Don. In some of the most gripping scenes of \u201cMad Men,\u201d Don swaggers into some posh conference room and delivers a self-assured, moving pitch that brings the house down (and saves the company!). This kind of gallant role-playing extends to his personal life. Instead of facing himself and his problems, he plays the suave romantic, trying to run away with Rachel Menken, proposing to Megan, etc. But these acts of escapism tend to backfire, leading to a nihilistic, boozy downward spiral.\n\nFor the first time on Sunday night\u2019s finale, Don faced personal ruin but he didn\u2019t either fall to pieces or slide into the role of macho American hero. Don suddenly seemed to realize that his choices weren\u2019t limited to winning (with victory cries and fireworks and applause all around) or losing (with tears and swigged whiskey and socking people in the jaw in a blind rage). Don saw that he could simply show up, be honest, demonstrate a little restraint, and try hard to support the people who mattered to him. Yeah, I know. Who is this guy?\n\nAt the start of \u201cWaterloo,\u201d Don isn\u2019t the only character whose chosen illusions are going up in smoke. In an inverse of Neil Armstrong\u2019s heroism on TV, Ted Chaough turns off the plane\u2019s engine while flying with some clients from Sunkist, panicking them and drawing Pete\u2019s ire. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die,\u201d Ted explains to Jim. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to do this anymore. Advertising. I want to do something else, somewhere else.\u201d Ted doesn\u2019t care about winning anymore, but he\u2019s also tired of feeling like a loser. He assumes that advertising is the source of his troubles, but maybe he\u2019s still mourning the loss of Peggy. Instead of trying to understand himself, though, he\u2019s reversing his Season 6 role as the good version of Don Draper and is, instead, conjuring Don\u2019s nihilistic, boozy nose-dives of yore.\n\nLou is also enraged that his career is stalling out. Instead of following his big dreams of creating a cartoon, he\u2019s spent ten years \u201cbuilding a tobacco resume\u201d as he puts it, to Jim \u201cand one meeting turned me into a joke.\u201d He adds, \u201cI\u2019m gonna crawl out of this place with nothing left to show.\u201d Jim, though, represents the cold, robotic pragmatism of the modern workplace, and his response sounds like a line straight out of Lou\u2019s cartoons: \u201cWe don\u2019t owe you anything! You\u2019re a hired hand. Now get back to work!\u201d\n\nBurt Cooper has certainly been known to show a similar strain of heartless pragmatism. This pragmatism has sometimes worked in Don\u2019s favor in the past, like when he discovered Don\u2019s true identity but merely shrugged it off. He takes a similar stance here, backing his team but passively assuming Don is doomed. Little sock-footed Cooper has always been a bundle of oddities and contradictions, though. He embraces Eastern philosophies and believes in balance, yet he reacts to some changes at the office like a reticent dinosaur. He seems like a lonely, racist old man half the time, but there he is, watching the moon landing right next to his black maid (his version of family!). Among the Lous and the Teds of SC&P, Cooper seems uniquely qualified to live in the moment, seize the day, and all of those other hard-to-achieve goals of 1969. His last words, in reaction to Neil Armstrong\u2019s famous \u201cone small step\u201d line? \u201cBravo!\u201d\n\n\u201cTrouble\u2019s just a bubble\n\nAnd the clouds will soon roll by\n\nSo let\u2019s have another cup o\u2019 coffee\n\nAnd let\u2019s have another piece o\u2019 pie.\u201d\n\nRoger quotes Irving Berlin\u2019s lyrics to Cooper when Cooper appears unruffled by Jim Cutler\u2019s attempts to oust Don, but Roger, Lou and Ted are the ones losing their religion. If trouble\u2019s just a bubble and the Buddhists have it right, then their whole way of life is an illusion. They\u2019ve sweated over work for years, but work will never save them from themselves.\n\nSpeaking of losing faith, when Roger hears that Burt Cooper died, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s a much bigger loss than his own mother\u2019s death. He goes immediately to the office, the way the mourning go home to be with their family. Joan, who\u2019s the closest thing to family that Roger has left, hugs him. Then Jim Cutler moves in for the kill, already strategizing how to get rid of Don given these new variables. \u201cIs this what would happen if I died?\u201d Roger asks, wondering if his entire life and career could be swept aside just as easily.\n\nFor a ruthless pragmatist and man of the future, though, Jim Cutler is oddly fixated on Don \u2013 and his notions of Don are badly in need of an update. \u201cI\u2019m deeply unimpressed, Don. You\u2019re just a bully and a drunk. A football player in a suit,\u201d he tells him when Don confronts him about his efforts to push him out of the firm. Then he aims below the belt. \u201cThe most eloquent I ever heard you was when you were blubbering like a little girl about your impoverished childhood.\u201d The old Don \u2013 heroic, flashy, win or lose Don \u2014 would\u2019ve knocked Jim\u2019s lights out. But the new Don isn\u2019t a football player in a suit at all. He bites his tongue and walks away.\n\nAlternative forms of masculine self-expression are on display elsewhere, too. When a handsome handyman starts flirting with Peggy without any trace of deviousness or swagger, she suddenly sees the appeal of a regular guy who appreciates her and isn\u2019t too old or too married or too named-after-waterfowl. She also sees the appeal of having an annoying kid around, asking you for things when you\u2019re busy. The illusion that her work life must obliterate her personal life is shattered in one glorious scene. Peggy might just have everything she wants one day! (Sniff.) And how about Sally, choosing an awkward astronomer over a future football player in a suit? What could be more gratifying than seeing these two smart women ditching the American hero for something a little more flexible and magical?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Grace comes in small moments as \"Mad Men\" finishes the first half of its last season and hints about what's to come", "author": "Heather Havrilesky", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Grace comes in small moments as \"Mad Men\" finishes the first half of its last season and hints about what's to come", "title": "\u201cMad Men\u201d finale recap: \u201cThe moon belongs to everyone\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/26/mad_men_finale_recap_the_moon_belongs_to_everyone/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/mad_men_recap1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Grace comes in small moments as \"Mad Men\" finishes the first half of its last season and hints about what's to come", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/mad_men_recap1.jpg", "title": "\u201cMad Men\u201d finale recap: \u201cThe moon belongs to everyone\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cMad Men\u201d finale recap: \u201cThe moon belongs to everyone\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Burt Cooper, don draper, Mad Men, mad men finale, mad men recap, Peggy Olsen, Television, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02ea\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Burt Cooper, don draper, Mad Men, mad men finale, mad men recap, Peggy Olsen, Television, TV, Entertainment NewsDon Draper has always embodied the strengths and weaknesses of the American hero.\nIn some of the most gripping scenes of \u201cMad Men,\u201d Don swaggers into some posh conference room and delivers a self-assured, moving pitch that brings the house down (and saves the company!).\nThe illusion that her work life must obliterate her personal life is shattered in one glorious scene.\nHe assumes that advertising is the source of his troubles, but maybe he\u2019s still mourning the loss of Peggy.\nThen Jim Cutler moves in for the kill, already strategizing how to get rid of Don given these new variables."}
