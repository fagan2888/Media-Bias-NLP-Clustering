Fox, Phil Tesoriero, Sean Zimmerman and Nick Schneider \u2014 will head to Denver Health to give gifts to children in the hospital during the holidays.\n\nThe team got involved last week selling bracelets at the Dec. 13-14 home games. They sold 200 bracelets at $10 apiece and will sell 66 ornaments during this weekend\u2019s games for $20 each.\n\nThe players will shop for the gifts the morning of Dec. 22 and deliver them later that day.\n\n\u201cI took this proposal to the staff and they\u2019ve done a heck of a job,\u201d Bembridge said.\n\nBembridge has tried to lead similar campaigns in other cities where he\u2019s played. He and a teammate set it up together about four years ago. Bembridge also tried to do a toy drive in Italy last year, but did not have as much success.\n\nBembridge currently leads the Central Hockey League with 21 goals and 38 points in his first season with the Cutthroats.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Denver Cutthroats,Garett Bembridge,Nick Schneider,Phil Tesoriero,Sean Zimmerman,T.J.
