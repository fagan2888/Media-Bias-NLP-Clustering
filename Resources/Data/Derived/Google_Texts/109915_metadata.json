By design, Obamacare includes a series of provisions designed to insulate insurers from major losses in the first three years. I usually describe them as \u201cshock absorbers.\u201d Many other policy wonks refer to them as the three Rs, for reinsurance, risk corridors, and risk adjustment. Two of the three, risk corridors and reinsurance, are temporary measures set to expire in 2016. More knowledgeable critics of the law, like Bob Laszewski and Megan McArdle, have warned that more insurers could abandon the market or at least jack up their premiums once those measures expire.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you with certainty whether they are right or wrong.

One of my favorites was an op-ed that ran in the Wall Street Journal at the end of last year. The author was John Cochrane, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago. The headline was \u201cWhat to Do When Obamacare Unravels\u201d\u2014not \u201cif,\u201d mind you, but \u201cwhen.\u201d\n\nAt the time, with unexpected plan cancellations and the website problems very much on people\u2019s minds, betting against the program working probably seemed like a good idea.
