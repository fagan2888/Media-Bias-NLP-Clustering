That image frames her memories of a silver medal in downhill claimed when she was 22 years old, bringing the first burst of fame to her and portending what would become one of the greatest careers in the history of American ski racing.\n\nMemories of Lillehammer, seen through the glass brightly.\n\n\u201cI look through that porthole and I see people arm in arm, dancing together,\u201d Street said Saturday at the men\u2019s and women\u2019s downhill training. \u201cI hear the crowds singing to Tommy Moe, \u2018Happy Birthday.\u2019 I feel the cold T-bar underneath the back of my legs on the way up to the slalom. I hear my coach, when I\u2019m trying to run the slalom, telling me, \u2018You ski like blank,\u2019 and it\u2019s not a good word.\n\n\u201cLillehammer was this warm, fuzzy, amazing experience. I surprised myself with a medal, and even though I won a gold in Nagano, Lillehammer still for me is my favorite Olympic memory.\u201d\n\nSki racing fans knew she was a potential star in Lillehammer because she had won a silver medal a year earlier at the world championships. But America was unprepared for the irrepressible spirit from Triumph, Idaho, who was as colorful as she was gifted.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a very good run,\u201d Street said that day in Lillehammer. \u201cI skied like a dirtbag, but I had my race face on and I was charging down the mountain.\u201d\n\nA month before the Olympics she had finished seventh in a downhill at Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy, giving her the confidence she needed to charge in Lillehammer\n\n\u201cI went, \u2018Bing.\u2019 It all kind of lit up and I went, \u2018Hmm, maybe I could pull something off in Lillehammer,\u2019 \u201d Street said. \u201cBut I honestly went in just wanting to get the first Olympic jitters out of my system. When I started popping fast in training, and then I won the last training run, that\u2019s when I really had to scramble to get ahead of (my emotions), wrap my brain around it, harness it and ride it, not have it run away from me.\u201d\n\nHer medal ceremony was special because that same night Norwegian hero Johann Olav Koss received one of his three gold medals for speedskating.\n\n\u201cI had 200,000-plus people there to cheer for me,\u201d Street said. \u201cI felt like a rock star. I felt like an American hero, because I had a cowboy hat on and I was representing.\u201d\n\nIn subsequent years, she would become the first American to win a World Cup discipline title in downhill \u2014 which she did twice \u2014 and win the super-G at the 1998 Nagano Olympics 14 months after blowing out a knee in a training run at Vail. She also inspired a generation of girls to pursue ski racing.\n\nLindsey Vonn decided she wanted to become a ski racer at age 9 after meeting Street. Jacqueline Wiles of Aurora, Ore., was the same age when she met Street for the first time, and she told Street that in the finish area here Saturday. Street inspired her to become a ski racer, and now she\u2019s an Olympian at age 21.\n\n\u201cWe got your picture. We got to meet you and talk a little bit,\u201d Wiles told Street. \u201cIt was inspiring. I had a picture of you on my wall.\u201d\n\nToday, Street lives near Birmingham, Ala., and is raising four boys. She is working in Sochi for Fox Sports 1.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Picabo Street reflects on her first Olympic medal, and inspiring young girls to follow in her skis", "title": "Picabo Street reflects on her first Olympic medal, and inspiring young girls to follow in her skis", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/08/picabo-street-reflects-on-her-first-olympic-medal-and-inspiring-young-girls-to-follow-in-her-skis/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208_121748_1000284.jpg", "height": 455}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208_121748_1000284.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-08T12:10:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:39:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd70b5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI look through that porthole and I see people arm in arm, dancing together,\u201d Street said Saturday at the men\u2019s and women\u2019s downhill training.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a very good run,\u201d Street said that day in Lillehammer.\nI had a picture of you on my wall.\u201dToday, Street lives near Birmingham, Ala., and is raising four boys.\n\u201cBut I honestly went in just wanting to get the first Olympic jitters out of my system.\nStreet inspired her to become a ski racer, and now she\u2019s an Olympian at age 21."}
