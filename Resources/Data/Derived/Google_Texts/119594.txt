"Mad Men" star Jon Hamm was once accused of being one of several fraternity members to take part in a "violent hazing" incident.

The LA Times reports a then 19-year-old Hamm was a student at the University of Texas at Austin when he and several other members from the Sigma Nu fraternity were accused of taking part in the 1990 incident, resulting in a lawsuit being filed the next year.

The website adds the violence was alleged to have taken place against a fellow pledge and included him "leading him around with a hammer placed in a sensitive location, paddling him and setting his underpants on fire."

According to the San Antonio Light, three fraternity members were sentenced to serve 30 days stemming from the incident and the fraternity was banned from the university. "Jonathan Hamm of St. Louis" was among four men listed in that story as being charged with "multiple counts of hazing."

Two years after the lawsuit was filed, which argued Hamm participated in the incident "till the very end," an arrest warrant was issued for the man who later starred as and won a Golden Globe for playing Don Draper. The newspaper adds he was formally charged with hazing and received probation in a deal cut in 1995.

The old revelations about Hamm recently came to light after he entered a 30-day rehab program last month for alcohol addiction, E! News notes. This month, a tabloid report surfaced indicating Hamm and longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt had called it quits.

People reports Hamm and Westfeldt are denying the breakup rumors.

"The story that appeared in this week's edition of In Touch magazine is not true," the couple's rep said in a statement to People. "They continue to ask for the public's understanding and sensitivity during this challenging time."

"He needs [Jennifer]," another source told the magazine of the stability she brought into his life. "He has to have that in his life."
