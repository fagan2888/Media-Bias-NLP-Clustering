I mean, surely Republicans will realize they cannot possibly nominate a populist tycoon, with zero experience in government, who vows to round up and expel 11 million people. Of course it will dawn on Democrats that it is inconceivable to have a self-declared socialist as their standard-bearer. Inevitably the planets will return to their normal orbits and everything will go back to the way it should be.\n\nAnyone thinking along these lines, I believe, is in for an unpleasant surprise.\n\nI know that not a single vote has been cast. I realize it\u2019s still probable that Democrats will eventually settle on an establishment candidate and still possible (though pretty unlikely) that Republicans will do the same. But even if the Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders insurrections somehow fizzle, their impact will not soon fade. These unlikely messengers are showing us how ignorant many of our leaders are about the nation they purportedly serve.\n\nAs individuals, Sanders and Trump are hardly cut from the same cloth; one rails against billionaires and one is a billionaire. Their supporters would probably not mix well at a cocktail party. But there\u2019s a reason why these are the only two candidates who regularly fill basketball arenas with passionate, standing-room-only crowds: Both call for change that is fundamental, not cosmetic or incremental.\n\nAnd there are specifics on which Trump and Sanders agree. Both stridently denounce free-trade agreements, such as Nafta and the new Trans-Pacific Partnership, saying that they depress U.S. wages and send jobs to other countries. Establishment Democrats and Republicans, by contrast, have rarely seen a free-trade pact they didn\u2019t like. Apparently, all the assurances from eminent economists that free trade is a plus for the economy offer little comfort to voters who commute past empty acres where factories once stood.\n\nSanders supports truly universal single-payer health care, which he describes with the shorthand \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a position that every Republican candidate is required to take \u2014 but also has been a consistent supporter of universal care, though he does not specify how he would bring it about. It turns out that many voters dislike \u201cbig government\u201d but need and demand the services it provides. Ideological purity does not cure disease, and everybody eventually gets sick.\n\nTrump and Sanders are both skeptical of the establishment consensus about America\u2019s role as the world\u2019s policeman. Sanders would use military force only as a last resort; Trump would let Vladimir Putin take charge of cleaning up the Syria mess if he wants to. Politicians in Washington have given us a series of long, messy wars \u2014 fought almost exclusively by the sons and daughters of the working class \u2014 that don\u2019t end in victory parades and somehow create as many threats as they eliminate.\n\nPerhaps most significant of all, Trump and Sanders both portray traditional politicians as bought and paid for by powerful monied interests. Sanders rails against big banks, powerful corporations and wealthy plutocrats who bend the system to their will. Trump speaks from personal experience, blithely telling audiences how he regularly wrote big checks to politicians in both parties to buy access and influence.\n\nThe system is rigged, these insurgents say. Your elected leaders are working for themselves and their puppet-masters. They couldn\u2019t care less about you.\n\nSanders\u2019 solution is a grass-roots \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d Trump, to the extent he offers concrete proposals, seems to promise the muscular use of presidential power. But both have touched a raw nerve, and our political parties had better pay attention.\n\nAs the caucuses and primaries begin, the RealClearPolitics poll averages show that 36% of Republicans favor Trump and an additional 10% support other candidates who have never held elective office. On the Democratic side, 37% of Democrats say they favor Sanders. These numbers should be nothing short of alarming to the party establishments.\n\nThey show that there are huge numbers of Americans out there whose voices are not being heard \u2014 voters who are tired of half-measures and unkept promises. Whatever happens between now and November, this alienation will not magically disappear.
