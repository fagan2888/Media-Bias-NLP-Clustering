The Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday announced an option letting people pay their taxes in cash at 7-Eleven stores.

â€œTaxpayers have many options to pay their tax bills by direct debit, a check or a credit card, but this provides a new way for people who can only pay their taxes in cash without having to travel to an IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center," IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in a news release.

More than 7,000 7-Eleven stores across 34 states are participating.

The payment option is an IRS partnership with electronic-payments solutions providers Official Payments and PayNearMe, electronic transaction networks that allow customers to make cash payments at places like 7-Eleven.

The IRS said it has been working with Official Payments for people who want to pay their taxes by credit card since 1999. The Department of Health and Human Services in 2014 announced a partnership with PayNearMe to promote ObamaCare sign-ups.

People wishing to use this payment option can follow the directions provided on the IRS website. The IRS said taxpayers who want to use this option should start well ahead of the April 18 tax deadline because a multi-step process is involved.
