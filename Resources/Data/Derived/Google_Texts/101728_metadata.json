That is at the core of the social problems we have in Scotland today.\"\n\nScotland has one of the highest death rates from chronic liver disease in Europe, only beaten by Hungary.\n\nBut Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Tory deputy leader, said: \u201cThis is one of the most preposterous interventions in the referendum debate to date, even by Alex Neil's standards.\n\n\"Figures demonstrate that the deterioration in Scotland's record with alcohol began almost to the day Margaret Thatcher left office \u2013 make of that what you will.\n\n\"Subsequent governments allowed alcohol to become more affordable and it remains a critical problem in Scotland today.\u201d\n\nIn a second controversial outburst at the same meeting, Mr Neil said Scots who work in shops or the fast food chain McDonald's do not have \"good jobs\".\n\nAsked about youth unemployment, Mr Neil said training and education was essential to have \"any prospect of having a good job, and I am not talking about jobs in McDonald's or at a checkout counter.\"\n\nAround 240,000 Scots work in the retail sector, while McDonald's employs around 7,000 in Scotland.\n\nJames Kelly, a Scottish Labour MSP, said the minister was showing \"contempt for working class people\".\n\nA spokesman for shopworkers union Usdaw said: \"These remarks could be considered as insulting by many people who work in retail and are ill-advised.\n\n\"The evidence out there supports the fact that a career in retail can be fulfilling. There are plenty of 'good jobs' and these comments are not helpful.\"", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "newstopics", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02776/thatcher-brighton_2776654k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@simon_telegraph"}, "keywords": "Margaret, Thatcher, Alex, Neil, alcohol, Politics,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;Politics;Scotland;UK_News;Simon_Johnson;Scottish_Politics", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/politics", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "news_keywords": "Margaret, Thatcher, Alex, Neil, alcohol", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "SNP Health Minister: Margaret Thatcher to blame for Scotland's drinking", "section-id": 2303, "GSAGenre": "politics", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-politics", "GSAMLC": "news/newstopics/politics", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "DCSext.pd": 1, "WT.cg_s": "politics", "description": "Alex Neil says the former Conservative Prime Minister's decision to shut down \n  Scotland's heavy industries took a heavy toll on their workforces' health", "tmgads.channel": "news", "article-id": 10613091, "DCSext.Category": "politics", "DCSext.Level": 3, "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-02", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-news_topics-politics", "last-modified": "2014-02-02", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "News", "wordcount": 557, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Simon Johnson", "tag": "Scottish Politics", "subsection": "Politics", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 6, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 10613091, "tmgads.articleid": 10613091, "tmgads.level": 3, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"SNP Health Minister: Margaret Thatcher to blame for Scotland\\u0027s drinking \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10613091/SNP-Health-Minister-Margaret-Thatcher-to-blame-for-Scotlands-drinking.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02776/thatcher-brighton_2776654k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"10613091\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-02T16:57:31Z\",\"section\": \"News\",\"authors\": [\"Simon Johnson\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"Politics\",\"Scotland\",\"UK News\",\"Simon Johnson\",\"Scottish Politics\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Alex Neil says the former Conservative Prime Minister's decision to shut down   Scotland's heavy industries took a heavy toll on their workforces' health", "title": "SNP Health Minister: Margaret Thatcher to blame for Scotland's drinking", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10613091/SNP-Health-Minister-Margaret-Thatcher-to-blame-for-Scotlands-drinking.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02776/thatcher-brighton_2776654k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.politics", "DCSext.author": "Simon Johnson", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2014-02-02 16:57"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19ca\"", "article_summary": "Margaret Thatcher is to blame for Scotland's destructive relationship with alcohol, the SNP\u2019s health minister has claimed.\n\"Figures demonstrate that the deterioration in Scotland's record with alcohol began almost to the day Margaret Thatcher left office \u2013 make of that what you will.\nBut the Tories described the intervention as \"preposterous\" and said Neil was \"parroting myths about Baroness Thatcher nearly 25 years after she left office\".\nThe Sunday Post reported that the Health Minister said most of the increase in deaths \u201csince Thatcher took power in 1979\u201d was down to alcohol and drug abuse, violence and suicide.\nA spokesman for shopworkers union Usdaw said: \"These remarks could be considered as insulting by many people who work in retail and are ill-advised."}
