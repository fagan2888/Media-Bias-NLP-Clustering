(Courtesy photo/Town of Mead Animal Control)\n\nWhen Town of Mead Code Enforcement and Animal Control Officer Ismael Aldana received a call Monday morning about a cat stuck in a dumpster, he knew the cat was in trouble.\n\n\"It looked like this cat had been there a minimum of 48 hours,\" Aldana said. \"It was pretty dehydrated and exhausted. It was trying to get its head out.\"\n\nAldana said the cat stuck her head in a drain hole on the commercial-sized dumpster to get at the food inside, probably pizza and fries, and couldn't get her head back out.\n\nHe added that the man at the scene who reported the cat had placed a box under the cat's feet, because she was basically hanging out of the hole.\n\nMead animal control officers were able to rescue this feral cat that got its head stuck in a hole in a dumpster. (Courtesy photo/Town of Mead Animal Control)\n\nAldana contacted Longmont Friends of Feral and Abandoned Cats, who agreed to take the cat. He also called the Town of Mead Public Works Department, so they could come up with a solution.\n\n\"We put our brains together to see what we were going to do,\" he said.\n\nSolution \u2014 electrical grease.\n\n\"My biggest issue is it was going to fight when we tried to get it out,\" he said. \"It was exhausted, but animals will still fight.\"\n\nAnother solution \u2014 call the Mead Veterinary Medical Center to come out and sedate the cat.\n\nAldana said once the cat was sedated, he rubbed grease onto her neck and was able to get her head out of the drain. He named her Catillac.\n\n\"I got that from the old cartoon 'Heathcliff,'\" he said. \"I was a big fan of that cartoon.\"\n\nTonni Loutzenhiser, Executive Director of Longmont Friends of Feral and Abandoned Cats, said Catillac is tired but appears to be healthy. She said Catillac is feral, but her organization is going to try to tame her.\n\nLoutzenhiser said if they can't tame Catillac, they will try to find her a barn home, but she believes they will be able to tame her because she is still young.\n\nAldana said Mead is a small town, so Catillac's rescue was a big deal for the animal control department.\n\n\"I don't think that cat would have made it if he stayed there for the rest of the day,\" he said.\n\nJohn Bear: 303-684-5212, bearj@timescall.com or twitter.com/johnbearwithme", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/carbon-valley-news/ci_29167758/great-mead-cat-rescue-grease-sedatives-help-free", "modificationDate": "2015-11-26T09:30:15-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1125/20151125__26TCACATw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By John Bear \n  Staff Writer", "description": "When Town of Mead Code Enforcement and Animal Control Officer Ismael  Aldana received a call Monday morning about a cat stuck in a dumpster, he knew the cat was in trouble.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29167758:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-26T09:28:29-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/carbon-valley-news/ci_29167758/great-mead-cat-rescue-grease-sedatives-help-free", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1125/20151125__26TCACATw~2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "When Town of Mead Code Enforcement and Animal Control Officer Ismael  Aldana received a call Monday morning about a cat stuck in a dumpster, he knew the cat was in trouble.", "title": "The great Mead cat rescue: Grease, sedatives help free feline stuck in dumpster"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "When Town of Mead Code Enforcement and Animal Control Officer Ismael  Aldana received a call Monday morning about a cat stuck in a dumpster, he knew the cat was in trouble.", "title": "The great Mead cat rescue: Grease, sedatives help free feline stuck in dumpster", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/carbon-valley-news/ci_29167758/great-mead-cat-rescue-grease-sedatives-help-free", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1125/20151125__26TCACATw~2.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-26T09:28:29-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-11-25T20:27:24-0700", "sailthru.title": "The great Mead cat rescue: Grease, sedatives help free feline stuck in dumpster", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Carbon Valley", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By John BearStaff", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1125/20151125__26TCACATw~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-11-26T09:30:36-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Carbon Valley Frederick Firestone Dacono Colorado news sports living schools"}, "article_summary": "Mead animal control officers were able to rescue this feral cat that got its head stuck in a hole in a dumpster.\nDespite being rescued from the dumpster, this feral cat was in a foul mood.\n(Courtesy photo/Town of Mead Animal Control)When Town of Mead Code Enforcement and Animal Control Officer Ismael Aldana received a call Monday morning about a cat stuck in a dumpster, he knew the cat was in trouble.\n(Courtesy photo/Town of Mead Animal Control)Aldana contacted Longmont Friends of Feral and Abandoned Cats, who agreed to take the cat.\nAldana said Mead is a small town, so Catillac's rescue was a big deal for the animal control department."}
