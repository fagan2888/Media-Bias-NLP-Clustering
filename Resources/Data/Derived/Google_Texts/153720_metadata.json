The negotiating teams met often throughout the spring and early summer in a joint effort to achieve a contract settlement.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement the 625 lay teachers at the 17 high schools will receive a $1,350 pay increase but will also see an increase in the employee deduction in their medical plan.\n\nOne obvious benefit of the settlement is the avoidance of a strike this fall at just about the time of the visit of Pope Francis.\n\n\u201cBoth the Association and the School System are pleased that these successful negotiations will assure students and their parents that the 17 archdiocesan high schools will open on time in September, poised for another year of success,\u201d the joint statement said.\n\nIn further comments, Christopher Mominey, the COO/Secretary for Catholic Education for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, said, \u201cOn behalf of the Office of Catholic Education, I am pleased that we were able to provide our students and school families the clear assurance that we are continuing our bold vision of growth and innovation this fall. I am grateful for the work that was done jointly in a spirit of collaboration in order to achieve this outcome.\n\n\u201cOur intention in every round of contract negotiations is to bargain in good faith with our valued educators to provide a fair and equitable contract that works to serve our students and school families. As I\u2019ve expressed directly to our teachers at the 17 high schools in the past, I have a deep admiration for the work that they do each day as we Catholic school educators in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia equip saints for life in this world and the next.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rita Schwartz, president of ACT and also of the National Association of Catholic School Teachers, what was done by mutual agreement is known as an \u201cearly bird contract\u201d \u2014 a contract that only considers key issues, in this case only wages and benefits, with no other issues on the table.\n\nThe initial plan was a settlement by June 1, and if not done by then there would be a switch to full negotiations on all issues, which would mean a much more protracted process.\n\nNeither side wanted a repeat of 2011 when an agreement was not reached, resulting in a two-week strike.\n\nA first proposed contract was presented by the archdiocese in May, which was rejected by the union membership at a May 27 meeting. The sticking point according to Schwartz was that the increase in employee health care contributions would eat up the offered pay raise.\n\nComplicating the issue was the fact that the archdiocese had recently changed its health care program from a contract with Independence Blue Cross with defined annual premiums to a self-insurance program that would still be administered by Blue Cross who would bill the archdiocese for actual outlay.\n\nThe rest of the archdiocesan employees were already covered by the new system and it seemed to be working well, according to Schwartz, but the teachers were only added last November, and without a full year in the plan they were uncertain what effect it would have on future payments, including the share paid by the employees.\n\nAfter union members rejected the proposal in May, the archdiocese suggested both parties scrap the stipulated agreement to go into full negotiations and continue with the early bird method instead, which they did.\n\nAfter further negotiation a new plan was presented by the archdiocese which both increased the pay raise and lowered the employee health care contribution. The two sides agreed upon it June 12, the last day of school, but it was not until June 24 that a meeting of the union membership could be arranged, at which time it was unanimously ratified.\n\nFor her part, Schwartz has nothing but good things to say about this year\u2019s negotiation process with the archdiocese.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately it is only for one year,\u201d she said. \u201cBut with the Affordable Care Act no one can predict where health care insurance is going.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Catholic Philly", "description": "The teachers ratified a new one-year deal June 25.
