Among many other things, there is what scientists have called a \u201chuman fingerprint\u201d \u2014 a pattern of warming in the troposphere and cooling in the stratosphere that is very likely characteristic of human influence.\n\nThe authors did not shrink from addressing one of the primary threads that critics have been pulling in their effort to unravel the scientific consensus \u2014 the recent flattening of global temperature rise.\n\n\u201cEach of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth\u2019s surface than any preceding decade since 1850,\u201d the IPCC notes.\n\nNevertheless, a detectable slowing of the warming trend between 1998 and 2012 might well have to do with recent volcanic eruptions, which add heat-reflective materials to the atmosphere, a decade-long solar cycle and simple decade-to-decade variability.\n\nThe experts should keep working to refine their picture of the climate system, with the caution and skepticism that good science demands. Meanwhile, America\u2019s leaders should not take the fruit of that skepticism \u2014 some continuing uncertainty \u2014 as license to continue stalling. Ignoring the real possibility of large increases in global temperature is not wise leadership. It\u2019s wishful thinking.\n\nThe Washington Post (Oct. 9)", "article_metadata": {"description": "If one body represents the international scientific consensus on global warming, it is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations panel that just released the first portion of its fifth authoritative report on the science.
