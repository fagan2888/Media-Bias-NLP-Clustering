He is a race-car driver and knows a slight breeze in the wrong direction can spin him out of control in a split second.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always something,\u201d he said.\n\nTruex will climb into a new-look, new-build No. 78 car for NASCAR\u2019s season-opening Daytona 500 on Sunday. And he already is playing catch-up, before the race starts.\n\nBut the pilot of the Denver-based Furniture Row Racing team won\u2019t try to dodge the stress.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not like, \u2018The season\u2019s starting, we\u2019re going to feel things out.\u2019 There\u2019s no lackadaisical feeling at the beginning,\u201d Truex told The Denver Post last week.\n\n\u201cDaytona 500 is here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest race of the year. You immediately start in the pressure cooker. You\u2019re putting all that pressure on yourself.\u201d\n\nTruex\u2019s performance last season shocked the stock-car circuit by bolting into the Sprint Cup final four. FRR, the only team based outside of North Carolina, became the first single-car team to reach the playoffs. Truex finished fourth, FRR\u2019s highest finish in 11 seasons.\n\nBut between the season-ending race at Homestead in South Florida and a return to the state for the Daytona 500, the Super Bowl of stock-car racing, his 78 has been revamped.\n\nFRR switched its manufacturer to Toyota from Chevrolet. It changed its technical alliance to Joe Gibbs Racing from Richard Childress Racing. And it gained two new sponsors, giving them a new paint job for 11 races this season.\n\nAll those changes probably will cause some drag on the 78 to begin the season. FRR\u2019s late-season success last fall left Truex less time to test his new setup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like drinking from a fire hose most days,\u201d said Cole Pearn, FRR\u2019s crew chief. \u201cIt\u2019s not often you throw out most of what you were doing.\u201d\n\nFRR believes the risk of scuttling a Chase-worthy car for a redone ride is worth the price, even if the results aren\u2019t immediate. Kyle Busch won NASCAR\u2019s Sprint Cup championship last season in a Toyota engine and chassis setup for Joe Gibbs Racing.\n\nTruex raced into NASCAR\u2019s elite last year with seven top-10 finishes early on. But if Truex\u2019s new 78 setup slows him off the line to start the 2016 season, hope won\u2019t be lost. Busch won his title last year after missing the first 11 races of the season with a broken leg and foot.\n\n\u201cYou have to have mistake-free racing, at the end of the day. That\u2019s what keeps you at the edge of your seat,\u201d said Pearn, in his second season as 78\u2019s crew chief. \u201cAs long as the stars align and we do our part, we should be back there.\u201d\n\nDaytona, though, didn\u2019t start well for Truex. He got docked a week ago during time-trial qualifications because a roof flap didn\u2019t meet specifications. Then on Thursday he crashed on the final lap of qualifications when Jimmie Johnson\u2019s car spun and pinned the 78 against the wall. Truex was forced into his backup car. He will start 28th in the 44-car field Sunday.\n\nBut he turned in the second- fastest practice speed Friday, running 198.64 mph \u2014 tied with Busch and a split second behind Denny Hamlin.\n\n\u201cHow far we\u2019ve come as a team, with Cole and I and our engineering group, I feel like they can figure out anything,\u201d Truex said.\n\n\u201cYeah, we have new cars and new sponsors and a new manufacturer and all this stuff. But the team remains the same. And that\u2019s the difference-maker for us. You just have to get out there and get it done.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Martin Truex Jr. rolling dice with revamped 78 at Daytona for Furniture Row Racing", "title": "Martin Truex Jr. rolling dice with revamped 78 at Daytona for Furniture Row Racing", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/20/martin-truex-jr-rolling-dice-with-revamped-78-at-daytona-for-furniture-row-racing/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160220__BN20160221_CC14_BNSP21CARTRUEXp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160220__BN20160221_CC14_BNSP21CARTRUEXp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-20T19:24:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T04:22:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But the pilot of the Denver-based Furniture Row Racing team won\u2019t try to dodge the stress.\nThat\u2019s what keeps you at the edge of your seat,\u201d said Pearn, in his second season as 78\u2019s crew chief.\n78 car for NASCAR\u2019s season-opening Daytona 500 on Sunday.\nBut if Truex\u2019s new 78 setup slows him off the line to start the 2016 season, hope won\u2019t be lost.\nKyle Busch won NASCAR\u2019s Sprint Cup championship last season in a Toyota engine and chassis setup for Joe Gibbs Racing."}
