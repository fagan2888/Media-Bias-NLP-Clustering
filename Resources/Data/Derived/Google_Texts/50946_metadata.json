The term \u201csocialist\u201d has become such a toxic epithet in our political culture that the two chief candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have spent considerable time confronting the term \u2013 with Hillary Clinton correctly pointing out that it doesn\u2019t apply to her center-left views, even as Bernie Sanders valiantly strives to remove its stigma by self-identifying as a \u201cdemocratic socialist.\u201d\n\nIn light of all this, one might be forgiven for assuming that America\u2019s founders were unilaterally right-wing in their economic ideology. After all, if this wasn\u2019t the case, liberals could easily debunk attempts to delegitimize them by simply citing the incontrovertible facts of American history.\n\nWhich brings us to the five reasons why liberals can be just as comfortable as conservatives in claiming the founding fathers as their own.\n\n1. The founding fathers constantly disagreed with each other.\n\nIt is easy to talk about the founding fathers as if they were a monolithic body, but as records of the Constitutional Convention and The Federalist Papers clearly demonstrate, the men who created this country disagreed on everything from the enumerated powers in each branch of government and the abolition of slavery to, yes, the role that the state should play in regulating economic policy.\n\nSince there are too many examples of the latter to comprehensively discuss in one article, I\u2019ll limit my exploration to one of the most fundamental questions of all \u2014 the general welfare clause of the Constitution (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1), which empowers Congress \u201c[t]o lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence [sic] and general Welfare of the United States.\u201d\n\nWhen conservatives argue that \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d does not cover left-wing economic policies, they often cite James Madison (from The Federalist No. 41), who argued that it should be construed as narrowly as possible, insisting that \u201cit would have been difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing an authority to legislate in all possible cases.\u201d Less than four years later, however, Alexander Hamilton argued that the term \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d simply referred to Congress\u2019s power to impose taxes for any program that would serve the broader public interest, pointing out (in his Report on Manufactures) that \u201cit is therefore of necessity left to the discretion of the National Legislature, to pronounce, upon the objects, which concern the general Welfare, and for which under that description, an appropriation of money is requisite and proper.\u201d\n\nWhile legal and historical scholars disagree to this day as to whether Madison or Hamilton was correct, there is no question that they shared the same basic difference of opinion on economic questions as many Americans today. That said, there is one point on which they would not have disagreed.\n\n2. The Constitution was created because America\u2019s first government was too weak.\n\nDespite their penchant for name-dropping the Constitution as proof that the central government should be as weak as possible, conservatives ignore that the Constitution was actually written because America\u2019s first federal government was too weak. Signed in 1781, the Articles of Confederation did not allow Congress to impose taxes, impose uniform tariff policies throughout the country, or effectively address the economic concerns of ordinary citizens \u2014 in particular, those who had incurred massive debt during the American Revolution and were being hounded by their creditors.\n\nThis last detail is especially important, since James Madison himself later wrote that it \u201ccontributed more to that uneasiness which produced the Constitution and prepared the mind for a general reform\u201d than any other problem. As a result, the Constitution included protections for citizens facing bankruptcy, explicitly allowed Congress to collect taxes, and in general focused on fixing the problems that had become apparent in the Articles of Confederation.\n\nThat said, as Madison admitted in a private letter in 1832, economic powers that didn\u2019t appear in the Constitution weren\u2019t always rejected or not adopted because the federal government wasn\u2019t intended to have them. \u201cWithout knowing the reasons for the votes in those cases, no such inference can be sustained,\u201d Madison observed. \u201cThe propositions might be disapproved because they were in a bad form or not in order; because they blended other powers with the particular power in question; or because the object had been, or would be, elsewhere provided for.\u201d\n\n3. George Washington created the United States Post Office.\n\nThis may not seem like a big deal today, but when President Washington signed the Postal Office Act of 1792, he created what was then the most far-reaching and sophisticated postal service in the Western world. In the process, the post office actively worked to make Americans into better democratic citizens by shaking them out of the provincial mindsets they would otherwise develop from living on farms or in small towns before the Industrial Revolution. As historian Richard R. John explains in his award-winning book on the subject,\n\n\u201cBy facilitating the regular transmission of information throughout the length and breadth of the United States, the postal system provided ordinary Americans with information about the wider world that they could obtain in no other way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While the right constantly points to the founding fathers as exemplars of its philosophy, the truth is more nuanced", "title": "5 reasons why modern wing-nuts would\u2019ve hated the founding fathers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "While the right constantly points to the founding fathers as exemplars of its philosophy, the truth is more nuanced", "title": "5 reasons why modern wing-nuts would\u2019ve hated the founding fathers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/27/5_reasons_why_modern_wing_nuts_wouldve_hated_the_founding_fathers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/hamilton_washington_jefferson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While the right constantly points to the founding fathers as exemplars of its philosophy, the truth is more nuanced", "title": "5 reasons why modern wing-nuts would\u2019ve hated the founding fathers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/hamilton_washington_jefferson.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Matthew Rozsa", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Conservatism, History, Progressivism, Socialism, The Founding Fathers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Which brings us to the five reasons why liberals can be just as comfortable as conservatives in claiming the founding fathers as their own.\nThe founding fathers constantly disagreed with each other.\nTopics: Conservatism, History, Progressivism, Socialism, The Founding Fathers, News, Politics NewsIf you\u2019re a Democrat (or, for that matter, a progressive of any stripe) the chances are you\u2019ve heard conservatives evoke the founding fathers when dismissing your beliefs on economic issues.\n\u201cWithout knowing the reasons for the votes in those cases, no such inference can be sustained,\u201d Madison observed.\nAfter all, if this wasn\u2019t the case, liberals could easily debunk attempts to delegitimize them by simply citing the incontrovertible facts of American history."}
