There have been some proprietary issues. Certain EHRs don't allow physicians to prescribe electronically. But now that Rhode Island Hospital is on board, having EPIC integrated should speed things along.\"\n\nThe Rhode Island Quality Institute, who manages CurrentCare, recently touted the addition of Lifespan and Care New England's \"EPIC\" EHR system to CurrentCare -- and last fall announced that CurrentCare enrollment topped 400,000 patients.\n\nData from the 990s for the nonprofit shows that RIQI, which oversees several other programs besides CurrentCare, had revenue streams between $11 million and $17 million over the past three years, with expenses ranging between $12 and $14 million yearly. The Center for Freedom and Prosperity's Open Gov state spending website show that the state alone paid over $2 million to RIQI since 2010.\n\nHowever, the state HIT survey showed that while healthcare providers were familiar with various components of CurrentCare, fewer than two out of ten physicians - of which there are just over 5000 in the state -- utilized the product in 2014.\n\n\"Government is simply less efficient than the free market system. While public ventures generally begin with good intentions, public funding too often results in lack of accountability. We are not aware of any built-in system that systematically reviews programs for efficacy nor provide any cost/benefit analysis,\" said Pam Gencarella wit taxpayer advocacy group OSTPA. \"That is why RI government is bloated. We believe there should be such a system of review and it should apply to all government programs.\"\n\nEHRs in the Spotlight\n\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse, who sits on the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), was part of a recent hearing last week to explore how the federal government can improve the use of electronic health records (EHRs).\n\nIn release following the hearing, Whitehouse's office said that the Senator had recently \"helped convene state health care leaders... [to]develop a series of recommendations for Governor Raimondo and the General Assembly to pursue, which included expanding incentives for EHR adoption and utilization targets.\"\n\nThe HIT survey reported that of responding physicians, despite agreeing EHR's improve many aspects of care, fewer than half of hospital and office-based physicians agree that EHRs improve job satisfaction.\n\n\"The promise of EHRs has not been fulfilled as promised,\" said DeToy. \"I can remember talking to doctors, back when these were discussed in the [1990s], and saying if you can control your data, that's the holy grail -- but they haven't gotten yet to interoperability. It's like me having a Droid, and you having an Apple.\"\n\n\"So doctors spent so much money on [EHRs] and never got the promised [return on investment]. They put the data in and can't get from everyone else. And yes, there are older generations who haven't taken to the change,\" continued DeToy. \"I spoken with doctors who told me, 'I've spent $50,000 and it hasn't saved me any money, it's cost me money.\"\n\nDeToy cautioned against reading into the survey responses, which represented 68% of physicians in the state.\n\n\"Remember that in this survey that they are relying on in self-reporting. As human beings we tend to be motivated to report when we're unhappy. If someone sends me a restaurant survey and I was relatively pleased, I probably won't respond,\" said DeToy. \"There's a grain of salt, but it's the best we have to work with.\"\n\nRI Taxpayers questioned however the amount of investment to date in CurrentCare, given its utilization numbers.\n\n\"In view of the fact that the ironically named \"Affordable Care Act\" (ObamaCare) has not led to more affordable healthcare choices, in fact, just the opposite, it has become crystal clear that more taxpayer or customer dollars is not the answer for our healthcare system,\" said Monique Chartier with RI Taxpayers. \"As the return on investment from \"CurrentCare\" appears to be far worse than for ObamaCare, it's time to cut all public funding for it. Privatization might be an option, as long as it is not accompanied by a government mandate on physicians to participate or to pay an involuntary fee.\"\n\nRelated Slideshow: 50 RI School Cafeterias with the Most Health Code Violations\n\nPrev Next #50 East Greenwich High School Number of Violations: 11 Sample Violation: Inspector Comments: The floor along the wall in the store room area has an accumulation of old mouse droppings.
