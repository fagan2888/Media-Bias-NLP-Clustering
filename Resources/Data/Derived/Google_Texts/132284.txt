Gulf Coast State College was filled with BBQ smoke Saturday evening for the 8th annual Grills Gone Wild competition.

Dozens of amateur and competition grill masters fired up their grills and cooked up their best barbecue; from chicken to ribs and even a barbecue sundae.

General admission and VIP tickets were sold, and proceeds from Saturday's event will go to 35 local charities.

"It has grown tremendously, we use to be just a small organization, now we have grown it to where we are actually giving out prize money and grillers are coming in to compete for prize money from all over the southeast region, explained Don Cooley, a member of the Panama City Beach Rotary Club.

"There's so many people here who are personal friends and have personal stories that we have heard, so this is a cool way to help people like that and also hear more stories that haven't been shared," said Olivia Kholstaedt, a Marketing Manager with event sponsor Panama City Toyota.

Event organizers with the Panama City Beach Rotary club say the goal for the event was to raise $100,000.
