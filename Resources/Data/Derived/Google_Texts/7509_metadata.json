Let\u2019s value private enterprise and personal responsibility. Let\u2019s spend within our means and not create more debt for our children and grandchildren.\n\nIs Collin Peterson responsible for that? Yes, because the first thing he did when he was elected to that Congress was to vote for Nancy Pelosi. He put her in charge of the machinery of Congress for that result to occur. That\u2019s how Congress works. He knows that much of what occurs there is procedural and through committees, so the leader wields incredible power. She has a say as to who serves on which committee, and how, and if, bills move through the House. Furthermore, he knows that Congress works essentially through a two party system, and they tend to vote in groups, so what the leader pushes to a large measure determines what the result will be.\n\nSo, it doesn\u2019t matter that he voted \u201cno,\u201d on the bill, because he voted \u201cyes\u201d when he voted for Nancy Pelosi to lead the Democrats in Congress, and that is the vote that mattered. Yes, Collin Peterson does vote conservatively on a number of issues important to the people of the Seventh District. Only he knows whether that is a matter of conviction or tactics to get re-elected. However, has his vote against a Democratic bill ever meant the difference of whether the Democratic bill passes? I don\u2019t think so, and so it is always a safe, meaningless vote \u2014 except for his re-electability. Furthermore, what is telling here is that Mr. Peterson says he won\u2019t vote to repeal Obamacare. That speaks volumes as to what his real position was on Obamacare.\n\nWhat has been the first thing Collin Peterson has done when he returns to Washington after being elected? He votes for Nancy Pelosi. So, regardless of how Collin Peterson otherwise may vote, a vote for Collin Peterson is a vote for Nancy Pelosi and gun control; A vote for Collin Peterson is a vote for the Nancy Pelosi and Obamacare and poorer medical care; A vote for Collin Peterson is a vote for Nancy Pelosi and \u201ctransgender\u201d men in women\u2019s bathrooms; A vote for Collin Peterson is a vote for Nancy Pelosi and Islam and Muslims sweeping across the nation; A vote for Collin Peterson is a vote for the Nancy Pelosi and more and more in-your-face control by the United Nations over our lives; A vote for Collin Peterson is a vote for Nancy Pelosi and extreme environmentalism.
