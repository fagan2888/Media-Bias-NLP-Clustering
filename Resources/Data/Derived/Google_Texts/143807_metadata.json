Trump said an \u201cearly thing\u201d he\u2019d do if elected would be to approach the \u201cwealthy\u201d nations and ask for back payments. He said that countries think America is \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re no longer the stupid country (that protects nations who have late payments),\u201d he said to cheers.\n\nHe urged the crowd to vote Tuesday, telling people that if they vote for him, they\u2019ll remember the vote as \u201cthe single greatest vote I ever cast.\u201d\n\nHis speech touched on his policy for Middle East, calling the region \u201ca big, fat, ugly mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll build three schools in different countries in the Middle East, they get blown up, we rebuild them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut if we want to build a school in Pennsylvania, the government says we have no money.\u201d\n\nBoos from the crowd ensued when Trump mentioned the current government has spent over $4 trillion in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cIf our politicians went on vacation 15 years ago, we would be a lot better off in the Middle East than we are now,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t disappoint the crowd that cheered during mentions of \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d (Clinton) and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d (Cruz). He dismissed both of the presidential candidates during his almost hour-long speech.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got bad judgment,\u201d Trump said of Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s criminal,\u201d he added regarding her use of private email accounts during her stint with as Secretary of State.\n\nBased on the news Sunday night that Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich \u201ccolluded\u201d \u2014 conspire \u2014 to keep Trump from getting the needed 1,273 delegates, Trump told the crowd that \u201cCruz can\u2019t do it himself.\u201d He told the crowd his campaign calls Kasich \u201cone-in-43\u201d because of Kasich\u2019s lone delegate win in Ohio. Trump said a contested convention won\u2019t be needed, as he\u2019s confident \u201cI\u2019m going to win on the first ballot.\u201d\n\nThe Republican front-runner said he cares about \u201cwinning this nomination, beating Hillary Clinton and doing a great job for our nation.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump reminded those in the audience, how much he loved Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cI went to school in Pennsylvania, my son (Eric) went to school in Pennsylvania, my daughter (Ivanka) went to school in Pennsylvania,\u201d Trump continued.\n\nBefore the speech, U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Hazleton, and U.S. Rep. Thomas A. Marino, R-Lycoming Township, took the stage to pump up the crowd of nearly 12,000.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is going to make sure your children are going to have a great future,\u201d Marino said to cheers.\n\nBarletta told the crowd that Trump can\u2019t be bought by lobbyists or corporations, as he\u2019s self-funding his campaign. The Hazleton native called Trump\u2019s campaign a \u201cmovement.\u201d Trump used the same word during the speech, when talking about his supporters.\n\nThough unconfirmed by arena or Trump staff, Trump stated that 6,000 people were unable to get inside the arena. He called his supporters \u201cthe smartest and by far the loyalist.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Wilkes-Barre area visit was his third of the day Monday, following rallies in Warwick, Rhode Island, and West Chester. He was also the only candidate this cycle \u2014 Democrat or Republican \u2014 to come to Luzerne County.\n\nBefore leaving the stage, Trump thanked the arena for \u201ca good time\u201d and reminded them to \u201cget a good\u2019s nights sleep, and start (voting) early,\u201d before he reiterated his feelings for Pennsylvania with an \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump gives a campaign speech at Mohegan Sun Arena on Monday. 4/25/16.
