Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). \"We can deal with Iran -- or any other issue unrelated specifically to veterans -- with separate legislation.\"\n\nThough officially nonpartisan, the American Legion is known for having more-conservative, older members. NPR reported that legion members hearing from Mitt Romney in 2012 were \"not an Obama-friendly crowd.\"\n\nThe Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America offered a similar sentiment against linking Iran sanctions on Tuesday:\n\nThe Senate should not get distracted while debating & voting on the #vets bill. Iran sanctions, Obamacare, etc. aren\u2019t relevant to S. 1982. \u2014 IAVA (@iava) February 25, 2014\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) are leading the GOP push for new Iran sanctions. On Tuesday, Burr said that he wanted to put Iran sanctions language into a Republican amendment to the Sanders bill.\n\n\"It's important to Republicans and Democrats to have a vote on the Iran sanctions initiative,\" Burr said Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, he pointed out another reason to add Iran sanctions to the veterans measure. \"It happens to be a vehicle that might leave the United States Senate, and therefore it is an appropriate vehicle,\" he said.\n\nRepresentatives for Burr and McConnell did not immediately return requests for comment about the veterans groups' opposition.\n\nBut Sanders also opposes adding Iran sanctions to his legislation.\n\n\"What does Iran sanctions have to do with the veterans bill? And it has nothing to do with the veterans law. That's the simple truth,\" he said on CNN Wednesday.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Troops Leave Iraq, 2011 Troops Leave Iraq, 2011\n\n1 of 6 Troops Leave Iraq The last vehicles in a convoy of the U.S. Army's 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division crosses the border from Iraq into Kuwait, Sunday, Dec. 18, 2011.
