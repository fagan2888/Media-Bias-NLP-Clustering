The Department of Human Services has said many people are likely still eligible for coverage but failed to respond in time or for some DHS may have failed to process it. Others claim to have never received a letter at all.\n\nRandy Dollar of Jacksonville is one of them. He said the moment he discovered he lost his health insurance he literally had a mouth full of blood. The 53-year-old said a pharmacist told him after having a procedure to prepare for heart surgery.\n\n\u201cI had a heart valve put in and they wanted a dental clearance. When I went in they pulled twelve teeth, packed my mouth full of gauze,\u201d he said. \u201cI already had IVs hanging out both arms then they gave me two prescriptions. One for pain pills and one for antibiotics. I go down to the pharmacy to get them filled, in the same building, and then they said, \u2018your insurance is terminated.\u2019\u201d\n\nDollar said he was informed by the pharmacy on August 3rd, just two days before his scheduled heart surgery. He said the clinic that performed his open-heart surgery checked his coverage in mid-July, before it was terminated, so the procedure wasn\u2019t canceled.\n\nFollowing surgery Dollar said he couldn\u2019t follow medical advice about recovery because he couldn\u2019t afford necessary prescriptions. The lapse in coverage nearly cost his life for the second time.\n\n\u201cThis glitch almost killed me two or three times,\u2019 Dollar said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fill my prescriptions, and this is one day out of heart surgery. I got a handful of prescriptions and I can\u2019t fill them. Four days later I went to the emergency room at Arkansas Heart Hospital.\u201d\n\nAfter facing a medically dangerous and financially burdensome gap in coverage Dollar said he was eventually able to appeal his termination, submit income verification and had his coverage re-instated. The governor\u2019s office has noted that those who have received termination notices have 90 days to appeal and can recoup costs.\n\nDollar said he never received a letter from the Department of Human Services requiring proof of income to be submitted within 10-days of when the request was initiated at DHS.\n\nArkansas has twice offered major adjustments to the process. The governor previously enacted a two-week moratorium to help DHS deal with an \u201cinformation overload\u201d and increased staff levels. Envelopes and the message on the DHS letter have also been reconfigured, designed to be more understandable.\n\nTwo of three private insurance companies have also offered to continue prescription coverage, with the agreement the state will reimburse them if individuals are later found to in fact still have been eligible for Medicaid after termination.\n\nThat continued pharmacy benefit does not extend to very low-income people, children, and the medically frail on traditional Medicaid, rather than the states private option version of Medicaid expansion. The director of AACF Rich Huddleston estimated 8,000 poor children and 8,000 medically frail are among those with newly terminated plans.\n\nLast week federal officials directed Arkansas to extend the 10-day window to 30 days. In recent weeks Governor Hutchinson repeatedly defended the 10-day time limit saying it \u201cinvigorated\u201d the process. However, Arkansas still made the switch to 30 days. It does not retroactively applied to the 59,000 people who already lost coverage under the old rules.The executive director of Arkansas Citizens First Congress said the governor needs to give everyone on Medicaid the same window of time.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have health care coverage for unfair reasons. The governor should reinstate those people immediately,\u201d said Kopsky. \u201cThen go through it, because we agree that people that don\u2019t qualify do need to be weeded out of the system. There\u2019s no doubt about that but it needs to be done consistently, fairly, and effectively and they haven\u2019t met any of those standards.\u201d\n\nArkansas Advocates for Children and Families director of health policy Marquita Little said the process of Medicaid redetermination could go more smoothly if Arkansas invested in better outreach efforts. The Republican controlled Legislature banned outreach funding in 2014 for some aspects of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe had a pretty robust marketing, education, outreach process in place previously using federal grant dollars. We had over 500 in-person assisters working around the state and helping people in their communities. Now we have 15. There were commercials and radio spots but what\u2019s happened since that time is that private organizations have had to try and fill in that gap. It\u2019s been a much more limited amount,\u201d said Little. \u201cWe saw that it worked, that\u2019s how we got so many people enrolled originally.\u201d\n\nArkansas cut its uninsured rate more than any other state in the nation since the ACA was adopted. It dropped from 22 percent to just over 9 percent from 2013 to midyear 2015.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local & Regional News", "description": "A rally at the state Capitol on Wednesday tried to drive home the message that Arkansas\u2019s beleaguered Medicaid verification process is resulting in some", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://ualrpublicradio.org/post/groups-call-50000-plus-arkansas-medicaid-plans-be-reinstated", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuar/files/styles/medium/public/201509/dollar.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A rally at the state Capitol on Wednesday tried to drive home the message that Arkansas\u2019s beleaguered Medicaid verification process is resulting in some", "title": "Groups Call For 50,000-plus Arkansas Medicaid Plans To Be Reinstated"}, "story_id": 437196800, "twitter": {"site": "@kuarpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kuarkauffman"}, "author": "Jacob Kauffman", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Groups Call For 50,000-plus Arkansas Medicaid Plans To Be Reinstated"}, "nid": 46983, "datePublished": "2015-09-03", "keywords": "Arkansas Politics, Arkansas Health, Arkansas Healthcare", "wordCount": 1519, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06f6\"", "article_summary": "The 53-year-old said a pharmacist told him after having a procedure to prepare for heart surgery.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t fill my prescriptions, and this is one day out of heart surgery.\nThe state is embarking on its first attempt to verify income eligibility since Medicaid expansion was adopted.\nThe director of AACF Rich Huddleston estimated 8,000 poor children and 8,000 medically frail are among those with newly terminated plans.\nThat continued pharmacy benefit does not extend to very low-income people, children, and the medically frail on traditional Medicaid, rather than the states private option version of Medicaid expansion."}
