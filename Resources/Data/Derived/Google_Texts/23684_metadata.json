Steny Hoyer, D-Md., second in the House Democratic hierarchy, didn't rule out supporting the GOP legislation dubbed the \"Keep Your Health Care Plan Act of 2013\" (although he sounded like a man who'd prefer to drink muddy water rather than vote for a bill whose passage would hand Obamacare's Republican foes a significant victory).\n\n\"We'll see what the bill says before I make a determination,\" Hoyer told journalists at a Tuesday briefing. The legislation was crafted by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nHoyer's clear preference is for the Obama White House to find an administrative workaround, ideally before the likely House vote Friday.\n\nAsked if House Democrats would be pressing the White House for a solution, Hoyer said: \"[I] don't know whether we'll press them, but they say they're coming up with it. But sooner rather than later [telling us] what they're thinking ... would be better, yes.\"\n\nCuriously, at about the time Hoyer left the door open to the Upton bill, White House press secretary Jay Carney seemed intent on closing it.\n\n\"Broadly speaking ... we do not see that as fixing the problem; we see that as throwing the, you know, baby out with the bath water,\" Carney said of Upton's bill. The problem with the measure, Carney said, is it would let insurance companies sell policies that failed to meet the higher coverage standards set by Obamacare.\n\nIf the White House doesn't find an answer before the House votes on the Upton bill, Democratic leaders could see a significant part of their caucus vote with Republicans.\n\nThat happened on July 17, when 35 Democrats \u2014 some facing close re-election races next year, like Reps. Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona and Nick Rahall of West Virginia \u2014 voted yes on a bill that passed the House that would have delayed the individual mandate for a year. It was ignored by the Senate.\n\nCopyright 2016 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.\n\nMissing some content? Care to comment?
