Both are tasked with creating a media campaign to entice new enrollees, specifically minorities.\n\nFacing the worst drought in recent memory\u2014 spurring rising food costs and job losses \u2014 Californians have better uses for tax dollars than another PR campaign, says Sen. Ted Gaines, who plans to ask for an audit of Covered California\u2019s marketing department.\n\n\u201cOgilvy made some major mistakes in their advanced outreach, specifically with the use of Richard Simmons. Why are they being rewarded with a renewed contract when they wasted taxpayer money?\u201d asked Gaines. \u201cThe video bombed; I wasn\u2019t able to get satisfactory answers as to what they accomplished with this.\u201d\n\nLast year Gaines demanded an audit of Covered California\u2019s marketing department, but the state\u2019s Joint Legislative Audit Committee \u2014 composed mostly of Democrats \u2014 refused to order an investigation. Now the committee has new leadership, and Gaines thinks he has a great shot at success when next meeting is held Aug. 25.\n\nClick here for more from Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-07-06 01:03:32 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "A publicity firm that produced a costly webcast for California Obamacare featuring a gyrating Richard Simmons was\u00a0retained, along with another company, for three more years at a cost of\u00a0$156 million.", "twitter": {"description": "A publicity firm that produced a costly webcast for California Obamacare featuring a gyrating Richard Simmons was\u00a0retained, along with another company, for three more years at a cost of\u00a0$156 million.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/01/architects-richard-simmons-obamacare-dance-off-rehired-in-156m-pr-campaign.html", "title": "Architects of Richard Simmons Obamacare dance-off rehired in $156M PR campaign", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Architects of Richard Simmons Obamacare dance-off rehired in $156M PR campaign\",\"image_url\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-01T12:27:23Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/01/architects-richard-simmons-obamacare-dance-off-rehired-in-156m-pr-campaign.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"c87d75b0-2d0e-405c-aeca-47691d072749\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "A publicity firm that produced a costly webcast for California Obamacare featuring a gyrating Richard Simmons was\u00a0retained, along with another company, for three more years at a cost of\u00a0$156 million.", "dc.identifier": "c87d75b0-2d0e-405c-aeca-47691d072749", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "pagetype": "article", "description": "A publicity firm that produced a costly webcast for California Obamacare featuring a gyrating Richard Simmons was\u00a0retained, along with another company, for three more years at a cost of\u00a0$156 million.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "watchdog.org", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "Architects Of Richard Simmons Obamacare Dance-off Rehired In $156m Pr Campaign", "dcterms.created": "2015-07-06 01:03:32 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "A publicity firm that produced a costly webcast for California Obamacare featuring a gyrating Richard Simmons was\u00a0retained, along with another company, for three more years at a cost of\u00a0$156 million.", "title": "Architects of Richard Simmons Obamacare dance-off rehired in $156M PR campaign | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/01/architects-richard-simmons-obamacare-dance-off-rehired-in-156m-pr-campaign.html", "image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-07-01", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Architects of Richard Simmons Obamacare dance-off rehired in $156M PR campaign\",\"image_url\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-01T12:27:23Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/01/architects-richard-simmons-obamacare-dance-off-rehired-in-156m-pr-campaign.html\",\"post_id\":\"c87d75b0-2d0e-405c-aeca-47691d072749\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "article_summary": "A publicity firm that produced a costly webcast for California Obamacare featuring a gyrating Richard Simmons was retained, along with another company, for three more years at a cost of $156 million.\nCovered California signed the contracts last week with Ogilvy Public Relations \u2014 maker of the $137-million Simmons video \u2014 and Campbell Ewald.\n\u201cOgilvy made some major mistakes in their advanced outreach, specifically with the use of Richard Simmons.\nBoth are tasked with creating a media campaign to entice new enrollees, specifically minorities.\nNow the committee has new leadership, and Gaines thinks he has a great shot at success when next meeting is held Aug. 25."}
