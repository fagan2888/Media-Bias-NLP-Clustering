Claire McCaskill said, \u201cWe need to de-militarize this situation.\u201d Journalists reporting live on the demonstrations sparked by the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown expressed befuddlement as to why the police needed high-caliber weapons better suited for war zones than protests in an American city.\n\nBut one group of people is decidedly happy about the militarized response in Ferguson: those who work in the weapons industry. The array of police forces\u2013the Missouri State Highway Patrol, the St. Louis county and city police and local Ferguson officers\u2013that descended on the largely black Missouri city have used the products these corporations are selling in abundance. Tear gas, rubber bullets, smoke bombs, stun grenades, armored personnel carriers, sound cannons and high-caliber rifles have all been deployed to quell the unrest, though they have contributed to anger over police tactics.\n\nThe police response is the perfect showcase for the companies that manufacture military equipment for law enforcement use. They can point to the police tactics to sell their products to other law enforcement agencies preparing for demonstrations. And in Missouri, the police\u2019s massive use of armaments like tear gas mean that their stock is becoming depleted and they will need to re-up their purchases. These companies will profit from the tension in Ferguson, and could fuel even greater militarization of the police, a trend that began with the war on drugs and has accelerated in recent years with the advent of the war on terror.\n\nThe companies getting mileage out of the unrest in Ferguson are vast. The LRAD Corporation manufactures the long-range acoustic devices that have emitted piercing noises at protesters in Missouri. These sound devices can cause headaches and other types of pain. The police in Ferguson are also using the Bearcat armored truck manufactured by Lenco. That vehicle, costing $360,000, was paid for with Department of Homeland Security grant money, according to the New York Times. Since 2003, over $9 million in grants from Homeland Security have flowed to police in St. Louis, according to the Times. Overall, since the September 11 terror attacks, $34 billion in such grants have been given to law enforcement agencies across the country, showing it is the federal government fueling police militarization.\n\nThe Ferguson police department has received two armored Humvees, a generator and a trailer from the U.S. military, according to the Associated Press. Police departments around the nation have received the military\u2019s surplus equipment, which has brought weapons used in Afghanistan and Iraq to local towns and cities. Congress first passed a law authorizing the funneling of surplus military equipmentto domestic law enforcement in 1990. It\u2019s now known as the 1033 program, referring to the section of the program in the Pentagon budget.\n\nThe Justice Department has also gotten in on the action. Justice Department grants have paid for tear gas and rubber bullets, though it\u2019s not clear if police in Ferguson used those grants to buy their own tear gas.\n\nWhoever paid for it, the companies that make tear-gas are sure to benefit from the Ferguson demonstrations. Two corporations\u2019 tear-gas products have been fired on demonstrators in recent days: Combined Tactical Systems (CTS) and Defense Technology. CTS, headquartered in Pennsylvania, is well-known for being a leading supplier of tear gas around the world, including to the governments of Israel, Egypt and Bahrain, which buy the weapons with the generous amounts of U.S. military aid given to them. Defense Technology, also based in Pennsylvania, has likewise profited from tear gas sold to Israel, Egypt and Bahrain, in addition to Yemen, Turkey and Tunisia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sales of all those military-grade weapons are making numerous American arms dealers extremely rich", "author": "Alex Kane", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sales of all those military-grade weapons are making numerous American arms dealers extremely rich", "title": "Ferguson is big business: How companies are profiting from police crackdowns", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/24/ferguson_is_big_business_how_companies_are_profiting_from_police_crackdowns_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/ferguson13.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sales of all those military-grade weapons are making numerous American arms dealers extremely rich", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/ferguson13.jpg", "title": "Ferguson is big business: How companies are profiting from police crackdowns", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Ferguson is big business: How companies are profiting from police crackdowns", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Ferguson, Missouri, st. louis", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde53c\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Ferguson, Missouri, st. louis, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetThe tear-gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs fired in Ferguson, Missouri have fed outrage over police militarization in the U.S.\nThey can point to the police tactics to sell their products to other law enforcement agencies preparing for demonstrations.\nThe police response is the perfect showcase for the companies that manufacture military equipment for law enforcement use.\nJustice Department grants have paid for tear gas and rubber bullets, though it\u2019s not clear if police in Ferguson used those grants to buy their own tear gas.\nDefense Technology, also based in Pennsylvania, has likewise profited from tear gas sold to Israel, Egypt and Bahrain, in addition to Yemen, Turkey and Tunisia."}
