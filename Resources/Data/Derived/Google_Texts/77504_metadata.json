In comments reported by The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa, Bachmann said she fears that allowing undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States could create a new class of \u201cilliterate\u201d Democratic voters.\n\nBachmann described Obama\u2019s coming executive orders\u2014which have infuriated congressional Republicans who have spent years fighting immigration reform\u2014as \u201cunskilled, illiterate foreign nationals.\u201d Obama on Wednesday confirmed that he would outline his plans on Thursday. He is expected to announce a program that would reduce the likelihood that a family would be separated by deportation, with special considerations made for undocumented parents who need to provide for children.\n\n\u201cThe social cost will be profound on the U.S. taxpayer\u2014millions of unskilled, illiterate, foreign nationals coming into the United States who can\u2019t speak the English language,\u201d Bachmann said. \u201cPeople do vote without being a citizen. It\u2019s a wink and a nod, we all know it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d (Fact check: voter impersonation almost never happens. One exhaustive study found 31 credible cases\u2014out of 1 billion votes cast since 2000.)\n\nLeaders of the Republican Party have retained attorneys and said they might challenge the constitutionality of both the Affordable Care Act and Obama\u2019s immigration-related executive orders. Last June, the Senate passed an immigration-reform bill that House Speaker John Boehner has since refused to bring to the floor. Obama had reportedly planned to move on immigration earlier, but held his executive orders until after the November 4 midterm elections, at the request of Democratic candidates who worried that the measures would hurt them at the polls.\n\nGiven America\u2019s history of using literacy tests to disenfranchise minority voters, Bachmann\u2019s suggestion that Democratic votes could be cast by \u201cilliterate,\u201d non-citizen residents is pretty foul. (That\u2019s to say nothing of the G.O.P.\u2019s nationwide push for voter-I.D. laws, which have an outsize effect on minority voting.) It is, as Bachmann might phrase it, a wink and a nod to an unsubstantiated fear of minority agency at the polls. More gross posturing: Bachmann appears to have immediately walked back her use of \u201cilliterate,\u201d telling Costa that she was simply parroting language from \u201cAmerican Hispanics\u201d she spoke with when she visited the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cThose are not Michele Bachmann\u2019s words,\u201d said Michele Bachman.", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": "2014-11-19T05:45:00Z", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9Net 2016", "og": {"site_name": "Vanity Fair", "description": "Sounds like a literacy test.", "title": "Michele Bachmann: Obama Wants to Turn Immigrants Into \u201cIlliterate\u201d Democratic Voters", "url": "http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/11/michele-bachmann-immigrants-illiterate-democratic-voters", "image": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cab3a6b8f23e3a03152030/4:3/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.vanityfair.com", "description": "Sounds like a literacy test.", "title": "Michele Bachmann: Obama Wants to Turn Immigrants Into \u201cIlliterate\u201d Democratic Voters", "image": {"src": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cab3a6b8f23e3a03152030/master/pass/image.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 7802537, "app_id": 1591153417872059, "pages": 8810407571}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "News", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Sounds like a literacy test."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8d6\"", "article_summary": "In comments reported by The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa, Bachmann said she fears that allowing undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States could create a new class of \u201cilliterate\u201d Democratic voters.\nGiven America\u2019s history of using literacy tests to disenfranchise minority voters, Bachmann\u2019s suggestion that Democratic votes could be cast by \u201cilliterate,\u201d non-citizen residents is pretty foul.\nBachmann described Obama\u2019s coming executive orders\u2014which have infuriated congressional Republicans who have spent years fighting immigration reform\u2014as \u201cunskilled, illiterate foreign nationals.\u201d Obama on Wednesday confirmed that he would outline his plans on Thursday.\nIt is, as Bachmann might phrase it, a wink and a nod to an unsubstantiated fear of minority agency at the polls.\n\u201cThose are not Michele Bachmann\u2019s words,\u201d said Michele Bachman."}
