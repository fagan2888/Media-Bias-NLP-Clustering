Shoppers visit a brick-and-mortar store, examine a product, then use a mobile device to see if a better price is offered at other stores or e-commerce sites.\n\nAnalysts estimate that retailers lose as much as $217 billion a year in missed sales from showrooming customers. The fallout is bad enough that some stores were disabling wireless Internet connectivity to keep shoppers from browsing \u2014 an approach now largely discontinued.\n\nBut some merchants are confronting the issue head-on by offering to match competitors\u2019 prices.\n\nChief among them are Best Buy and Target, which in the past year have implemented or liberalized price-matching policies.\n\n\u201cPeople want to have information, including pricing, when they\u2019re making a purchase,\u201d said Dave Liken, manager of the Target in Glendale. \u201cI\u2019m sure all retailers have lost sales because of (showrooming), but we want to help customers as much as possible.\u201d\n\nStaffers in Target\u2019s electronics departments and service desks are equipped with iPads to look up product information and to confirm a customer\u2019s claim that an item is priced lower at a competing online retailer.\n\nTarget stores will match prices for identical products listed on Amazon.com, Walmart.com, BestBuy.com, Toysrus.com and even its own website, Target.com, as well as local brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nBest Buy takes the concept a step further by matching with a greater selection of online competitors, plus physical stores within a 25-mile radius.\n\n\u201cSome retailers think that showrooming is a dirty word,\u201d said national retail analyst Marshal Cohen of New York-based NPD Group. \u201cBut the progressive ones have learned to embrace it and make it work to their advantage.\u201d\n\nThe rapid growth of online commerce has brought the issue new visibility on the eve of the holiday shopping season.\n\nOverall retail sales are forecast to grow a modest 3.9 percent this season, but online sales will surge by an estimated 13 to 15 percent, according to the National Retail Federation and Shop.org.\n\nHigher-priced electronic goods \u2014 televisions, computers, smartphones, household appliances \u2014 are the products for which consumers are most likely to engage in online comparison shopping.\n\nWhile the chief defensive strategy against showrooming is to match prices, merchants also are attempting to convince customers that shopping in a store and talking to a sales associate can be a better experience than clicking on a website.\n\n\u201cWe work with retail clients to accentuate what they bring to the equation,\u201d said Cort Langworthy, a mobile-marketing expert at Lakewood-based Integer Group.\n\nLangworthy said brick-and-mortar merchants have attributes that can prove appealing to shoppers:\n\n\u2022 Instant gratification. Why wait for order processing and shipping when you can take the product home now? Some shoppers are willing to pay a price premium for that.\n\n\u2022 Exclusivity. Merchants can work with manufacturers to develop products carried only by their own stores.\n\n\u2022 Customer service. Talking to a sales rep in person, with a product that can be seen and touched, is a better experience for some consumers than online shopping.\n\nA recent survey by retail consulting firm SDL showed that 73 percent of U.S. shoppers would be willing to pay more for a product in exchange for what SDL described as a \u201cpositive customer experience.\u201d\n\nStill, analysts say showrooming undoubtedly will become a more prevalent practice with the growing use of smartphones and tablets.\n\nStaples Inc. announced recently that it will match competitors\u2019 prices, except for special sales events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\n\nWalmart and Toys R Us are among other retailers with price-matching programs.\n\nKmart does not price-match because the retailer believes its customers get good value from regular store prices and through its \u201cShop Your Way\u201d affinity program that gives members points and discounts on some products, said spokeswoman Megan Barrow.\n\nJenn Markey, vice president of marketing for Ottawa, Canada-based consulting firm 360pi, said some upscale retailers frown on price-matching because it diminishes their cachet with consumers.\n\n\u201cNeiman Marcus and Nordstrom, for example, are not trying to go after the low-price mentality,\u201d Markey said. \u201cIt actually could be harmful to their brand.\u201d\n\nSteve Raabe: 303-954-1948, sraabe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/steveraabedp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Retailers adapt to mobile phone comparison shopping", "title": "Retailers adapt to mobile phone comparison shopping", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/22/retailers-adapt-to-mobile-phone-comparison-shopping/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131122__20131124_K3_BZ24SHOWROOMINGJPICp1.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131122__20131124_K3_BZ24SHOWROOMINGJPICp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-22T17:38:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T09:50:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Analysts estimate that retailers lose as much as $217 billion a year in missed sales from showrooming customers.\nOverall retail sales are forecast to grow a modest 3.9 percent this season, but online sales will surge by an estimated 13 to 15 percent, according to the National Retail Federation and Shop.org.\n\u201cSome retailers think that showrooming is a dirty word,\u201d said national retail analyst Marshal Cohen of New York-based NPD Group.\nRetailers are learning to respect \u2014 not fear \u2014 their customers who whip out a smartphone to check competitors\u2019 prices.\nHigher-priced electronic goods \u2014 televisions, computers, smartphones, household appliances \u2014 are the products for which consumers are most likely to engage in online comparison shopping."}
