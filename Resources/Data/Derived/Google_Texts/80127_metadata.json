After a childhood spent in New York City\u2019s infamous Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood and a stint in the Army, Fairbanks\u2019 new chief of police has seen it all. Still, there is one aspect of his new home Aragon finds truly surprising.\n\n\u201cPeople are helpful and kind and friendly. I\u2019m not saying that in my last city they weren\u2019t friendly, but this is really to the nth degree as far as people really being genuinely kind and considerate,\u201d Aragon said. \u201cI like what I\u2019ve seen of Fairbanks. The Golden Heart City - it\u2019s not myth. It\u2019s realistic, and it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nAragon took over the Fairbanks Police Department in late November, leaving his previous position as police chief in La Marque, Texas, a town of about 15,000 just 50 miles south of Houston. He said it was his experience growing up in New York that pushed him toward a career in law enforcement.\n\n\u201cNew York City was rough back then, pre-Rudolph Giuliani. It was really a hard-core city with a lot of crime and neighborhood decay,\u201d Aragon said. \u201cI saw the other side of the coin. I said, \u2018I can make a difference by doing the right things right.\u2019\u201d\n\nAragon spent 10 years in various sheriff\u2019s departments before \u201cmaking the leap\u201d to small-town police chief, which he has done for the past 26 years. Before working in Texas, he served as a police chief in North Carolina, South Carolina and Arkansas.\n\nAragon said he has many ideas for the Fairbanks Police Department, but he\u2019s not about to try to change the world in a day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a slow mover on making changes - I\u2019ve learned from experience. I always use this analogy: you can\u2019t turn a battleship around on a dime. You got to go slow or else you\u2019re going to lose people in the shuffle, and I want everybody to come along with me,\u201d Aragon said.\n\nAragon subscribes to a management theory that embraces a four-phase system of getting to know his staff, assessing the needs of the department and presenting them to the mayor, implementing these changes and refining them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reasonable; it\u2019s methodical. You don\u2019t want to fly by the seat of your pants in any way. You want to make sure that you\u2019ve got a system,\u201d Aragon said.\n\nAragon is almost done talking to all 53 of his staff members and finds many of them are \u201cchomping at the bit to do things.\u201d He\u2019s \u201cvery impressed\u201d with what he sees and is encouraged by the interest some of his officers have shown in the community-based policing program he plans to implement. This type of policing goes beyond the ways police departments have traditionally dealt with crime, Aragon said.\n\n\u201cA lot of departments, still to this day, are doing what we call \u2018reactive policing.\u2019 I call it \u2018call the police, send a car, make an arrest, call the police, send a car, make an arrest.\u2019 You\u2019re not fixing the root cause. We need to go back to the thinking of preventing a crime from occurring in the first place,\u201d Aragon said.\n\nAragon said he\u2019s already identified the \u201cmovers and the shakers\u201d in his department who will start this new outreach program.\n\n\u201cCommunity-based policing it\u2019s not just serving food and having midnight basketball games. It\u2019s \u2018What are the problems?\u2019 Lets get out of the car and work on them, and let\u2019s get the community to know we\u2019re actually there trying to solve them, and then telling them what we did,\u201d Aragon said.\n\nThough officers can\u2019t walk a beat because the area is too large, Aragon plans to assign them to work defined areas and get to really know the community members. This will include officers visiting residents in their homes to discuss their needs and issues. He plans to start the program in South Fairbanks, an area he is \u201creally concerned\u201d about.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t been here three days and I realized where there is attention needed,\u201d Aragon said. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta start somewhere.\u201d\n\nAragon already has reached out to South Fairbanks community leaders and is encouraged by their response.\n\n\u201cThe ones I\u2019ve talked to in that area are really happy that we\u2019re considering them,\u201d Aragon said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, http://www.newsminer.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Randall Aragon's career in law enforcement has spanned 36 years and taken him all over the United States.
