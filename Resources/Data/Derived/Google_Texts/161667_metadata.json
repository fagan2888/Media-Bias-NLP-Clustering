Instead, Republicans will attempt to keep the focus on their demands for stricter security measures intended to slow the resettlement of refugees following the attacks in Paris last month.\n\nThe president has threatened to veto a bill passed last month in the House that would dramatically increase the barriers to entry for Syrian refugees \u2013 an effort supporters say is meant to ensure Islamic State group fighters don't infiltrate themselves into the refugee population in an attempt to sneak into the U.S.\n\nBut thanks to the support of a number of Democrats, who voted with Republicans to put the measure near a veto-proof majority, the refugee legislation can end up included in the omnibus spending bill, so long as spats over Obamacare and Planned Parenthood don't stymie negotiations.\n\n[READ: Highway Deal Includes Ex-Im Reauthorization]\n\nThat led Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to call for a separate consideration of those issues as part of a budget reconciliation bill.\n\n\"The Republican leader has an obsession with the Affordable Care Act,\" Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Tuesday. \"I'm sure he's going to come and talk about what a great victory it was on this reconciliation.\"\n\n\"It will pass and go to the president, and he'll veto it in about 10 seconds,\" he said. \"And, of course, the veto will certainly be sustained.\"\n\nMcConnell, R-Ky., presented a revised plan to his conference at a meeting Monday night that would phase out Medicaid expansion over two years, eliminate the subsidies that help low-income consumers pay for insurance premiums, and roll back a medical device tax and the so-called \"Cadillac tax\" on high-cost plans.\n\nThe measure, which would require 51 votes to pass, would also defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"This week we finally have a chance to vote to end Obamacare's cycle of broken promises and failures with just 51 votes,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"In other words, the president can't be shielded from the weighty decision he'll finally have to make when this measure lands on his desk.\"\n\n\"He may well decide to stick to his rhetoric that the law is working better than even he intended and veto the bill,\" McConnell said of Obama. \"But he should instead decide to finally stand with the middle class that suffered enough from this failed law. It's a choice the president has never faced before.\"\n\nWhile the exact language of the reconciliation has yet to be finalized, it's an attempt to grant Republicans a chance to vote in favor of two items popular among their constituents \u2013 Obamacare repeal and defunding Planned Parenthood \u2013 while also easing the election-year concerns of moderates, including those who come from the 30 states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Senate GOP leaders at Monday's meeting assured members the two-year drawdown would allow the next president to put a replacement plan in place so the newly insured did not lose their coverage.\n\nA previous version of the bill, which passed the House in October, was derailed when the Senate parliamentarian determined some of the measure's components were ineligible to be considered under the rules of reconciliation. The reconciliation process allows the Senate to bypass cloture requirements that essentially force every measure to collect 60 votes to close debate or face the possibility of a bill-killing filibuster. The process is limited to laws that deal with spending or the budget.\n\nThe previous House measure had been criticized by conservatives for not going far enough in repealing the Affordable Care Act. Several Republican senators, including presidential candidates Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky, plus Mike Lee of Utah, had threatened to vote against it. Their opposition would have been enough to sink the bill, but they have warmed to the new version.\n\n\"I'm very encouraged,\" Lee said, after Monday's meeting.\n\n[ALSO: Senator Slams Spending on Silent Shakespeare, 'Federal Match.com']\n\nConsideration was expected to begin as early as Tuesday afternoon, and a vote could take place as soon as Thursday. The House would then need to consider the Senate's version of the bill to send it to the president's desk.\n\nIt's unclear if conservatives will be satisfied with the procedural sleight of hand. House GOP leaders have repeatedly refused to rule out riders on the omnibus spending bill, including a version of refugee legislation that passed the House last month or a measure defunding Planned Parenthood, that would also draw a presidential veto.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., declined to speculate on potential riders, downplaying the likelihood of a government shutdown in a conversation with reporters Monday.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Affordable Care Act", "title": "GOP Feint on Obamacare Provides Path for Refugee Measure", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Republican leaders hope tackling contentious issues now will get Democrats on board to restrict Syrian refugees.", "title": "GOP Feint on Obamacare Provides Path for Refugee Measure", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/12/01/gop-feint-on-obamacare-provides-path-for-refugee-measure", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/df/bd/b062fbbf4445aec281bdb11155ef/151201-mitch-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Republican leaders hope tackling contentious issues now will get Democrats on board to restrict Syrian refugees.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP Feint on Obamacare Provides Path for Refugee Measure"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 1, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Gabrielle Levy,Congress,Republican Party,Pulse,picks,Planned Parenthood,Affordable Care Act", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Republican leaders hope tackling contentious issues now will get Democrats on board to restrict Syrian refugees."}, "article_summary": "The previous House measure had been criticized by conservatives for not going far enough in repealing the Affordable Care Act.\nThe measure, which would require 51 votes to pass, would also defund Planned Parenthood.\nHouse GOP leaders have repeatedly refused to rule out riders on the omnibus spending bill, including a version of refugee legislation that passed the House last month or a measure defunding Planned Parenthood, that would also draw a presidential veto.\n\"It will pass and go to the president, and he'll veto it in about 10 seconds,\" he said.\nBut thanks to the support of a number of Democrats, who voted with Republicans to put the measure near a veto-proof majority, the refugee legislation can end up included in the omnibus spending bill, so long as spats over Obamacare and Planned Parenthood don't stymie negotiations."}
