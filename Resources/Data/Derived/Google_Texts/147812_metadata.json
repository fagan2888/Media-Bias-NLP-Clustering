Burwell is ongoing, the most recent hearing on December 8, 2014 at the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThey are represented by The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a non-profit, public-interest legal team with a strong record of winning religious liberty cases \u2014 including on behalf of Hobby Lobby Stores, in a similar challenge to the Obamacare abortion-drugs mandate.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision in June 2014 applied to family-owned businesses, Little Sisters of the Poor are protesting the Obamacare mandate as a religious non-profit group.\n\nAttorneys for Little Sisters of the Poor expect the case to be decided in their favor. Their case captured the nation\u2019s attention a year ago when, surprising many court observers, Justice Sonia Sotomayor (appointed to the court by President Obama) granted the nuns\u2019 emergency appeal to sidestep the Obamacare mandate until an appeals court ruled on the case.\n\nA few weeks later and over 1,200 miles away in New Orleans, the latest challenge to Texas\u2019 pro-life law was heard at the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nGenevieve Wood, senior contributor to The Daily Signal, describes the health policy issues at stake in this case Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Lakey:\n\nA provision in a Texas law passed in 2013 states \u201cminimum standards for an abortion facility must be equivalent to the minimum standards adopted for ambulatory surgical centers.\u201d Abortion rights supporters say it\u2019s not necessary for abortion clinics to have the same standards as other medical clinics. [Yet] because abortion clinics have not been more regulated, there is a growing list of clinics around the country now coming under investigation and scrutiny for failing health inspections and harming women.\n\nIn one of the most-spirited debates ever aired on PBS, Wood discusses the Texas law with pro-choice panelists in a recent segment from \u201cOn the Contrary\u201d:\n\nClearly the issue of life is being openly deliberated in the public square. Yet little has been said of the most recent hearings affecting pre-born lives; this is perhaps due to the cases\u2019 complexity as well as, for pro-life advocates, the busy lead-up to the March for Life.\n\nOn January 13, three judges at the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis heard two cases back-to-back \u2014 each with similar arguments presented to defend state laws banning abortions based on when a baby\u2019s heartbeat can be detected (read: Heartbeat Laws).\n\nEdwards v. Beck challenges Arkansas\u2019 Human Heartbeat Protection Act, passed in March 2013 by a 56-33 vote in the Arkansas House of Representatives. This overwhelming majority vote enacted the law, despite Governor Mike Beebe (D) vetoing the original bill.\n\nIn November 2014, Arkansas voters replaced him with Governor Asa Hutchinson (R) who ran on a platform supporting the state\u2019s Heartbeat Law and other pro-life policies. The state\u2019s new Attorney General Leslie Rutledge stated during her campaign: \u201cI will fight hard to support pro-life initiatives,\u201d noting the pending appeals court case.\n\nIn the same month as Arkansas\u2019 life-or-death drama played out, North Dakota passed a similar Heartbeat Law; abortion providers moved swiftly and filed a similar lawsuit. MKB Management Corp. v Stenehjem challenges North Dakota\u2019s HB 1456 enacted as law, which \u201cmakes it a criminal offense to perform an abortion if a heartbeat has been detected.\u201d\n\nThe winding road of legislation and lawsuits finally lead to a courtroom in St. Louis, where the two sides faced off in front of a three-judge panel on January 13.\n\nPresent in court during the hearings, pro-family legal advocate Allan Parker was struck by both states\u2019 closing arguments in the two cases. \u201cUsually in court you close with your strongest argument. It is telling that we heard the defense close noting the harms of abortion to women and the availability of Safe Haven laws, which is a totally new argument.\u201d\n\nAlso called \u201cBaby Moses\u201d laws, Texas enacted the first Safe Haven law in 1999 to give parents in crisis a way to safely give up an infant they could not raise.\n\n\u201cThe defense rested on the fact that Safe Haven laws provide a better alternative for women than abortion does,\u201d he says. \u201cWomen can turn their babies over to the state, no questions asked, and be free of the burden of childcare \u2014 obviously, without having to terminate the child.\u201d\n\nHe notes with enthusiasm that Safe Haven laws now exist in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, adding, \u201cThis is the first time that argument has been made in any court in America. It\u2019s a new question, and the appeals court is free to make its own decision; it\u2019s a case of first impression to use the legal term.\u201d\n\nWhile Parker radiates optimism on the case, the petitioners do as well. \u201cWe feel that these cases are rock solid in our favor, that they make the rules very clear: The state can\u2019t ban abortion prior to viability,\u201d said Janet Crepps in an interview with Courthouse News Service. Crepps serves as senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the case on behalf of a North Dakota abortion center.\n\nAlso present in the courtroom was Myra Myers, who lost a child to abortion and now tells her story through Operation Outcry. She offered a different perspective, saying, \u201cI am so grateful that both these states have presented a strong defense to protect the lives of unborn children.\u201d\n\nMyers pointed to the \u201cstartling\u201d testimony of one abortion center owner. \u201cNobody gets pregnant to have an abortion,\u201d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder of Whole Woman\u2019s Health which provides abortions in four states. Her admission was presented to the court in a legal brief.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s right: nobody even thinks about abortion until they\u2019re pregnant and scared,\u201d says Myers. \u201cOnce you\u2019re inside a clinic, the abortion industry says there is only one option. I didn\u2019t know a \u2018safe haven\u2019 was possible when I lost my baby to abortion; none of these mothers are informed about it.\u201d\n\nOutside the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, Melissa Jacobs lead a team of ten women and men who prayed on the court\u2019s steps as lawyers made their case inside. \u201cWe have been covering these cases and this court in prayer for over 18 months,\u201d she said following their silent prayer gathering. \u201cToday, I have a peace we\u2019ve been faithful in this assignment the Lord has given us.\u201d\n\nTemperatures dipped to 10 degrees, yet the team stood in prayer for over an hour. Co-leader of Bound4LIFE St. Louis with her husband, Jacobs remained confident that the prayers outside mattered as much as the arguments inside.\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\n\u201cGod hears us when we pray,\u201d she said. \u201cThe judges\u2019 decisions won\u2019t be released for some time, so we can\u2019t stop persisting in prayer. We believe America could change in a heartbeat through these cases.\u201d\n\nDecisions by federal judges in all four cases are expected in a matter of months, with the fate of life-saving state policies on the line.\n\nAfter 10 years in communications/marketing at The Heritage Foundation and Focus on the Family, Josh M.
