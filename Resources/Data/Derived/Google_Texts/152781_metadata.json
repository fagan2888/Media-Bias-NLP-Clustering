Health plans the president called \u201csubstandard\" because they didn\u2019t meet these minimum requirements are OK for another two years.\n\nGone are over half the deadlines in the law.\n\nMost amazing, gone is the \u201cshared responsibility\u201d tax on people who fail to get covered, which Obama lawyers told the Supreme Court in 2010 was the law\u2019s linchpin.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to get covered by March 31, 2014 or pay a \u201cshared responsibility\u201d tax.\n\nIt\u2019s not a mere $95, as widely thought. A household with $75,000 in income and 3 kids could be socked with a $1,750 tax for 2014.\n\nYet only 10% of uninsured Americans who qualify for ObamaCare exchange plans are signing up, according to McKinsey & Company. Even with subsidies to soften sticker shock, 90% of the people these plans were intended to help are saying \u201cno thanks.\u201d\n\nLast week, the House of Representatives voted 250 to 160 to postpone the \u201cshared responsibility\u201d tax for a year. Twenty-seven Democrats supported the measure. But President Obama vowed to veto it, so it will go nowhere.\n\nInstead, Obama is making changes his way -- illegally \u2013 by fiat. That is his M.O. He calls it \u201ctransition relief.\u201d\n\nSome transition! These changes extend for a full two years.\n\nHe also announced last week that people whose plans were cancelled because they didn\u2019t conform to ObamaCare may renew those plans through October, 2016.\n\nFew people will, because state insurance commissioners and insurance companies have the final say, and most are saying \"no.\" But the president was trying to shift the blame.\n\nAt the same time, the administration came out with a new set of loose rules exempting anyone with cancelled plans from having to get coverage at all.\n\nThis exemption will inevitably be available to the uninsured as well. After all, exempting the once insured while slapping a hefty tax on the uninsured would have a political shelf life of about fifteen minutes. The end result of all this is: good bye mandate.\n\nThe core of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 the requirement for minimal essential coverage backed up by the \u201cshared responsibility\u201d tax -- is now gone, even as the president doubles down on defending his law and pretending it will work some day.\n\nLast November, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz boasted that Democrats would be running on ObamaCare. Now many are running away from it.\n\n\n\nThe break in party ranks suggests some Democrats might soon be ready to support a congressional fix to stop the news reports of workers\u2019 hours being cut, patients losing their doctors, and money dumped into nonfunctioning websites.\n\nThe president\u2019s budget calls for $600 million to improve ObamaCare\u2019s website technology -- throwing good money after bad.\n\nThe outlines of a two-year compromise to carry the nation through the presidential election are obvious:\n\n- Keep popular provisions like allowing children on parents\u2019 plans until age 26.\n\n- Keep the Medicaid expansion to help the needy.\n\n- Suspend the dysfunctional exchanges.\n\n- Repeal the employer mandate to save the 40 hour work week.\n\n- And repeal the tax on the uninsured.\n\nThat\u2019s more sensible than watching President Obama lawlessly run ObamaCare into the ground.\n\nBetsy McCaughey, Ph.D. is chairman of Reduce Infection Deaths and a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.
