The mother of a 3-year-old girl and her boyfriend face felony charges of criminal negligence resulting in death after the girl died Saturday night when fire ravaged a Greeley mobile home.

Lileigh Kellenaers was fatally injured. Kristen Braig, 27, and Dustin Blanchard, 34, also were injured.

Greeley police and fire personnel investigated and determined that Braig and Blanchard had left the girl home alone for an unknown amount of time during which the fire started at about 11:50 p.m. The couple returned home to find the mobile home at 711 26th Ave., No. 9, on fire, according to a City of Greeley news release. A cause of the blaze has not been released.

Firefighters arrived at the scene to find Greeley police administering first aid to occupants outside the burning home. Ambulances arrived and transported the victims.

All three were taken to North Colorado Medical Center, where Lileigh Kellenaers was pronounced dead.

With temperatures hovering near a frigid zero degrees, a second alarm was called, which brought additional firefighters and equipment to the scene, said Greeley Fire Department Division Chief Dale Lyman.

A total of 27 firefighters were involved in the response.

They brought the fire under control within 30 minutes.

Some nearby homes sustained fire and heat damage.
