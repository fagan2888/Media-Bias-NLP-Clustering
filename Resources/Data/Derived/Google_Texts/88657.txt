Owners of a Panhandle zoo are facing charges after being accused of not properly caring for the animals.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture says the Gulf Breeze Zoo, owned by Eric Mogensen and his daughter Meghan, was not supervised properly when a child was bitten by a camel.

They also say rabbits weren't separated so their babies were eaten or injured and the tiger's enclosure did not have proper ventilation.

The charges also allege the zoo did not use proper veterinary care and relied on expired medicine and even shot an animal as a means of euthanasia.

The Mogensens are charged with multiple violations of the Animal Welfare Act and are also facing charges for two other facilities they own in Virginia.
