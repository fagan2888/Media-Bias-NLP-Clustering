He throws the ball well and has some receivers that can make plays for him as well.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday in Boulder (2 p.m., Pac-12 Network), Colorado is hoping for a much better defensive performance against Mannion. He led the Beavers last season to a 44-17 win over the Buffs in Corvallis with six touchdown passes.In that game, Mannion completed 27-of-52 passes for 414 yards with one interception against Colorado.\n\n\u201cWe had alignment problems last year in that game,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd you have to execute.\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sean Mannion, Oregon State\u2019s \u201cpro-style offense\u201d unsettle CU Buffs", "title": "Sean Mannion, Oregon State\u2019s \u201cpro-style offense\u201d unsettle CU Buffs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/29/sean-mannion-oregon-states-pro-style-offense-unsettle-cu-buffs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140929__sean-mannion-oregon-state-092914p1.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140929__sean-mannion-oregon-state-092914p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-29T13:26:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:29:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd13bb\"", "article_summary": "Following Colorado\u2019s Monday practice, Buffs defensive backs coach Charles Clark was asked what makes Mannion (6-foot-5, 220 pounds) so effective.\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the shotgun at times, he\u2019s under center at times.\n\u201cHe has a big arm, he can throw the deep ball,\u201d Clark said of Mannion.\n\u201cWe had alignment problems last year in that game,\u201d Clark said.\nBOULDER \u2014 Oregon State senior quarterback Sean Mannion is considered a future NFL player and is on track to become the Pac-12\u2019s all-time leader in passing yards."}
