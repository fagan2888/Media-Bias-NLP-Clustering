And he said Americans should be concerned about are the larger structural problems of the program.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a hole that is getting deeper,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI mean, the website was the easy thing to do. And they messed that up. The people who are losing \u2014 are getting their insurance cancellation that was a necessity of the law. It\u2019s sort of offensive because they think they have a good insurance plan. The government regulators are saying, \u2018Sorry, not good enough.\u2019 Some of them are going to suffer. Some will benefit. But these are the foothills to what will be a whole set of bigger problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of the problems with the enrollment right now, that increases the likelihood we will have the death spiral, where only sick people sign up, the healthy don\u2019t sign up, and that \u2014 you just can\u2019t run a system like that,\u201d he continued. \u201cThen there are further problems, complexities down the road of the \u2014 how the subsidy mechanism works. That\u2019s a very complicated mechanism. Basically, you\u2019re reorganizing [17] percent of the U.S. economy, and you\u2019re handing a lot of \u2026 people who can\u2019t run a website, and so there\u2019s bound to be unintended consequences.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "Columnist warns only sick people signing up and not getting healthy people to sign up will make system unsustainable", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "On Friday\u2019s \u201cNewsHour\u201d on PBS, New York Times columnist David Brooks warned that Obamacare is headed for much larger problems, beyond the current obvious problems of the dysfunction of its websi", "title": "David Brooks: Obamacare headed toward a \u2018death spiral\u2019", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/02/david-brooks-obamacare-headed-toward-a-death-spiral/", "image": {"width": 633, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brooks112-e1383371340708.jpg", "height": 272}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Columnist warns only sick people signing up and not getting healthy people to sign up will make system unsustainable", "title": "David Brooks: Obamacare headed toward a \u2018death spiral\u2019 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/02/david-brooks-obamacare-headed-toward-a-death-spiral/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brooks112-e1383371340708.jpg"}, "creator": "@jeff_poor", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-02 10:11:33", "sailthru.title": "David Brooks: Obamacare headed toward a 'death spiral'", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "david-brooks,obamacare,jeff-poor", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "david brooks,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "On Friday\u2019s \u201cNewsHour\u201d on PBS, New York Times columnist David Brooks warned that Obamacare is headed for much larger problems, beyond the current obvious problems of the dysfunction of its websi", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Brooks112-e1383371340708.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbb8\"", "article_summary": "3943301On Friday\u2019s \u201cNewsHour\u201d on PBS, New York Times columnist David Brooks warned that Obamacare is headed for much larger problems, beyond the current obvious problems of the dysfunction of its website.\nIn his weekly appearance on the PBS program with syndicated columnist Mark Shields, Brooks called the website the easy part of the 2009 health care reform law.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a hole that is getting deeper,\u201d Brooks said.\nAnd he said Americans should be concerned about are the larger structural problems of the program.\n\u201cThen there are further problems, complexities down the road of the \u2014 how the subsidy mechanism works."}
