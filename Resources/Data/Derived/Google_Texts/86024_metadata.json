The study tracked youth consumption of the beverages from 2005 to 2012.\n\nBoth trends \u2013 the surge in teens guzzling sugary drinks and the drop in consumption for younger children \u2013 are tied to regulations governing the sale of the beverages in California schools, said Harold Goldstein, executive director of the California Center for Public Health Advocacy.\n\n\u201cTaking sodas out of schools contributed to a precipitous drop in consumption among younger kids,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile older kids have switched to sports drinks and energy drinks, and those products are available in schools.\u201d\n\nIn California, soda sales have been banned in elementary and middle schools since 2006 and in high schools since 2009, but a loophole in the state education code allows the sale of electrolyte replacement beverages, otherwise known as sports drinks, in high school cafeterias, vending machines, snack bars and other on-campus venues. That loophole will close on July 1, 2014, when new regulations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture take effect to ban the sale on school campuses of sugary sports and energy drinks that have more than 40 calories in 8 ounces or 60 calories in 12 ounces.\n\n\u201cThat means your typical 20-ounce Gatorade won\u2019t be in schools,\u201d said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit organization.\n\nSome 65 percent of adolescents drink at least one sugary sports drink or soda a day, an 8 percent jump since an earlier survey tracking consumption habits, researchers said.\n\nSodas, sport drinks should be \u201ctreats,\u201d advocates say\n\nGiven the close association between daily sugary beverage consumption and obesity, the rise is cause for alarm for schools that are working to address the effects of obesity on student attendance, self-esteem and health.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has made real progress in reducing the consumption of sugary beverages among young children,\u201d said Susan Babey, the report\u2019s lead author. \u201cBut teens are in trouble.\u201d\n\nShe said sodas and sports drinks should be regarded as occasional \u201ctreats,\u201d not part of a daily meal plan.\n\nThe study\u2019s most encouraging finding was that young children are consuming markedly fewer sugary beverages. About 19 percent of 2- to 5-year-olds drink a sugary beverage every day, the study said, a 30 percent decline since the earlier survey. Among 6- to 11-year-olds, 32 percent are daily consumers, down 26 percent since 2005-2007.\n\nThe study was based on data collected in the California Health Interview Survey, the nation\u2019s largest state health survey. Researchers completed interviews with more than 40,000 households.\n\nSnapshot from one \u201copen campus\u201d high school\n\nStill, banning the beverages from schools won\u2019t stop teenagers from finding the drinks. Some 75 percent of high school campuses in California are \u201cclosed\u201d and don\u2019t allow students to leave the grounds without supervision during the school day. \u201cIt\u2019s the 25 percent we need to worry about it,\u201d said Wootan at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\nAt Oakland Technical High School \u2013 which has an open campus policy allowing students to leave during lunch \u2013 many students sitting on the front lawn at lunchtime Thursday drank from water bottles, while other students returned from local stores with pizza and sugared beverages, including Arizona iced tea, Shasta Cola and a 7-11 Slurpee.\n\nMany were well aware of the amount of sugar they were consuming, but didn\u2019t feel it was a serious problem. One student said bottled water was more expensive than his canned iced tea.\n\n\u201cI buy it because it tastes good,\u201d said Will, a freshman carrying a can of Shasta Cola.\n\nHis friend, Ethan, had a 23.5-ounce can of Arizona Green Tea containing 51 grams of sugar. \u201cThis has a lot of sugar, but it\u2019s better than soda,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cIt\u2019s Arizona and it\u2019s green tea.\u201d\n\nPublic perception may hold that iced teas and fruit drinks are a better choice than sodas, yet high concentrations of sugar in the beverages make them something to consume in moderation, experts said.\n\nThe counties with the largest declines in percentage of youth drinking soda or other sugary beverages every day included Ventura County, with a 37 percent decrease since 2005; Yuba County, with a 32 percent decrease; and Napa County, with a 31 percent decrease.\n\nCounties with the largest increase in daily sugary drink consumption among youth of all ages were Lake County, with a 36 percent increase; Monterey County, with a 29 percent increase; and Solano County, with a 24 percent increase.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the clock ticks toward a 2014 federal ban on the sale of sports drinks at high schools, California teenagers are showing an increasing fondness for the", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"California Teens Slurping More Sugary Drinks \",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2013\\/10\\/18\\/california-teens-slurping-more-sugary-drinks-soda-sugar-sweetened-beverages\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-18 11:51:52\",\"mod_date\":\"2013-10-21 17:08:08\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":15783,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Children's Health\",\"Science\",\"Sugar-Sweetend Beverages\"],\"categories\":[\"KQED blogs\",\"Living Healthy\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/10\\/oak-tech-ice-tea.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "As the clock ticks toward a 2014 federal ban on the sale of sports drinks at high schools, California teenagers are showing an increasing fondness for the sugary beverages, with an alarming 23 percent spike in the consumption of sports and energy drinks since 2005, according to a new study.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, consumption of sugary drinks by young children is declining sharply, according to the study by researchers at the California Center for Public Health Advocacy and the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.
