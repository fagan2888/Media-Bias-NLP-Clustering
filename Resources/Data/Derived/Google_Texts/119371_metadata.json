Those steps may include completing Form 8962 for claiming the Premium Tax Credit assistance. Or you may need to complete a different form to claim an exemption.\n\nIf you are not exempt and chose not to buy health coverage, you will have to pay an extra tax or fee.\n\nThose who are claimed as a dependent by someone else for healthcare purposes needn\u2019t do any of the above.\n\nHow to Report Health Insurance on Tax Return\n\nMost small business owners file their tax returns using Form 1040, Form 1040A or Form 1040EZ. Depending on which form you use, you will be asked to fill out some information on a certain line.\n\nOn Form 1040, the healthcare checkbox can be found on Line 61.\n\nOn Form 1040A, the healthcare checkbox can be found on Line 38.\n\nAnd on Form 1040EZ, filers should direct their attention to Line 11.\n\nHow To Tell if You\u2019re Exempt from the Healthcare Requirement\n\nHealthcare.gov has a laundry list of exemptions, including low income, being a member of a Native American tribe or being incarcerated.\n\nDepending on the exemption you may be able to claim it on your federal tax return. Form 8965 is the IRS form for claiming a healthcare exemption.\n\nIn other cases, you may have to apply separately via a different form, to claim the exemption.\n\nClaiming an exemption is rather complex. The departments of Health and Human Services and Treasury will be rolling out tools for taxpayers ahead of this year\u2019s filing deadline, April 15.\n\nAccording to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell:\n\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, HHS will work with other agencies, tax preparers and community organizations to arm these consumers with the information they need to know as they prepare to file their taxes. We will also be providing helpful tools so that the millions of taxpayers who qualify for an exemption can receive one.\u201d\n\nThe government also says that it will \u201creach out\u201d via emails, phone, and text messages \u201cto people who got coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace with personalized information that is most relevant to their tax status.\u201d\n\nMinimum Essential Coverage\n\nYou are required to have what the government defines as \u201cminimum essential coverage.\u201d\n\nBut the IRS goes on to point out that most health care coverage that people have meets the minimum essential coverage requirement.\n\nMinimum essential coverage includes:\n\nHealth care coverage provided by your employer,\n\nHealth insurance coverage you buy through the Health Insurance Marketplace,\n\nMany types of government-sponsored health coverage including Medicare, most Medicaid coverage, and most health care coverage provided to veterans and active duty service members, or\n\nCertain types of individual policies you buy directly from an insurance company.\n\nThe instructions for Form 8965 have more information on what qualifies as minimum essential coverage.\n\nPremium Tax Credit for Healthcare\n\nIf you, your spouse, or a dependent enrolled in health insurance through the Marketplace, you may be able to claim a special tax credit called the Premium Tax Credit.\n\nInstructions for qualifying for and claiming the Credit are contained on Form 8962. (As of this writing, Form 8962 is still a draft and not finalized.)\n\nAdditional Information\n\nIn the meantime, HHS and the IRS have already made several resources available. They include guides for people who may not be eligible to check that one box on their tax form, or who may have to file additional forms.\n\nFor more information, see the Affordable Care Act tax provisions on the IRS website.
