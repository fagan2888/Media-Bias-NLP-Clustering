Rick Perry made a somewhat startling claim about the high number of uninsured Texans.\n\n\u201cPeople criticize us for having a large number of uninsured,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Texans decided they wanted. They did not want government forcing everyone to buy insurance.\u201d\n\nHe was defending Texas\u2019 refusal, under his leadership, to create an insurance marketplace or expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.\n\nToday, Texas Democrats hit back.\n\n\u201cRick Perry should be ashamed of himself for saying that the people of Texas did not want increased coverage and expanded access to healthcare. More than one million hardworking Texans are living without affordable care because of his failure to partner with the Legislature to find a Texas solution to closing the coverage gap,\u201d state Democratic Party spokesman Javier Gamboa said. \u201cThis lame excuse won\u2019t work for him in Texas, New Hampshire or the rest of the nation as he runs for president.\n\n\u201cPerry owes the hard working people of Texas \u2014 especially those who would be covered under Medicaid expansion, and are forced to go without coverage \u2014 an apology for his lack of leadership as governor of Texas,\u201d Gamboa asserted.\n\nWhen Perry made the comment, the hand-picked guests were unfazed.\n\nShawn Walsh, 49, CEO of a computer consulting firm, had prompted Perry\u2019s comment by complaining about rising costs of insurance for his business and its employees. And afterward, he said he liked Perry\u2019s answer.\n\n\u201cHe hit it right on the head,\u201d Walsh said.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wMi9kZW1zLWhpdC1wZXJyeS1jbGFpbS10aGF0LXRleGFucy13YW50LXRvLWhhdmUtdW5pbnN1cmVkLXRleGFucy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
