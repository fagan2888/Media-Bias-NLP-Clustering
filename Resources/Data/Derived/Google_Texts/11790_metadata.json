Its detractors claim the curriculum simply encourages sexual activity among minors.\n\nThe Charleston County School District currently offers five board-approved abstinence-based sex education curricula. Making Proud Choices! also emphasizes abstinence in addition to effective condom and contraceptive use.\n\nThe curriculum consists of eight modules. The first focuses on students\u2019 goals and dreams, and how risky sexual activity can interrupt future plans. In the following lessons, students learn the consequences and causes of unintended pregnancies, STDs and HIV infection. Through various role-play activities and other exercises, they practice refusing unsafe sexual behavior and openly discussing their feelings if they\u2019re being sexually pressured.\n\nMost teachers rely on the human sexuality supplement to the state-approved health textbook to teach sex education, said Christine Beyer, an associate at the S.C. Department of Education. However, state law also allows school districts to use other curricula and appoint a community-run health advisory committee to help choose those materials. The 13-member committee, made up of students, teachers, clergy and medical professionals, is tasked with reviewing the curricula and making recommendations to the district school board.\n\nUnder state law, the curriculum must emphasize abstinence until marriage, and for high school students, explain various methods of contraception. Schools are expressly forbidden from distributing condoms and contraceptives, and teachers are barred from mentioning \u201calternate sexual lifestyles\u201d except in the context of STDs. Health instructors can choose which curriculum they use and parents have the right to exempt their children from any sex education class.\n\n\u2018We were rushing\u2019\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time school board members have ignored recommendations from the district\u2019s health advisory committee.\n\nFive years ago, the board agreed to allow schools to teach abstinence-only curriculum from Heritage Community Services, despite the health advisory committee\u2019s 9-1 recommendation against it. In October 2013, the health advisory committee voted to recommend adding Making Proud Choices! to the districts\u2019s list of approved sex-education curricula, but the Strategic Education Committee tabled it.\n\n\u201cThe school board will oftentimes take the recommendations of their committee and just kind of run it through,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little unusual the board would not approve what they recommend.\u201d\n\nThis past May, the health advisory committee again voted to recommend Making Proud Choices! for use in grades 8 through 12 in Charleston County Schools. This time, the vote was unanimous. Members of the health advisory committee and representatives of Medical University of South Carolina\u2019s EMPOWERR, a drug and HIV prevention program for minority teenagers, introduced Making Proud Choices! to board members at a Strategic Education Committee in July.\n\nThe meeting drew several opponents of the curriculum, many wearing \u201cVote \u2018No\u2019 to MPC\u201d stickers on their shirts. The three-member Strategic Education Committee, which includes Chris Collins, Chris Staubes and Darby, moved to address the curriculum at a later meeting once they had more time to review the materials.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure we\u2019re presenting the best options for our students and our parents and our teachers, and I feel like we were rushing this a little bit,\u201d Darby said. \u201cWe need to step back a little bit and let the superintendent share her vision and move forward.\u201d\n\nA CCSD spokesman noted the superintendent doesn\u2019t have the authority to approve or make changes to the district\u2019s sex education curriculum, but he said Postlewait wants to ensure parents have a say in what their children are taught.\n\n\u201cThey agreed they want parents to be able to exercise options when it comes to the delivery of the state\u2019s mandated sex ed. curriculum,\u201d said Daniel Head, director of CCSD\u2019s Office of Strategy and Communications. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sensitive topic for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nA \u2018very effective\u2019 curriculum\n\nSeveral S.C. school districts have approved Making Proud Choices! in the past, including Anderson School District 3, Richland County School District 1, and Spartanburg School District 3, according to a 2013 report by the Columbia-based New Morning Foundation.\n\n\u201cIf you look into the literature about Making Proud Choices!, it is very effective,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cBut it is intended for a certain group of young adults.\u201d\n\nMaking Proud Choices!, developed by renowned public health researchers Loretta Sweet Jemmott and her husband, John B. Jemmott III, was originally designed for vulnerable, minority adolescents in community-based settings, rather than for a general school audience.\n\nTo ensure the curriculum complied with state law, April Borkman, the program coordinator for EMPOWERR, voluntarily worked with the district\u2019s health advisory committee to modify the Making Proud Choices! manual. Her revisions strengthened its pro-abstinence message and excised or replaced passages critics of the program found objectionable. Through her work at EMPOWERR, Borkman has used Making Proud Choices! to teach sex education to high-risk teens for the past 10 years.\n\n\u201cHIV, STDs and teen pregnancy are all a real problem here,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming to us and they don\u2019t know the basic information they need to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nStatistics show South Carolina\u2019s teenage pregnancy and STD rates consistently rank among the highest in the nation. Nearly 20 percent of S.C. middle school students and more than half of S.C. high school students reported having sexual intercourse, according to a 2011 statewide Youth Risk Behavior Survey. And condom use has declined significantly among the state\u2019s high school students \u2013 from 67 percent in 2005 to 58 percent in 2011.\n\nBased on these numbers, it\u2019s clear abstinence-only sex education doesn\u2019t work, Borkman said.\n\n\u201cI want to see our teens succeed and do well. I want to see us producing citizens who are going to go on and do wonderful, great things: get an education, open businesses, become doctors, become lawyers, become public health advocates for others,\u201d Borkman said. \u201cIf they\u2019re protecting themselves now... then they can reach their goals and dreams.\u201d\n\nReach Deanna Pan at 937-5764.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Controversial sex education curriculum tabled again, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsEducation, \r\nMetro, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, Charleston County School Board,Making Proud Choices!,Sex education", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Facing pressure from multiple directions, the Charleston County school board isn\u2019t ready to approve a new comprehensive sexual education curriculum that teaches both abstinence and effective contraceptive use.", "title": "Controversial sex education curriculum tabled again", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150801/150809916/controversial-sex-education-curriculum-tabled-again", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC16/150809916/AR/0/AR-150809916.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC16/150809916/AR/0/AR-150809916.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Facing pressure from multiple directions, the Charleston County school board isn\u2019t ready to approve a new comprehensive sexual education curriculum that teaches both abstinence and effective contraceptive use.", "title": "Controversial sex education curriculum tabled again", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC16/150809916/AR/0/AR-150809916.jpg?201508012249", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150809916}}, "keywords": "Controversial sex education curriculum tabled again , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsEducation, \r\nMetro, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, Charleston County School Board,Making Proud Choices!,Sex education", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-01T19:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-08-01T22:49:00Z", "author": "Deanna Pan"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Facing pressure from multiple directions, the Charleston County school board isn\u2019t ready to approve a new comprehensive sexual education curriculum that teaches both abstinence and effective contraceptive use."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d24\"", "article_summary": "Nearly 20 percent of S.C. middle school students and more than half of S.C. high school students reported having sexual intercourse, according to a 2011 statewide Youth Risk Behavior Survey.\nMaking Proud Choices!\nto the districts\u2019s list of approved sex-education curricula, but the Strategic Education Committee tabled it.\nThe 1988 Comprehensive Health Education Act requires public schools to teach sexual and reproductive health education, but in Charleston, rarely do board members, parents, educators and medical professionals agree on how it should be taught.\nFacing pressure from multiple directions, the Charleston County school board isn\u2019t ready to approve a new comprehensive sexual education curriculum that teaches both abstinence and effective contraceptive use."}
