But apparently, its primary readership is stupid people. Why else would it bother to \"debunk\" an obvious work of satire, by well-known brilliant satirists at the website iOwnTheWorld.com? (Incidentally, a daily must-read for me).\n\nHere is the image that Snopes found to be \"false\":\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is how the deep thinkers at Snopes presented the satire to their readership:\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that they omitted the credit to iOwnTheWorld.com, presumably because readers might have actually gone there and realized it is a satirical site. Thus, they betray their crass political motivations, to discredit critics of Obama's handling of the shutdown. This is flat out dishonest.\n\nUpdate. Big Fur Hat writes to me:\n\nJust for edification, the site that stripped off our credits was not\n\nSnopes.\n\nIt was a conservative website - The FreePatriot.org Frank Webb, the owner, I believe, admitted it in an e-mail, saying his \"very good editor, \" great at her job\" editor, felt that\n\nthe image needed \"cleaning up.\"\n\nAnd in that cleaning up, whoopsy, our credit disappeared.\n\nLet me save Snopes some time. This image from iOwnTheWorld.com and Conservative Treehouse is also satirical. No, Obama has not yet capped Old Faithful. It's a joke!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is next for Snopes? Perhaps they will co nsider debunking the most famous political cartoon in American history, Thomas Nast's \"Let us prey\" which portrayed New York's Boss Tweed as a raptor.\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse! Boss Tweed was not a bird.\n\nThen there is this:\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse! Newt Gingrich is not lighter than air.\n\nGood Lord, don't these people have something better to do?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2013/10/how_stupid_is_snopescom.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/legacy_assets/blog/assets/Newt-rising-cartoon.jpg", "title": "Blog: How Stupid is Snopes.com?"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Why else would it bother to \"debunk\" an obvious work of satire, by well-known brilliant satirists at the website iOwnTheWorld.com?\nSnopes.com is a website that purports to investigate the truthfulness of news reports and internet rumors.\nBut apparently, its primary readership is stupid people.\nThus, they betray their crass political motivations, to discredit critics of Obama's handling of the shutdown.\nBig Fur Hat writes to me:Just for edification, the site that stripped off our credits was notSnopes."}
