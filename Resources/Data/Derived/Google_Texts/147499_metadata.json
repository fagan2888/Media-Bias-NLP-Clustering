Germany, whose economy powered the Eurozone\u2019s tepid recovery, actually saw its economy contract last spring.\n\nRelated: U.S. Economy, Stocks Can\u2019t Escape the World\u2019s Pain\n\nJapan\u2019s economy is also contracting, dragged down by tax increases associated with a deficit reduction plan, according to Brookings. China\u2019s \u201cgrowth momentum has slowed\u201d as it undergoes financial sector and other market-oriented reforms, the researchers found.\n\nMoreover, the Brazilian and Russian economies are flat-lining, with the implication that their overall market growth is almost certain to remain weak for the rest of the year, according to the analysis.\n\n\u201cThe world economy is now being powered mostly by the U.S. growth engine, a situation that is untenable for a sustained and durable global economic recovery,\u201d wrote Eswar Prasad, Karim Foda and Arnav Sahu in the Brookings study.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew echoed many of the study\u2019s themes in a speech Tuesday morning at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.\n\nRelated: How Europe\u2019s Economic Slump Could Doom Ukraine\n\nNoting that Labor Department figures last Friday showed that employers added 248,000 jobs in September and that the unemployment rate had dropped to 5.9 percent \u2013 the lowest since July 2008 \u2013 Lew said, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen continuing signs of a strengthening U.S. economy. The whole world is looking at the U.S. economy to continue being a strong engine for growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re determined to have the U.S. economy grow strongly, the rest of the world also has to take steps to make sure that growth continues to accelerate,\u201d Lew said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in other countries that there has been a less determined response to their own economic conditions\u2026. There is a need to focus on growing short-term demand while at the same time focusing on long-term structural reforms for long-term growth.\u201d\n\nLew added, \u201cI do think there is a need for more action in quite a number of parts of the world. I don\u2019t think the United States alone can pull the global economy to where it needs to be.\u201d\n\nThere are a myriad of explanations for the current state of world economic affairs in which the U.S. and the United Kingdom are among the few positive standouts. The Brookings authors include \u201cgeopolitical uncertainties\u201d that have undermined business and consumer confidence. In addition, there are concerns that major economies continue to rely on monetary policy and manipulation of the money supply \u201cto do the heavy lifting\u201d instead of undertaking critical structural reforms.\n\nRelated: Ruble\u2019s Nosedive Shows Power of Russian Sanctions\n\n\u201cTo support more balanced growth, other economies will have to start pulling their weight, ideally by generating more domestic demand rather than relying on exports,\u201d the report stated. \u201cA revival of growth cannot be engineered just by relying on central banks, a lesson that still seems beyond the grasp of political leaders.\u201d\n\nThe report, titled \u201cA Shaky Recovery Runs out of Steam,\u201d was based on research and analysis from the October 2014 update of the Tracking Indexes for the Global Economic Recovery (TIGER) interactive map, done in collaboration with the Financial Times.\n\nIn touting the long-term economic successes of the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve, Lew said, \u201cWe took definitive steps, starting in 2008, to staunch the financial crisis, including a major stimulus. We took more steps than most of the world did. We took very decisive steps to get demand going again in this economy and we\u2019re now reaping the benefits of that.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Jack Lew Is Kidding Himself About Too Big to Fail\n\nHowever, as the Brookings study noted, the U.S. recovery is far from complete and many problems persist. For instance, the labor force participation rate remains three percentage points lower than before the crisis and part-time employment remains high. \u201cDespite strengthening domestic demand, labor market slack has kept wage and inflationary pressures under wraps,\u201d the report said.\n\nRob Garver of The Fiscal Times contributed to this report.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A grim new study of the international economic scene warns that \u2013 with the exception of the United States \u2013 the industrialized world is seeing the steam go out of the recovery.", "title": "As Global Economy Sputters, U.S. Growth Is Jeopardized", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/07/Global-Economy-Sputters-US-Growth-Jeopardized", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05062012_economy_snail_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/07/Global-Economy-Sputters-US-Growth-Jeopardized", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05062012_economy_snail_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A grim new study of the international economic scene warns that \u2013 with the exception of the United States \u2013 the industrialized world is seeing the steam go out of the recovery.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Much of Europe has hit \u201canother rough patch,\u201d the study on the global economic recovery said, with the three largest economies \u2013 Germany, France and Italy \u2013 showing no signs of growth.\nGermany, whose economy powered the Eurozone\u2019s tepid recovery, actually saw its economy contract last spring.\n\u201cThe world economy is now being powered mostly by the U.S. growth engine, a situation that is untenable for a sustained and durable global economic recovery,\u201d wrote Eswar Prasad, Karim Foda and Arnav Sahu in the Brookings study.\nRelated: U.S. Economy, Stocks Can\u2019t Escape the World\u2019s PainJapan\u2019s economy is also contracting, dragged down by tax increases associated with a deficit reduction plan, according to Brookings.\nChina\u2019s \u201cgrowth momentum has slowed\u201d as it undergoes financial sector and other market-oriented reforms, the researchers found."}
