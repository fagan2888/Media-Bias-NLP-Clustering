HONOLULU (AP) â€” A celebration of actor Jim Nabors' 85th birthday and 40th anniversary brought nearly 300 people to his Honolulu lawn.

Messages rolled in from across the country for the man who portrayed Gomer Pyle on "The Andy Griffith Show," The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported (http://bit.ly/1L61JKd). Friday marked not only his birthday but the start of his 40th year with his now-husband, Stan Cadwallader.

Lt. Gen. John A. Toolan Jr., commanding general of the United States Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, delivered congratulations from President Barack Obama.

Meanwhile, Gov. David Ige said he represented the people of Hawaii when he designated June 12 "Jim Nabors' Day."

Nabors, who also starred in the spinoff sitcom, "Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.," is known as an ardent supporter of the U.S. Marine Corps. He is one only a handful of people to earn the official status of "Honorary Marine."
