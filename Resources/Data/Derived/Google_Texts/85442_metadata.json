(WIVB) \u2013 More than 200 people packed an emergency meeting Monday night where the supervisors of Newfane, Cambria, Wilson and Somerset tried to come up with ideas of how to save Eastern Niagara Hospital in Newfane.\n\nThe operators of the facility say no decisions have been made about any closures, but residents say they have seen and heard other signs that the hospital is moving towards closure.\n\nPauline Laubacker\u2019s daughter has epileptic seizures every few months.\n\n\u201cIt could be the difference of life or death,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when she goes into these seizures, her heart rate goes between 130 and 180, which could cause either cardiac arrest or a stroke, and with this hospital right around the corner, she can get medical help as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe hospital has been in Newfane for over 50 years, but it was just about five years ago that it became an Eastern Niagara Hospital. It\u2019s the same group that operates the former Lockport Memorial Hospital, but in the past few months both hospitals have had layoffs.\n\nTown supervisors met with the medical group\u2019s CEO last week.\n\nNewfane Supervisor Tim Horanburg said, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you the exact statement was made: \u201cIf we keep Newfane open, both hospitals are going down.\u201d What does that tell you?\u201d\n\nRELATED | News 4 received a statement from a hospital spokesperson last week, who said the layoffs were related to efficiency\n\nNewfane resident Debbie Bartenstein opined, \u201cI\u2019ve lived in this community my whole lif;, I\u2019ve raised my children here. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve been in crises and one thing I do know is this community bands together like no other community I\u2019ve ever seen. We will fight and we will fight hard.\u201d\n\nHoranburg added, \u201cThe residents of Northern Niagara County raised the money and built that hospital. There was no state or federal aid, it was the residents who built it, so I wouldn\u2019t put anything past these residents, what we can do. If there\u2019s communication, we can make it work.\u201d\n\nHospital officials say despite recent investments in the facility, the hospital has struggled because of a trend of more people using urgent care facilities, and changes in the way hospitals are paid, but they stress no final decisions have been made.\n\nThe full statement is below:\n\nEastern Niagara Hospital has made significant efforts on behalf of its Newfane site during the past several years. It invested $3 million in 2010 to renovate the Med/Surg unit to improve the environment for inpatient care. The Dialysis Unit was added in 2011 after this service was identified as a medical need in the community. Radiology equipment/technology has been enhanced, including the additions of a 64 slice CT scan, digital mammography and dual-head nuclear medicine upgrades.\n\nThe Hospital effected some layoffs this year at both Hospital sites in response to declines in inpatient volume, a shift toward outpatient services, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, changes in the way hospitals are paid, increases in uncompensated care and charity care, the Medicare sequestration cuts and the difficult healthcare environment.\n\nIn response to the Newfane community\u2019s recent concerns, the Hospital is studying a variety of options to reduce expenses, but has made no decisions. In order to remain viable, it is imperative that the Hospital proactively examine opportunities to reshape the organization and utilize its resources in the most efficient manner possible \u2014 in accordance with the utilization of services by patients.\n\nCarolyn Moore, Director of Community Relations stated, \u201cChange is a constant for health care institutions today. Hospitals can no longer operate in the same manner they did 20 years ago or even 10 years ago. As the needs of the community and the utilization of services change, the Hospital must also reconfigure. It is essential in order to ensure ENH\u2019s long term sustainability in the region.\u201d\n\nMoore added, \u201cENH remains committed to providing access to local care. It is taking a methodical approach to evaluate all areas so that it can best meet the changing needs of the community and position the Hospital for continued success. Specifics have yet to be determined. In order to fulfill its mission of providing care to the residents of eastern Niagara County, ENH must continue to achieve fiscal stability \u2014 which can sometimes be a painful process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 200 people packed an emergency meeting Monday night where the supervisors of Newfane, Cambria, Wilson and Somerset tried to come u\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wivb", "og": {"site_name": "wivb.com", "description": "More than 200 people packed an emergency meeting Monday night where the supervisors of Newfane, Cambria, Wilson and Somerset tried to come up with ideas of how to save Eastern Niagara Hospital in N\u2026", "title": "Residents plan to fight to keep Newfane hospital operating", "url": "http://wivb.com/2014/03/17/residents-plan-to-fight-to-keep-newfane-hospital-operating/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/eastern-niagara-hospital.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than 200 people packed an emergency meeting Monday night where the supervisors of Newfane, Cambria, Wilson and Somerset tried to come up with ideas of how to save Eastern Niagara Hospital in N\u2026", "title": "Residents plan to fight to keep Newfane hospital operating", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/eastern-niagara-hospital.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@news4buffalo", "site": "news4buffalo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Buffalo News, Buffalo Weather | WIVB-TV News 4 Buffalo, NY | WIVB.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488276218", "fb": {"pages": 83900655504}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "wivb.com", "google-site-verification": "rCC8KvhYhxYynxDuL7C_fyWPtSiu1m13vV8Xe8bufDg", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/news4buffalo", "published_time": "2014-03-18T02:06:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-18T02:06:01+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wivb.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f7d9afd22abc1421f3f3acc9bc34faf7?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02a0\"", "article_summary": "We will fight and we will fight hard.\u201dHoranburg added, \u201cThe residents of Northern Niagara County raised the money and built that hospital.\nNEWFANE, N.Y.
