Although Congress is threatening to repeal portions of the ACA (aka \u201cObamacare\u201d), it certainly won\u2019t happen before you and I need to report and file our 2014 tax returns.\n\nTo our rescue, the IRS has released the new Publication 5187 (\u201cHealth Care Law: What\u2019s New for Individuals & Families\u201d) to help us through the minefield of these new regulations on our tax return. If you can\u2019t sleep tonight or really want to read it, here is a link to the Publication 5187.\n\nWho is subject to the ISR rules? All U.S. citizens are subject to the ISR rules, as are all non-U.S. citizens who are in the U.S. long enough during a calendar year to qualify as resident aliens for federal income tax purposes.\n\nForeign nationals who live in the U.S. for a short enough period that they do not become resident aliens for tax purposes are exempt from the ISR provision even though they may have to file a U.S. income tax return.\n\nWhat must be reported on the tax return? All individuals subject to the ISR rules use their 2014 income tax return to:\n\nReport that they have qualifying health care coverage (also called minimum essential coverage)\n\nShow they qualify for an exemption from coverage\n\nMake an individual shared responsibility payment.\n\nWhat is minimum essential coverage? This is a health care plan or arrangement specifically identified in the law as minimum essential coverage, including:\n\nEmployer-sponsored coverage under a group health plan (including self-insured plans)\n\nSpecified government-sponsored programs (e.g., Medicare Part A, Medicare Advantage, most Medicaid programs, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), most TRICARE programs (for eligible active and retired service members), and comprehensive health care coverage of veterans)\n\nIndividual market coverage (e.g., a qualified health plan purchased through the Marketplace or individual health coverage purchased directly from an insurance company)\n\nGrandfathered health plans (in general, certain plans that existed before the ACA and have not changed since the ACA was passed)\n\nOther plans or programs that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recognizes as minimum essential coverage for the purposes of the ACA.\n\nHow to report minimum essential coverage: Taxpayers whose entire tax household had minimum essential coverage for each month of their tax year will indicate this on their federal income tax return by simply checking a box on their Form 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ.\n\nOn Form 1040, they\u2019ll check the \u201cfull year coverage box\u201d at Line 61: \u201cHealth care: individual responsibility (see instructions).\u201d No further action is required.\n\nHow to report exemptions from health coverage: If you qualify for an exemption and don\u2019t have to carry insurance under ACA, you can claim coverage exemptions on Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions, and attach it to Form 1040, Form 1040A, or Form 1040EZ.\n\nIndividual shared responsibility payments: This is the nice title the government has come up with for the term \u201cpenalty\u201d for not carrying insurance.\n\nThus, a taxpayer will need to make an individual shared responsibility payment (SRP) when filing his federal income tax return if anyone in his household does not have minimum essential coverage and does not qualify for a coverage exemption.\n\nFor 2014 (to be paid on your 2014 tax return), the annual SRP amount is the greater of:\n\n1% of the household income that is above the tax return filing threshold for the taxpayer\u2019s filing status\n\nThe family\u2019s flat dollar amount, which is $95 per adult and $47.50 per child (under age 18), limited to a family maximum of $285.\n\nBeware: Taxpayers owe 1/12th of the annual SRP for each month they or their dependent(s) do not have coverage and do not qualify for a coverage exemption.\n\nHow to report individual shared responsibility payment: The ISR payment is computed on a worksheet in the instructions to Form 8965 and is entered on Form 1040, line 61; Form 1040A, line 38; or Form 1040EZ, line 11.\n\nPublication 5187 notes that IRS is prohibited from using liens or levies to collect any ISR payment. However, if taxpayers owe such a payment, the IRS may offset that liability with any tax refund that may be due to them.\n\nIn summary, this is something not to be trifled with. Congress designated the IRS to collect the penalties for not carrying insurance, and so we must report on our tax return \u2014 honestly, mind you \u2014 the type of insurance coverage we had during the year. If audited, we will need to prove this.\n\nRegards,\n\nMark Kohler\n\nfor The Daily Reckoning\n\nP.S. Be sure to sign up for our FREE email edition of The Daily Reckoning.
