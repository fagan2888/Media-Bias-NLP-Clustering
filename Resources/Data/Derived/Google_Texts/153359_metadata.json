One area that ought to be discussed more is mandatory firearms training for gun owners.\n\nDick Metcalf\u2019s November 7 firing from Guns & Ammo magazine shows that some in the gun community don\u2019t much like dissent from the idea of unlimited Second Amendment rights. The long-time columnist dared to suggest in his last piece that just maybe gun owners should be required to get some firearms training. Outraged readers deluged the magazine with subscription cancellations, two firearms manufacturers threatened to pull advertising (according to Metcalf) and he got the boot. \u201cIt is very clear to me that [Metcalf\u2019s views] don\u2019t reflect the views of our readership,\u201d editor Jim Bequette wrote in an apology.\n\nIf so, the readership\u2019s views probably don\u2019t reflect the opinions of most gun-rights supporters, either. In a survey last July of 945 gun owners by Republican pollster Frank Luntz, 74 percent of current or former NRA members said \u201cconcealed-carry permits should only be granted to applicants who have completed gun safety training.\u201d In March 2011, gun rights blog The Truth About Guns posted an entry by regular contributor Jim Sutherland arguing for mandatory training for gun owners. And in his majority Supreme Court opinion in D.C. v. Heller, Justice Scalia notes that the adjective \u201cwell-regulated\u201d in the Second Amendment implies the \u201cimposition of proper discipline and training.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason that the idea of mandating training won\u2019t stay dead \u2014 in volatile situations, a good many gun owners don\u2019t have a fraction of the practice they need to make good decisions or even shoot straight. Kenneth Cooper, a New York State-certified firearms instructor, was in a gun shop last week when a woman came in who\u2019d gotten her handgun license. It soon became clear she didn\u2019t know the first thing about guns \u2014 like what a magazine is or the difference between a semiautomatic and a revolver. \u201cThis is very scary stuff,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cIf she hurts somebody, it\u2019s bad for the gun industry, it\u2019s bad for the person she hurts and it\u2019s bad for her.\u201d\n\nA good guy with a gun might stop a bad guy with a gun, but he (or she) also may well take out bystanders. CDC data show just over 600 accidental firearms deaths and 17,000 injuries for the latest years that data are available. Shooters can miss their targets, like concealed-carry car-jack victim Edward Bell, who fired on his own car as it was being driven away by an assailant and instead killed 69-year-old Geraldine Jackson inside her house. Or they open up on the wrong person, like the concealed-carry holder in Arkansas who shot at what he thought was a bank robbery getaway car but turned out not to be. They make careless mistakes, like the concealed-carry holder in a Florida internet caf\u00e9 whose handgun fell out of his waistband, hit the floor and went off, killing another patron. And they make bad choices, like the one that allegedly killed Renisha McBride, who was shot on November 2 after crashing her car and knocking on a door for help \u2014 the homeowner claims he thought someone was breaking in and that his gun discharged by accident.\n\nEven experienced cops have trouble handling shoot-don\u2019t-shoot decisions and gun battles well, say police experts. Low light, suspects in motion and combat stress all affect their accuracy and judgment. Quality firearms training makes the difference between taking down an assailant or killing an innocent. Standards vary across states, but on average new police recruits get 60 hours of weapons training. After that, all cops have to re-test on a target range once or twice a year or more, including shooting in dim light and at moving targets. Every year, they also participate in tactical training designed to mimic real-world scenarios.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mandatory firearm training for gun owners wouldn't just save law enforcement and bystanders \u2014 but NRA members, too", "title": "How can the NRA block this?
