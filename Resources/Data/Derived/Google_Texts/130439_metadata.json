Most of the projects were left incomplete after five years of work, the audit notes.\n\nThe report comes at a difficult time for the Defense Department.\n\nA Senate subpanel has slated a hearing next week to examine the task force\u2019s efforts after SIGAR audits revealed that TFBSO had spent almost $43 million to build a gas station and $150 million on luxurious private villas.\n\nThat the task force disbanded in March and no one at Pentagon seems to remember it ever existed has further damaged the relationship between Defense and Congress.\n\nThe Armed Services subcommittee looking into the task force is chaired by Sen. Kelly Ayotte (NH), who is up for reelection in 2016 and is seen as one of the most vulnerable GOP incumbents. She could leverage the hearing \u2013 which will feature SIGAR chief John F. Sopko and a senior Defense official \u2013 as an opportunity to rake the Pentagon over the coals and cement her fiscal credentials with conservative voters back home.\n\nRelated: Pentagon Posh: U.S. Spent $150 Million on Luxury Villas in Afghanistan\n\nAs for the latest SIGAR report, TFBSO spent more than $46 million building capacity for \u201cmineral tender support,\u201d which is related to the legal process of bidding for contracts, but not a single tender resulted in a signed contract.\n\nThe task force used $35.9 million for seismic reflection surveys, including one contract that was cancelled for cause after $4.7 million had been doled out and the project failed to collect any of the data required by the contract; nearly $45 million on hydrocarbon tender support activities; and about $34 million to repair and replace natural gas pipelines. None of these projects ever got off the ground fully, the audit notes.\n\nThe Pentagon isn\u2019t alone is wasting money, though. USAID could end up wasting $200 million in Afghanistan thanks to issues like delays in reform, staff turnover and other chronic problems within the Afghan Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, according to the audit.\n\nRelated: The $43 Million Afghan Gas Station Scandal Blows the Lid Off Pentagon Waste\n\nIf anything, the report adds more poison to the well when it comes to the TFBSO on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for these kinds of projects in Afghanistan, you don\u2019t even need the fingers on one hand to count the success stories,\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that U.S. taxpayers must bear the brunt of so many expensive failures.
