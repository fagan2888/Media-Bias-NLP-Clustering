Natalie Keyssar for The Wall Street Journal\n\nDr. Alexander Imich, who had been the world\u2019s oldest man, died over the weekend at his Manhattan home. He was 111.\n\nHis niece told the Associated Press that Dr. Imich\u2019s health began declining in the past several weeks. The chemist and parapsychologist\u2019s life was not only long \u2014 it was eventful and colorful. Born in a Polish town that was then part of Russia, Dr. Imich and his wife fled the Nazis in 1939, eventually moving to the United States.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s Ralph Gardner interviewed Dr. Imich in his West End Avenue home in 2011, back when he was just 108 years old. Mr. Gardner described him as a whip-smart fellow whose years hadn\u2019t made a dent in his memory or recollection.\n\nOccasionally Dr. Imich would lapse into silence\u2014only for a few seconds\u2014and I\u2019d wonder whether it was a sign of senility, or at least flagging stamina. But that wasn\u2019t it, because his next recollection, or retrieval of a name or date from the distant past, was just as confident, his voice just as robust, as anything that he\u2019d said previously.\n\nSome of Dr. Imich\u2019s remembrances were painful \u2014 the impact of anti-Semitism on his career aspirations, the freezing temperatures in a labor camp, the loss of his family members in the Holocaust. Other stories were far more fanciful.\n\nHe also told the story of the time he heard an explosion in his apartment and discovered a visitor, whose arrival he\u2019d been awaiting at his front door, seated on the floor behind him. He also believes in UFOs and has a photograph on his desk of friends he says were abducted by aliens. Finally, he believes that humans can survive largely without food, and attributes his longevity, at least in part, to how little he eats. Whether he\u2019s right about any or all these things scarcely matters. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Alex tired,\u201d said Ms. Kaufman, who works for Selfhelp, a support organization for Holocaust survivors. \u201cAll that stuff he was talking about keeps him going.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Dr. Alexander Imich, who had been the world's oldest man, died over the weekend at his Manhattan home.
