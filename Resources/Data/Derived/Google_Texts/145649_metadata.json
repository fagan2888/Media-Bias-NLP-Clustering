To keep up the gravy train, the big players have to continue to reduce patient benefits and physician payments. There is no question in my mind. Patients and their families and advocates have to speak loudly, firmly, and progressively going forward.\u201d\n\nPatients and their advocates have played only a minimal role in the development of the CDC guidelines. The only two patient advocacy groups invited to the webinar were the American Chronic Pain Association and the American Cancer Society.\n\nOne group that was well represented at the webinar were non-profits focused on fighting addiction and drug abuse, includingThe Partnership at Drugfree.org, Safe States, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, Harm Reduction Coalition, ShatterProof, and Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing (PROP).\n\nAs Pain News Network has reported, PROP has played a significant role behind the scenes in the development of the CDC\u2019s opioid prescribing guidelines. At least five PROP board members, including President Jane Ballantyne, MD, Vice-President Gary Franklin, MD, and PROP founder Andrew Kolodny, MD, are on CDC panels that developed the guidelines. Kolodny is chief medical officer for Phoenix House, a non-profit that operates a chain of addiction treatment clinics.\n\nWas CDC \"Hoodwinked\" by Experts?\n\n\u201cI am surprised that the CDC would secretly align with PROP and others with conflicts, especially since many, if not most of their proposed guideline statements are not scientifically based,\u201d said Jeffrey Fudin, PharmD, a pharmacist and founder of Professionals for Rational Opioid Monitoring & Pharmacotherapy (PROMPT).\n\n\u201cCDC should be ashamed at their approach, as they were obviously hoodwinked by the presumed experts, most of whom have no formal training in pain management whatsoever. I am surprised that participants were not required to disclose potential conflicts. It disgusts me that the very stakeholders that are paying for opioids are on a panel with an agenda to save money by denying opioid use.\u201d\n\nThe CDC said it selected a \u201cdiverse\u201d panel of experts for its various committees, including the \"Core Expert Group\" (CEG) that apparently played the largest role in developing the guidelines. A list of CEG members and peer reviewers will be listed at the end of this article.\n\n\"For a guideline to be credible, it is important to eliminate or effectively manage sources of bias. These sources of bias might include financial relationships with industry, intellectual preconceptions, and previously stated public positions. Prior to participation, CDC asked CEG members to reveal potential conflicts of interest. Members could not serve if they held conflicts that could be anticipated to have a direct and predictable effect on the recommendations,\" the agency said in internal documents obtained by Pain News Network.\n\nAccording to those documents, CEG members Ballantyne and Franklin did not disclose they were PROP office holders or indicate they had a conflict of interest as members of PROP.\n\nBallantyne did disclose that she served as a paid consultant to Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, a law firm that specializes in antitrust litigation, including lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies. Ballanytne also disclosed that she serves on a special advisory committee reviewing opioid abuse deterrence for the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\"There is strong evidence that increased prescribing for chronic pain has produced increases in dependence, overdose and death without improving pain relief, function or quality of life for many individuals with common chronic pain diagnoses,\" wrote Ballantyne in a recent letter on behalf of PROP to an official with the National Institutes of Health, which is developing the National Pain Strategy.\n\nFranklin did not disclose any conflicts, although he played a significant role in the development of opioid prescribing regulations in Washington state, which has some of the toughest prescribing laws in the nation. For that, Franklin was honored by the workers compensation industry for \"his pioneering research and outspokenness on the overprescribing of opioid pain medications.\"\n\n\u201cWhereas there is evidence for significant short-term pain relief, there is no substantial evidence for maintenance of pain relief or improved function over long periods of time without incurring serious risk of overdose, dependence, or addiction,\u201d wrote Franklin in a position paper published last year in Neurology, the journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\nThe CDC said it carefully reviewed the financial relationships and \"intellectual preconceptions\" of CEG members --- and \"determined the risk of these types of activities to be minimal.\"\n\nA request for an interview with Debra Houry, Director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which selected the panels, vetted the members, and oversaw development of the guidelines, was declined.\n\nGuidelines \"Bad News\" for Pain Patients\n\nPatient advocacy groups are only now waking up to the fact that they\u2019ve had little role or voice in the CDC guidelines -- which are scheduled to be released in January. Only a summary of the guidelines is available on a CDC website and the agency is no longer accepting public comments on them.\n\n\"The CDC's draft guidelines regarding pain therapy are bad news for thousands of patients living with daily pain. They ignore the needs of patients and offer no real solutions to help physicians manage patients' pain. In addition, these guidelines were developed behind closed doors and have not been made publicly available. It is imperative that the CDC be transparent as they develop these guidelines,\" said Srinivas Nalamachu, MD, a member of the Alliance for Patient Access.\n\nIn a letter sent to CDC Director Tom Frieden, a coalition of patient groups said they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the prescribing guidelines are \u201cinconsistent with established best practices\u201d and show an \u201cextreme imbalance\u201d in the agency\u2019s views about opioids.\n\nThey also complained about the webinar.\n\n\u201cThe CDC slides presented on Wednesday were not transparent relative to process and failed to disclose the names, affiliations, and conflicts of interest of the individuals who participated in the construction of these guidelines. The presenters refused to provide any information other than to read exactly what was written on the slides even when asked directly by audience members to disclose the processes and people who had developed these prescribing guidelines,\u201d the letter states.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time pain patients have been largely excluded from an issue that\u2019s important to them, according to David Becker, a patient advocate and longtime critic of regulators and leaders in pain care.\n\n\u201cUntil people in pain work together in common cause to have a real voice in pain care, then the designs of others in government and industry will continue to impose inhumane, degrading, and ineffective treatment on them - without their advice or consent,\u201d Becker said.\n\nInterestingly, the only media outlet invited to the CDC webinar was Consumer Reports, which last year did a cover story and special report on \u201cThe Dangers of Painkillers.\u201d\n\nGroups and organizations invited to the CDC webinar:\n\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians\n\nAmerican Academy of General Physicians\n\nAmerican Academy of Neurology\n\nAmerican Academy of Pain Management\n\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\n\nAmerican Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\n\nAmerican Board of Internal Medicine\n\nAmerican Cancer Society\n\nAmerican Chronic Pain Association\n\nAmerican College of Obstetrics and Gynecology\n\nAmerican College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine\n\nAmerican College of Physicians\n\nAmerican College of Preventive Medicine\n\nAmerican Geriatrics Society\n\nAmerican Hospital Association\n\nAmerican Insurance Association\n\nAmerican Medical Association\n\nAmerican Pain Society\n\nAmerican Pharmacists Association\n\nAmerican Physical Therapy Association\n\nAmerican Public Health Association\n\nAmerican Society of Addiction Medicine\n\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists\n\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology\n\nAmerican Society of Health-System Pharmacists\n\nAmerican Society of Hematology\n\nAmerican Society of Interventional Pain Physicians\n\nAssociation of American Medical Colleges\n\nBlue Cross/Blue Shield(s)\n\nBrandeis PDMP Center of Excellence\n\nCigna\n\nClinton Global Initiative\n\nColorado Department of Regulatory Agencies\n\nCommunity Anti-Drug Coalitions of America\n\nConsumer Reports\n\nCVS Caremark\n\nFederation of State Medical Boards\n\nHarm Reduction Coalition\n\nKaiser Permanente Southern California\n\nMaineCare\n\nNational Association of Boards of Pharmacy\n\nNational Association of State Alcohol/Drug Abuse Directors\n\nNational Association of State Medicaid Directors\n\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\n\nNational Conference of State Legislatures\n\nNational Governors Association\n\nNational Safety Council\n\nPew Charitable Trusts\n\nPhysicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing\n\nSafe States\n\nShatterProof\n\nTrust for America\u2019s Health\n\nThe Partnership at Drugfree.org\n\nAmerican Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence\n\nAppalachian Regional Commission\n\nAssociation of State and Territorial Health Officials\n\nAmerican College of Emergency Medicine\n\nNational Association of County and City Health Officials\n\nSociety of General Internal Medicine\n\nCore Core Violence & Injury Prevention Program (VIPP) grantees\n\nCDC Prevention for States grantees\n\nCore Expert Group members:\n\nPam Archer, MPH; Oklahoma State Department of Health\n\nJane Ballantyne, MD; University of Washington/PROP President\n\nAmy Bohnert, MHS, PhD; University of Michigan\n\nBonnie Burman, ScD; Ohio Department on Aging\n\nRoger Chou, MD; Oregon Health and Sciences University\n\nPhillip Coffin, MD, MIA; San Francisco Department of Public Health\n\nGary Franklin, MD, MPH; University of Washington/PROP Vice-President\n\nErin Krebs, MD, MPH; Minneapolis VA Health Care System/University of Minnesota\n\nMitchel Mutter, MD; Tennessee Department of Health\n\nLewis Nelson, MD, New York University School of Medicine\n\nTrupti Patel, MD; Arizona Department of Health Services\n\nChristina A.

Kolodny is \r\nchief medical officer for Phoenix House, a non-profit that operates a chain \r\nof addiction treatment clinics.\r\n\r\nWas CDC \"Hoodwinked\" by Experts?\r\n\r\n\u201cI am surprised that the CDC would secretly align with PROP and others with \r\nconflicts, especially since many, if not most of their proposed guideline \r\nstatements are not scientifically based,\u201d said Jeffrey Fudin, PharmD, a \r\npharmacist and founder of Professionals for Rational Opioid Monitoring & \r\nPharmacotherapy (PROMPT).\r\n\r\n\u201cCDC should be ashamed at their approach, as they were obviously hoodwinked \r\nby the presumed experts, most of whom have no formal training in pain \r\nmanagement whatsoever.\u00a0 I am surprised that participants were not required \r\nto disclose potential conflicts. It disgusts me that the very stakeholders \r\nthat are paying for opioids are on a panel with an agenda to save money by \r\ndenying opioid use.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe CDC said it selected a \u201cdiverse\u201d panel of experts for its various \r\ncommittees, including the \"Core Expert Group\" (CEG) that apparently played \r\nthe largest role in developing the guidelines. A list of CEG members and \r\npeer reviewers will be listed at the end of this article.\r\n\r\n\"For a guideline to be credible, it is important to eliminate or \r\neffectively manage sources of bias. These sources of bias might include \r\nfinancial relationships with industry, intellectual preconceptions, and \r\npreviously stated public positions. Prior to participation, CDC asked CEG \r\nmembers to reveal potential conflicts of interest. Members could not serve \r\nif they held conflicts that could be anticipated to have a direct and \r\npredictable effect on the recommendations,\" the agency said in internal \r\ndocuments obtained by Pain News Network.\r\n\r\nAccording to those documents, CEG members Ballantyne and Franklin did not \r\ndisclose they were PROP office holders or indicate they had a conflict of \r\ninterest as members of PROP.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBallantyne did disclose that she served as a paid consultant to Cohen \r\nMilstein Sellers & Toll, a law firm that specializes in antitrust \r\nlitigation, including lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies.\u00a0 \r\nBallanytne also disclosed that she serves on a special advisory committee \r\nreviewing opioid abuse deterrence for the Food and Drug Administration.\r\n\r\n\"There is strong evidence that increased prescribing for chronic pain has \r\nproduced increases in dependence, overdose and death without improving pain \r\nrelief, function or quality of life for many individuals with common \r\nchronic pain diagnoses,\" wrote Ballantyne in a recent letter on behalf of \r\nPROP to an official with the National Institutes of Health, which is \r\ndeveloping the National Pain Strategy.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFranklin did not disclose any conflicts, although he played a significant \r\nrole in the development of opioid prescribing regulations in Washington \r\nstate, which has some of the toughest prescribing laws in the nation. For \r\nthat, Franklin was honored by the workers compensation industry for \"his \r\npioneering research and outspokenness on the overprescribing of opioid pain \r\nmedications.\"\r\n\r\n\u201cWhereas there is evidence for significant short-term pain relief, there is \r\nno substantial evidence for maintenance of pain relief or improved function \r\nover long periods of time without incurring serious risk of overdose, \r\ndependence, or addiction,\u201d wrote Franklin in a position paper published \r\nlast year in Neurology, the journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\r\n\r\nThe CDC said it carefully reviewed the financial relationships and \r\n\"intellectual preconceptions\" of CEG members --- and \"determined the risk \r\nof these types of activities to be minimal.\"\r\n\r\nA request for an interview with Debra Houry, Director of the CDC\u2019s National \r\nCenter for Injury Prevention and Control, which selected the panels, vetted \r\nthe members, and oversaw development of the guidelines, was declined.\r\n\r\nGuidelines \"Bad News\" for Pain Patients\r\n\r\nPatient advocacy groups are only now waking up to the fact that they\u2019ve had \r\nlittle role or voice in the CDC guidelines -- which are scheduled to be \r\nreleased in January. Only a summary of the guidelines is available on a CDC \r\nwebsite and the agency is no longer accepting public comments on them.\r\n\r\n\"The CDC's draft guidelines regarding pain therapy are bad news for \r\nthousands of patients living with daily pain. They ignore the needs of \r\npatients and offer no real solutions to help physicians manage patients' \r\npain. In addition, these guidelines were developed behind closed doors and \r\nhave not been made publicly available. It is imperative that the CDC be \r\ntransparent as they develop these guidelines,\" said Srinivas Nalamachu, MD, \r\na member of the Alliance for Patient Access.\r\n\r\n\u00a0In a letter sent to CDC Director Tom Frieden, a coalition of patient \r\ngroups said they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the prescribing guidelines \r\nare \u201cinconsistent with established best practices\u201d and show an \u201cextreme \r\nimbalance\u201d in the agency\u2019s views about opioids.\r\n\r\nThey also complained about the webinar.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe CDC slides presented on Wednesday were not transparent relative to \r\nprocess and failed to disclose the names, affiliations, and conflicts of \r\ninterest of the individuals who participated in the construction of these \r\nguidelines. The presenters refused to provide any information other than to \r\nread exactly what was written on the slides even when asked directly by \r\naudience members to disclose the processes and people who had developed \r\nthese prescribing guidelines,\u201d the letter states.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not the first time pain patients have been largely excluded from an \r\nissue that\u2019s important to them, according to David Becker, a patient \r\nadvocate and longtime critic of regulators and leaders in pain care.\r\n\r\n\u201cUntil people in pain work together in common cause to have a real voice in \r\npain care, then the designs of others in government and industry will \r\ncontinue to impose inhumane, degrading, and ineffective treatment on them - \r\nwithout their advice or consent,\u201d Becker said.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the only media outlet invited to the CDC webinar was \r\nConsumer Reports, which last year did a cover story and special report on \r\n\u201cThe Dangers of Painkillers.\u201d\r\n\r\nGroups and organizations invited to the CDC webinar:\r\n\r\n    * American Academy of Family Physicians\r\n    * American Academy of General Physicians\r\n    * American Academy of Neurology\r\n    * American Academy of Pain Management\r\n    * American Academy of Pediatrics\r\n    * American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\r\n    * American Board of Internal Medicine\r\n    * American Cancer Society\r\n    * American Chronic Pain Association\r\n    * American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology\r\n    * American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine\r\n    * American College of Physicians\r\n    * American College of Preventive Medicine\r\n    * American Geriatrics Society\r\n    * American Hospital Association\r\n    * American Insurance Association\r\n    * American Medical Association\r\n    * American Pain Society\r\n    * American Pharmacists Association\r\n    * American Physical Therapy Association\r\n    * American Public Health Association\r\n    * American Society of Addiction Medicine\r\n    * American Society of Anesthesiologists\r\n    * American Society of Clinical Oncology\r\n    * American Society of Health-System Pharmacists\r\n    * American Society of Hematology\r\n    * American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians\r\n    * Association of American Medical Colleges\r\n    * Blue Cross/Blue Shield(s)\r\n    * Brandeis PDMP Center of Excellence\r\n    * Cigna\r\n    * Clinton Global Initiative\r\n    * Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies\r\n    * Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America\r\n    * Consumer Reports\r\n    * CVS Caremark\r\n    * Federation of State Medical Boards\r\n    * Harm Reduction Coalition\r\n    * Kaiser Permanente Southern California\r\n    * MaineCare\r\n    * National Association of Boards of Pharmacy\r\n    * National Association of State Alcohol/Drug Abuse Directors\r\n    * National Association of State Medicaid Directors\r\n    * National Comprehensive Cancer Network\r\n    * National Conference of State Legislatures\r\n    * National Governors Association\r\n    * National Safety Council\r\n    * Pew Charitable Trusts\r\n    * Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing\r\n    * Safe States\r\n    * ShatterProof\r\n    * Trust for America\u2019s Health\r\n    * The Partnership at Drugfree.org\r\n    * American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence\r\n    * Appalachian Regional Commission\r\n    * Association of State and Territorial Health Officials\r\n    * American College of Emergency Medicine\r\n    * National Association of County and City Health Officials\r\n    * Society of General Internal Medicine\r\n    * Core Core Violence & Injury Prevention Program (VIPP) grantees\r\n    * CDC Prevention for States grantees\r\n\r\nCore Expert Group members:\r\n\r\n    * Pam Archer, MPH; Oklahoma State Department of Health\r\n    * Jane Ballantyne, MD; University of Washington/PROP President\r\n    * Amy Bohnert, MHS, PhD; University of Michigan\r\n    * Bonnie Burman, ScD; Ohio Department on Aging\r\n    * Roger Chou, MD; Oregon Health and Sciences University\r\n    * Phillip Coffin, MD, MIA; San Francisco Department of Public Health\r\n    * Gary Franklin, MD, MPH; University of Washington/PROP Vice-President\r\n    * Erin Krebs, MD, MPH; Minneapolis VA Health Care System/University of\r\n      Minnesota\r\n    * Mitchel Mutter, MD; Tennessee Department of Health\r\n    * Lewis Nelson, MD, New York University School of Medicine\r\n    * Trupti Patel, MD; Arizona Department of Health Services\r\n    * Christina A.
