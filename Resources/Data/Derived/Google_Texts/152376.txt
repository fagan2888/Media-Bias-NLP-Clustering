A man shoves another man to the ground and points a gun at him during a confrontation at an east Wichita restaurant early Saturday morning.

Wichita police say it happened at about 3:20 a.m. outside of the Denny's restaurant near Harry and Rock.

A 21-year-old man told arriving officers he was confronting another man who he felt was inappropriately touching his sister outside of the restaurant.

The victim told officers the suspect, who he is acquainted with, then shoved him to the ground before taking out a handgun and pointing it at him.

That's when the victim got up, ran into the restaurant and called 911.

Police say several witnesses saw the suspect and another female get into a red Ford F-150 pickup that was last seen heading northbound on Rock Road.

The suspect is described as a white man in his 40s, 5-foot-9, 155 pounds and bald.

No one was injured.
