At least one smart fridge played a role in a massive spam attack last year, involving more than 100,000 internet-connected devices and more than 750,000 spam emails. She also mentioned \u201csmart fluorescent LEDs [that are] are communicating that they need to be replaced but are also being hijacked for other things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe merger of physical and virtual is really where it\u2019s at. If we don\u2019t grok that then we\u2019ve got huge problems,\u201d she said. Grok, a reference to Robert A. Heinlein\u2019s 1961 novel Stranger in a Strange Land, describes the telepathic communion of thoughts, feelings, and fears.\n\nSmart clothing, she said, could create security and access problems, specifically for the CIA. The same technologies that could allow millions to better monitor and manage their health could create a transparency and workplace problems that \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to deal with.\u201d It has a sort of science-fictional flare, but Meyerriecks says there\u2019s no excuse for being caught off-guard by technological events, or \u201cpunctuating technological disruptions\u201d that are clearly visible in trends today.\n\nRelated: How You're Shaping the Future Through Big Data\n\n\u201cThe merger of biological and cyber, those will be viewed as disruptors although we all know they\u2019ve been invested in for decades at this point. When someone finally figures out how to productize it in a way.\u201d By way of an example, she brought up the cell phone, \u201cWhen it goes from the brick to something I can\u2019t leave my house without, then it\u2019s disruptive.\u201d\n\nIn many ways that day has already arrived. Dick Cheney, formerU.S. Vice President, told 60 Minutes that he had a wireless pacemaker installed in his chest in 2007 that would have allowed his doctor to monitor his heart, online. He didn\u2019t enable the BlueTooth broadcasting feature for fear of it being hacked. We have a hard enough time securing computers on desks. We may already face the risk of an entire generation of baby boomers becoming vulnerable to lethal cyber attacks because of Internet-enabled medical devices.\n\nHere are some other takeaways from the discussion:\n\nThe Economic War Is Afoot\n\nWhen asked if the United States was already engaged in an economic war, with intellectual property as the prize, Meyerriecks responded that \u201cAbsolutely, this the case.\u201d That\u2019s evident in the fact that the U.S. is now suing five members of the Chinese military for what amounts to industrial espionage, stealing trade secrets for personal profit. It\u2019s a lawsuit against individuals, but the Chinese government, as a whole, took it personally and suspended participation in a joint China-U.S.cyber-security working group.\n\nQuantum Computing Won\u2019t Save You\n\n\u201cOn our best day we\u2019re 20 years away,\u201d Meyerriecks said of true quantum computing (defined roughly as computing that everyone in computing science can agree is actually quantum in nature, achieving entanglement.) \u201cWhen it happens, we have a huge challenge. We are making significant investments and paying a lot of attention.\u201d\n\nRelated: Who Controls the Digital Data of the Deceased?\n\nSteve Chan, the director of the Network Science Research Center at IBM who joined Meyerriecks on stage in Aspen, said that the search for the quantum Holy Grail was not only confused but largely unnecessary. Quantum is generally referred to as computation that takes advantage of the unique behaviors of quantum bits, or qubits, to represent information in multiple ways, as opposed to ones and zeros. \u201cNowadays,\u201d he said \u201cwe can do custom chip design so we can use binary rules but three digit representations that get basically the same value, with fewer digits, which saves computational cycles.\u201d\n\nPut Your Faith in Big Data\n\nThe threats and the opportunities technological acceleration occupy the same space.\n\nWhen asked about the major investment areas of the future, Lynn Dugle, a vice president at military contractor Raytheon enthusiastically offered up big data and described the \u201copportunity to know things, through cyber-analytics, through personal analytics.\u201d She cited a common industry forecast that more than 50 billion machine-to-machine connected devices will inhabit the globe by 2020 (according to figures from Cisco), versus approximately 13 billion today.\n\nCalling Big Data a big opportunity has become almost \u201cglib,\u201d according to Meyerriecks. But it\u2019s an area where the CIA is also focusing its major investments and building the capability to do the sort of highly-targeted and individual specific data collection that would make today\u2019s NSA activities look positively quant. It\u2019s big data that \u201cdwarfs today\u2019s twitter feeds,\u201d she said, and emphasized that it was data specific to an individual, not everyone, \u201cthat\u2019s targeted collection. Not random collection.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Defense One.\n\nRead more in Defense One:\n\nWeather and War: A Perfect Storm\n\nISIS Is 'Now a Full-Blown Army'\n\nWhat Egypt Stands to Win from Gaza Conflict", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The major themes defining geo-security for\u00a0the coming decades were ex", "title": "Why the CIA Fears the Internet of Things", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/27/Why-CIA-Fears-Internet-Things", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/SmartThings.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/27/Why-CIA-Fears-Internet-Things", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/SmartThings.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The major themes defining geo-security for\u00a0the coming decades were ex", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Calling Big Data a big opportunity has become almost \u201cglib,\u201d according to Meyerriecks.\nIt\u2019s big data that \u201cdwarfs today\u2019s twitter feeds,\u201d she said, and emphasized that it was data specific to an individual, not everyone, \u201cthat\u2019s targeted collection.\nQuantum Computing Won\u2019t Save You\u201cOn our best day we\u2019re 20 years away,\u201d Meyerriecks said of true quantum computing (defined roughly as computing that everyone in computing science can agree is actually quantum in nature, achieving entanglement.)\nGrok, a reference to Robert A.
