If you fall asleep or maybe you\u2019re just a bad driver, guardrails may prevent you from going off a cliff.\n\nRecently, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Kimberley Strassel used the phrase \u201cno political guardrails\u201d to point out how many of today\u2019s politicians seem to lack any constraints, any safeguards against their use of power. She\u2019s onto something.\n\n\u201cMr. Obama wants what he wants. If ObamaCare is problematic, he unilaterally alters the law,\u201d Strassel writes. \u201cIf the nation won\u2019t support laws to fight climate change, he creates one with regulation. If the Senate won\u2019t confirm his nominees, he declares it in recess and installs them anyway.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton does it too. In fact, she promises that once she becomes president, that is how she will govern. If Congress won\u2019t give her gun control laws she wants, she says she\u2019ll unilaterally impose them. Likewise, if Congress rejects her proposed new tax on corporations, \u201cthen I will ask the Treasury Department, when I\u2019m there, to use its regulatory authority, if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d\n\nWhatever it takes. So far, the public doesn\u2019t seem to mind.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s poll numbers go up after he promises \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\u201d says that \u201cthere\u2019s nobody bigger or better at the military than I am,\u201d says that he\u2019ll make Mexico \u201cpay for that wall\u201d and so on.\n\nApparently lots of people like the idea of a big, strong mommy or daddy who will take control of life and make everything better. Constitutional restraints? They\u2019re for sissies. We want \u201cleadership\u201d \u2014 someone \u201cstrong\u201d to run America.\n\nI don\u2019t. I\u2019m an adult. I don\u2019t want to be \u201cled.\u201d I will run my own life. Also, a president doesn\u2019t \u201crun America.\u201d The president presides over just one of three branches of government, and there are strict limits on what he can and should do.\n\nThe Constitution was written to limit political authority. Those limits left individual Americans mostly to our own devices, which helped create the freest and most prosperous country in the history of the world.\n\nNow, advocates for both parties are off the rails. Some Republicans demand that the IRS audit the Clinton Foundation. Part of me wishes that it would. I suspect their foundation is largely a scam, a pretend charity that props up the Clintons\u2019 egos and pays Hillary\u2019s political flunkies. Heck, in 2013, it raised $144 million but spent only $8.8 million on charity!\n\nShut it down! But where are the guardrails here? As Strassel put it, \u201cWhen did conservatives go from wanting to abolish the IRS to wanting to use it against rivals?\u201d\n\nToday, politicians act as if guardrails are just an annoyance. And they get rewarded for that.\n\nStrassel writes, \u201cThe more outrageous Mr. Trump is, the more his numbers soar. The more Mrs. Clinton promises to cram an agenda down the throats of her \u2018enemies,\u2019 the more enthusiastic her base. The more unrestrained the idea, the more press coverage; the more ratings soar, the more unrestrained the idea.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, humble candidates, quieter ones with modest plans \u2014 constitutional ones \u2014 get lost in the noise.\n\nSo does important government reform. While people argued whether Trump dislikes immigrants, Congress quietly reauthorized the Export-Import Bank, a huge and immoral subsidy for corporations.\n\nA coalition of free-market and anti-corporate-welfare activists fought to get Ex-Im Bank funding eliminated and finally won \u2014 but then their work was quietly undone in a massive spending bill.\n\nI once had lunch with Paul Ryan, R-Wis. He talked about reading Ayn Rand, and he emphasized the need to cut government spending. Now he\u2019s the speaker of the House who just oversaw a record-sized spending bill that doles out money to both parties\u2019 pet projects.\n\nLittle of that is authorized in the Constitution, which was intended to leave to the people or the states everything not explicitly mentioned in the document.\n\nToday, we get a depressing combination of big, showy violations of constitutional rules \u2014 which distract us from the tiny, routine violations of constitutional rules.\n\nIndividual freedom, and limited government, is better.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "breaking news, headlines, politics, polls, elections, election predictions, economy, world news, top stories, pundit, peoples pundit", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "Today, politicians act as if guardrails are just an annoyance.
