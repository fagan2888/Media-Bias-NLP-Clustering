First, no more caucuses. Next, all primaries are held on the same day; no more little Iowa and New Hampshire having so much influence. No more cross-over voting. Some guidelines could be set so that only Republicans vote in the Republican primary and vice-versa. Independents don\u2019t have a say in a party\u2019s nominating process.\n\nNow the big change: each voter will vote for their top three preferences and points will be allocated accordingly similar to the voting for the Heisman Trophy. This way, the most broadly accepted candidate can be chosen if there is significant division. There would not be an endless stream of debates rehashing the same issues. DENNIS SINGLETON, HUBER HEIGHTS\n\nGovernment the problem with health care\n\nRe \u201cGovernor\u2019s Medicaid waiver punishes the poor,\u201d May 6: Healthcare is a constant issue in this country due to cost, and people\u2019s differing opinions on the solution to the cost problem. Dr. Donald Nguyen\u2019s commentary takes the position that a government solution is preferable to a market solution and that a market solution is cruel. He points out that it requires \u201cmulti-layer bureaucracy\u201d and an \u201celaborate debit card swiping and tracking system that is complicated and costly.\u201d\n\nA multi-layered bureaucracy and a complicated and costly system is an apt description of both the Affordable Care Act and government interventions in health care in general. Before the liberal health care interventions of the 1960s, health care was a freer market and was more affordable. Forbes in its article \u201cThe Cost of Health Care: 1958 vs. 2012\u201d states that \u201cwhile time prices for other goods and services had shrunk to less than one quarter of their 1958 levels, time prices for health care had more than quadrupled.\u201d Restrictions on charity medical work, competition of health care plans across state lines and a slow and restrictive FDA raise costs.\n\nThe federal government needs to get out of health care so that the states can start deciding their own levels of care. DAVID LECKLIDER, KETTERING\n\nOEA hasn\u2019t helped teachers with pay\n\nThe article, \u201cPay behind struggle to retain teachers,\u201d May 1, caused me to wonder how much my first year\u2019s teaching salary in 1963 would be today when adjusted for inflation. I assumed the Ohio Education Association (Ohio teacher\u2019s union), which did not exist as a union in 1963, had a tremendous influence on improving teacher compensation over the past 53 years because this has been one of its primary missions.\n\nLo and behold, here\u2019s what I found. I graduated from The Ohio State University in 1963 licensed to teach high school science. My first teaching contract at Riverside High School in Logan County was for $4,400, with another $600 to coach football and basketball. Disregarding my coaching pay, $4,400 in 1963 is equivalent to $34,234 today. Today\u2019s average Ohio starting teacher salary is about $34,000. Fairborn starts first-year teachers at $33,194 while Centerville, towards the higher end of the pay scale, is $37,900.\n\nMy 1963 pay is actually higher that the average starting pay for Ohio teachers when adjusted for inflation. The comparison tells me that the OEA has accomplished very little to help improve teacher pay over the years. Way to go, OEA. You\u2019ve pulled the wool over the eyes of every teacher in Ohio for the inflated value that you bring.
