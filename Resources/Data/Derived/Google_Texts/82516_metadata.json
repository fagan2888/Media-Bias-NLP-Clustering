That can take a lot of time. But if the technician is trained properly, they could gather all that information beforehand so when I walk into the room, I can analyze it and work through it with the patient, looking for drug interactions, making sure they understand their medication \u2026\u201d\n\nSchool of Pharmacy officials hope about 20 students will enroll for the first cohort, although the program \u2014 which will be delivered primarily online \u2014 can accommodate as many as 50, Morgan said.\n\nPharmTechX is not suitable for people who just received their pharmacy technician license; work experience is required. The program is comprised of three certificate programs costing $1,000 each, Morgan said. Students who enroll in July could complete the first certificate by December.\n\nPharmacy technicians complete a two-year training program to become licensed. For those who work in community pharmacies (both chains and independent stores), their duties include greeting patients who are picking up or dropping off prescriptions, entering that information into the computer and putting the medication into the bottle.\n\nThe on-duty pharmacist then has to verify that each prescription was filled properly and that the patient isn\u2019t taking other drugs that could result in a harmful interaction. Technicians who work in hospital pharmacies are given similar levels of responsibility.\n\nBut training technicians to take on greater responsibilities will clear the way for pharmacists to practice to the \u201cfull extent of their license,\u201d said Natalie Eddington, dean of the School of Pharmacy.\n\nEddington said PharmTechX is \u201cone of the first\u201d programs of its kind nationwide. Other programs offer \u201ccontinuing education\u201d sessions for pharmacy technicians, who are required to log 20 hours of CE every two years, but Eddington said PharmTechX is more rigorous.\n\nThe program was designed with input from MedStar Health, the University of Maryland Medical System and the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Morgan said.\n\n\u201cAbout a year and a half ago, we went to them to get a sense of whether they had a need for this,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cAnd we found out they all wanted more advanced training opportunities \u2014 they wanted techs who could do more than what they\u2019re doing now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The University of Maryland, Baltimore is introducing a new program, PharmTechX, for licensed pharmacy technicians who want to learn more advanced skills.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Alissa Gulin", "og": {"site_name": "Maryland Daily Record", "description": "The University of Maryland, Baltimore is introducing a new program, PharmTechX, for licensed pharmacy technicians who want to learn more advanced skills.", "title": "UM to unveil pharmacy technician training program", "url": "http://thedailyrecord.com/2014/06/13/um-to-unveil-pharmacy-technician-training-program/", "image": "http://thedailyrecord.com/files/2014/06/UMD-Pharmacy-200x200.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "UM to unveil pharmacy technician training programMaryland Daily Record", "keywords": "university of maryland, umb, school of pharmacy, pharmtechx, training, pharmacy technician, affordable care act ,affordable care act,school of pharmacy,training,umb", "fb": {"admins": 1425649256}, "categories": "Fulltext Opinions", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "google-site-verification": "aha7Dk0W7bnMim4icYS7v2vBG_9L4xbJNHFgG2SeUOo", "y_key": "279935c4367d5a48", "thumbnail": "http://thedailyrecord.com/files/2014/06/UMD-Pharmacy-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8ad\"", "article_summary": "Pharmacy technicians complete a two-year training program to become licensed.\nThe University of Maryland School of Pharmacy is introducing a new program, PharmTechX, for licensed pharmacy technicians who want to learn more advanced skills, such as helping compile patients\u2019 medication histories and setting up robotic technology to fill prescriptions.\nPharmTechX is not suitable for people who just received their pharmacy technician license; work experience is required.\nOther programs offer \u201ccontinuing education\u201d sessions for pharmacy technicians, who are required to log 20 hours of CE every two years, but Eddington said PharmTechX is more rigorous.\nBut training technicians to take on greater responsibilities will clear the way for pharmacists to practice to the \u201cfull extent of their license,\u201d said Natalie Eddington, dean of the School of Pharmacy."}
