In the end, county supervisors voted 4-1 to authorize what amounted to a cost of living increase over what had been allotted for the earlier program.\n\nSupervisor Michael D. Antonovich was the dissenting vote.\n\n\"This is yet another example of how the County must shoulder the burden for the Federal Government -- which has failed to secure the border and continues to incentivize illegal immigration,\" he said, in a statement issued by his office on Sept. 23.\n\nEstimates have suggested that as many as 3 million to 4 million people statewide, and around 1 million in Los Angeles County, will remain without healthcare coverage after Affordable Care Act reforms are fully rolled out.\n\nFor more on healthcare, follow me on Twitter: @LATerynbrown", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "L.A.
