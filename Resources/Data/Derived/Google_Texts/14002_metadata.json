I get so much politics I don\u2019t, you know, want to be inundated with a bunch of chatter about politics during the day.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nIn the past, the president has said he found out about the IRS targeting conservatives for the political beliefs, the VA scandal, Fast and Furious from media reports.\n\nWATCH:\n\nConsidering he has a staff of thousands who are supposed to inform him of what is happening within his own government and they clearly aren\u2019t, it might be time for him to switch the TV from SportsCenter to actual news. After all, being president of the United States is the job he ran for twice.
