Nicolle Wallace, who enhanced her profile after 2008 while bashing former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin on MSNBC to make up for Wallace\u2019s shortcomings as a political adviser, and liberal actress Rosie Perez, the pro-Obama advocate who trashed Mitt Romney in 2012 and accused Rudy Giuliani of \u201cincompetence\u201d on 9/11, are the new co-hosts on The View.\n\nAs Breitbart News has previously reported, \u201cduring previous appearances on the show,\u201d Wallace \u201cgushed over Bill Clinton, Chris Christie, and Jeb Bush, while trashing Palin and conservatives,\u201d continuing her trend of throwing conservatives under the bus to get patted on the head by the elite media after she and Steve Schmidt disastrously torpedoed John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign with their terrible tactics:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn 2008, when McCain campaign consultants, namely Wallace and Steve Schmidt, decided to go \u201call-in\u201d and suspend McCain\u2019s campaign during the financial crisis, McCain\u2019s poll numbers plummeted. Immediately thereafter, Schmidt and Wallace blamed the campaign\u2019s downfall on Palin\u2013whose vice presidential selection put the moribund campaign in the lead\u2013to save their own reputations. Wallace was so \u201cloyal\u201d in 2008 that she did not even vote for the McCain-Palin ticket on election night. \u201cI didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she told The New York Times. \u201cAnd I was fine with that.\u201d She claimed she never received her absentee ballot. Wallace soon discovered that the more she bashed conservatives and Palin on programs like Morning Joe, the more the mainstream media wanted to use her.\n\nAs has also been reported, co-host Rosie O\u2019Donnell, a nasty 9/11 truther with a past history of blatant racism, \u201cdid not want the Republican co-host to be too confrontational.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News previously noted, \u201center Wallace, the show\u2019s Brooklyn Brawler,\u201d who \u201cwill be the lapdog who praises liberal Republicans the mainstream media love, while taking cheap shots at conservatives to please her producers and co-hosts.\u201d The show\u2019s producers may \u201cbe thrilled to exploit her as their useful Republican. But don\u2019t expect the uninspiring Wallace to get the show out of its ratings slump.\u201d\n\nAs for Perez, Newsbusters noted that she campaigned for Obama, sneered at Mitt Romney, praised Al Sharpton, and even accused former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani of \u201cincompetence\u201d on 9/11 that led to the death of firefighters.\n\nWelcome to The View.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Palin-Basher Nicolle Wallace, GOP-Trasher Rosie Perez Join 'The View'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Palin-Basher Nicolle Wallace, GOP-Trasher Rosie Perez Join 'The View'", "title": "Palin-Basher Nicolle Wallace, GOP-Trasher Rosie Perez Join 'The View' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/09/05/Conservative-Trasher%20Nicolle%20Wallace%20Rosie%20Perez.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/09/05/palin-basher-nicolle-wallace-pro-obama-gop-basher-rosie-perez-join-the-view/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Palin-Basher Nicolle Wallace, GOP-Trasher Rosie Perez Join 'The View'", "title": "Palin-Basher Nicolle Wallace, GOP-Trasher Rosie Perez Join 'The View' - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/09/05/Conservative-Trasher%20Nicolle%20Wallace%20Rosie%20Perez.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "9/11, Mitt Romney, Sarah Palin,Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Sarah Palin", "published_time": "2014-09-05T08:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd4c\"", "article_summary": "Wallace was so \u201cloyal\u201d in 2008 that she did not even vote for the McCain-Palin ticket on election night.\nImmediately thereafter, Schmidt and Wallace blamed the campaign\u2019s downfall on Palin\u2013whose vice presidential selection put the moribund campaign in the lead\u2013to save their own reputations.\nWallace soon discovered that the more she bashed conservatives and Palin on programs like Morning Joe, the more the mainstream media wanted to use her.\n\u201cAnd I was fine with that.\u201d She claimed she never received her absentee ballot.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she told The New York Times."}
