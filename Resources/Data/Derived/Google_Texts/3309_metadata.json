Hong A woman looks at bullet holes on the window of IV Deli Mark, where Friday's shooting took place\n\nOn Friday night, Elliot Rodger allegedly killed six people and wounded 13 others near a Santa Barbara, California university campus. The rampage came after Rodger posted a YouTube video in which he said it was \u201can injustice, a crime\u201d that women have never been attracted to him and that he was going to \u201cpunish you all for it\u201d and \u201cslaughter every single blonde slut I see.\u201d\n\nThe video was the most recent evidence that Rodger had become involved with various deeply misogynistic groups on the internet. He was an active member of PUA Hate, a group supposedly against pick up artists who promise to teach men how to have sex with any woman they want but who repeat many of the same degrading ideas about women. He was also reportedly active on forums and subscribed to YouTube channels from the men\u2019s rights movement, a community that is being tracked by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nWhile the debate in the aftermath of the shooting will likely focus on gun legislation \u2014 lawmakers are already calling for a renewed focus on background checks and other measures \u2014 and mental health resources, it is also becoming a discussion about widespread misogyny. The hashtag #YesAllWomen became a venue on Twitter for women to share personal stories and experiences. As the country tries to reckon with the tragedy, it will have to grapple with a climate in which men perpetrate violence against womenon a daily basis, violence that is deeply embedded within our society.\n\nHere are some facts that paint the picture:", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Friday's shooting came after a deeply misogynistic rant and is part of a culture where violence against women is commonplace.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Friday's shooting came after a deeply misogynistic rant and is part of a culture where violence against women is commonplace.", "title": "By The Numbers: How The Santa Barbara Shooting Reflects A Culture Of Violence Against Women", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/05/26/3441555/santa-barbara-shooting-violence-women/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP628796901135.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Friday's shooting came after a deeply misogynistic rant and is part of a culture where violence against women is commonplace.", "title": "By The Numbers: How The Santa Barbara Shooting Reflects A Culture Of Violence Against Women", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP628796901135-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@AdamReports", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP628796901135.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP628796901135.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-26T12:18:54+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/brycercovert"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5c8\"", "article_summary": "Health By The Numbers: How The Santa Barbara Shooting Reflects A Culture Of Violence Against Women CREDIT: AP/Jae C.
