Misericordia University’s commencement this year marked a significant milestone for one graduate.

Teena O’Connor, 41, of Hunlock Creek, received her Bachelor of Science in Nursing on Saturday after being recognized as the university’s 2014 Outstanding Adult Learner.

“To most of the world, I think I make this look very easy,” she said.

But as her family and co-workers know, the past two years have been a challenge, balancing her full-time studies while raising her three children and working as the operations manager for the Department of Neurology at Geisinger Health System.

“I’ll go to her work, and all of her co-workers are always like, ‘I don’t know how she does it,’” O’Connor’s daughter Nicole said. “And I’m like, ‘Me neither.’”

Nicole O’Connor, 19, also studies nursing at Misericordia and just completed her first year. She said seeing her mother’s hard work in the field of nursing has been an inspiration.

“She’s been a very strong, confident woman all of her life,” Nicole O’Connor said. “I like following in her footsteps.”

Teena O’Connor said she’s been inspired by her daughter as well.

“I love all my children equally, but looking back, there was a moment when my daughter was little, and I was holding her when I thought, ‘I have to do something more,’ she said. “And that’s when I made the decision to go back to college the first time, so I could be something for my daughter to aspire for.”

Nicole O’Connor said it’s only natural that she decided to go into nursing, since her mom, aunts and grandmother have all worked as nurses.

In 2000, Teena O’Connor earned her associate degree in nursing from Broome County Community College in Binghamton, New York. After getting her degree, she decided to put the rest of her studies on hold so she could spend more time with her family.

“I didn’t want to take away from them,” she said, adding that her children were active in school sports, and that she didn’t want to studies to keep her from attending games. “My priority needed to be them at that time.”

By 2012, Teena O’Connor decided that her children were mature enough for her to return to school. That year, she enrolled at Misericordia’s RN to BSN program. Having worked as a registered nurse for 14 years, Teena O’Connor saw new graduates coming out of Misericordia’s nursing program.

“I was born and raised in this area, with Misericordia right in my back yard,” she said. “I knew it was the right place to be.”

Balancing her work, academic, and personal lives has been a struggle for Teena O’Connor. Sometimes, she said the pressure can be too much.

“At least one time a semester I think I’m going to crack, and then I take a couple steps back and say, ‘Okay, this is manageable, I’ve been through worse things in my life, and this is small stuff,’” Teena O’Connor said.

Her son, Chris, 21, says he’s amazed and proud of the work her mother is doing.

“I don’t know how she does it,” he said. “She has papers, projects, even work, but she figures it out somehow.”

Teena O’Connor says the secret to keeping her life together has always been her family.

“I really couldn’t do it without the support of my family — from them helping out with keeping up with housework, to helping with meals, to being there to calm me down when I feel very stressed,” she said. “Sometimes it gets a little difficult to manage everything.”

Even now that she’s earned her BSN, Teena O’Connor has no intention of taking a break. Her next goal is to graduate with her master’s degree by 2017, the same year that Nicole will receive her bachelor’s degree.

“That’s our next goal together, and she’s excited about sharing in that experience with me,” Teena O’Connor said. “It will probably be one of the most defining moments of my life.”

She said first she ran the idea by Nicole, who said the mother-daughter graduation would be unique.

“I ran it by her first because I didn’t want it to be an opportunity where she felt I was stealing her thunder,” Teena O’Connor said.

Nicole O’Connor said she’s interested in family medicine, but has not decided on a definitive career path. Teena O’Connor said she’s just happy that she can help provide mentorship for her daughter.

“I want her to be something great, and the only way she’s going to be something great is if I make choices in my life to be a good role model,” she said. “It could not mean more to me that my daughter has chosen the same profession — no pushing on my end. She just has seen what I have accomplished in my life and how much joy this profession has brought me.”
