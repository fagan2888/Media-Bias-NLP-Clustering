He treats it with a chemical, runs it through a processor \u2014 and injects it into the woman\u2019s aching knees and elbows.\n\nThe \u201csoup,\u201d he says, is rich in shapeshifting stem cells \u2014 magic bullets that, according to some doctors, can be used to treat everything from Parkinson\u2019s disease to asthma to this patient\u2019s chronic osteoarthritis.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s in the soup,\u201d says Berman. \u201cMost of the time, if stem cells are in the soup, then the patient\u2019s got a good chance of getting better.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s quackery, critics say. But it\u2019s also a mushrooming business \u2014 and almost wholly unregulated.\n\nThe number of stem-cell clinics across the United States has surged from a handful in 2010 to more than 170 today, according to figures compiled by The Associated Press.\n\nMany of the clinics are linked in large, for-profit chains. New businesses continue to open; doctors looking to get into the field need only take a weekend seminar offered by a training company.\n\nBerman, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, is co-founder of the largest chain, the Cell Surgical Network. Like most doctors in the field, he has no formal background in stem cell research. His company offers stem cell procedures for more than 30 diseases and conditions, including Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, lupus and erectile dysfunction.\n\nThere are clinics that market \u201cantiaging\u201d treatments; others specialize in \u201cstem-cell facelifts\u201d and other cosmetic procedures. The cost is high, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000.\n\nBerman and others point to anecdotal accounts of seemingly miraculous recoveries. But while stem cells from bone marrow have become an established therapy for a handful of blood cancers \u2014 and while there are high hopes that the cells will someday lead to other major medical advances \u2014 critics say entrepreneurs are treating patients with little or no evidence that what they do is effective.\n\nOr even safe. They point to one stem-cell doctor who has had two patients die under his care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of this 21st century cutting-edge technology,\u201d says Dr. Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell researcher at the University of California at Davis. \u201cBut the way it\u2019s being implemented at these clinics and how it\u2019s regulated is more like the 19th century. It\u2019s aWildWest.\u201d\n\n\u2018LIQUID GOLD\u2019\n\nDoctors in South Korea and Japan pioneered the fat-based stem cell technique, using it to supposedly enhance face lifts and breast augmentation. For years, U.S. patients would travel to hospitals in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe \u2014 places where regulation is more lax than in the United States \u2014 to have these procedures as part of the international \u201cstem cell tourism\u201d trade.\n\nPlastic surgeons in the U.S. quickly realized the financial potential of the fat they were already taking out of patients\u2019 bellies and backsides through liposuction \u2014 something that had been disposed of previously. Berman calls it \u201cliquid gold.\u201d\n\nSome early adopters have expanded into chains, offering doctors across the country a chance to join the franchise after buying some equipment and attending a seminar. These doctors sometimes appear on local TV news broadcasts, drumming up new business from patients and stoking interest from other doctors. Prospective patients are then directed to a call center, where sales representatives try to match them with stem cell doctors over the phone.\n\nBerman spent over 30 years as a Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon before co-founding the Cell Surgical Network in 2012. He and his business partner, a urologist, adapted equipment and techniques from Asia into a liposuction-based procedure.\n\nToday, the Cell Surgical Network is the largest stem cell chain in the nation, with 67 locations and a roster of more than 100 doctors in 22 states. Doctors who join the network generally charge about $9,000 per procedure; they pay Berman and his partner $25,000 to $30,000 for a South Korean cell-separating machine and other equipment.\n\nStem cells have long been recognized for their ability to reproduce and transform into other cell types. Because of their ability to repair and replace tissue, they are thought to hold potential for treating many diseases and injuries.\n\nEmbryonic stem cells are the most versatile because they have the ability to form all the various cell types in the body, but their use in medicine is considered controversial by some because it involves the destruction of human embryos.\n\nAdult stem cells are less versatile, but can be easily harvested from various tissues in the body, including bone marrow and fat. For decades, they have been routinely transplanted, first in bone marrow transplants and then in procedures that transfer the cells alone. They have been useful in combating leukemia, lymphoma and other blood diseases, saving the lives of tens of thousands of people each year.\n\nThe stem cell clinics, though, promise results far beyond those currently considered prudent by mainstream medicine.\n\n\u201cI think responsible professionals have a broad consensus that marketing of these unproven interventions is premature and unprofessional, if not unethical,\u201d says Dr.George Daley, a founding executive of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nVIVID AND BRIGHT\n\nJulia Matsumoto, of Fountain Valley, California, claims stem cell injections have helped maintain her eyesight four years after being diagnosed with chronic relapsing neuropathy, which causes inflammation of the optic nerves and can lead to blindness. Berman has treated her on a monthly basis since 2012, free of charge, because Matsumoto cannot afford repeat procedures. Berman liposuctions fat from her abdomen then processes it with a spinning centrifuge machine and a drug, before filtering it and infusing the mixture into an injection site in Matsumoto\u2019s chest. \u201cThings were so vivid and bright literally 30 minutes after the stem cells were given to me,\u201d Matsumoto says, recalling her first treatment. \u201cI started crying on the way home.\u201d\n\nSuch patient anecdotes are not considered reliable medical evidence. And because stem cell clinics have not published large, rigorous studies of their techniques, it\u2019s virtually impossible to evaluate their record of success.\n\nBerman calls his business model \u201cpatient-funded research,\u201d and says he plans to soon publish the results of a 1,000-patient study demonstrating its safety. Cell Surgical has hired consultants to follow up with patients over the phone and survey how they are feeling.\n\nBut Leigh Turner, a professor of bioethics at the University of Minnesota, says charging patients to participate in medical research is bizarre and unethical. He calls the approach \u201cunauthorized, for-profit human experimentation,\u201d and has asked the Food and Drug Administration to investigate Berman, arguing that his business amounts to selling unapproved, experimental drugs.\n\nSome practitioners point to early-stage laboratory and animal studies which have been published in scientific journals. But academics say such findings cannot be applied to humans and don\u2019t provide critical information about potential side effects like infections, tumors and blood clots.\n\n\u201cThis field, sadly, is contaminated by lots of poor-quality data that people are using to move forward and actually treat patients,\u201d says Daley of Harvard.\n\nThe clinics insist that their treatments are safe, but routinely require that patients sign waivers.\n\nPatients of Dr. Zannos Grekos, a cardiologist in Bonita Springs,also were required to sign a consent form, acknowledging the stem cell procedures\u2019 risks, including death. But families of at least two of Grekos\u2019 patients say he downplayed the risks.\n\nGina Adams, daughter of patient Richard Poling, says her family was told her father would be \u201cback on the golf course the next day\u201d after a routine procedure he hoped would help him recover from a lung condition that made breathing difficult. The cost was $8,000. In March 2012, Grekos harvested fat from Poling\u2019s abdomen and sent it to an off-site processing facility to isolate the stem cells. Later that afternoon, he directed an assistant to infuse the resulting mixture into the patient\u2019s bloodstream. Poling suffered cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead after being rushed to a local hospital.\n\nAn investigation by the Florida Department of Health concluded the procedure had \u201cno substantiated medical or scientific value.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/06/1003036192-FL_SAR_hfcover09.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "His company offers stem cell procedures for more than 30 diseases and conditions, including Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, lupus and erectile dysfunction.\n\u201cThings were so vivid and bright literally 30 minutes after the stem cells were given to me,\u201d Matsumoto says, recalling her first treatment.\nThe stem cell clinics, though, promise results far beyond those currently considered prudent by mainstream medicine.\nAnd because stem cell clinics have not published large, rigorous studies of their techniques, it\u2019s virtually impossible to evaluate their record of success.\nProspective patients are then directed to a call center, where sales representatives try to match them with stem cell doctors over the phone."}
