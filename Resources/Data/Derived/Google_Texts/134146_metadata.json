Federal guidelines classify a large employer as any business with more than 50 workers.\n\nThe state is not exempt from the requirement. Idaho state government, for example, has more than 24,000 full-time workers.\n\nThe verification forms will be sent electronically to the Internal Revenue Service, and each state employee will also receive a digital copy.\n\nState workers who want paper copies of insurance verification forms can request them, Woolf\u2019s office told IdahoReporter.com.\n\nThe verification process begins Jan. 1, 2015, and Idaho must submit its first report to the IRS by Jan. 31, 2016.\n\nThe $250,000 will fund computer coding expenses for the sizable undertaking. A document turned over to IdahoReporter.com by the controller\u2019s office reveals the IRS project will take agency employees off two other undertakings, which Woolf and company didn\u2019t explain in the budget request.\n\nThe IRS project also has the potential to force Woolf\u2019s office to incur overtime costs.\n\nWith a few months remaining prior to the January kickoff of the 2015 legislative session, budget writers were less than familiar with Woolf\u2019s pitch. Rep. Maxine Bell, R-Jerome, who serves as chair of the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, told IdahoReporter.com she\u2019d seen the request in passing, but hadn\u2019t thought much of it.\n\nBell did say she looks forward to a \u201cthoughtful discussion\u201d on the expense.\n\nWhile lawmakers might indeed hold that discussion, they don\u2019t really have a choice on the matter. If the state declines to fund the project, the federal government can enact severe penalties on Idaho, including up to a combined $350,000 per year.\n\nWoolf doesn\u2019t want any association with Obamacare, but says he will request the funds to prevent future expenses for the state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like Obamacare and I believe it\u2019s not right for the people of Idaho, but the penalties for non-compliance are very real and very severe,\u201d Woolf said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "IdahoReporter.com", "description": "President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care initiative will likely cost Idaho another $250,000 as the state seeks to comply with federal insurance reporting requirements under the law.
