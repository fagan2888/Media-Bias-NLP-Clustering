Anticipating a political move against stop-loss insurance plans, Congressional Republicans have introduced a bill to more closely define stop-loss insurance so that it cannot be lumped in with traditional health insurance for purposes of complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

The Stop-Loss Insurance Protection Act was introduced by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, and Senate HELP Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, and Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tennessee, to “ensure that employers can continue providing quality health benefits to their employees through self-insured group health plans,” said a release from Roe's office.
