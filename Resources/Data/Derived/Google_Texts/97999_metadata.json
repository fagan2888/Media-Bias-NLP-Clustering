The estimate was included in a report on New York City\u2019s finance issued by the state comptroller\u2019s office Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for them to sit down and see how to restructure the operation,\u201d said Ken Bleiwas, deputy comptroller for the state of New York. \u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d\n\nHHC, which historically has taken care of the city\u2019s poorest and sickest patients, is straining under the weight of the costs of treating undocumented immigrants and competition from non-profit hospitals for Medicaid patients. Meanwhile, the federal government is cutting payments to hospitals that care for a disproportionate number of poor patients, as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHHC estimates cuts to federal Disproportionate Share Hospital funding will grow from $180 million in fiscal year 2017 to more than $508 million in 2018. The system\u2019s projected losses will grow to $2 billion in 2019 from $1.1 billion in the current fiscal year, according to the state comptroller.\n\nHHC may need bigger subsidies from the city, posing a risk to the city\u2019s finances, Bleiwas said.\n\nAbout 80 percent of HHC\u2019s patients are on Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor, or are uninsured, according to HHC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a structurally balanced operation when a large segment of your customer base can\u2019t pay,\u201d Bleiwas said.\n\nLast year, HHC president and chief executive officer, Dr. Ram Raju released a \u2018Vision 2020\u2019 plan that proposes making up for the loss of government aid by growing its patient base. Raju wants to boost membership in MetroPlus, HHC\u2019s low-cost health-care plan, to 1 million and increase the number of New Yorkers served by city hospitals to 2 million annually. MetroPlus had about 476,000 patients as of Dec. 1, about 87 percent of them Medicaid patients.\n\n\u201cThey were counting on very ambitious growth in MetroPlus and it\u2019s not necessarily happening,\u201d said Charles Brecher, co-director of research for the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed watchdog, and long-time observer of the municipal hospital system.\n\nTo narrow projected operating losses in the current fiscal year, HHC planned on cutting 1,000 positions, a $100 million savings. Instead, staffing has risen to 49,313 employees in December, an increase of 907 from June, according to the comptroller\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cNYC Health + Hospitals is the largest provider of uninsured care in the city,\u201d Ian Michaels, an HHC spokesman, said in an e-mail. \u201cWe are working with the city, state and federal governments to ensure that we are adequately compensated for that care. \u201d\n\nTo bolster HHC\u2019s cash, the city has allowed the corporation to delay or forgo reimbursing the city for the cost of medical malpractice and debt service. Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s budget proposal calls for increasing the city\u2019s aid by $337 million and working with HHC on a restructuring plan.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Martin Z Braun", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-01/new-york-hospitals-must-restructure-finances-comptroller-says", "title": "New York Hospitals Must Restructure Finances, Comptroller Says", "description": "New York\u2019s public hospital system, the largest in the U.S., projects it will end the fiscal year with its lowest cash level in at least 15 years, and it\u2019s \u201cimperative\u201d that city officials come up with a plan to stabilize it, according to the state comptroller\u2019s office.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Martin Z Braun", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "New York", "news_keywords": "New York", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-01/new-york-hospitals-must-restructure-finances-comptroller-says", "parsely-title": "New York Hospitals Must Restructure Finances, Comptroller Says", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-03-01T14:38:50.722Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "New York\u2019s public hospital system, the largest in the U.S., projects it will end the fiscal year with its lowest cash level in at least 15 years, and it\u2019s \u201cimperative\u201d that city officials come up with a plan to stabilize it, according to the state comptroller\u2019s office.", "parsely-tags": "New York,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2016-03-01T14:38:50.722Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-01/new-york-hospitals-must-restructure-finances-comptroller-says", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "New York\u2019s public hospital system, the largest in the U.S., projects it will end the fiscal year with its lowest cash level in at least 15 years, and it\u2019s \u201cimperative\u201d that city officials come up with a plan to stabilize it, according to the state comptroller\u2019s office.", "title": "New York Hospitals Must Restructure Finances, Comptroller Says"}, "fb": {"status": "New York\u2019s public hospital system, the largest in the U.S., projects it will end the fiscal year with its lowest cash level in at least 15 years, and it\u2019s \u201cimperative\u201d that city officials come up with a plan to stabilize it, according to the state comptroller\u2019s office."}, "parsely-post-id": "O3CFDF6VDKHS01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s time for them to sit down and see how to restructure the operation,\u201d said Ken Bleiwas, deputy comptroller for the state of New York.\n\u201cWe are working with the city, state and federal governments to ensure that we are adequately compensated for that care.\nThe estimate was included in a report on New York City\u2019s finance issued by the state comptroller\u2019s office Monday.\nRaju wants to boost membership in MetroPlus, HHC\u2019s low-cost health-care plan, to 1 million and increase the number of New Yorkers served by city hospitals to 2 million annually.\nMeanwhile, the federal government is cutting payments to hospitals that care for a disproportionate number of poor patients, as part of the Affordable Care Act."}
