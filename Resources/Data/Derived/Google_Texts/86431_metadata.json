They're for all the usual services that those in her line of work provide to clients: bathing, house cleaning, meal preparation, toileting, transferring and prompting patients to take medication.\n\nBetts had seven different Medicaid customers, and this takes some juggling - you gotta budget that time. Or else just fudge the numbers on the bills you submit, which the U.S. Attorney's Office alleges that she did with jaw-dropping brazenness.\n\nAmong other things, the indictment charges that Betts:\n\n*Claimed to be with two or more different clients at the same time.\n\n*Claimed to provide services when clients actually were in the hospital.\n\n*Claimed to provide services when she was at her own medical appointments.\n\n*Claimed to provide services at different locations without any travel time between them.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Betts documented \"more than 750 work days that exceeded 24 hours, the highest of which totaled 39.5 hours.\" In all, she stands accused of defrauding Medicaid to the tune of $587,000. Betts faces 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine on each of the six counts that have been brought against her for health-care fraud.\n\nNo, trolls, this has nothing to do with Obamacare, shut up.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lending a helping hand in KCK. \n\n\nDoris Betts, a 54-year-old personal-care attendant in Kansas City, Kansas, has been submitting bills to Medica...", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "http://r2.pitch.com/files/base/scomm/kcp/image/2014/04/960w/1397090529_rsz_2554.jpg", "site_name": "Kansas City Pitch", "description": "Lending a helping hand in KCK. \n\n\nDoris Betts, a 54-year-old personal-care attendant in Kansas City, Kansas, has been submitting bills to Medica...", "title": "Astonishingly efficient Kansas personal-care attendant bills Medicaid for 39 hours in a single day"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "kc6h9aovh2ev_gwrAZgCxqsLmpdru1BedxO99dZpJVo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd03c2\"", "article_summary": "Doris Betts, a 54-year-old personal-care attendant in Kansas City, Kansas, has been submitting bills to Medicaid since 2008 for her services.\nBetts had seven different Medicaid customers, and this takes some juggling - you gotta budget that time.\nAmong other things, the indictment charges that Betts:*Claimed to be with two or more different clients at the same time.\n*Claimed to provide services when she was at her own medical appointments.\n*Claimed to provide services at different locations without any travel time between them."}
