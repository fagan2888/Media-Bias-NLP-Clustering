Associated Press\n\nChina is moving a drilling rig out of South China Sea waters claimed by both China and Vietnam, easing a two-month standoff that sparked deadly riots in Vietnam and tense encounters between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels.\n\nThe move could provide an opening for Beijing and Hanoi to repair relations and comes as the U.S. steps up criticism of China\u2019s efforts to enforce its claims to the strategically important sea. But China\u2019s government said its companies still had the right to explore the contested waters, raising the possibility that tensions could flare again.\n\nChina Oilfield Services, a unit of state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp., said its deep-water HYSY 981 drilling rig had completed exploration and drilling operations off Triton Island, or Zhongjian Island in Chinese. The island is part of the Paracel Islands chain, which is claimed by both China and Vietnam.\n\nA Vietnam coast guard official confirmed that the oil rig began moving on Tuesday night local time. Rear Adm. Ngo Ngoc Thu, vice commander of the Vietnam coast guard, said the Chinese vessels that had been accompanying the rig were also moving. He said Vietnam was keeping its vessels at the site and watching the oil rig\u2019s movement.\n\nChinese officials had previously said the rig\u2019s work would be completed by August. A spokeswoman for China Oilfield Services, or COSL, confirmed drilling work had been completed ahead of schedule and said the rig\u2019s new intended location, near China\u2019s southern island of Hainan, isn\u2019t in an area of dispute with other nations.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that Chinese companies were within their rights to undertake work around the Paracel Islands. It said it opposed interference by Vietnam and had taken \u201cnecessary measures to safeguard the safety of operations\u201d by COSL.\n\nTran Cong Truc, former chief of the Vietnamese government\u2019s border committee, said Vietnam would remain vigilant. \u201cChina\u2019s South China Sea policy is aggressive, so the withdrawal of the oil rig is only a tactic, a responsive measure they need to take right now.\u201d\n\nVietnam\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Le Hai Binh, said his country was determined to protect its sovereignty and demanded that China not move the oil rig back to \u201cparts of Vietnamese waters stipulated by the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.\u201d\n\nVietnam protested Chinese drilling in the area after it began in early May and had sent coast-guard vessels to confront the rig. Dozens of Chinese and Vietnamese maritime vessels had amassed near the disputed rig, with each side claiming its ships had been violently rammed by the other\u2019s.\n\nVisit wsj.com to read the full story.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "China is moving a drilling rig out of South China Sea waters claimed by both China and Vietnam, easing a two-month standoff that sparked deadly riots in Vietnam and tense encounters between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels.", "title": "China-Vietnam Tensions May Ease as Oil Rig Leaves Contested Waters", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/07/16/china-vietnam-tensions-may-ease-as-oil-rig-leaves-contested-waters/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "China-Vietnam Tensions May Ease as Oil Rig Leaves Contested Waters", "description": "China is moving a drilling rig out of South China Sea waters claimed by both China and Vietnam, easing a two-month standoff that sparked deadly riots in Vietnam and tense encounters between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Brian Spegele and Vu Trong Khanh", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "China is moving a drilling rig out of South China Sea waters claimed by both China and Vietnam, easing a two-month standoff that sparked deadly riots in Vietnam and tense encounters between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-16T21:02:15-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/07/16/china-vietnam-tensions-may-ease-as-oil-rig-leaves-contested-waters/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-930", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "China is moving a drilling rig out of South China Sea waters claimed by both China and Vietnam, easing a two-month standoff that sparked deadly riots in Vietnam and tense encounters between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels.", "title": "China-Vietnam Tensions May Ease as Oil Rig Leaves Contested Waters", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/07/16/china-vietnam-tensions-may-ease-as-oil-rig-leaves-contested-waters/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-930", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-16T21:07:17-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ec4\"", "article_summary": "In this file photo, the Haiyang Shiyou oil rig 981 is pictured in the South China Sea.\nA Vietnam coast guard official confirmed that the oil rig began moving on Tuesday night local time.\nBut China\u2019s government said its companies still had the right to explore the contested waters, raising the possibility that tensions could flare again.\nRear Adm.
