Isn\u2019t it funny that nobody is making such claims any more?\n\nNew York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote a few months into ObamaCare\u2019s first open enrollment period that \u201cWhat we have in California, then, is a proof of concept. Yes, ObamaCare is workable \u2014 in fact, done right, it works just fine.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that California is a proof of concept, but not in the way Krugman thought.\n\nAs Californians are discovering to their dismay, their state\u2019s ObamaCare program is a nightmare of technological glitches, bureaucratic ineptitude and overpriced plans that under-deliver care.\n\nDespite spending more than $1 billion in federal taxpayer grants to build it, the \u201cCovered California\u201d exchange gets an average one-star rating on the popular review site, Yelp. Customers complain about extreme hold times, wrong information, the inability to cancel or update plans, and so on. Among the comments:\n\n\u0095 \u201cI\u2019m all for the ACA but this website is a massive, stinking, pathetic example of governmental incompetence.\u201d\n\n\u0095 \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how many people are going to give up on getting insurance because of how bad this site is. It actually makes me sad.\n\n\u0095 \u201cObama you are alienating those who supported you. Come on I/we deserve better than this.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a two-part series by former CBS News investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson for the Daily Signal documents mismanagement, computer glitches, inflated enrollment numbers and attempts to silence whistleblowers. In one case, a family got 18 notices from Covered California in one day, 14 saying they were covered and four saying they weren\u2019t.\n\nSuch hassles might be tolerable if the product Californians are trying to buy is outstanding. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case, either.\n\nDespite projections that California\u2019s enrollment would grow by half a million this year \u2014 a 36% boost over last year \u2014 signups climbed only about 7,000 \u2014 or less than 0.5%. And the retention rate was just 65% of enrollees \u2014 far lower than the overall national average.\n\nCalifornia isn\u2019t the only state with disappointing enrollment figures this year. Overall ACA enrollment is well below government forecasts. So give Krugman credit for being right when he claimed that: \u201cIn California we can see what health reform will look like.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Reform: Back in 2013, ObamaCare supporters couldn't talk enough about how California was a showcase for how the law would succeed.
