A Pratt man is in critical condition after being shot by police Saturday evening.

Officers were called around 9 p.m. to a disturbance in the 1100 block of Stout Street. When they arrived 45-year-old Bradley Verstraete confronted them in the street according to the Pratt Police Department.

The report says Verstaete was carrying a hunting knife and an axe handle and started threatening officers. After he refused to obey the officer's commands, Verstraete was tazed.

Police say the tazer was not effective and the suspect charged at the officers, who then shot Verstaete.

Eyewitness Yadira Garcia-Pedroza heard who she says is Verstaete yelling at the officers. "We did hear them yelling back and forth, the guy was yelling at the cops, get off me, being really belligerent," she said, "it looked like the guy went at the cop and then we just heard the shots fired."

Verstaete was taken to a local hospital with critical injuries. Staff at Pratt Regional Medical Center are not releasing an update on his condition.

Garcia-Pedroza says she heard two gun shots. Pratt Police have not said where Verstaete was hit or how many times.

Both officers were placed on administrative leave, as the local police police mandates and the KBI is investigating.

Department of Corrections records show Verstaete has spent time in Kansas prisons since 1989, his first conviction being for burglary. He also has convictions of battery on a law enforcement officer and possession of narcotics.

He was paroled on the drug charge in September of 2011.
