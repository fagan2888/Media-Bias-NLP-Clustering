Alternatively, for example, certain trans men are unique among men for potentially needing cervical cancer screenings, but could be denied coverage if they had previously updated their medical records to reflect their authentic male gender.\n\nThe HHS guidelines also address other forms of sex-based discrimination, requiring insurers to cover all forms of female contraception and genetic testing for people with certain histories of breast or ovarian cancers.\n\nSuch previous holes in coverage, compounded by a poverty rate among trans populations that averages four to six times that of the cisgender population, have amplified health disparities faced by trans patients. With HHS's Monday announcement, insurers will now be required to cover any preventive treatment recommended by a patient's healthcare provider.\n\nWhile the decision is a much-needed affirmation to trans advocates that preventive care should be based on body parts rather than gender identity, the federal government has yet to demand that insurers cover all medically necessary transition-related care, including talk therapy, hormone therapy, and gender-affirming surgeries. Thus far, only New York, California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont have eliminated statewide barriers to trans-inclusive health insurance.\n\nObamacare has, however, made it illegal since 2013 for insurance companies to deny coverage to anyone for a \"pre-existing condition,\" including \"gender dysphoria\" \u2014 a clinical diagnosis received by many trans people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Preventive screenings and treatments should be based on body parts, not gender identity, say trans advocates \u2014 and the federal government agrees.", "og": {"image": "http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2015/05/11/Federal-Gov--Health-Insurers-Cannot-Deny-TransgenderX400.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-17T22:28:15-05:00", "type": "article", "title": "Federal Gov: Health Insurers Can't Deny Transgender Patients Preventive Care"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Advocate", "fb": {"page_id": 19799718480, "app_id": 625763650825412, "pages": 6030918854}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-11T20:27:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-11T20:27:48-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Federal Gov: No, Insurers Can't Deny Transgender Patients Preventive CarePreventive screenings and treatments should be based on body parts, not gender identity, say trans advocates \u2014 and the federal government agrees.\nWith HHS's Monday announcement, insurers will now be required to cover any preventive treatment recommended by a patient's healthcare provider.\nSuch previous holes in coverage, compounded by a poverty rate among trans populations that averages four to six times that of the cisgender population, have amplified health disparities faced by trans patients.\nThus far, only New York, California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont have eliminated statewide barriers to trans-inclusive health insurance.\nWhile the decision is a much-needed affirmation to trans advocates that preventive care should be based on body parts rather than gender identity, the federal government has yet to demand that insurers cover all medically necessary transition-related care, including talk therapy, hormone therapy, and gender-affirming surgeries."}
