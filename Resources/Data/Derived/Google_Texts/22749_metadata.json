There is a big footprint that comes with military strength and it warrants setting your foot very, very carefully and treading very gingerly when you are in a sensitive area,\u201d said Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia.\n\nAt the meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in the Myanmar capital, Naypyitaw, Washington will be proposing that South China Sea claimants take voluntary steps to reduce tensions. The U.S. suggests freezing actions that change the status quo, such as seizing unoccupied islands and land reclamation.\n\nChinese officials have already made clear they don\u2019t support the proposal. China says it has a historical right to most of the South China Sea and resents what it sees as U.S. meddling, viewing it as an attempt to contain its growing power. The other claimants include the Philippines, which is a U.S. treaty ally, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\nRussel said all the claimants, including Vietnam, can do more to clarify what they say is theirs in accordance with international law. He said the U.S. would also urge conclusion of a long-delayed code of conduct \u2014 another initiative China is unenthusiastic about.\n\nSeparately, while in the Myanmar, Kerry will be pressing the country\u2019s leaders to apply greater safeguards for human rights. Kerry will also be gauging the former pariah nation\u2019s preparations for 2015 elections, Russel said.\n\nLast week, more than 70 U.S. lawmakers warned of worsening conditions in Myanmar, also known as Burma, including anti-Muslim discrimination and violence, and urged the Obama administration to sanction those complicit in abuses and atrocities. The lawmakers also urged Obama not to make further concessions to the reformist government unless there\u2019s significant progress.\n\nAfter Myanmar, Kerry will travel to Australia to join Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Australian officials for security talks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The United States will be looking to calm tensions stoked by recent Chinese oil drilling in disputed waters of the South China Sea at an upcoming meeting of the region's foreign ministers, a senior U.S. official said Monday.", "pubdate": 20140804, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The United States will be looking to calm tensions stoked by recent Chinese oil drilling in disputed waters of the South China Sea at an upcoming meeting of the region's foreign ministers, a senior U.S. official said Monday.", "title": "U.S. seeks to quell South China Sea tensions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/495404811.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/us-seeks-quell-south-china-sea-tensions/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The United States will be looking to calm tensions stoked by recent Chinese oil drilling in disputed waters of the South China Sea at an upcoming meeting of the region's foreign ministers, a senior U.S. official said Monday.", "creator": "@newshour", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/495404811.jpg", "title": "U.S. seeks to quell South China Sea tensions", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "vietnam"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "china, oil, south china sea, vietnam"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7eae\"", "article_summary": "China says it has a historical right to most of the South China Sea and resents what it sees as U.S. meddling, viewing it as an attempt to contain its growing power.\nAt the meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in the Myanmar capital, Naypyitaw, Washington will be proposing that South China Sea claimants take voluntary steps to reduce tensions.\nAfter Myanmar, Kerry will travel to Australia to join Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Australian officials for security talks.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States will be looking to calm tensions stoked by recent Chinese oil drilling in disputed waters of the South China Sea at an upcoming meeting of the region\u2019s foreign ministers, a senior U.S. official said Monday.\nSeparately, while in the Myanmar, Kerry will be pressing the country\u2019s leaders to apply greater safeguards for human rights."}
