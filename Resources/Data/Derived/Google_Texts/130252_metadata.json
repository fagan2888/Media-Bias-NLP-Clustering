That\u2019s one shy of the NCAA record of seven, which occurred in the 1982-83 season.\n\nThe six teams that have been ranked No. 1 had already lost a combined 28 games entering Saturday\u2019s action.\n\nConsider that last season, the top four seeds entered the NCAA Tournament with a combined nine losses. This season, it\u2019s unlikely there will be a combination of any two top seeds with that few combined losses.\n\nIn other words, good luck filling out the bracket for your NCAA Tournament office pool next month.\n\nWe are living in a world, after all, where Texas Tech has toppled three ranked teams in as many games. Before they began that confounding run, the Red Raiders were just 3-7 in the Big 12.\n\nAlmost every college basketball season begins with a flurry of so-called upsets, when teams that probably should have been ranked higher heading into a season take down squads that were probably overrated to begin with. It\u2019s a feeling-out stage, but calm typically falls on top of the chaos, and by February some sense of order usually has been established.\n\nBut, as yet another wild Wednesday demonstrated, order in the 2015-16 men\u2019s college basketball season is nowhere to be found.\n\nStephan making mark. Few young basketball players grow up with lists of goals above their beds that include \u201cget a Division II scholarship,\u201d but perhaps they should.\n\nThose ranks the past few years have provided a great stage for prep players in this state to advance their careers.\n\nDerrick White, a lightly recruited player out of Legend High School who took off at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs, parlayed his success into an opportunity to transfer to Colorado, where he is expected to be a key piece for the Buffaloes next season. He is a late bloomer who eventually will play the sport professionally.\n\nThe latest player thriving on the Division II stage is Ryan Stephan, a 6-foot-10 senior at Colorado Mesa by way of Green Mountain High School in Lakewood.\n\nStephan entered the weekend averaging 25.5 points and 11.4 rebounds per game, third-best in D-II in each category.\n\nNext up for the versatile big man likely will be a professional career overseas.\n\nHe has already spent an offseason playing in an Australian league, and he continues to elevate his chances of making a living playing the game he loves.\n\nNow that sounds more like something that would be on that list of goals.\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516, nkosmider @denverpost.com or @nickkosmider\n\nUpdated Feb. 21, 2016 at 9:59 a.m.The following corrected information has been added to this article: Because of an error by a reporter, Ryan Stephan\u2019s high school was misreported.
