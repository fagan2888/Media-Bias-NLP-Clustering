That\u2019s a high enough ratio that presidential candidates are taking note on both sides of the aisle. Senator Bernie Sanders listed the statistic in a statement supporting mandated CEO disclosure of salaries, and CEO Trump himself declared that the numbers were \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\nHowever, even on a topic where a democratic socialist and a real estate mogul agree, it turns out that there\u2019s always a devil\u2019s advocate. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon proposed an interesting hypothesis on a recent \u201cMeet the Press\u201c: lowering executive pay won\u2019t fix our nation\u2019s staggering income inequality.\n\n\u201cIf you took all the compensation of all the CEOs of the top 500 companies in America, it wouldn\u2019t make a dent in the problem,\u201d he said.\n\nLike two ships passing each other in the night, this neatly parallels another recent CEO wage moment. In April, Dan Price of Gravity Payments announced that everyone in his 120-person company\u2014from the lowest-paid clerk on up\u2014would receive a minimum salary of $70,000. In part, he achieved this by cutting his own $1 million salary to $70,000.\n\nArguably, this made a pretty large dent in the problem for the 119 other people who work at Gravity Payments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jamie Dimon says lowering executive pay won't fix income inequality.
