PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving will not play Saturday night against the Trail Blazers as the team eases him back from injury.

Irving made his season debut this week after being sidelined for six months with a broken left kneecap suffered in the NBA Finals. The Cavs are being cautious with Irving, who played 26 minutes in the team’s Christmas Day loss at Golden State. Irving isn’t ready to play back-to-back games yet.

Irving’s playing time has been restricted so far. He is slowly building up his minutes as he improves his strength and conditioning. He scored 13 points on 4-of-15 shooting in the 89-83 loss to the Warriors.

The 23-year-old is averaging 10 points on 29.4 percent. Irving could sit again on the road trip as the Cavs play in Denver on Tuesday following a matchup in Phoenix on Monday.
