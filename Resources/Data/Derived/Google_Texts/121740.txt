Republican Ken Cuccinelli told his supporters Tuesday that he thinks he would have won the Virginia gubernatorial race had Virginians been exposed just a little bit more to the “truth” of Obamacare before they voted.

Cuccinelli narrowly lost the contest last week to former Democratic National Committee Chairman and moneyman Terry McAuliffe. In the closing days of the campaign, the Republican attorney general in Virginia essentially framed the race as a referendum on President Barack Obama’s unpopular health-care law, which has been rocked by a messy roll out over the last month.

“Perhaps my greatest disappointment in this year’s race is simply that the truth wasn’t enough,” Cuccinelli wrote on his Facebook page Tuesday. “I know that sounds simple, and there’s a lot more to campaigns than being substantively better than the other side, but I’ve always trusted that truth counts for something… a lot actually.”

“In fact, I think just a few more days of the truth of ObamaCare raining down on Virginians would have done the trick,” Cuccinelli added. “But it was not to be, at least not for us, not in 2013.”

Cuccinelli promised to go into more detail about the election at a later date.

“While I will have more to say about the election later, I didn’t want too much time to go by without saying a heartfelt ‘thank you’ to all of you that did so much to help me fight to win this year’s governor’s race,” he wrote.
