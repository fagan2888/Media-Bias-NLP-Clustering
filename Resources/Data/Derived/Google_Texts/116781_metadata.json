Cool Cool Cool.\u201d\n\nThis was probably the reaction of the majority of fans of NBC\u2019s genre-breaking \u201cCommunity\u201d when they learned that their sitcom had been rescued from the maw of cancellation by a last-minute deal between Sony and Yahoo, paving the way for a sixth season of the show with a relatively small but famously dedicated audience.\n\nFor many, this was just another surprising \u201cup\u201d in the lifespan of a television show that has had more ups and dramatic downs than a world-class rollercoaster. This is a show that had threats of cancelation leveled its way since its first season, had constant behind-the-scenes drama that drew nearly as much attention as its episodes, that fired creator Dan Harmon and then had him come back once ratings and quality started to drop. That\u2019s not even counting the departure of Chevy Chase or key actor Donald Glover, who left to pursue a rap career, among other things.\n\nRelated: Did Game of Thrones Just Kill the Multiplex?\n\nStill, that hasn\u2019t stopped excited fans from hopping onto Twitter to express their excitement and their relief at the show\u2019s salvation, as well as their surprise that it was Yahoo \u2014 not Netflix or Hulu \u2014 that pulled the show out of the fire.\n\nThis is exactly the reaction Yahoo wanted.\n\nEven though Marissa Mayer has made clear her intentions of becoming a powerhouse in online video \u2014 the Yahoo Screen service holds the rights to a trove of Saturday Night Live clips as well as a Ben Stiller-produced dating show parody that is, by all accounts, very funny \u2014 it still lacked a show that is guaranteed to pull in a dedicated audience and make a wider viewership aware of the fact that they do original video.\n\nThe average \u201cCommunity\u201d viewer is demographic gold. As Harmon himself said when old episodes of the show were picked up by Hulu, \u201cThe most coveted demographic, and most coveted of that demographic, these very smart, upwardly mobile, college-age kids just don\u2019t watch TV anymore.\u201d\n\nRelated: Marissa Mayer\u2019s Yahoo, A Surprise Wall Street Darling\n\nYahoo\u2019s acquisition of the show, spurred on by the app it has provided to Android and iOS devices, could prove that the show draws just those coveted viewers. The use of web analytics rather than Nielsen boxes, which tend to skew more towards households and families rather than single college students, could also have a significant impact on the show\u2019s audience data.\n\nThere\u2019s even more in this for Yahoo. \u201cCommunity\u201d is, by its very nature, a show that breaks convention. Starting in the mold of a stereotypical situational comedy, it has taken on its own particular brand of meta-humor that simultaneously embraces the sitcom format and thumbs its nose at it, parodying every genre from action blockbuster to history documentary. It\u2019s quirky and funny, but most of all, it\u2019s experimental.\n\nHBO used \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to become known for skin and gore. Netflix used \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d to become known for character-based slow burners. By cementing \u201cCommunity\u201d as a cornerstone of its lineup, Yahoo could become a home base for experimental, clever comedies. \"Our hope is to build and extend and prolong the series beyond the upcoming season six,\u201d said Yahoo CMO Kathy Savitt in an interview with Vulture.\n\nRelated: House of Cards, The New Media Crack for Netflix Addicts\n\nThat all remains to be seen, though. The series has no announced date, and so far details are minimal.
