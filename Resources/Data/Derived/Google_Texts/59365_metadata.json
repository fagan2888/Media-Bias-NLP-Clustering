And the entire state of Texas filed suit against the agency, claiming that the EEOC\u2019s stance unlawfully limits the ability of employers to exclude convicted felons from the workforce.\n\nWill the EEOC back down in 2014? Unlikely, says Holland.\n\nIf anything, the agency may increase pressure on businesses to show that background checks are job related and that firms don\u2019t exclude candidates with certain convictions.\n\nSupreme Court rulings\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act and repealed the 30-year-old FSA use-it-or-lose-it rule.\n\nThis year, HR pros can look forward to rulings in these cases:\n\nThe Supreme Court will determine if President Obama overstepped his powers when he appointed members to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) during a Senate break last year.\n\nThe NLRB has remained active while the issue has wound its way through the courts.\n\nIn fact, there have been over 600 board decisions since Obama made the appointments.\n\nDepending on the ruling, the justices may find that the NLRB has had no authority to be active this whole time \u2013 and those 600-plus rulings may be rescinded. (NLRB v. Canning)\n\nThe NLRB has remained active while the issue has wound its way through the courts. In fact, there have been over 600 board decisions since Obama made the appointments. Depending on the ruling, the justices may find that the NLRB has had no authority to be active this whole time \u2013 and those 600-plus rulings may be rescinded. (NLRB v. Canning) The High Court will also render a decision on the healthcare reform requirement that firms offer insurance coverage for birth control without a co-pay.\n\nPrivate companies say they can refuse to do so on the claim it violates their religious beliefs. (Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius)\n\nPrivate companies say they can refuse to do so on the claim it violates their religious beliefs. (Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius) Finally, the Court will consider what qualifies as \u201cchanging clothes\u201d under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nThe case may finally clarify when firms have to pay staff for putting on and taking off safety gear at the beginning and end of work shifts. (Sandifer v. U.S. Steel Corp.)\n\nMedical marijuana\n\nIllinois recently became the 20th state (along with the District of Columbia) to legalize marijuana for medical use \u2013 and it definitely won\u2019t be the last.\n\nIf you\u2019re like most companies, you\u2019ve already got a drug and alcohol use policy, and the changes in marijuana regs for certain states won\u2019t change its effectiveness.\n\nAt the same time, you may want to revise your policy if you\u2019re in one of the 18 states where marijuana use has been legalized. (Here\u2019s a full list.)\n\nIf you do update your policy, make it clear that despite the expansion of people\u2019s rights outside the workplace, your company still prohibits its use and can do so legally.\n\nYou should also communicate that to staff \u2014 just so no one tries to test the policy\u2019s legality.\n\nIf you\u2019re not in a state that\u2019s approved medical marijuana use, keep an eye on your state legislations to see if medical marijuana is gaining support.\n\nHealthcare reform\n\nYou knew this was coming.\n\nNo two ways about it: Healthcare reform is going to be HR\u2019s biggest headache moving forward. In fact, all other topics of concern cower in the face of the ongoing struggles companies will face with reform next year. Holland notes that:\n\nUncertainty about how the Affordable Care Act will unfold is creating havoc for employers. It\u2019s possible that executive orders will unilaterally change the directives being debated, that more provisions will be postponed or changed \u2014 or that the ACA will simply implode under its own weight.\n\nThis ambiguity will overshadow every other employment issue in 2014.\n\nYes, the employer mandate to provide reform-compatible health insurance was pushed back to 2015, giving companies an extra year to prepare.\n\nBut 2014 will still see a number of major regs taking effect, including:\n\nthe 90-day max waiting period for health insurance coverage\n\nelimination of annual dollar limits on \u201cessential benefits\u201d\n\nthe elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions, and\n\nadditions to the Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) statements.\n\nThe feds have also announced they\u2019ll be auditing employers\u2019 plans for health reform compliance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This year was no walk in the park for HR pros -- and there looks to be plenty to keep everyone busy in the coming year.", "og": {"description": "This year was no walk in the park for HR pros \u2014 and there looks to be plenty to keep everyone busy in the coming year.", "title": "What can HR expect in 2014?
