On Tuesday, Democrats used the filibuster to stop a bill that would fund the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 and roll back President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration policies \u2014 dead in its tracks.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDemocrats\u2019 relationship with the filibuster had been on the rocks when they ran the Senate, a time when the GOP regularly used the procedural weapon to disrupt the majority\u2019s agenda. Democrats responded by gutting the filibuster on nominations, making \u201cRepublican obstruction\u201d a go-to explanation for the Senate\u2019s gridlock and complaining bitterly when the GOP minority blocked debate from even opening on bills.\n\nThen came Tuesday\u2019s 51-48 vote blocking the DHS bill. This was the first time a Democratic minority had blocked a bill from coming to the floor for debate since Aug. 3, 2006, when Democrats stifled legislation that would have raised the minimum wage and decreased the estate tax.\n\nCasual Senate watchers could be forgiven for thinking that Democrats and Republicans had simply exchanged talking points after the 2014 election. Now in the majority, Republicans are the ones accusing the minority of keeping the Senate from getting things done.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re refusing to debate a bill they\u2019d like to change,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said of the Democrats. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s rather an, honestly, absurd position. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to come out here and make that argument with you all, because I think it\u2019s a pretty hard argument to make with a straight face.\u201d\n\nMcConnell, who had made countless procedural arguments against Democratic legislation during his stewardship of the minority, said Democrats instead should allow debate on the bill and offer amendments.\n\nMore filibusters may come in a matter of days if Republicans follow through on their threats to make Democrats repeatedly reject the DHS-immigration proposal. It appears Democrats will block any attempt to bring a DHS funding bill with riders to the floor.\n\nDemocrats have always supported keeping the filibuster for legislation, leaving it in place even when they gutted the 60-vote threshold on executive branch nominations in 2013. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) set out this year prepared to use the procedural tool to parry aside legislation that his caucus broadly opposed \u2014 and the DHS and its immigration policies fit the bill perfectly.\n\n\u201cThis funding bill for Homeland Security should not be held hostage for immigration,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, a Democratic leader. \u201cWe\u2019re being straight up.\u201d\n\nUse of the filibuster \u2014 which allows individual members to require 60 votes to begin and end debate \u2014 is something Democrats often criticized when they were in the majority just two months ago. In tandem with demanding votes on amendments, Republicans routinely used procedural tools to block legislation, elevating their use of the tactic to historic levels.\n\n\u201cSo often in the last Congress we were accused of not being ready to end the debate,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). \u201cBut we were seldom accused of not starting the debate.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the previous Congress\u2019 Democratic Senate majority was incensed by the myriad occasions when Republicans blocked debate from starting on legislation. They were particularly offended when the GOP demanded amendments, then prevented debate from starting on the underlying bill, including with legislation on intelligence reform or pay equity. Bills can\u2019t be amended if the floor debate can\u2019t start.\n\nEven after Reid vowed to open the amendment process on the intelligence bill last December, the GOP stuffed it, prompting Reid to lash out at Republicans who \u201cwouldn\u2019t even let the Senate debate the legislation.\u201d In April, when a pay equity bill failed to make it to the floor, Reid said he was \u201cat a loss as to why anyone would decline to debate such an important issue.\u201d\n\nOf Tuesday\u2019s Democratic filibuster, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) fumed that \u201cDemocrats never blush. They always do whatever is convenient at the time.\u201d\n\nThe bill, which would fund Jeh Johnson's Department of Homeland Security, was the first that a Democratic minority had blocked from coming to the floor for debate since Aug. 3, 2006.\n\nBut Democrats argued that their vote Tuesday is not equivalent to Republicans\u2019 routine practice of halting legislation and stalling nominations over the past eight years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been crystal clear from Day One that we will fight bills we oppose,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Reid. \u201cThe difference between Democrats and Republicans is that Democrats won\u2019t filibuster every bill regardless of the merit. Republicans would\u2019ve filibustered a motion to blow your nose.\u201d\n\nReid has called his minority \u201cconstructive\u201d after Democrats allowed speedy votes on terrorism risk insurance legislation and veterans\u2019 suicide prevention this year, following now-retired Sen. Tom Coburn\u2019s (R-Okla.) successful blockade against both widely supported measures last year. But Democrats also made Republicans walk through procedural hoops on the Keystone XL oil pipeline, blocking Republicans from finishing the bill last week until Democrats received more amendment votes.\n\nDemocrats view the DHS bill as a must-pass funding bill that\u2019s combined with hard-line immigration policies. Why, they ask, would they agree to debate two issues that shouldn\u2019t be mixed together?\n\nAsked if his caucus had ever considered allowing the Senate to debate the DHS bill, Reid responded: \u201cIf they want to debate immigration starting tomorrow, let\u2019s do it tomorrow. But not at the express determination of the Republicans to hold hostage \u2026 the Homeland Security bill.\u201d\n\nThis logic did not sink in with GOP leaders.\n\n\u201cHow \u2019bout that? Go figure. It\u2019s kind of an ironic twist of this whole thing that they won\u2019t let us get on the bill,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). \u201cI hope you guys will reprint all that stuff\u201d Democrats said last Congress, he added.\n\nReid and his caucus spent several days last week debating how to handle the DHS bill. They could allow the bill to come to the floor and then demand a vote on their own, \u201cclean\u201d funding amendment with no riders. But that would have given McConnell control over the DHS bill, and Democrats do not believe he intends to allow an opportunity to strip out the immigration language. Even voting to advance the bill to the floor could give the appearance of Democratic support for the immigration riders, particularly to those unfamiliar with the Senate\u2019s procedural jujitsu.\n\nLate last week, Democrats arrived at their unanimous decision to block the House\u2019s GOP bill and instead demand a vote on their separate, clean bill, which was introduced by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). Even the half-dozen Democrats who had publicly questioned Obama\u2019s actions on immigration were on board.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to play games on DHS funding,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a critic of the immigration action last year. \u201cWe just need a clean vote, straight up.\u201d\n\nSenators and aides declined to speculate on how often Democrats are prepared to block legislation from even seeing the floor, beyond any iteration of a DHS bill with immigration riders. Legislation repealing the Affordable Care Act would probably meet the same fate, no matter how much Democrats want to debate health care.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to use it,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said of the filibuster.\n\nDemocratic leaders and rank-and-file senators roundly dismissed charges that Democrats are beginning to resemble the Republican minority they so reviled. They said their goal isn\u2019t to mess with McConnell, but they will follow through on Reid\u2019s pledge to block \u201ccrazy stuff.\u201d\n\nRepublicans \u201cgot together saying: \u2018All things Obama we\u2019re going to block and do all [we] can so he doesn\u2019t win.\u2019 We\u2019re doing nothing like that,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a meeting saying: \u2018How do we stop McConnell from getting anything done?\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Party leaders change their tune now that they are in the minority.", "title": "Democrats learn to love the filibuster", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/senate-democrats-filibuster-114888.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/03/150203_chuck_schumer_harry_reid_msm_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Jeff Sessions,Harry Reid,White House,Patty Murray,Barack Obama,Senate,Chuck Schumer,Department Of Homeland Security,Mitch McConnell,Senate Democrats,John Thune,Roy Blunt,Joe Manchin", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Party leaders change their tune now that they are in the minority.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe279e\"", "article_summary": "Senate Democrats are falling back in love with the filibuster.\n\u201cThe difference between Democrats and Republicans is that Democrats won\u2019t filibuster every bill regardless of the merit.\nDemocrats view the DHS bill as a must-pass funding bill that\u2019s combined with hard-line immigration policies.\n\u201cThey\u2019re refusing to debate a bill they\u2019d like to change,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said of the Democrats.\nCasual Senate watchers could be forgiven for thinking that Democrats and Republicans had simply exchanged talking points after the 2014 election."}
