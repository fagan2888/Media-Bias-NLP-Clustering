Another started the bandsaw. Then they broke down the hundreds of chickens they had slaughtered that morning \u2014 slicing skin, cutting bone, weighing wings.\n\nThe workers at this meat-processing shop, part of the Northeast Regional Corrections Center, are inmates. Some state lawmakers hope they will become the next generation of butchers.\n\nUnder a bill introduced this month at the Legislature, work shifts at this minimum-security facility would become a formal curriculum, training the men for jobs in meat processing after they\u2019re out. New workers are needed in the industry, some experts say, as the demand for local meat grows and the owners of slaughterhouses and butcher shops grow old.\n\nTwo-thirds of the owners of Minnesota\u2019s small meat-processing facilities are at or near retirement age, according to a recent survey by the Agricultural Utilization Research Institute. Just one-third have succession plans, the survey shows.\n\nShawn Wirta, right, and Zach Malich, inmates at the Northeast Regional Corrections Center near Duluth, butchered chickens.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need to take some action here and make sure that we don\u2019t lose this vital part of the agricultural infrastructure,\u201d said Paul Hugunin, with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.\n\nEach year, about 600 men serve short sentences at the Saginaw corrections center, a work farm started in the 1930s that sits on 3,200 acres north of Duluth. They grow hay on about 400 acres. They plant potatoes, corn and carrots. They raise chickens, turkeys and pigs.\n\nThe inmates eat much of the meat for lunch and dinner, but the facility also butchers animals for farmers, for a fee.\n\nThe idea of a formal training program sprang from Rep. Jason Metsa, DFL-Virginia, who was trying to think of \u201ccreative ways to attract more farmers to our area.\u201d He\u2019s pairing the pilot program with the corrections center\u2019s request for a new $1.2 million food-processing building \u2014 pitching a USDA-inspected facility as the answer to local farmers\u2019 laments about a lack of meat-processing spots in northeastern Minnesota.\n\nKeith Nelson, a St. Louis County commissioner, told the House Agriculture Policy Committee last week that some producers in his district have to travel 250 miles round-trip to have their chickens readied for sale.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of us around that could gain a great deal of value from such an operation,\u201d said Nelson, a beef farmer who serves on the correction center\u2019s board.\n\nPhysical work\n\nKnives, regulations and a map of the Czech Republic hang in Jasek\u2019s office in the meat-processing plant. After growing up there, in a village of 300 people, Jasek traveled by bus and train for hours each day to study meat processing, part of a three-year degree.\n\nIn Minnesota, there is no such educational program for butchers and meat cutters \u2014 who, on average, make $18.53 an hour, according to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. One in Pipestone shut down. But the University of Minnesota offers a broader meat-science degree.\n\nJasek, a St. Louis County employee, assigns the inmates simple tasks, he said. Some stay only a few weeks. Others he can train more thoroughly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard work,\u201d he said, folding his broad-knuckled hands. \u201cPhysically demanding work.\u201d\n\nPartly because of those demands, it\u2019s tough to find skilled help, said Mike Lorentz, chief executive of Lorentz Meats, a meat processing plant in Cannon Falls that specializes in organic and high-end protein. So he\u2019s glad the proposal is raising the issue.\n\nThe meat-processing industry is diverse \u2014 ranging from small retail shops to Hormel Foods\u2019 plants \u2014 so the training varies, too, Lorentz said. Working at an urban butcher shop might require wine-pairing knowledge, he said, while at Hormel, an employee might do a single cut all day long.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s harder to train people up,\u201d said Lorentz, whose 30,000-square-foot facility employees 90 people. \u201cThe challenge with the bill is, who are you helping?\u201d\n\nRise of local meat\n\nAt the farmers market in Grand Rapids, Jane Grimsbo Jewett sells beef, pork and chicken. But beforehand, her cows and pigs must travel to a meat processor in Foley, \u2014 a 115-mile drive each way. The chickens trek to a processor 75 miles away.\n\nJake Truong enjoyed a cup of coffee and fresh roast chicken during his break. Truong is among the inmates learning to butcher.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s costly in terms of fuel and time,\u201d Grimsbo Jewett said.\n\nBut Grimsbo Jewett, a research fellow at the Minnesota Institute for Sustainable Agriculture, knows that building and upgrading meat processing facilities is costly, too. \u201cA lot were built in the 1950s \u2014 or even earlier \u2014 and requirements have changed a lot,\u201d she said.\n\nAbout 41 percent of Minnesota\u2019s small processing facilities have clocked more than 50 years, the survey by the Agricultural Utilization Research Institute shows. The Department of Agriculture offers grants to processors to buy new equipment or expand or upgrade their facilities, Hugunin said.\n\nSoutheastern Minnesota offers farmers \u201cpretty good\u201d options for meat processing, said Jan Joannides, executive director of Renewing the Countryside, a nonprofit. But in northeastern Minnesota, \u201cthere are real gaps in terms of availability.\u201d\n\nIn particular, there are few USDA-inspected facilities, \u201cthe gold standard,\u201d as Joannides put it. That inspection allows the meat to be sold in other states. Facilities inspected by state employees according to federal standards can sell to grocery stores and at farmers markets, just not across state lines.\n\nThere are few of either in northeastern Minnesota, said Jennifer Stephes, meat inspection supervisor for the Department of Agriculture. Her office has heard from farmers and local producers there looking for closer options.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this growing interest among the public and among policymakers in having more local foods,\u201d Joannides said. \u201cThere are farmers out there willing to do it. But oftentimes it\u2019s the middle part that\u2019s a bottleneck.\u201d\n\nA lack of inspectors might be contributing to the problem, Grimsbo Jewett said. Gov. Mark Dayton\u2019s budget calls for five more meat inspectors, an increase of $250,000, citing \u201ca significant increase in requests for inspections in the past six months.\u201d\n\nInmates used rubber stamps to identify the different cuts of meats they process.\n\n\u2018Young and dumb\u2019 to \u2018solid\u2019\n\nDuring a midafternoon break, the men gathered in the room with the smoker, opening its door to grab a few browned birds. They spread them on a sheet of butcher\u2019s paper, sliced them open and dug in.\n\nThey paired the chicken with dark coffee, drunk from white mugs scrawled with their names and nicknames. Shawn Wirta\u2019s mug says, \u201cBOSS.\u201d\n\nWirta was 17 years old and drunk when he crashed his grandparent\u2019s Buick, hitting a car turning into a driveway on Arrowhead Road in Duluth. A passenger in that car, a 22-year-old man, flew through the back window and died.\n\n\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Wirta said last week, shaking his head.\n\nHe came to this work farm in Saginaw a \u201cyoung and dumb\u201d kid. But 18 months of meat processing taught him about hard work. \u201cWhen I came out of here at 19 years old, I was solid,\u201d he said. \u201cI got out of here wanting to work. It fills up your day, it takes up your time, it keeps you out of trouble.\u201d\n\nWirta nabbed a job as a butcher, after \u201cshowing them what I could do,\u201d he said. He skinned hogs for a season, moving on to sausage making. \u201cI could pretty much cut up any animal you want me to cut up.\u201d\n\nHe was sent back to Saginaw for leaving the state, not allowed under his probation. In a month, when he\u2019s released and his probation ends, Wirta plans to spend time with his 3-year-old daughter, who visits him here twice a week. Then he\u2019ll head back to his farm in Florida, where he raises goats and chickens.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill would make prison work a formal training program.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Bill would make prison work a formal training program.", "title": "Inmates to butchers: Bill would create meat processing program", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/inmates-to-butchers-bill-would-create-meat-processing-program/297953831/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142768352248098.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142768352248098.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bill would make prison work a formal training program.", "title": "Inmates to butchers: Bill would create meat processing program", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/inmates-to-butchers-bill-would-create-meat-processing-program/297953831/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142768352248098.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142768352248098.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "article": {"tag": "inmates"}, "news_keywords": "butcher shop,Legislature,butcher,Saginaw,inmates"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfda7\"", "article_summary": "Gallery: Zach Malich left and Mike Monchamp inmates at the Northeast Regional Corrections Center enjoyed fresh roast chicken during their break.\nInmates at the Northeast Regional Corrections Center butcher chickens and pigs mostly to eat later in the week for lunch.\nThe workers at this meat-processing shop, part of the Northeast Regional Corrections Center, are inmates.\nGallery: Shawn Wirta an inmate at the Northeast Regional Corrections Center cut chickens with and band saw.\nGallery: Zach Malich an inmate at the Northeast Regional Corrections Center gathered chickens from the freezer to be butchered."}
