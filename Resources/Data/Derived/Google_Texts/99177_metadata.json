That is the lowest hanging fruit,\" he said to applause from employees at Rice Energy, Inc., in Canonsburg.\n\nIt's a position that's part of his regular stump speech and puts him in line with many in his party, but it's squarely in opposition to who he describes as \"radical environmentalists.\"\n\nOpponents of the project cite environmental concerns and worries about the impact on tribal communities near the pipeline, but proponents, like Bush, say that the finished project would create thousands of jobs and contribute to economic output.\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush will call for lighter regulation of the energy sector and for more local control of natural resources when he delivers his energy plan Tuesday.", "pubdate": "2015-09-29T04:07:32Z", "author": "Ashley Killough, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Jeb Bush will call for lighter regulation of the energy sector and for more local control of natural resources when he delivers his energy plan Tuesday.", "pubdate": "2015-09-29T04:07:32Z", "title": "Jeb Bush praises capitalism in making energy pitch", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/29/politics/jeb-bush-energy-plan-pittsburgh/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150921204615-jeb-bush-september-18-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150921204615-jeb-bush-september-18-large-169.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid-vls-col,col-jeb-bush", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/29/politics/jeb-bush-energy-plan-pittsburgh/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Jeb Bush praises capitalism in making energy pitch - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2015-09-29T23:41:49Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff73\"", "article_summary": "The quickest boost to the economy, he argued, would be approving the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\"As president, I would approve the XL pipeline, for crying out loud.\nThe former Florida governor, making his case at an oil and natural gas company in western Pennsylvania, also called for more local control of natural resources.\nThat is the lowest hanging fruit,\" he said to applause from employees at Rice Energy, Inc., in Canonsburg.\nOpponents of the project cite environmental concerns and worries about the impact on tribal communities near the pipeline, but proponents, like Bush, say that the finished project would create thousands of jobs and contribute to economic output."}
