Northcrest Baptist Church in Meridian has kicked off its annual “Love Out Loud” week in Dumont Plaza.

This week marks with third year of the event. Members of Northcrest along with volunteers from other churches will be out in the community doing everything from cleaning schools, helping the boys and girls club to conducting random acts of kindness. Jamie Castle says putting forth an effort to make where we live a better place, while at the same time, spreading the word of God, is important.

“We decided that we needed to do something in our own city to show the people here that we love them. It’s great to go out of the country for a week, but if you can some in your own city, this is our mission build,” Northcrest Committee Missions member Jamie Castle explains. “This is where people need to know that we love them and that Jesus loves them.”

If you would like to help out this week, members will meet in the student building at Northcrest Church every morning before heading out.
