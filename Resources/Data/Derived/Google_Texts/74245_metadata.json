Never has that been truer than in Doug Burgum's most recent ads, in which he states that endorsed Republican candidate for governor Wayne Stenehjem favors the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. Not only did Stenehjem as our attorney general join with many other states early on to oppose Obamacare, he has long opposed its violations of states' rights.\n\nKing v. Burwell was a long-odds case to try to kill the ACA by limiting premium subsidies to only those getting their health insurance through a state-based exchange. Because North Dakota, along with most other states, uses the federal exchange, the lawsuit's success would have meant that nearly 16,000 lower income and young North Dakota policyholders would have lost their insurance premium subsidies.\n\nObamacare requires that everyone buy insurance, and this suit would have taken away the subsidies. Though Stenehjem is opposed to Obamacare, he recognized the hardship that this lawsuit would have placed on many North Dakotans, and he fought to prevent that from happening. The Supreme Court agreed with this reasoning and ruled that subsidies should be available to all citizens, regardless of whether they were getting their insurance through a state-based exchange or the federal exchange.\n\nUsing the logic of Burgum's ad, Burgum is against North Dakota residents getting the same insurance premium subsidies that other states' residents get.\n\nDon't be fooled by the slick and expensive 30-second ads providing misleading information. Please join me in supporting the facts and voting for Wayne Stenehjem for governor.\n\nJudy Lee\n\nWest Fargo\n\nLee, a Republican, represents District 13 in the North Dakota Senate.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "opinion,letters,doug burgum,Wayne Stenehjem,Obamacare,North Dakota governors race,elections 2016", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Grand Forks Herald", "description": "\"A public opinion is no substitute for thought,\" stated Warren Buffett.
