Doug, I appreciate it, but I think we both know there\u2019s no widespread panic across the country,\u201d Smith said before turning to face the camera. \u201cBut I think we know that. And I think we also know that if there\u2019s widespread panic, it\u2019s not based in fact and it\u2019s not based in reason. And I think more than anything, those are just words that people on TV sometimes use.\u201d\n\n-RELATED: Concha: Fear, Mystery and Speculation Means Ebola Coverage Could Reach O.J.

Other Ebola patients in the U.S. contracted the disease while abroad and have also been treated.\n\nWatch via Fox News:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[Photo via Fox News/screen grab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Eddie Scarry (@eScarry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fox News anchor Shepard Smith on Wednesday lit into the news media for what he described as unproductive coverage of the Ebola cases that have been found and", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shepard-Smith-1.jpg", "title": "Shep Smith Excoriates Media for Ebola Coverage: \u2018Not Worth the Ratings\u2019"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shepard-Smith-1.jpg", "title": "Shep Smith Excoriates Media for Ebola Coverage: 'Not Worth the Ratings'", "description": "Fox News anchor Shepard Smith on Wednesday lit into the news media for what he described as unproductive coverage of the Ebola cases that have been found and treated in the U.S.", "card": "summary", "site": "@mediaite"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "keywords": "tv", "date": "2014-10-15T15:42:38+00:00", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15d8\"", "article_summary": "And I think more than anything, those are just words that people on TV sometimes use.\u201d-RELATED: Concha: Fear, Mystery and Speculation Means Ebola Coverage Could Reach O.J.\nDoug, I appreciate it, but I think we both know there\u2019s no widespread panic across the country,\u201d Smith said before turning to face the camera.\nAnd I think we also know that if there\u2019s widespread panic, it\u2019s not based in fact and it\u2019s not based in reason.\nOther Ebola patients in the U.S. contracted the disease while abroad and have also been treated.\n\u201cBut I think we know that."}
