They offered a five-year deal to receiver Demaryius Thomas, an NFL source said Friday, and have initiated talks with tight end Julius Thomas although no formal offer has been presented.\n\n\u201cI definitely would be open to working something out with the Denver Broncos,\u201d Julius Thomas said Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand how these things work. I\u2019ll let Frank (Bauer, his agent) and Mr. (John) Elway take care of it.\u201d\n\nElway, the Broncos\u2019 general manager, told The Post earlier this week that he wanted to secure deals with both players before training camp begins next month. The Broncos addressed their defense this offseason, and with the draft picks signed, Thomas and Thomas have become their top targets. They will become free agents at season\u2019s end, making this a preemptive strike similar to the method used to lock up left tackle Ryan Clady.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do anything once training camp starts. They\u2019re both in their last years, and we\u2019d like for them to stay and be Broncos for a long time,\u201d Elway said.\n\nThe Broncos drafted Demaryius Thomas in the first round in 2010 despite his limited r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as part of Georgia Tech\u2019s wishbone offense. He has evolved into one of the game\u2019s elite, catching 186 passes for 2,864 yards and 24 touchdowns the past two seasons.\n\nDemaryius told The Post this week that his focus remains \u201con winning championships. Nothing else.\u201d CBS4 first reported the Broncos\u2019 offer to Demaryius.\n\nThomas, who is making $3.27 million this season, stands in line for a huge boost. Seven NFL receivers have contracts with an average annual value of at least $10 million, including Detroit\u2019s Calvin Johnson and Miami\u2019s Mike Wallace. If no deal is worked out, the Broncos could place the franchise tag on Thomas after the season, which would be roughly $12.3 million.\n\nJulius Thomas, who has a $645,000 salary this season, was a fourth-round draft pick in 2011. He enjoyed a breakout season in his third season, and would be looking at a $7 million annual average, based on comparables.\n\nTroy E.
