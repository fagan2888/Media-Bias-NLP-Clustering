It includes cutting regulations, eliminating programs like the Affordable Care Act, and paring back food stamps, which he includes among the \"costly programs...paying people not to work.\" (His citation for this description of the food stamp program links to a publication of the Heritage Foundation, which has received funding from Koch family foundations. This is undisclosed in the USA Today article.)\n\n------------\n\nFOR THE RECORD\n\nAug. 11, 2:22 p.m.: The headline on this post incorrectly states that USA Today did not fact-check its op-ed piece by Charles Koch. Michael Hiltzik did not contact USA Today to ask whether the piece was fact-checked. USA Today Forum Editor David Mastio said that the piece was fact-checked before publication in accordance with the newspaper\u2019s practices.\n\nAug. 7, 2:36 p.m.: An earlier version of this post stated that the BLS figure of people working part-time for economic reasons as of July was 7.4 million. The correct figure is 7.5 million.\n\n------------\n\nGovernment policies such as Obamacare have given businesses a powerful incentive to hire two part-time people to do one full-time job. \u2014 Charles Koch\n\nKoch backs up his claims with statistics that aren't what they seem and studies from a couple of other scholarly institutions, such as the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, which also have financial ties to Koch. These are undisclosed in the USA Today article.\n\nKoch even suggests that his world view resembles that of Martin Luther King. That's audacious, to say the least, but we'll have to let the ghost of Dr. King take that up with him directly, at the appropriate juncture.\n\nEssays like Koch's cry out for the sort of fact-checking the Kansas City Star applied (if belatedly) to a recent op-ed by Heritage Foundation chief economist Stephen Moore. Koch's piece didn't get it.\n\nJob trends Data: Bureau of Labor Statistics Part-time work rose sharply during the recession, and has been drifting lower ever since (left chart); full-time work has followed the opposite course, falling in the recession and rising ever since (right chart). Figure for 2014 are as of the end of July. Part-time work rose sharply during the recession, and has been drifting lower ever since (left chart); full-time work has followed the opposite course, falling in the recession and rising ever since (right chart). Figure for 2014 are as of the end of July. (Data: Bureau of Labor Statistics)\n\nLet's look at some details.\n\nIn his op-ed, Koch rails against \"destructive regulations\" that he contends cost an estimated $1.86 trillion a year. His source for this is a study by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which has received contributions from Koch family foundations. (This is undisclosed by USA Today.)\n\nThe study spends very little effort analyzing benefits from these regulations, many of which are designed to protect public health and safety. It doesn't report what happens, for instance, when regulators take their eyes off the ball, at which point a city like Toledo, Ohio, can lose access to drinking water, or a California neighborhood can be leveled by a gas explosion, killing eight.\n\nKoch laments that \"30% of U.S. employees need government licenses to work.\" His link to this figure points us to an op-ed in the New York Times by Morris Kleiner, a professor at the University of Minnesota. Kleiner's piece starts with the assertion that \"in Minnesota, more classroom time is required to become a cosmetologist than to become a lawyer.\"\n\nIzzatso? According to Minnesota's official website, a cosmetology license requires 1,550 hours of course instruction. That works out to about nine months of full-time study. To get licensed as a lawyer, however, typically requires a degree from a four-year college, a law degree from an accredited law school (three more years), and passage of the bar exam (often requiring further class study). I'm no mathematician, but seven-years-plus of study sounds to me like more than nine months.\n\nYes, maybe it's unnecessary for government agencies to license hair stylists, florists and manicurists. But what about lawyers? Surgeons? Electricians? Stockbrokers? Real-estate salespersons? Does Koch think the free market can adequately monitor their skills and honesty? Would he fly in a plane without an FAA-certified pilot?\n\nThe centerpiece of Koch's op-ed is a discussion of employment statistics. Here's where USA Today fact-checkers really could have added some value.\n\nKoch states that \"government policies such as Obamacare have given businesses a powerful incentive to hire two part-time people to do one full-time job.\" For support, he cites June's employment statistics, which show a sudden increase of 275,000 Americans working part time for economic reasons. \"In 2007, 4.4 million Americans worked part-time jobs because they could not find full-time work,\" Koch writes. \"That number now stands at 7.5 million.\"\n\nIf Koch is suggesting that the ranks of part-time workers have increased steadily from 4.4 million to 7.5 million since 2007, that's disingenuous, especially if he's attributing the trend to Obamacare--oh heck, let's call it a lie.\n\nThe truth is that the number of people working part time for economic reasons (leaving aside those who work part time voluntarily, say because they have child-care or other family responsibilities) rose sharply from 2007 to 2009--surely because of the recession. Obamacare wasn't enacted until 2010.\n\nSince 2009 the figure has been coming down steadily, from a peak of about 8.9 million to about 7.5 million as of July. The full-time workforce fell precipitously at the time of the recession, meanwhile, and has been climbing steady ever since. In other words, the trend is exactly contrary to what Koch seems to want you to believe.
