Ted Cruz for the second week in a row, saying he was \u201creally unpopular\u201d with a Republican leadership who will have to show him \u201cwho\u2019s boss.\u201d\n\nBut as for the reason Cruz has made so many headlines over the past week \u2014 the threat of shutting down the government to defund Obamacare \u2014 Brooks said he didn\u2019t see that as a possibility.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Mr. Pollyanna on this,\u201d Brooks said on Friday\u2019s \u201cNewsHour\u201d on PBS. \u201cI think we\u2019re \u2014 it will be fine. I think what happened, there was a minority of House Republicans who upset the majority, upset the leadership. They wanted to have this big thing, we\u2019re going to defund Obamacare, or else shut we\u2019re going to down the government. The leaders didn\u2019t really want to do this. They thought it was a dead end or, as they\u2019re now calling it, a box canyon, which is the metaphor of the week. And \u2014 so, but they have got these people. They are going to give them what they want, from pressure from the right. So they give them what they want. They pass this thing, no funding for Obamacare. It\u2019s going to die in the Senate. And then I think they are going to come back or either fudge or cave in. And I suspect we will not be shutting down the government.\u201d\n\nBrooks explained that Cruz had the so-called far right led by Cruz have the momentum behind, which is a problem the Republican leadership would have to deal with eventually.\n\n\u201cApparently, Sen. Ted Cruz is in charge of the House and with these 43 or some-odd-couple-dozen more tea party Republicans,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cMostly, there are a couple things going on. First, the people on the far right \u2014 well, we will call it the far right \u2014 have just the media behind them. They have got a lot of momentum behind them. And nobody really wants to anger them. And it\u2019s just easier to placate if you are leadership than it is to really take them on. I think that\u2019s probably a wrong strategy long-term. At some point, you have got to a showdown probably with the Ted Cruzes of the world if you are in leadership. At some point, if are you in leadership \u2014 and, believe me, the Republican leaders detest him. He\u2019s really unpopular. And at some point, they think he will burn out. Maybe that\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out the problem for Republican leaders, which is Cruz like former South Carolina Republican Sen. Jim DeMint before him, are able to raise a lot of money and create \u201cnational stature.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]hey want the leaders of the party to lead a party,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThey believe politics is a team sport. A lot of these Republicans like Cruz and like some in the House and like Jim DeMint, who is a former senator now at the Heritage Foundation, they are doing very well for themselves by running against the Republican Party. They can raise a lot of money. They can build their national stature, potential presidential options. But it\u2019s very bad for the leadership. And so, eventually, I think they are going to have to have a confrontation and they\u2019re going to have show who\u2019s boss somehow.\u201d\n\n(h/t Real Clear Politics Video)\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "Columnist predicts government will not be shut down, but calls Texas senator a problem for Republican leadership", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "New York Times columnist David Brooks took on Texas Republican Sen.
