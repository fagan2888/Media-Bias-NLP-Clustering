Russia and the US Look for a Way to Cool Down Syria\n\nThe latest discovery is sure to spark a round of questions, including how ISIS came into possession of such a terrible weapon. Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons stockpile after hundreds died in a Sarin nerve gas attack near Damascus in 2013. Western countries blamed that attack on the government of President Bashar al-Assad, which has vehemently denied it.\n\nThe latest incident will no doubt come up when the OPCW's 41-member Executive Council meets next month.\n\nThe news comes days after Director of National Intelligence James Clapper spoke at a security conference in Munich late last week and warned ISIS wants to use chemical weapons on the United States.\n\n\"It is pretty clear that they [ISIS] have used this [chemical weapons] numerous times,\" said Clapper. \"It is very clear aspirationally they would like to do more and it is a concern to us in the United States because the indications are that they would like to use chemical weapons against us.\"\n\nRelated: Russia\u2019s Latest Weapons Sale to Iran Shifts the Balance of Mideast Power\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency chief John Brennan echoed those remarks during an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThere are reports that ISIS has access to chemical precursors and munitions that they can use. The CIA believes that ISIS has the ability to manufacture small quantities of chlorine and mustard gas,\u201d he said.\n\nPressed if such materials could be exported to the West, Brennan replied, \u201cI think there's always the potential for that. This is why it's so important to cut off the various transportation routes and smuggling routes that they have used.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Who ISIS Would Vote for in the US Presidential Election\n\n\u201cU.S. intelligence is actively involved in being a part of the effort to destroy ISIL and to get as much insight into what they have on the ground inside of Syria and Iraq,\u201d he added.\n\nIf ISIS has used mustard gas --- which was used with deadly effect in World War I and which burns to the eyes, skin and respiratory system severely \u2013 there\u2019s little reason to believe they won\u2019t use it again, most likely in Iraq.\n\nThe U.S.-led military campaign is planning a major offensive to take back Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city, which fell to extremists in the summer of 2014.\n\nDefense Department officials and allies might have to factor in the possibility of chemical warfare in retaking the city, possibly by providing additional equipment to protect liberating forces against such an attack or possible booby-traps left by ISIS.\n\nAny delay gives the terror group more time to dig in its heels and prepare for the coming siege, making the task of recapturing Mosul that much harder.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One of the greatest fears about the Islamic State\u2019s march across Iraq and parts of Syria in 2014 was that undisclosed or unsecured chemical weapons would fall into the terror group\u2019s hands, adding a horrifying weapon to their arsenal and posing new dangers to allies in Middle East and the U.S. homeland.", "title": "The Fight Against ISIS Now Includes Chemical Weapons", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/16/Fight-Against-ISIS-Now-Includes-Chemical-Weapons", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02162016_ISIS_Tank.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/16/Fight-Against-ISIS-Now-Includes-Chemical-Weapons", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02162016_ISIS_Tank.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "One of the greatest fears about the Islamic State\u2019s march across Iraq and parts of Syria in 2014 was that undisclosed or unsecured chemical weapons would fall into the terror group\u2019s hands, adding a horrifying weapon to their arsenal and posing new dangers to allies in Middle East and the U.S. homeland.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"It is pretty clear that they [ISIS] have used this [chemical weapons] numerous times,\" said Clapper.\nSyria agreed to give up its chemical weapons stockpile after hundreds died in a Sarin nerve gas attack near Damascus in 2013.\nThe CIA believes that ISIS has the ability to manufacture small quantities of chlorine and mustard gas,\u201d he said.\nThe OPCW concluded in October that mustard gas was used last year in neighboring Syria, making this the second such instance.\nThe news comes days after Director of National Intelligence James Clapper spoke at a security conference in Munich late last week and warned ISIS wants to use chemical weapons on the United States."}
