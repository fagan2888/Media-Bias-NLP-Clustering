Donald Trump\u2014the fear that he might actually become the GOP nominee\u2014is the ultimate nightmare. Some gleeful Democrats are rooting (sotto voce) for the Donald, though many expect he will self-destruct. Ad Policy\n\nNevertheless, Republicans face a larger problem. The GOP finds itself trapped in a marriage that has not only gone bad but is coming apart in full public view. After five decades of shrewd strategy, the Republican coalition Richard Nixon put together in 1968\u2014welcoming the segregationist white South into the Party of Lincoln\u2014is now devouring itself in ugly, spiteful recriminations.\n\nThe abrupt resignation of House Speaker John Boehner was his capitulation to this new reality. His downfall was loudly cheered by many of his own troops\u2014the angry right-wingers in the House who have turned upon the party establishment. Chaos followed. The discontented accuse party leaders of weakness and betraying their promises to the loyal rank and file.\n\nAt the heart of this intramural conflict is the fact that society has changed dramatically in recent decades, but the GOP has refused to change with it. Americans are rapidly shifting toward more tolerant understandings of personal behavior and social values, but the Republican Party sticks with retrograde social taboos and hard-edged prejudices about race, gender, sexual freedom, immigration, and religion. Plus, it wants to do away with big government (or so it claims).\n\nThe party establishment, including business and financial leaders, seems to realize that Republicans need to moderate their outdated posture on social issues. But they can\u2019t persuade their own base\u2014especially Republicans in the white South\u2014to change. The longer the GOP holds out, the more likely it is to be damaged by the nation\u2019s changing demographics\u2014the swelling impact of Latinos and foreign-born citizens, and the flowering influence of millennials, the 18-to-30-year-olds who are more liberal and tolerant than their elders.\n\nNixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d was cynical, of course, but it was an effective electoral ploy. Now, however, it is beginning to look like a deal with the devil. For 2016, the GOP has to cope with very different challenges. The party has to find a broadly appealing nominee who won\u2019t scare off party moderates and independent voters, but who at the same time can pacify rebellious right-wingers and prevent a party crackup.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Boehner_Shutdown_Budget_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "William Greider", "description": "Fresh chatter among Washington insiders is not about whether the Republican Party will win in 2016 but whether it will survive.
