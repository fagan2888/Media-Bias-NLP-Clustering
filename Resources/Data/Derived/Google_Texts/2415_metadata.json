But one class of drugs, known as biologics, which includes some of the most expensive medications in the world, has been insulated from the competition of cheaper copies for years.\n\nThat changed when the 14 members of the panel, convened by the F.D.A., agreed to recommend approval of a drug known as EP2006, which helps the body make white blood cells and is a close copy of an existing medication called Neupogen, also called filgrastim. EP2006 was approved in Europe in 2009 as Zarzio but has not been used in the United States, in part because no regulatory pathway existed to bring copies of biologic drugs to market.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of like cutting the ribbon to open a major new road,\u201d said Ronny Gal, a senior research analyst who focuses on specialty pharmaceuticals at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. \u201cIt is literally a new concept in medicine.\u201d\n\nBiologic drugs are so called because they are made out of living cells and not synthesized from chemicals as ordinary drugs are. Some examples of popular biologic drugs are Remicade, Humira and Enbrel for autoimmune disease, and Herceptin, Rituxan and Avastin for cancer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf the F.D.A. follows the panel\u2019s advice \u2014 it usually does, though it does not have to \u2014 the move would usher in an era of competition for biologics and would eventually reduce prices, Mr. Gal said. Pharmaceutical companies have been criticized recently for the high prices of new drugs, and biologics are particularly expensive; Avastin, for example, can cost more than $50,000 a year.\n\nExpress Scripts, the nation\u2019s largest manager of prescription drug benefits, estimates that the introduction of EP2006 \u2014 to be called Zarxio in the United States \u2014 could save $5.7 billion in drug costs over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe need to bring low-cost competition into biologic drugs is critical in making American health care more affordable,\u201d Mr. Gal said. Biologics make up about a third of drugs in the United States, he said, and the share is expected to grow.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe drug recommended on Wednesday is made by Sandoz, a unit of the Swiss company Novartis. Neupogen, the original, is made by Amgen, an American company.\n\nBiologic drugs were first developed in the 1980s and were considered so specialized that making generic versions was seen as most likely impossible. But science has advanced, and as patents began to expire, drug companies started developing close copies, called biosimilars, and seeking F.D.A. approval for them. Companies with the original patents initially resisted, arguing that their drugs were so complex that it was not possible to make an exact copy, but that position eventually became untenable.\n\nBiosimilars are about a third cheaper than brand-name biologic drugs, on average, in countries where they are in use, according to Express Scripts, although some argue the discounts could be much steeper, up to 90 percent.\n\nExpress Scripts estimated that $250 billion in drug costs could be saved over the next decade if 11 biosimilars in development were approved.\n\nAt the meeting on Wednesday, experts seemed to be following the thinking of F.D.A. officials, several of whom stated directly that the drug maker had achieved its goal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe data submitted by Sandoz demonstrated that EP2006 is highly similar to U.S.-licensed Neupogen, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the two products,\u201d said Dr. Albert Deisseroth, medical officer team leader for the Division of Hematology Products at the F.D.A.\n\nExperts voted to recommend approval for all five of Neupogen\u2019s licensed uses \u2014 known in medical terms as its indications. That is a victory for Sandoz, and a positive signal for makers of biosimilars, who had worried that approval might only cover a few uses.\n\nThe F.D.A. is not allowed to consider the price of drugs in its approvals, but even so, a series of outside speakers, including patients, urged approval to make critical treatments more affordable.\n\n\u201cWe have talked this morning about the elephant in the room \u2014 about cost,\u201d said Amye Leong, who identified herself as a patient. \u201cI know that the F.D.A. is not supposed to be talking about this, but it is the cost that we patients daily must deal with.\u201d\n\nThe meeting drew intense interest in the pharmaceutical industry and included prominent speakers like Dr. Janet Woodcock, the director of the agency\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, who spoke about the new regulatory pathway for biosimilars. The blueprint was laid out in 2010 in the Affordable Care Act, and the F.D.A. has issued guidance for companies on how to gain approval for biosimilars.", "article_metadata": {"ad-sponsor": "Neupogen", "tone": "news", "ptime": 20150107125246, "twitter": {"description": "The group of experts endorsed a close version of the cancer drug Neupogen, which could open the door to more such biosimilar medicines.", "title": "For First Time, F.D.A.
