And it\u2019s getting worse, not better.\n\nThese piss poor outcomes have contributed mightily to the ongoing economic decline of our nation \u2013 making us less competitive with our peers in an increasingly difficult and demanding global economy.\n\nThis website has extensively documented this downward trend in our home state of South Carolina \u2013 which operates one of the absolute worst government-run education systems in the entire country.\n\nUnfortunately, this \u201cminimally adequate\u201d system \u2013 which desperately needs long-overdue market-based reforms \u2013 is receiving nothing but more government control. And more costly intervention.\n\nSad \u2026\n\n\u201cPublic education\u201d is no longer about achieving real academic progress \u2026 it\u2019s all about \u201cteaching for the test,\u201d drilling students with pre-programmed test prep worksheets and packets that emphasize rote memorization at the expense of authentic cognitive development.\n\nThe results speak for themselves, too. South Carolina has fallen further behind the rest of America, which itself is falling further behind the rest of the world.\n\nThe only good news? The veil has been lifted. Across the country, millions of parents previously conditioned to bow before the altar of \u201cpublic education\u201d are now realizing that they \u2013 and their children \u2013 have been taken for a very expensive ride. And because most of them cannot afford to put their children in private schools (the best of which actually spend less per pupil than the government failure factories, ironically) \u2026 they are exercising the only option available to them: Homeschooling.\n\nIn 1999, the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) published its first survey of America\u2019s homeschool population. At the time, it determined that only 850,000 students were homeschooled across the country. By 2003, this number had climbed to 1.1 million and by 2007 it had soared to 1.5 million.\n\nIn 2013, NCES found 1.7 million homeschooled children \u2013 although modifications in its survey methodology prompted a warning to \u201cuse caution when comparing estimates\u201d to previously released data.\n\nAccording to Dr. Brian D. Ray of the National Home Education Research Institute, there are currently 2.3 million homeschool students in the United States \u2013 a population that is growing by at least two percent and perhaps as much as eight percent annually.\n\nIn other words, the homeschool population is soaring \u2013 expanding by a whopping 170 percent over the last sixteen years.\n\nAnd while the government education establishment and liberal media apologists love to claim homeschooling \u2013 and school choice in general \u2013 represents a \u201cwhite exodus,\u201d the numbers tell a different story.\n\n\u201cThese are atheists, Christians, and Mormons; conservatives, libertarians, and liberals; low-, middle-, and high-income families; black, Hispanic, and white; parents with Ph.D.s, GEDs, and no high-school diplomas,\u201d Ray concluded.\n\nIn fact, according to Ray homeschooling is \u201cquickly growing in popularity among minorities.\u201d\n\nWait \u2026 shouldn\u2019t this surge in homeschooling ease the strain on taxpayers?\n\nYes \u2026\n\n\u201cThe finances associated with their homeschooling likely represent over $27 billion that American taxpayers do not have to spend, annually, since these children are not in public schools,\u201d Ray concluded.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of money \u2026\n\nUnfortunately, taxpayer investment in the failed, government-run system continues to climb \u2026 especially here in the Palmetto State. According to budget data, during the current fiscal year an estimated $9.8 billion is being spent on South Carolina\u2019s government-run system \u2013 up from $7.4 billion in FY 2009-10.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of new money for the same old failure \u2026\n\nBy contrast, homeschooling is not expensive \u2026 at least not in terms of cash outlays. Most homeschool teachers shell out around $600 per year. The real cost? Their time. To do the job right (and to conform with extensive government rules and regulations covering the homeschooling industry), it\u2019s almost impossible to homeschool and hold down a full-time job.\n\nWith the economy worsening, this means parents who choose to homeschool their children are making an increasingly significant sacrifice \u2026 albeit it an increasingly necessary one.\n\nAs a nation (and as a state), we need to reward this sacrifice and incentivize their commitment. Parents who are willing to homeschooling deserve to be encouraged in those efforts \u2013 and if government is going to regulate them, the very least it can do is permit them to benefit from at least a fraction of the $12,144 the state is spending per pupil (not counting bond money).\n\nThis is the basic theory behind the broader parental choice movement: Giving parents access to some percentage of the total per pupil cost so that they can explore marketplace options better suited to their children\u2019s individual needs.\n\nSuch a reform would not only incentivize parents, it would create a market pressure on the government-run system to get better (while at the same time freeing up more resources on a per pupil basis).\n\nUnfortunately, this basic premise has been incessantly demonized by South Carolina politicians of both parties, who claim any form of choice that isn\u2019t tightly-controlled by the government represents an assault on the public system.\n\nNews flash: Government-run schools are failing just fine on their own.\n\nThis is about making them better by subjecting them to real accountability \u2026 the accountability of the market.\n\nEmbracing and incentivizing the homeschool movement is one way to enhance that accountability while at the same time lifting up academic outcomes across the board. It\u2019s also a way to reward those parents who have taken it upon themselves to do the job government has so miserably failed to do.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2016/04/26/a-homeschool-revolution/", "type": "article", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/homeschool-605x370.jpg", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "title": "A Homeschool Revolution"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "In 1999, the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) published its first survey of America\u2019s homeschool population.\nIn fact, according to Ray homeschooling is \u201cquickly growing in popularity among minorities.\u201dWait \u2026 shouldn\u2019t this surge in homeschooling ease the strain on taxpayers?\nWith the economy worsening, this means parents who choose to homeschool their children are making an increasingly significant sacrifice \u2026 albeit it an increasingly necessary one.\nIn other words, the homeschool population is soaring \u2013 expanding by a whopping 170 percent over the last sixteen years.\nEmbracing and incentivizing the homeschool movement is one way to enhance that accountability while at the same time lifting up academic outcomes across the board."}
