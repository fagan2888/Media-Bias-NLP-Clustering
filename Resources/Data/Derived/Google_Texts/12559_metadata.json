I think that if you don't know somebody doing it, you have a friend who has a family member that knows somebody doing it. We're trying to combat that,\" Walton County Sheriff's Office Public Affairs Coordinator, Corey Dobridnia said.\n\nDeputies believe the person responsible bought the supplies in the store before trying to make it in the parking lot. They cleared the spill and reopened the small section of parking lot.\n\nDobridnia says no arrests have been made and there are no suspects at this time. Anyone with information can call the Sheriff's Office at 892-8111.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Walton County Sheriff's officials spent Saturday morning cleaning up a meth lab 'shake and bake' outside of a Wal-Mart.", "language": "english", "author": "WJHG", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Meth-Lab-Shake-and-Bake-Mixture-Found-Outside-a-Walton-County-Wal-Mart-331892501.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/METH+LAB42.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Walton County Sheriff's officials spent Saturday morning cleaning up a meth lab 'shake and bake' outside of a Wal-Mart.", "title": "Meth Lab"}, "twitter": {"description": "Walton County Sheriff's officials spent Saturday morning cleaning up a meth lab 'shake and bake' outside of a Wal-Mart.", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Meth-Lab-Shake-and-Bake-Mixture-Found-Outside-a-Walton-County-Wal-Mart-331892501.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/METH+LAB42.jpg", "title": "Meth Lab", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Meth Lab", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Meth Lab Shake and Bake, Mixture Found Outside a Walton"}, "article_summary": "Walton County Sheriff's officials spent Saturday morning cleaning up a meth lab \"shake and bake\" outside of a Wal-Mart.\nWe're trying to combat that,\" Walton County Sheriff's Office Public Affairs Coordinator, Corey Dobridnia said.\nOfficials with the Sheriff's Office say it's not an uncommon problem in Walton County, and it's one they're actively trying to combat.\nThey said it had exploded in the parking lot but no one was hurt.\nAnyone with information can call the Sheriff's Office at 892-8111."}
