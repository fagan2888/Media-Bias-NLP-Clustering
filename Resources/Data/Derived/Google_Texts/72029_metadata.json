A crowdsourcing effort called the Global Biodiversity Information Facility identifies and curates biodiversity data \u2014 such as photos of species taken with a smartphone \u2014 to show their distribution and then makes the information available online. That is especially helpful to researchers in developing countries with limited budgets. Another project, Lifemapper, at the University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute, uses the data to understand where a species might move as its world changes.\n\n\u201cWe know that species don\u2019t persist long in fragmented areas and so we try and reconnect those fragments,\u201d said Stuart L. Pimm, a professor of conservation at Duke University, and head of a nonprofit organization called SavingSpecies. One of his group\u2019s projects in the Colombian Andes identified a forest that contains a carnivorous mammal that some have described as a cross between a house cat and a teddy bear, called an olinguito, new to science. Using crowd-sourced data, \u201cwe worked with local conservation groups and helped them buy land, reforest the land and reconnect pieces,\u201d Dr. Pimm says.\n\nCoastal areas, especially, are getting scrutiny. Biologists in Florida, which faces a daunting sea level rise, are working on a plan to set aside land farther inland as a reserve for everything from the MacGillivray\u2019s seaside sparrow to the tiny Key deer.\n\nTo thwart something called \u201ccoastal squeeze,\u201d a network of \u201cmigratory greenways\u201d is envisioned so that species can move on their own away from rising seas to new habitat. \u201cBut some are basically trapped,\u201d said Reed F. Noss, a professor of conservation biology at the University of Central Florida who is involved in the effort, and they will most likely need to be picked up and moved. The program has languished, but Amendment 1, on the ballot this November, would provide funding.\n\nOne species at risk is the Florida panther. Once highly endangered, with just 20 individuals left, this charismatic animal has come back \u2014 some. But a quarter or more of its habitat is predicted to be under some three feet of water by 2100. Males will move on their own, but females will need help because they won\u2019t cross the Caloosahatchee River. Experts hope to create reserves north of the river, and think at some point they will have to move females to new quarters.\n\nProtecting land between reserves is vital. The Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative, known as Y2Y, would protect corridors between wild landscapes in the Rockies from Yellowstone National Park to northern Canada, which would allow species to migrate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRESEARCHERS have also focused on \u201crefugia,\u201d regions around the world that have remained stable during previous swings of the Earth\u2019s climate \u2014 and that might be the best bet for the survival of life this time around.\n\nA section of the Driftless Area encompassing northeastern Iowa and southern Minnesota, also known as Little Switzerland, has ice beneath some of its ridges. The underground refrigerator means the land never gets above 50 or so degrees and has kept the Pleistocene snail, long thought extinct, from disappearing there. Other species might find refuge there as things get hot.\n\nA roughly 250-acre refugia on the Little Cahaba River in Alabama has been called a botanical lost world, because of its wide range of unusual plants, including eight species found nowhere else. Dr. Noss said these kinds of places should be sought out and protected.\n\nDaniel Janzen, a conservation ecologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is working to protect large tracts in Costa Rica, said that to truly protect biodiversity, a place-based approach must be tailored to the country. A reserve needs to be large, to be resilient against a changing climate, and so needs the support of the people who live with the wild place and will want to protect it. \u201cTo survive climate change we need to minimize the other assaults, such as illegal logging and contaminating water,\u201d he said. \u201cEach time you add one of those you make it more sensitive to climate change.\u201d\n\nThe Svalbard Global Seed Vault, beneath the permafrost on an island in the Arctic Ocean north of mainland Norway, preserves seeds from food crops. Frozen zoos keep the genetic material from extinct and endangered animals. The Archangel Ancient Tree Archive in Michigan, meanwhile, founded by a family of shade tree growers, has made exact genetic duplicates of some of the largest trees on the planet and planted them in \u201cliving libraries\u201d elsewhere \u2014 should something befall the original.\n\nIn 2008, Connie Barlow, a biologist and conservationist, helped move an endangered conifer tree in Florida north by planting seedlings in cooler regions. Now she is working in the West. \u201cI just assisted in the migration of the alligator juniper in New Mexico by planting seeds in Colorado,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to. Climate change is happening so fast and trees are the least capable of moving.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140927144502, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists are trying to figure out which species to save, and how.", "title": "Building an Ark for the Anthropocene", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/sunday-review/building-an-ark-for-the-anthropocene.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003141471"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/28/sunday-review/0928ARK/0928ARK-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/sunday-review/building-an-ark-for-the-anthropocene.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003141471", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/sunday-review/building-an-ark-for-the-anthropocene.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sundayreview", "hdl_p": "Building an Ark for the Anthropocene", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sunday-review/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 27, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Endangered and Extinct Species,Global Warming,Bees,Biodiversity", "description": "Scientists are trying to figure out which species to save, and how.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jim Robbins", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/28/sunday-review/0928ARK/0928ARK-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "28ark", "byl": "By JIM ROBBINS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Scientists are trying to figure out which species to save, and how.", "tom": "News Analysis", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/28/sunday-review/0928ARK/0928ARK-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Bee,Biodiversity", "CG": "sunday-review", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 27, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News Analysis", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/jim_robbins/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html#sundayreview", "section": "Sunday Review", "modified": "2014-10-02", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sunday-review/index.jsonp", "tag": "Biodiversity", "published": "2014-09-27", "section-taxonomy-id": "67D7F2A2-B495-4FFC-9478-1CE1965601D5"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141002152632, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/sunday-review/building-an-ark-for-the-anthropocene.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/28/sunday-review/0928ARK/0928ARK-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Scientists are trying to figure out which species to save, and how.", "title": "Building an Ark for the Anthropocene"}, "pdate": 20140927, "des": "Biodiversity", "articleid": 100000003141471, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Building an Ark for the Anthropocene", "col": "News Analysis", "PST": "News Analysis"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1e8\"", "article_summary": "Using crowd-sourced data, \u201cwe worked with local conservation groups and helped them buy land, reforest the land and reconnect pieces,\u201d Dr. Pimm says.\nAnother project, Lifemapper, at the University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute, uses the data to understand where a species might move as its world changes.\n\u201cI just assisted in the migration of the alligator juniper in New Mexico by planting seeds in Colorado,\u201d she said.\n\u201cTo survive climate change we need to minimize the other assaults, such as illegal logging and contaminating water,\u201d he said.\nBut a quarter or more of its habitat is predicted to be under some three feet of water by 2100."}
