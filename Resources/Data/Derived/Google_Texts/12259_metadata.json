A straw poll had Ted Cruz winning with 88 percent of the vote. Strategists had been begging people to vote for John Kasich in Ohio and Marco Rubio in Florida. Only a couple of the people in the audience indicated they were interested in playing that game. One, in fact, said he would vote for Donald Trump were he to secure the nomination, but in no way would he ever vote for Kasich. Countless other remarks disparaging the state\u2019s governor were heard.\n\nIn the air was a sense that the establishment, if it hadn\u2019t already, was in the process of falling. Freedom Works\u2019 President and CEO Adam Brandon said the Republican Party was a smoldering hole. An outsider and an insurgent were the only two candidates with any chance of winning the primary; and if the establishment dared pull a stunt to make it otherwise, a walkout at the convention would leave Republicans a smaller minority than they already are. They would go the way of the Whigs.\n\nAndrew Wilkow of Sirius\u2019 Wilkow Majority served as emcee. He began expressing disbelief at the way socialism is selling the same pipedreams at higher and higher costs. One need only pay attention to history, look at Venezuela, or consider that Amtrak, subsidized by government for forty years and never turning a profit, loses $80 million on food and beverages a year. \u201cAnd they\u2019re the only game on the train!\u201d\n\nFreedomWorks\u2019 Senior Economic Contributor Stephen Moore gave a state of the union address. The nation had now borrowed $19 trillion, $9 trillion more since the beginning of the Obama administration. 45 million Americans are on food stamps. A large number of middle-class workers have not had a pay raise since the recession began, and Obamacare is costing families more than their old insurance plans. As Republicans are siding with Democrats to make the national debt worse, the average student debt is $40,000.\n\nAs an economist, he noted that growth runs inversely to taxation and so suggested lowering taxes on work and ingenuity and raising taxes on liberals. His serious cures included the usual: implement a flat tax, repeal Obamacare, quit bailing out corporations and other forms of corporate welfare, close the Export Import bank, shut down unelected \u201cfourth branch\u201d departments, etc. His last suggestion, not mentioning any names, was, \u201cTo use every ounce of energy to make sure that she is not president in 2016.\u201d\n\nConservative writer and activist Brent Bozell was introduced as a strange man who bought two TV sets to prove there was a media bias, back in the day. He reported that Trump had been sucking 52 percent of the oxygen out of mainstream election coverage. By contrast, Cruz had gotten 1.5 percent. He then told how Trump can say and do anything with impunity. Hillary gets accolades for whatever she does.\n\nBozell noted the media was obsessed with Benghazi and the server, but he was flummoxed by the comprehensive amnesia surrounding Mrs. Clinton\u2019s amazing boon in trading cattle futures, Whitewater, Travelgate firings, the unauthorized access of FBI files that showed up in the White House in Filegate, and suppression of complaints of her husband\u2019s filanderings including one claim of rape. The media forgot all that when it celebrated an ever so compassionate tweet from Mrs. Clinton, \u201cEvery survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported.\u201d\n\nCruz is called a \u201cjerk,\u201d \u201cradical extremist,\u201d \u201cdangerous,\u201d \u201cslimy,\u201d and more. Jeb Bush was declared to be skyrocketing when he was polling at 3 percent. When he dropped out, Rubio, who had been treated unkindly, then became the darling. Fortunately, a majority of Americans are getting their news from online sources these days and bypassing the mainstream media.\n\nCongressman Marlin Stutzman from Indiana stressed the importance of getting majorites of Freedom Caucus Republicans elected, and Ted Stevenot stressed the importance of primary elections. He said most districts are gerrymandered so they are going to go Republican or Democrat on that basis solely. With Congressional approvals running in the teens, over 80 percent of incumbents were re-elected. So, if you\u2019re in a Republican district, choosing between an establishment dude and a grassroots liberty lover is going to happen in the primary. Stevenot added Ohio\u2019s central committees already have their candidates selected two years before they come before the public.\n\nCharlie Kirk, a youngster who founded Turning Point, USA when he was eighteen, thought today\u2019s massive student debt was racking up by design. He said debt was now $32,000 per borrower. He used the word \u201cborrower\u201d because half the borrowers don\u2019t graduate. Kids are not asked if they want to go to college but in what they want to major. Forcing college on kids gives them extra exposure to their revolutionary communists professors. In college, they major in esoteric fields that will never get them jobs to pay back their loans, thus making them dependent on government for the rest of their lives.\n\nJohn Goodman, the inventor of Health Savings Accounts (HSA\u2019s), spoke about the Republican replacement for Obamacare he was drafting. He first discussed the unsustainable math underlying Obamacare and inequities and impossibilities in how the system was supposed to be funded. His plan would return more oversight to the states and increase choice. He asked rhetorically why he could get his cell phone repaired without an appointment from any number of places, but medical treatments now have waiting times on the order of three weeks.\n\nOhio Congressman Jim Jordan shared that good things don\u2019t just happen. They take effort and time. This echoed a sentiment shared among participants that their work, the work of helping citizens become educated and savvy about the ways of government, is so much slower than that of the opposition. Masses can be frenzied up, sloganeered, and controlled with a blush of charisma. Education takes years. Ohioans now had three days.\n\nJordan consoled the audience saying truth was on the freedom lovers\u2019 side, and it would prevail. He recalled his favorite scene from the musical 1776. John Adams was letting fellow legislators edit his drafts until finally he had had it and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a revolution, blank it! We\u2019re going to have to offend somebody.\u201d Jordan closed with a Bible verse, \u201cFight the good fight, finish the race, and keep the faith.\u201d (2 Timothy 4:7)\n\nOther speakers included CL Bryant, an evangelical minister who has rallied with Glenn Beck in the past, Warren Davidson, who is running for Congress, and Marty Cummins, who was making copies of the booklet, \u201cThe Adventures of the Free Marketeers\u201d available for free.\n\nFreedomWorks\u2019 President and CEO Adam Brandon gave a short introduction for Beck. He said there wasn\u2019t much money in fighting for liberty. Had he wanted money, he would have gotten a job with the Jeb Bush campaign. After making his \u201csmoldering hole\u201d comment, he shared that had the patriots stopped after Lexington and Concord, the Boston Tea Party would have been but a blip in history. It\u2019s because they finished what they started with the Constitutional Convention of 1787 that America became the greatest nation on earth.\n\nBeck\u2019s Talk \u2013\n\nThe final talk, and the event of the season, was perhaps a sermon, by Beck. It was a different experience for Dufus. Instead of sitting in the back and rolling the eyes at the latest resurrections of the same old, worn out socialist ideas; Dufus wanted to pay attention and respect this man of great insight. She looked attentively at the speaker while furiously trying to write down every word, because the messages were O so valuable. Only a full transcript could do the talk justice.\n\nBeck addressed the anger that is masquerading as policy this political season. Many speakers had spoken about a brawl the night before in an Illinois rally and another incident that day in Ohio. Beck prayed that those present would give anger no place in their minds.\n\nBeck spoke of the Progressive agenda and control freakery. But first he reminded people they were created in the image of God with not only God-given rights, but God-given power. He asked what the most valuable resource was on earth. Some say gold or oil, many believe it is water. But Beck said it was man, a creature with power to choose and by volition do many good works.\n\nProgressives get their power by putting all those \u201chuman resources\u201d in a box, putting rules and punishment on agency. Progressives become powerful by overcoming human agency and using human power to achieve their ends. They are threatened by individual excellence; it betrays the lie in their schemes. Progressives, he said, disdain the common folk. They do not think lowly people are smart or wise enough to make decisions for themselves. They require elite corralling.\n\nWhat made America exceptional was the Founders\u2019 concept that gave government only one task: defending the liberty of its citizens. Beck was the second speaker to quote the United States Uniformed Services Oath of Office, to \u201csolemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\n\nBeck said people needed to go forth with honor, courage, and love. He repeated those present would prevail in the end because their cause was just and their understandings were true. A day of reckoning would come when this life was over. Progressives would have to answer for saddling future generations with debt. Including unfunded liabilities, a child born into the United States today is an indentured servant owing over $1 million. It was unconscionable that so many people were in denial of what they were offloading on future generations.\n\nBut Beck did not want people to get discouraged. They were sitting on a pivotal point in world history. The establishment was indeed falling, but we would be answerable to our Creator for what we did with the opportunity to build a better day. Many pundits speak as if letting the other party get the White House is the worst calamity that could befall the nation. ISIS, Obamacare, and the possibility of an even more legislative Supreme Court are more real threats; but the greatest threat, which carries the greatest opportunity, is whether or not the people will choose to preserve the form of government most conducive to human achievement, ever.\n\nFor audience participation, Beck asked everybody to look at a stranger sitting beside, in front, or in back of them. \u201cLook deep into their eyes.\u201d He then asked if any of us had the nerve to say that person deserved any less than ourselves. But before that, he told two guys not to look that intently at each other. \u201cGet a room!\u201d he advised.\n\nBeck oft quoted the Founders and thrice quoted Phil Collins of Genesis. The first time, following a quote from Thomas Payne, he began, \u201cI can feel it coming in the air tonight . . .\u201d The final time he did this, he looked straight at Dufus and began, \u201cI\u2019ve seen your face before my friend, but I don\u2019t know if you know who I am, Well I was there and I saw what you did, I saw it with my own two eyes\u2026.\u201d Flattered, Dufus flashed a grin back at him, and he continued, \u201cSo you can wipe off that grin, I know where you\u2019ve been it\u2019s all been a pack of lies.\u201d Well, Dufus can only hope he was, as he said, talking about the Democrat in Republican\u2019s clothing who has taken both sides of every issue, the heiress apparent who compromised lives and national security as secretary of state, and the socialist Democrat who promises programs that can only be paid with preposterous debt on future generations.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3"}, "article_summary": "For audience participation, Beck asked everybody to look at a stranger sitting beside, in front, or in back of them.\nAs Republicans are siding with Democrats to make the national debt worse, the average student debt is $40,000.\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re the only game on the train!\u201dFreedomWorks\u2019 Senior Economic Contributor Stephen Moore gave a state of the union address.\nJohn Goodman, the inventor of Health Savings Accounts (HSA\u2019s), spoke about the Republican replacement for Obamacare he was drafting.\nThe first time, following a quote from Thomas Payne, he began, \u201cI can feel it coming in the air tonight ."}
