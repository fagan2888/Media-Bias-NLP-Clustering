The man believed to be the gunman was found dead nearby.\n\nHoward County Police Chief William J. McMahon said the shooting occurred in a store called Zumiez above the food court on the upper level of The Mall in Columbia at around 11:15 a.m.\n\nPolice late Saturday afternoon identified the victims as Brianna Benlolo, 21, of College Park and Tyler Johnson, 25, of Ellicott City.\n\nChief McMahon said the shooter has not been identified because he had a \u201clarge amount of ammunition on and about him,\u201d causing police to take precautions before approaching his body.\n\n\u201cBecause of concerns about any other weapons he may have had or explosives, we are getting assistance from our federal partners in making sure there\u2019s no explosives on the body of the deceased,\u201d he said.\n\nThe chief said police could not confirm reports that the shooting was a domestic incident. He said the man likely acted alone and a shotgun was found near him. He also said no shots were fired by police in the course of the response.\n\nSusan Case, a spokeswoman for Howard County General Hospital, said five injured victims were brought to the hospital from the shooting scene. Most had injuries that were not directly related to the shooting but to the chaotic aftermath. One person had suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.\n\nHoward County Executive Kenneth S. Ulman praised the police response, saying officers arrived within two minutes of the first calls for help.\n\n\u201cEveryone did exactly what they were trained to do,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shooting drew officers from departments around the region as well as federal agencies. People were directed out of the mall and into a parking lot, where some boarded a bus and others walked toward their cars. Some people were seen crying.\n\nJoan Harding of Elkridge, Md., was shopping with her husband, David, for a tiara for their granddaughter\u2019s 18th birthday. She said she heard something heavy falling, followed by gunshots and people running.\n\nWitnesses described moments of panic as they heard a succession of gunshots and screaming as people ran for cover into nearby stores and hid behind locked doors.\n\n\u201cMy husband said, \u2018Get down!\u2019 and the girl that worked in the store said, \u2018Get in the back,\u2019\u201d Ms. Harding said. That is where they hid until police gave the all-clear.\n\nLaura McKinzles of Columbia works at a kiosk in the mall. She said she heard between eight and 10 gunshots, followed by people running and screaming. She ran into the backroom of a perfume store and locked the door.\n\nChief McMahon said the mall, located about 25 miles northeast of the District, had drilled on responses to active-shooter situations in the past.\n\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t happen in Columbia mall. This shouldn\u2019t happen anywhere. But unfortunately that\u2019s where we are in society and things do happen,\u201d Chief McMahon said.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports", "article_metadata": {"description": "A man and a woman fatally shot at a Maryland mall were employees of a skate shop where the shooting took place, Howard County police said Saturday.
