The nation\u2019s public debt was equal to roughly 40% of GDP when Mr. Obama took office. At last year\u2019s end it was 72% of GDP. [\u2026] Then there\u2019s Medicare, whose Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will go bankrupt in 2026. For five years, Mr. Obama has failed to offer a plan to restore Medicare\u2019s fiscal health as he is required by the law establishing Medicare Part D. When Medicare goes belly-up, he will be out of office. From the record number of Americans on food stamps to the worst labor-force participation rate since the 1970s to rising political polarization to retreating U.S. power overseas and increasing Middle East chaos and violence, Mr. Obama\u2019s successor \u2013 Republican or Democratic \u2013 will inherit a mess.\n\nSo, let me get this straight. Karl Rove, a former deputy of chief of staff in the Bush/Cheney White House, is worried about a president who will leave his successor with high deficits, a weak economy, a divided electorate, and violence in the Middle East.\n\nDid he even read this before submitting it? Did it not occur to him how ironic his complaints might seem, given that his former boss turned a massive surplus into a massive deficit, saw the economy suffer a near-catastrophic crash, and left two disastrous wars for Obama to clean up?\n\nAs for the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, one wonders if Rove realizes that it was Obama, not Bush, who extended the program\u2019s fiscal health?\n\nThe larger takeaway, however, is that Karl Rove has taken the practice of projecting one\u2019s flaws onto one\u2019s foes to a level of performance art.\n\nIt\u2019s a pattern I started documenting a few years ago, but which Rove somehow manages to add data points to with alarming regularity.\n\n* Rove has tried to buy elections, so he accuses Democrats of trying to buy elections\n\n* Rove has relied on scare tactics, so he accuses Democrats of relying on scare tactics\n\n* Rove embraced a permanent campaign, so he accuses Democrats of embracing a \u201c permanent campaign .\u201d\n\n* Rove relied on pre-packaged, organized, controlled, scripted political events, so he accuses Democrats of relying on \u201cpre-packaged, organized, controlled, scripted\u201d political events.\n\n* Rove snubbed news outlets that he considered partisan, so he accuses Democrats of snubbing news outlets that they consider partisan.\n\n* Rove had a habit of burying bad news by releasing it late on Friday afternoons, so he accuses Democrats of burying bad news by releasing it late on Friday afternoons.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "For Karl Rove to complain about a president bequeathing high deficits, a struggling economy, and a mess in the Middle East breaks is extraordinary.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/self-awareness-virtue", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "For Karl Rove to complain about a president bequeathing high deficits, a struggling economy, and a mess in the Middle East breaks is extraordinary.", "title": "Self-awareness is a virtue", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/self-awareness-virtue", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/money_and_politics_wx105.jpg?itok=xkgTKRUL", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/self-awareness-virtue", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/money_and_politics_wx105.jpg?itok=nOZOvnzn", "height": 553}, "title": "Self-awareness is a virtue", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "For Karl Rove to complain about a president bequeathing high deficits, a struggling economy, and a mess in the Middle East breaks is extraordinary."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-14T15:43:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Self-awareness is a virtue", "tags": "karl-rove,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "02/14/2014 15:43:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/self-awareness-virtue"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "For Karl Rove to complain about a president bequeathing high deficits, a struggling economy, and a mess in the Middle East breaks is extraordinary.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Karl Rove"}, "article_summary": "The nation\u2019s public debt was equal to roughly 40% of GDP when Mr. Obama took office.\n* Rove snubbed news outlets that he considered partisan, so he accuses Democrats of snubbing news outlets that they consider partisan.\nMost of the 700-word op-ed complains about the Affordable Care Act, but it\u2019s the conclusion that captures a failure of self-awareness that was unintentionally hilarious.\nDespite his missteps, Republican strategist Karl Rove still has a weekly column in the Wall Street Journal, and his latest submission is a gem that shines bright.\nThe larger takeaway, however, is that Karl Rove has taken the practice of projecting one\u2019s flaws onto one\u2019s foes to a level of performance art."}
