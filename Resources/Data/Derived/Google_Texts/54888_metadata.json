The 99 percent are persecuting them, the wealthy ones whined. That whole Occupy Wall Street thing hurt their feelings, conservative 1 percenters pouted.\n\nThe right-wing rich didn\u2019t threaten to take their Shimansky diamond soccer balls and stomp home in their Bruno Maglis. Instead, they want real retribution. They want to steal Americans\u2019 birthright, their most valuable possession \u2013 their democracy.\n\nSilicon Valley vulture capitalist Tom Perkins explained the billionaires\u2019 plan. First, Perkins contended in a letter to the Wall Street Journal that progressives and the 99 percent are persecuting America\u2019s wealthiest in the same way the Nazis murdered, raped and plundered the German Jewish minority during Kristallnacht. Then Perkins revealed his scheme to change the world, to crush the uppity 99 percent once and for all and make America what he would call a decent place for billionaires. It\u2019s simple. No more of that pesky one human, one vote. Perkins believes billionaires should get a vote for every dollar they pay in taxes. People too poor to pay federal income taxes would get no vote. None. Sales and real estate and dozens of other taxes that everyone pays don\u2019t count in Perkins Land.\n\nPerkins\u2019 one-dollar-one-vote plutocracy solves so many problems for the rich! The way democracy works now, the rich spend tens of millions on front groups that try to persuade the 99 percent to support legislation to aid the 1 percent \u2013 like tax breaks for ungodly profitable oil corporations and laws that prohibit voting by people without driver\u2019s licenses (that\u2019s poor people). Often these front groups fail \u2013 a fact that\u2019s extremely frustrating to the rich. Poor, poor rich people!\n\nInstead of all that annoyance, Perkins\u2019 plutocracy plan would enable the rich to make all of the rules. They would, after all, own virtually all of the votes.\n\nThe legislative shopping list of the Perkins plutocrats is not exactly the people\u2019s plan. The plutocrats would cut Social Security, as billionaire Pete Peterson\u2019s various front groups have tried to do for years. Similarly, they\u2019d end pensions for public employees, as Texas billionaire John D. Arnold is seeking. They\u2019d destroy Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act because, let\u2019s face it, the Perkins kingpins aren\u2019t going to help pay for health care for the elderly or poor working people. Forget about it.\n\nPerkins made his priorities pretty clear in a televised interview with Fortune Magazine Senior Editor Adam Lashinsky. The government should not be providing food stamps to 47 million people, he asserted. Perkins would end government food aid to these humans he considers laggards \u2013 like the elderly and disabled people and children who reside in 76 percent of households that get food stamps.\n\nLet those lazy arthritis-crippled seniors and whiny five-year-olds get jobs! Perkins notes in the interview that he earned money as a child \u2013 laboring as a paper boy, babysitter and grocery bagger \u2013 work that Perkins falsely and bizarrely claimed is outlawed now because of child labor and minimum-wage laws.\n\nOn the other hand, Perkins said the government should continue paying for medical and pharmaceutical research \u2013 programs from which his firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, made a profit. The Perkins government by and for the 1 percent would fund stuff that fills plutocrats\u2019 pockets and defund stuff that fills people\u2019s stomachs.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and conservative lap dog Kevin D. Williamson rushed to support Perkins. Williamson, a plutocrat wannabe, says in a National Review article that the rich should get political power in proportion to their federal income tax payments.\n\nThe rich are better than everyone else, according to Williamson, Perkins and wealthy bankers who hang out exclusively with other 1 percenters and snicker about the suffering that the Wall Street crash caused the 99 percent. \"I don't think people have any idea what the 1 percent is actually contributing to America,\" Perkins told Lashinsky. He mentioned a $100 million gift by a billionaire to a New York hospital.\n\nRight. Like Andrew Carnegie built libraries in an attempt to buy his way into heaven after his pathetic wages pauperized his mill workers and after he had them killed by Pinkertons when they tried to unionize to secure better pay, which, by the way, would have enabled them to build their own libraries.\n\nRight. Like all rich people are the smartest and hardest working. That would include 1 percenter Jamie Dimon who persuaded the JP Morgan Chase board to give him a 74 percent pay raise after the bank was fined more than $20 billion for improprieties. That would include former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain who gave himself and other executives $4 billion in bonuses days before his failing firm was taken over by Bank of America, which then grabbed billions in federal bailout money. That would include the incompetents who ran AIG and Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, who took down the nation\u2019s economy while pulling down billions in salary and bonuses.\n\nPresumably millionaire scoundrels like Enron\u2019s Jeff Skilling and Tyco\u2019s Dennis Kozlowski could place their votes from prison as long as they continued paying taxes because, of course, in the Perkins plutocracy, it\u2019s the width of one\u2019s wallet that counts, not the content of one\u2019s character.\n\nAnd in the United Plutocrats of Perkins, the children and grandchildren of billionaires, the nation\u2019s Paris Hiltons and PC Petersons, would wield millions of times the political power of Jack Andraka, the determined Maryland teen-ager who developed an inexpensive test for pancreatic cancer, or Tawanda Jones, who used her savings to start a dance team to teach Camden girls self-discipline.\n\nSelf-righteous 1 percenters \u2013 from former Morgan Stanley CEO John J. Mack to real estate investor Sam Zell \u2013 sulked in recent weeks that their money can\u2019t buy them love from the 99 percent. Perkins\u2019 solution is to eliminate democracy\u2019s self-determination and return to medieval rule by wealthy royals.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t understand that once people experience democracy, they\u2019re not going to let money buy votes.\n\nFollow Leo W.
