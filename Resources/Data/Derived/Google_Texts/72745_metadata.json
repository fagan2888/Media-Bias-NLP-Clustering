For the banquet, the color of your ticket determines where you sit \u2014 5 percent get to sit at a nice table with meal choices, 25 percent at a plain table with sandwiches and 75 percent find a chair or sit on the floor for beans, rice and a tortilla. To fundraise, the girls set up a page through philanthropyproject.com and raised almost $5,000. This year, the event is planned for the spring.\n\nWhat do you like about the hunger banquet model?\n\nIt shows how food distribution is out of whack. It's really awesome.\n\nWhy a philanthropy project?\n\nI love people. I love to talk to people and help people. I chose this project because food distribution is so unfair. We have so much food here. People in other places don't have anywhere near the privilege we have.\n\nWhat do you like about Centaurus?\n\nI love the community. It's so supportive and friendly.\n\nWhat would you change?\n\nI would have gotten involved with philanthropy earlier in high school. I wish I had more time.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to senior year?\n\nI'm looking forward to the hunger banquet and all the fun that comes with being a senior. It's the last year. I've got to make it count.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat's your favorite subject?\n\nEnglish and anything that allows me to talk and freely express ideas and work with people.\n\nWhat are your plans after high school?\n\nI want to major in gender studies or philosophy. The ultimate goal is to get to law school for human rights.\n\nWhat's you dream job?\n\nTo work for Lawyers Without Borders. They can do so much good.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_29150010/student-spotlight-maddie-chism-17-year-old-senior", "endDate": "2025-11-21T20:49:11-0700", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:29150010:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-21T22:42:23-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Maddie Chism, 17-year-old senior at Lafayette's Centaurus High School \n\nMaddie and her friend, Madison Hogan, are in their second year of organizing a hunger banquet to raise money for Sister Carmen, No Kid Hungry and Oxfam International.", "title": "Student Spotlight: Maddie Chism, 17-year-old senior at Lafayette's Centaurus High School", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_29150010/student-spotlight-maddie-chism-17-year-old-senior", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder Education & Schools", "modificationDate": "2015-11-21T22:43:15-0700", "news_keywords": "news information  boulder county schools elementary middle high preps", "pubDate": "2015-11-21T22:44:24-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-21T22:42:23-0700", "sailthru.title": "Student Spotlight: Maddie Chism, 17-year-old senior at Lafayette's Centaurus High School", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1121/20151121__22DCASPO~1_300.jpg", "description": "Maddie Chism, 17-year-old senior at Lafayette's Centaurus High School \n\nMaddie and her friend, Madison Hogan, are in their second year of organizing a hunger banquet to raise money for Sister Carmen, No Kid Hungry and Oxfam International.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_29150010/student-spotlight-maddie-chism-17-year-old-senior", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Maddie Chism, 17-year-old senior at Lafayette's Centaurus High School \n\nMaddie and her friend, Madison Hogan, are in their second year of organizing a hunger banquet to raise money for Sister Carmen, No Kid Hungry and Oxfam International.", "title": "Student Spotlight: Maddie Chism, 17-year-old senior at Lafayette's Centaurus High School"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1121/20151121__22DCASPO~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "What do you like about the hunger banquet model?\nI'm looking forward to the hunger banquet and all the fun that comes with being a senior.\nClick photo to enlarge \u00ab1\u00bbMaddie Chism, 17-year-old senior at Lafayette's Centaurus High SchoolMaddie and her friend, Madison Hogan, are in their second year of organizing a hunger banquet to raise money for Sister Carmen, No Kid Hungry and Oxfam International.\nEnglish and anything that allows me to talk and freely express ideas and work with people.\nI would have gotten involved with philanthropy earlier in high school."}
