With a key deadline looming and the MNsure health insurance website still experiencing technical glitches, agencies that help Minnesotans find a health plan have shifted into high gear.\n\nOn Saturday, Portico had turned to a classroom approach, with six adults working on laptops as four helpers looked over their shoulders. \u201cWe simply were running out of time and people power to do the one-on-one enrollments,\u201d said Rebecca Lozano, a Portico outreach manager.\n\nTrained helpers known as \u201cnavigators\u201d were always envisioned as a key enrollment strategy for MNsure, with many of them coming from social service agencies, like Portico, that work with poor and uninsured Minnesotans. But as frustrated consumers continue to struggle with the MNsure website or wait on hold for its overwhelmed hot line, navigators are emerging as even more important lifelines.\n\nSaturday\u2019s event started at 8:30 a.m. and was filled until 5:30 p.m. with people who needed 60 to 90 minutes to sign up for health insurance, hoping they could be enrolled before Dec. 31 and have coverage on Jan 1.\n\nTaichi and Robin Chen of New Hope had completed an online application but needed help to enroll themselves and their daughter in a plan.\n\nSupervisor Sara Casey, center, helped enrollees during all-day small group sessions Saturday at Portico Healthnet in St. Paul.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to bring it home,\u201d Robin Chen said.\n\nGregory Collins of Maplewood lost his insurance benefits when he was laid off from a foundry this summer. His son has been without epilepsy medication all school year. When he tried to drop a completed paper application at the front desk of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, he was told it wouldn\u2019t be processed in time and that he should consult a navigator.\n\nNearby was a St. Paul woman named Cherie \u2014 too embarrassed by her struggles with MNsure to give her last name \u2014 who lost her health benefits after a divorce and has been uninsured for a decade. The 63-year-old woman said she hasn\u2019t qualified for public Medical Assistance coverage in the past, and that when she got really sick, she went to a Walgreens clinic and paid for care herself.\n\nCherie squinted at the text on her screen, then raised her hand, muttering, \u201cIt\u2019s the craziest thing ever\u201d until a Portico helper was available.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s asking me, \u2018Do you plan to make Minnesota your home?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve already made it my home. Do I press yes?\u201d\n\nMany enrolled, many frustrated\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much navigators have boosted MNsure enrollments so far; many didn\u2019t start their outreach efforts until mid- to late October because navigators had their own set of delays in training and certification.\n\nWhile assistance from a navigator is noted on an enrollment record, a MNsure spokeswoman said last week that she did not have data showing how many enrollments were completed with their help. Nor does MNsure have payment figures; navigators are paid $25 to $70 per enrollee, but payments to the agencies aren\u2019t scheduled until next month.\n\nAs of Dec. 14, some 38,955 Minnesotans used MNsure to enroll in health plans \u2014 11,805 in private coverage and the rest in public programs such as Medical Assistance.\n\nBut MNsure leaders have been vexed by 50,000 people who completed applications and qualified for private plans \u2014 and in some cases for financial subsidies for their premiums \u2014 but then didn\u2019t select one.\n\nSome might have shopped but decided coverage was too expensive. Others might have experienced technical problems on the website that blocked their enrollments, or they delayed their selections until the last moment. (While Dec. 31 is the deadline for Jan. 1 benefits, Minnesotans can wait until March 31 to select plans for 2014 and not suffer financial penalties for being uninsured under the federal Affordable Care Act.)\n\nLike winning the lottery\n\nThe day at Portico reflected the variety of consumer experiences to date.\n\nWhile Collins made progress in his application, an elderly man next to him couldn\u2019t log in, and a woman across from him was locked out of the site because of incorrect password attempts.\n\nLozano celebrated as Collins reached the Web page where he could pick a plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a personal victory every time you get to the next step,\u201d she said.\n\nMinnesotans have until Dec. 31 to enroll in coverage that starts Jan. 1. Those premiums must be paid by Jan. 10.\n\n\u201cFist pump!\u201d Collins replied.\n\nCherie was the first in the morning group to enroll.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a weight off my shoulders,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to go home and tell my kids it actually worked!\u201d\n\nCollins came next. He hesitated to discuss his success for fear that it would jinx the application. While his wife is insured through work, it was too expensive to add him and their 19-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son with epilepsy.\n\nMNsure\u2019s option was much more affordable, he said.\n\n\u201cI feel like I just won the $6 million lottery,\u201d he said as his application completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "With website still balky, navigators play an urgent role as Minnesotans race state's Dec. 31 health insurance deadline.", "title": "Sign-up 'navigators' are helping to ease MNsure headaches", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/mnsure-helpers-are-lifelines-to-frustrated-customers/237103701/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_13878543386114.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_13878543386114.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "With website still balky, navigators play an urgent role as Minnesotans race state's Dec. 31 health insurance deadline.", "title": "Sign-up 'navigators' are helping to ease MNsure headaches", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/mnsure-helpers-are-lifelines-to-frustrated-customers/237103701/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_13878543386114.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_13878543386114.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "With website still balky, navigators play an urgent role as Minnesotans race state's Dec. 31 health insurance deadline."}, "article_summary": "\u201cI feel like I just won the $6 million lottery,\u201d he said as his application completed.\nBut as frustrated consumers continue to struggle with the MNsure website or wait on hold for its overwhelmed hot line, navigators are emerging as even more important lifelines.\nWith a key deadline looming and the MNsure health insurance website still experiencing technical glitches, agencies that help Minnesotans find a health plan have shifted into high gear.\nOn Saturday, Portico had turned to a classroom approach, with six adults working on laptops as four helpers looked over their shoulders.\nTrained helpers known as \u201cnavigators\u201d were always envisioned as a key enrollment strategy for MNsure, with many of them coming from social service agencies, like Portico, that work with poor and uninsured Minnesotans."}
