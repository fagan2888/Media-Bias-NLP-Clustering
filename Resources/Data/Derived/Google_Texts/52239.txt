EDITOR: One of the more important local races in some of Portage County is the 70th Assembly race where Amy Sue Vruwink has served the towns of Carson, Dewey and Hull for 12 years. When Republicans took over the majority a few years ago, they artfully redrew Vruwink's district so that she no longer represented the city of Marshfield or the town of Linwood, or even some of her neighbors and relatives in Milladore, but instead included in her district much of Monroe County, including Sparta and Tomah.

Vruwink has always put people ahead of politics, but partisan members of the Assembly wanted to insure their handpicked opponent would have an advantage because now this newly drawn district is much less safe for a Democrat's re-election.

I remember two years ago when Vruwink was running behind in her race on election night, until Portage County came in and put her over the top. Since then she has worked extremely hard to get to know her constituents in Monroe County. She explains to all of the residents of her district that during her last 12 years she has fought for family supporting jobs, affordable healthcare, and sportsman's rights. She is a strong advocate of veterans and works to serve all Wisconsinites in a bipartisan fashion.

Vruwink's opponent has been unwilling to meet in debate or visit this part of the district. She would not serve us well because she doesn't care to know us or let us know her. I for one will support Rep. Amy Sue Vruwink because she is my friend, neighbor, and I know she will work for us in Madison as she has in the past. Please get out and vote Nov. 4.

Dave Way,

town of Hull
