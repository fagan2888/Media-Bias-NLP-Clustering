The dozen (at last count!) Republican presidential candidates seem to be fighting for parts in an updated version of "Twelve Angry Men," the uplifting 1957 movie that dealt with a jury trying to reach consensus. At the beginning of the film they are all against acquittal of the defendant; at the end, all have reasonable doubt of his guilt. Here, unfortunately, all of the Republican wanna-be presidents fail to act on reason, no matter what the issue—Obamacare, abortion, immigration, taxes, climate change, foreign policy, marriage. Instead, they have memorized party lines.

They certainly have the anger part down and the negativity, but they don't offer any reasonable solutions to the problems facing our nation. And the spirit in their deliberation rooms seems mean and counter-productive. For example, what sense does it make to continue to deprive more of their own citizens access to better healthcare, as some of these governors are when they turn down Medicaid expansion? The candidates are great at grand-standing but not at sitting down with their sleeves up, ready to work on problems. (By the way, where is our own governor?!). "No, no, no" is the monotonous, consistent drone of their drivel. All bluster and no muster. They run around seeking greatness rather than sitting at their desks earning it.

We need candidates who understand the ground zero issues of common people and thrive in the workroom of reason not ambition, who broach ideas that can be debated on their merits—as I believe President Obama has tried to do, year after year (on healthcare, climate, immigration, etc.), only to be met with naysayers, these and other Con Men who are simply against everything because "He must be guilty."

Don't be conned.
