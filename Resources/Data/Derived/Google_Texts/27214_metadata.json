Texas state troopers during traffic stops have listed large numbers of Hispanics \u2013 including those with swarthy skin and Spanish surnames who speak only Spanish \u2013 as being white. The disingenuous record-keeping is described in an online article, \u201c Texas troopers ticketing Hispanic drivers as white ,\" which was published on Saturday by feisty Austin news channel KXAN.\n\nKXAN reporters Brian Collister and Joe Ellis said they had \u201cuncovered the discrepancies while reviewing more than 16 million DPS traffic citation records dating back to 2010.\u201d\n\nAnd to drive home that point, their in-depth article included a collage of 25 mug shots of people who obviously weren't white \u2013 yet who state police had identified as white. \u201cAre these people white?\u201d the article asked. Among several outrageous examples of Hispanics being categorized as white was the case of Pastor Gonzalez Sosa, who was pulled over earlier this year. \u201cIn the dashcam video obtained by KXAN through an open records request, Sosa speaks Spanish to the trooper and tells him he is from Mexico,\u201d KXAN noted. \u201cBut the Hispanic trooper, who also speaks Spanish, documented Sosa's race as white on the citation.\u201d\n\nKXAN said it had \u201cdiscovered the Department of Public Safety data shows more than 1.9 million drivers with traditionally Hispanic names listed as white over the past five years. For the same time period, approximately 1.6 million were reported as Hispanic.\u201d\n\nThe five most common last names of drivers stopped and recorded as white were Smith, followed by Garcia, Martinez, Hernandez, Gonzalez and Rodriguez.\n\nState troopers are required to list race and ethnicity under a law written to help prevent racial profiling, KXAN explained. The statue states that officers must report \u201cthe person's race or ethnicity, as stated by the person or, if the person does not state the person's race or ethnicity, as determined by the officer to the best of the officer's ability.\u201d\n\nSo what's going on? KXAN never nailed down that question. But given the national preoccupation with racial profiling, you have to wonder if state troopers who engaged in the false record keeping are doing so out of a sense of self-preservation. Specifically, they may be falsifying their records to avoid the appearance of being racial profilers -- of pulling over greater numbers of Hispanics and other minorities than whites.\n\nHispanics are 39% of Texas' population while \u201cwhite Anglos\u201d comprise 43%. According to left-leaning politicians and ethnic lobbies, crime rates that fail to reflect these demographics (and that instead show blacks and Hispanics committing crimes at greater rates than whites) must reflect profiling by racist cops.\n\nDisingenuous record keeping by the Texas Department of Public Safety is probably just the tip of the iceberg \u2013 and no doubt reaches into cities and towns across Texas, and to states all over America. Consider, for example, that several months ago in Austin, my car was stolen by three Hispanic males, all 20 years old. Austin police arrested the men 24 hours later \u2013 and submitted a report identifying them as white.\n\nIf the false record keeping in Texas is part of a national trend, it of course means that national crime statistics are deeply flawed \u2013 and that soaring crime rates attributed to Hispanics and blacks are even worse than what current statistics reveal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/11/whoops_texas_state_troopers_classifying_hispanics_as_white.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Whoops!
