But it was Fox News that, residing atop what Jon Stewart often refers to as Bullshit Mountain, began the media circus over the so-called attack on the Christian holiday in 2004 (Media Matters has nearly 100 posts tagged with \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d since then). Over the years, Fox has come up with a host of bizarre evidence of this so-called attack on Christians \u2014 here are a few of the most ridiculous ones:\n\n1. The word \u201choliday\u201d\n\nFox\u2019s first declaration of the War on Christmas as we know it today began with none other than that shouting voice with a face, Bill O\u2019Reilly, who was furious with stores that didn\u2019t mention the word \u201cChristmas\u201d with holiday displays. To this day, the mention of the word \u201choliday\u201d has been seen by O\u2019Reilly and his fellow anchors as a dirty word.\n\n2. The banning of stuff that no one is actually banning\n\nBecause the War on Christmas is not a real thing, Fox News anchors occasionally say some not-real things to support their not-real claims. For example, in 2004, Sean Hannity said that a New Jersey school had banned \u201cSilent Night\u201d from a musical performance in 2004. Though the school had planned to leave the song off after one one parent objected to the inclusion of the Christmas carol, the parent later withdrew the objection, and the song remained on the bill.\n\nIn 2005, O\u2019Reilly falsely claimed that a Texas school district \u201ctold students they couldn\u2019t wear red and green because they were Christmas colors,\u201d calling it \u201cfascist.\u201d The school district responded by releasing an official statement, and asking O\u2019Reilly to retract his.\n\n3. Jewish people who don\u2019t live in Israel, basically\n\nThe following is a direct quote from O\u2019Reilly in 2004 (emphasis mine):\n\n\u201cAll right. Well, what I\u2019m tellin\u2019 you, [caller], is I think you\u2019re takin\u2019 it too seriously,\u201d began O\u2019Reilly to a Jewish caller who complained about the emphasis schools place on Christian traditions in 2005. \u201cYou have a predominantly Christian nation. You have a federal holiday based on the philosopher Jesus. And you don\u2019t wanna hear about it? Come on, [caller] \u2014 if you are really offended, you gotta go to Israel then. I mean because we live in a country founded on Judeo \u2014 and that\u2019s your guys\u2019 \u2014 Christian \u2014 that\u2019s my guys\u2019 \u2014 philosophy. But overwhelmingly, America is Christian. And the holiday is a federal holiday honoring the philosopher Jesus. So, you don\u2019t wanna hear about it? Impossible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fox thinks Christianity is under attack, thanks to non-white Santas, freedom of speech and the word \"holiday\" VIDEO", "title": "9 reasons Fox News thinks there\u2019s a war on Christmas", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Fox thinks Christianity is under attack, thanks to non-white Santas, freedom of speech and the word \"holiday\" VIDEO", "title": "9 reasons Fox News thinks there\u2019s a war on Christmas", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/24/9_reasons_fox_news_thinks_theres_a_war_on_christmas/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/maxresdefault.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fox thinks Christianity is under attack, thanks to non-white Santas, freedom of speech and the word \"holiday\" VIDEO", "title": "9 reasons Fox News thinks there\u2019s a war on Christmas", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/maxresdefault.jpg", "creator": "@prachigu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Prachi Gupta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Best of 2013, Bill O'Reilly, Christianity, Christmas, Editor's Picks, Fox News, Holidays, Jon Stewart, Megyn Kelly, Sean Hannity, Video, War on Christmas", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ee6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Best of 2013, Bill O'Reilly, Christianity, Christmas, Editor's Picks, Fox News, Holidays, Jon Stewart, Megyn Kelly, Sean Hannity, Video, War on Christmas, Media News, Entertainment NewsAs Daniel Denvir explains in Politico, the War on Christmas has a rich history rooted in right-wing America.\nTo this day, the mention of the word \u201choliday\u201d has been seen by O\u2019Reilly and his fellow anchors as a dirty word.\nThe banning of stuff that no one is actually banningBecause the War on Christmas is not a real thing, Fox News anchors occasionally say some not-real things to support their not-real claims.\nThe word \u201choliday\u201dFox\u2019s first declaration of the War on Christmas as we know it today began with none other than that shouting voice with a face, Bill O\u2019Reilly, who was furious with stores that didn\u2019t mention the word \u201cChristmas\u201d with holiday displays.\nJewish people who don\u2019t live in Israel, basicallyThe following is a direct quote from O\u2019Reilly in 2004 (emphasis mine):\u201cAll right."}
