Planned Parenthood has denied profiting off the sale of fetal organs and called the videos \u201cheavily edited.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Medical Progress has also made the full, unedited videos of its meetings with Planned Parenthood executives available on its YouTube account.\n\nThe Media Research Center found that since the release of the first video on July 14, the three networks have devoted 1 minute and 13 seconds to showing video from the Center for Medical Progress with audio.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 1 minute, 13 seconds out of 243 hours and 30 minutes of morning and evening news shows,\u201d the Media Research Center\u2019s Katie Yoder wrote in a piece published last week.\n\nOnly 6 percent of the networks\u2019 total time spent covering the Planned Parenthood controversy consisted of playing the footage itself.\n\nDuring that 1 minute and 13 seconds, no graphic footage of fetal body parts was shown, although two of the videos depict Planned Parenthood staffers dissecting fetal remains.\n\nIn 243 hours and 30 minutes of airtime since the videos were released, 0.16 percent of their coverage was about the Center for Medical Progress videos, and 0.008 percent of the time consisted of playing the videos themselves.\n\nFor contrast, according to the study, the same three networks spent 88 minutes over the course of 3 days covering the undercover video of then-Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201c47 percent\u201d comments.\n\nThey also spent more than 2 hours in 3 and a half days covering the undercover video of former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling\u2019s racially charged remarks.\n\nIn a previous study by the Media Research Center, Yoder writes that the anchors and correspondents at the networks have not used the word \u201cbaby\u201d in their coverage, opting instead for terms like \u201caborted fetuses\u201d and \u201cfetal organs.\u201d CBS once used the phrase \u201cbody parts.\u201d\n\nSpokespersons for ABC, NBC, and CBS did not immediately respond to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ABC, NBC and CBS have \u201ccensored\u201d their coverage of the undercover Planned Parenthood videos, according to an analysis by the Media Research Center.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "ABC, NBC and CBS have \u201ccensored\u201d their coverage of the undercover Planned Parenthood videos, according to an analysis by the Media Research Center.", "title": "How Much Time ABC, NBC and CBS Have Spent Covering the Planned Parenthood Videos", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150813_NetworksPP_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-18T19:20:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1TBDDzh"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "ABC, NBC and CBS have \u201ccensored\u201d their coverage of the undercover Planned Parenthood videos, according to an analysis by the Media Research Center.", "title": "How Much Time ABC, NBC and CBS Have Spent Covering the Planned Parenthood Videos", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150813_NetworksPP_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2015-08-18T09:39:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-18T19:20:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Center for Medical Progress, Media Research Center, Planned Parenthood videos, undercover Planned Parenthood videos"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b75\"", "article_summary": "Only 6 percent of the networks\u2019 total time spent covering the Planned Parenthood controversy consisted of playing the footage itself.\nThe Center for Medical Progress\u2019s undercover videos depict Planned Parenthood executives discussing the sale of fetal organs at the organization\u2019s affiliates.\nABC, NBC, and CBS have \u201ccensored\u201d their coverage of undercover videos released by the Center for Medical Progress, according to an analysis conducted by the Media Research Center.\nThey also spent more than 2 hours in 3 and a half days covering the undercover video of former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling\u2019s racially charged remarks.\nPlanned Parenthood has denied profiting off the sale of fetal organs and called the videos \u201cheavily edited.\u201dThe Center for Medical Progress has also made the full, unedited videos of its meetings with Planned Parenthood executives available on its YouTube account."}
