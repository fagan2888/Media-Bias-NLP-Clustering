A sampling of how much some Lowcountry municipalities will receive, rounded to the nearest dollar: Counties Georgetown: $56,339 Berkeley: $16,086 Colleton: $7,411 Cities/towns Isle of Palms: $52,496 Folly Beach: $9,113 Summerville: $4,958 Kiawah Island: $2,391 Moncks Corner: $846 Edisto Beach: $694 Yemassee: $682 Walterboro: $285 Court document\n\nNot from the IRS, though.\n\nThe city of North Charleston and Charleston County stand to collect more than half of a seven-figure legal settlement with a long list of travel websites, most of them owned and operated by Expedia, Priceline, Travelocity and Orbitz.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest turn in a long-running nationwide dispute over hospitality taxes that many municipalities charge hotels and, in turn, their guests.\n\nThe issue first reared its head about a decade ago, when cash-strapped local and state governments felt they were being short-changed by Web-based travel sites. It centered on the industry\u2019s standard practice of reserving blocks of hotel rooms at discounted rates and then reselling them one by one at a profit.\n\nThe lawsuits began to fly when tax officials discovered that the booking businesses were basing their remittances, if they were remitting them at all, on the lower prices. The online firms have argued that only the wholesale rate they negotiate with hotels is taxable.\n\nThe spreads don\u2019t amount to much on a single booking, but they sure add up. An analysis this year by BloombergBusiness estimated that Expedia could be on the hook for an $847 million retroactive tax bill \u2014 that is, in the highly unlikely event it loses all of the legal challenges it\u2019s still facing.\n\nThe S.C. Supreme Court already has weighed in on the issue in a 2011 decision that sent a chill across the online travel landscape. It upheld a previous legal ruling and ordered Expedia subsidiary Travelscape in 2011 to pay more than $6.3 million in sales taxes for Internet hotel bookings it had brokered within the state.\n\nCharleston and Mount Pleasant also have gone to the mat over the accommodations money in a court case they filed with North Myrtle Beach. Their 2006 lawsuit was settled for $900,000 about three years ago. Of that, Charleston pocketed $657,000, and Mount Pleasant was paid $50,000.\n\nNorth Charleston, which charges hotels a 2 percent room tax, brought its own challenge in mid-2013 with Columbia and Aiken County. Charleston County joined in later. Circuit Judge R. Markley Dennis approved class-action status for the complaint in February.\n\nThe original lawsuit didn\u2019t say how much money was at stake. Described as a compromise to avoid further litigation, the $3.5 million settlement figure was reached after two mediation sessions and an analysis of hotel transactions by forensic accountants at Dixon Hughes Goodman.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are paid their requested 25 percent cut and reimbursed about $97,000 for expenses, about $2.49 million will be left for everyone else, assuming the deal is approved. The pot would be divided up among 23 counties and nearly 50 cities and towns all over South Carolina, unless they opt out of the settlement.\n\nOf the four main plaintiffs, Charleston County is poised to cash the biggest check, almost $1.16 million. North Charleston will collect about $240,600. Columbia and Aiken County are expecting to recover $303,689 and $8,431, respectively.\n\nThe other South Carolina government bodies were added to the class because they hadn\u2019t previously brought their own lawsuits, said Charleston attorney Jesse Kirchner, who helped file the case. Their proposed payments from the travel websites range from about $67,953 for Richland County to just $16.39 for tiny Westminster, in Oconee County.\n\nThe settlement is up for approval at a fairness hearing this week in the heart of downtown Charleston, the land of many a hotel room.\n\nContact John McDermott at 937-5572", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "North Charleston, county settling hotel tax dispute with travel websites, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalTourism, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nJohn McDermott, \r\nJohn McDermott, Accommodations tax,Aiken County,Charleston County,Columbia,Expedia,hotel taxes,Markley Dennis,Mount Pleasant,North Charleston,Orbitz,Supreme Court,tourism,Travelocity", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "As tax season enters the home stretch, a couple of local governments are anticipating some hefty refunds.", "title": "North Charleston, county settling hotel tax dispute with travel websites", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150405/150409772/north-charleston-county-settling-hotel-tax-dispute-with-travel-websites", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150405/PC05/150409772/AR/0/AR-150409772.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150405/PC05/150409772/AR/0/AR-150409772.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As tax season enters the home stretch, a couple of local governments are anticipating some hefty refunds.", "title": "North Charleston, county settling hotel tax dispute with travel websites", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150405/PC05/150409772/AR/0/AR-150409772.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150409772}}, "keywords": "North Charleston, county settling hotel tax dispute with travel websites , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalTourism, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nJohn McDermott, \r\nJohn McDermott, Accommodations tax,Aiken County,Charleston County,Columbia,Expedia,hotel taxes,Markley Dennis,Mount Pleasant,North Charleston,Orbitz,Supreme Court,tourism,Travelocity", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-05T08:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-03T12:50:00Z", "author": "John McDermott"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "As tax season enters the home stretch, a couple of local governments are anticipating some hefty refunds."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb200\"", "article_summary": "The travel website Expedia will pay more than $2.2 million of the $3.5 million legal settlement with North Charleston, Charleston County and two other plaintiffs.\nCheck-in time The $3.5 million hotel tax settlement is being funded by: Expedia, $2,220,414; Priceline, $549,292; Orbitz, $392,083; and Travelocity, $347,083.\nNorth Charleston, which charges hotels a 2 percent room tax, brought its own challenge in mid-2013 with Columbia and Aiken County.\nThe city of North Charleston and Charleston County stand to collect more than half of a seven-figure legal settlement with a long list of travel websites, most of them owned and operated by Expedia, Priceline, Travelocity and Orbitz.\nOf the four main plaintiffs, Charleston County is poised to cash the biggest check, almost $1.16 million."}
