But interviews with industry officials indicate some insurers, such as Blue Shield and Molina Healthcare Inc., picked up more business while others lost ground during the Affordable Care Act\u2019s third open enrollment.\n\nUntil now, Anthem Inc. had led Obamacare enrollment in California with 30 percent share of the market. But now rival Blue Shield has jumped ahead.\n\n\u201cOur competitive position did improve,\u201d said Ken Wood, senior vice president of consumer markets at San Francisco-based Blue Shield. \u201cA better price position meant better retention and more new enrollment.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Anthem declined to discuss the company\u2019s California results ahead of the exchange\u2019s announcement. But last month, the company said its Obamacare enrollment in California and 13 other states was 30 percent lower than expected and rivals\u2019 lower rates were one reason. Anthem Blue Cross is California\u2019s largest for-profit insurer.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t experiencing the overall market growth on the public exchanges that we projected when we laid out our five-year plan and unsustainable pricing in some markets is hurting our historic market share,\u201d Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish said during a Jan. 27 conference call with analysts and investors.\n\nLast week, Covered California said about 425,000 new enrollees had picked out coverage but more last-minute applicants were being counted. Nearly 1.2 million consumers had renewed their policies, bringing enrollment to about 1.6 million.\n\nUse Our Content This story can be republished for free ( details ).\n\nEnrollment totals will increase some as many people rushed to beat the Jan. 31 sign-up deadline. But the final tally will likely drop because some people don\u2019t pay their initial premium or they find coverage elsewhere.\n\nThe California exchange added two new insurers for this year \u2014 Oscar and UnitedHealth Group Inc. \u2014 but neither garnered much enrollment, according to sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nBoth Oscar and UnitedHealth are only selling policies in a limited number of regions and each insurer had less than 1,000 enrollees by early January.\n\nCovered California had denied UnitedHealth\u2019s bid to sell statewide during 2016 and instead limited the insurer to five of the state\u2019s 19 rating regions, primarily rural counties in Northern California. Then in November, the company announced heavy losses on individual policies across the country, and it cut back on marketing of exchange coverage companywide.\n\nOscar, on the other hand, blanketed Southern California with ads touting its high-tech, customer friendly approach to healthcare. But its initial sales in Los Angeles and Orange counties were modest, according to sources who saw preliminary enrollment totals.\n\nThe New York company was a relative unknown in California and going up against established insurers with strong name recognition and existing networks of doctors and hospitals. The company hasn\u2019t commented on its California enrollment, but overall it covers more than 125,000 people in New York, New Jersey, Texas and California.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled by the reaction we have received entering the California marketplace this year,\u201d Oscar Chief Executive Mario Schlosser said in a statement. \u201cOur priority is to provide simple, intuitive healthcare for our new members and we look forward to continued expansion and growth throughout the state.\u201d\n\nHMO giant Kaiser Permanente appears on track to remain in third place in Covered California, behind Blue Shield and Anthem. Molina, based in Long Beach, also made substantial gains during open enrollment after a smaller presence the first two years, according to people familiar with the market.\n\nPeter Lee, executive director of Covered California, said the exchange plans to release detailed data on enrollment by health plans and ethnicity later this month. The state spent $29 million on marketing during the recent open enrollment to attract the uninsured and persuade existing enrollees to renew.\n\n\u201cMost of us are healthy. But you need to remind people just because you didn\u2019t use your insurance it\u2019s still something you need,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHealth insurance marketplaces need to be constant sales and renewal machines.\u201d\n\nBlue Shield of California Foundation helps fund KHN coverage in California.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anthem sign-ups are trailing, and UnitedHealth and newcomer Oscar are playing a minor role in coverage thus far, according to unofficial reports.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Anthem sign-ups are trailing, and UnitedHealth and newcomer Oscar are playing a minor role in coverage thus far, according to unofficial reports.", "title": "Blue Shield Top Choice On California Exchange", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/blue-shield-top-choice-on-california-exchange/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://californiahealthline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/california-podium-770.png", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://californiahealthline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/california-podium-770.png?w=640"}, "site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-02-10T10:00:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-10T15:12:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1694\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOur competitive position did improve,\u201d said Ken Wood, senior vice president of consumer markets at San Francisco-based Blue Shield.\nFor the first time in three years, Blue Shield of California leads enrollment in the state\u2019s insurance exchange while Oscar, a closely watched newcomer, experienced a slow start.\n\u201cHealth insurance marketplaces need to be constant sales and renewal machines.\u201dBlue Shield of California Foundation helps fund KHN coverage in California.\nLast week, Covered California said about 425,000 new enrollees had picked out coverage but more last-minute applicants were being counted.\nBut now rival Blue Shield has jumped ahead."}
