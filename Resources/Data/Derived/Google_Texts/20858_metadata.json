Scott Perry (R-PA) for his party\u2019s willingness to shut down the government and compromise the full faith and credit of the United States to defund a law of the land that was legitimately passed and upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nPerry twisted himself into knots in an attempt to legitimize the GOP strategy of shutting down the government while denying the gravity of a government shutdown. He insisted that \u201cMedicare patients are going to get their checks. People in the army are going to receive their paychecks.\u201d Watch it:\n\nThe Hardball host ridiculed House GOP leadership for its proposed debt ceiling bill, calling it a \u201cDear Santa letter of Republican pipe dreams, including the dismantling of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Matthews continued by tearing into the Republican\u2019s unprecedented strategy, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of the congress holding up the government saying they will not continue to exist unless we kill a law of the land. It\u2019s never been done that I\u2019ve ever heard of.\u201d\n\nWhile the Pennsylvania Republican initially asserted that this strategy had been employed many times, he was unable to name a single instance in the face of Matthews\u2019 repeated questioning.\n\nFinally, Perry surrendered, admitting \u201cI don\u2019t know if its happened before\u2026\u201d\n\nMatthews pressed the congressman further, asking him, \u201cHow about the defaulting on debts? Will it matter?\u201d In response, Perry seemed to reject the widely-held belief that a failure to raise the debt ceiling would have dire economic consequences, saying \u201cLet me tell you what matters to the American people. Trillion dollar deficits unbridled with no plan to change it.\u201d\n\nChristopher Butterfield is an intern for ThinkProgress.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Rep.
