Rudy Giuliani on Thursday ruled out another run for mayor of New York City but suggested he would be open to pursuing another political office.

“As to would I run for another office? Sure, I’d think about that. But not mayor again. I did it, and it was a great job, and now somebody else gets a chance to do it,” Giuliani said on “CBS This Morning.”

He did not specify any particular public office he would pursue.

Giuliani’s appearance mainly focused on the opening of the National September 11 Memorial Museum, which he visited on Wednesday.

“It was difficult. In some ways more difficult, because it’s been so long,” he said about his visit.

Giuliani, 69, ran New York's City Hall as mayor from 1994 until 2001 and said he has to move on from that experience.

“I believe you can’t go back,” he said. “You know, you do a job with all your heart, all your soul, you do a lot of good things; you make some mistakes; now it’s history and you move on to other things.”

At an event in Manhattan on Monday, former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) joked that he would lead a future campaign for Giuliani if he chose to run for mayor again in 2017.

"But I would like to take this opportunity tonight to confirm that if asked, I would be willing to chair the Rudy 2017 campaign against Bill de Blasio,” Bush joked, drawing loud applause.

Giuliani mounted a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. Bush is currently considering a presidential run in 2016.

The former mayor said Thursday that he’s been busy advising the Colombian government on how to reduce crime in its country.
