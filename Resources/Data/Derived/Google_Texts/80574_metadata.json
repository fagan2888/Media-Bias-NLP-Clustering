And immigrants are starting small businesses at about twice the rate of nonimmigrant individuals.\n\nThough immigrants are only 13 percent of the nation\u2019s population, according to the latest U.S. Census figures, foreign-born entrepreneurs account for about 30 percent of the share of small business growth since the mid-1990s.\n\nThe share of new Latino business owners is also growing, and is evident in cities like Gainesville, where about 42 percent of the population is Latino or Hispanic.\n\nFurthermore, according to Census figures and the Immigration Policy Center, the research arm of the nonprofit American Immigration Council, immigrants made up less than 15 percent of the population in the Atlanta metropolitan area in 2010 while foreign-born individuals owned more than 20 percent of all businesses there.\n\nBusiness ownership growth rates among native-born persons have remained flat or slightly declined over last 20 years, according to the Kauffman report.\n\nImmigrants from Mexico account for the biggest portion of foreign-born entrepreneurs, followed by individuals from India and other countries in Asia.\n\nMedrano said his father learned the family business as a teenager in Mexico, making homespun ice cream as a way to support his mother.\n\nAfter years of odd jobs in California, such as installing windows, Medrano said his father realized opening an ice cream parlor could be a way to both indulge a passion and support a family.\n\nThe family now owns four stores, including one in Norcross.\n\nBut perhaps the final straw pushing Medrano\u2019s father to start his own business was the same motivation many entrepreneurs likely feel.\n\n\u201cHe was just tired of working for other people,\u201d Medrano said of his father.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/110325/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2015/06/14/0615immigrant4.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Edgar Medrano, 23, shakes his head in amazement when thinking about the history of his family\u2019s business.", "title": "Local family business highlights growth of immigrant entrepreneurs"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Local family business highlights growth of immigrant entrepreneurs"}, "article_summary": "Immigrants from Mexico account for the biggest portion of foreign-born entrepreneurs, followed by individuals from India and other countries in Asia.\nBut perhaps the final straw pushing Medrano\u2019s father to start his own business was the same motivation many entrepreneurs likely feel.\nBusiness ownership growth rates among native-born persons have remained flat or slightly declined over last 20 years, according to the Kauffman report.\nMedrano said his father learned the family business as a teenager in Mexico, making homespun ice cream as a way to support his mother.\n\u201cThey decided they liked it,\u201d Medrano said of his parents\u2019 decision to relocate and start their own business \u2014 La Mejor de Michoacan."}
