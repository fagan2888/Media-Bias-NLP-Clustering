In the words of Jon Stewart: \u201cPass the nachos, mama.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese kinds of things keep on surfacing in part because you and your TV station will promote them,\u201d Obama told O\u2019Reilly.\n\nStewart\u2019s reaction to Obama's smack down of Fox News:\n\n\u201cHoly Moley. That is quite an accusation\u2014that Fox News unfairly promotes, and in some cases creates scandals for the sole purpose of undermining this president. Although, in Obama\u2019s defense, it is true. That is exactly what Fox does every day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It took a couple of days, but Jon Stewart finally got around to addressing the truly enlightening\u00a0interview\u00a0that Fox aired between Bill O\u2019Reilly and President Barack Obama before Super Bowl XLVIII.", "title": "News, opinion and aggregation on business, politics, entertainment, technology, global and national \u2013 The Wire", "og": {"site_name": "The Wire", "description": "It took a couple of days, but Jon Stewart finally got around to addressing the truly enlightening\u00a0interview\u00a0that Fox aired between Bill O\u2019Reilly and President Barack Obama before Super Bowl XLVIII.", "title": "Jon Stewart Picks Apart Bill O'Reilly and the 'Fox Scandal Grab-Bag'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/02/05/Screen_Shot_2014_02_05_at_8.22.36_AM/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/02/jon-stewart-picks-apart-bill-oreilly-and-fox-scandal-grab-bag/357739/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It took a couple of days, but Jon Stewart finally got around to addressing the truly enlightening\u00a0interview\u00a0that Fox aired between Bill O\u2019Reilly and President Barack Obama before Super Bowl XLVIII.", "title": "Jon Stewart Picks Apart Bill O'Reilly and the 'Fox Scandal Grab-Bag'", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/02/05/Screen_Shot_2014_02_05_at_8.22.36_AM/lead_large.png", "creator": "@bencosman", "site": "@thewire", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "app_id": 192759427473466}, "keywords": "The Wire, TheWire.com, TheWire.com, news, opinion, aggregation, business, politics, entertainment, technology, global, national", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticWire"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d91\"", "article_summary": "In the words of Jon Stewart: \u201cPass the nachos, mama.\u201d\u201cThese kinds of things keep on surfacing in part because you and your TV station will promote them,\u201d Obama told O\u2019Reilly.\nThe highlight of the interview came when O\u2019Reilly asked the president if he thought the interview was unfair, to which Obama responded, \u201cabsolutely.\u201d Oh boy.\nIt took a couple of days, but Jon Stewart finally got around to addressing the truly enlightening interview that Fox aired between Bill O\u2019Reilly and President Barack Obama before Super Bowl XLVIII\u2014or, as Stewart called it, the interview between \u201cthe most powerful man in the free world\u201d and Obama.\nThat is quite an accusation\u2014that Fox News unfairly promotes, and in some cases creates scandals for the sole purpose of undermining this president.\nStewart\u2019s reaction to Obama's smack down of Fox News:\u201cHoly Moley."}
