They promise to help address stretched healthcare providers, who feel the effects of a rapidly ageing population and squeezed public health budgets.\n\nExamples range from wearable tech to measure vital signs and fitness to more futuristic devices such as the digital contact lenses being crafted by Novartis and Google that could help diabetes sufferers by measuring glucose levels in their tear fluid.\n\nSuch outlandish ideas are catching the eye of the world\u2019s elite business school students, who may once have sought out careers at McKinsey or Goldman Sachs, but are increasingly lured by the prospect of innovation and having a positive impact on society.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a more exciting time to be in the healthcare industry,\u201d says Blake Long, chief clinical officer at Mosaic Health Solutions, which invests in companies pioneering innovation in healthcare. \u201cThe digital revolution is having a monumental impact,\u201d says Blake, who studied at Duke\u2019s Fuqua School of Business, pointing to data analytics, which impacts precision medicine.\n\nThe gentle switch to healthcare among MBA students mirrors some of the brightest business minds. David Ebersman for example, former chief financial officer at Facebook, launched Lyra Health, a start-up using big data to aid treatment of depression and anxiety. Phil Mui, head of analytics at Google, swapped search engine for 3D modelling at HeartFlow, a start-up working on diagnosing heart disease.\n\n\u201cWe call these people e-health managers,\u201d says Federico Lega, director of the masters in international healthcare management at SDA Bocconi School of Management.\n\nCareer opportunities are sprouting at global health giants such as Anthem, Johnson & Johnson and GSK, but also at nimble life sciences start-ups bringing biotechnology to market, and also tech companies like Google, Apple and Samsung, which are exploring digital health.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of new fields emerging in the digital revolution,\u201d says Eivor Oborn, professor of healthcare management at Warwick Business School.\n\nEivor points to three sources of career expansion: analyzing data to inform patient health, health organization efficiency, and medical research. \u201cThese are all growth areas,\u201d she says.\n\nTuyen Huynh, pictured right, will join the leadership development program at McKesson , the largest US pharmaceutical distributor. He is attracted by the innovation which has the potential to improve patient health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As tech transforms healthcare, MBA jobs abound", "og": {"site_name": "BusinessBecause", "description": "As tech transforms healthcare, MBA jobs abound", "title": "Digital Health Revolution Creates MBA Careers With A Dose Of Social Impact", "url": "http://www.businessbecause.com/news/working-in-healthcare/3736/digital-health-revolution-creates-mba-careers", "image": "http://d311ua4en7j8ch.cloudfront.net/uploads/default/news/images/c3b3c8096bd3d7de.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "businessbecause.com", "description": "As tech transforms healthcare, MBA jobs abound", "creator": "@businessbecause", "image": {"src": "http://d311ua4en7j8ch.cloudfront.net/uploads/default/news/images/c3b3c8096bd3d7de.png"}, "title": "Digital Health Revolution Creates MBA Careers With A Dose Of Social Impact", "site": "@businessbecause", "card": "summary"}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-24", "fb": {"app_id": 170576704515}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Eivor points to three sources of career expansion: analyzing data to inform patient health, health organization efficiency, and medical research.\n\u201cThere are a number of new fields emerging in the digital revolution,\u201d says Eivor Oborn, professor of healthcare management at Warwick Business School.\nThe digital health revolution is in full swing, powered by whizzy new technologies that promise to transform patient care by spurring more efficient means of monitoring and managing people\u2019s medical conditions.\n\u201cThe digital revolution is having a monumental impact,\u201d says Blake, who studied at Duke\u2019s Fuqua School of Business, pointing to data analytics, which impacts precision medicine.\nHe is attracted by the innovation which has the potential to improve patient health."}
