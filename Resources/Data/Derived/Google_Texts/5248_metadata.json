Morgan, who has known Trump for over a decade, says he\u2019s not a racist. He\u2019s not a fan of his politics either, but he admits that after these bombings that have left over 30 dead and hundreds wounded, and the United States\u2019 indifference in stopping future ISIS attacks, it may be time to take the billionaire magnate more seriously on terrorism:\n\nIt was set up a couple of weeks ago, but the timing was eerily prescient.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nI spoke to Trump for 40 minutes. He was, as you\u2019d expect, bombastic, defiant and self-congratulatory. Why wouldn\u2019t he be? He\u2019s ripped up every political rulebook to take this presidential race by storm, a scenario that is hardly going to deflate the ego of New York\u2019s most cock-sure billionaire tycoon.\n\nBut he also spoke in more detail about his plans to combat ISIS and I found myself nodding more than I expected.\n\nTrump told me countries must tighten their borders in light of these terror attacks, especially to anyone related to an ISIS fighter in Syria.\n\nIs he so wrong?\n\nHe told me he wants law-abiding Muslims to root out the extremists in their midst, expressing his bafflement and anger that someone like Abdeslam was able to hide for so long in the very part of Brussels he had previously lived.\n\nIs he so wrong?\n\nHe told me America must make it far harder for illegal immigrants to enter the U.S. and thinks European countries should follow suit.\n\nIs he so wrong?\n\nHe told me he believes there are now areas of many major European cities which have become poisonous breeding grounds for radicalized Islamic terror.\n\nIs he so wrong?\n\nI didn\u2019t feel I was talking to a lunatic, as many seem to view Trump.\n\nI saw a guy, a non-politician unfettered by PC language restraints, who is genuinely furious at the devastation which ISIS is wreaking, and seriously concerned for the security of his fellow Americans and indeed, the citizens of Europe.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nLet\u2019s be honest with ourselves, right now ISIS is winning this war and will continuing committing utter carnage on our streets on an ever graver and more barbaric scale until they are stopped.\n\nI don\u2019t have the answers to how to do that.\n\nBut I don\u2019t hear any good ideas coming from any world leaders at the moment either, and it\u2019s their highly paid jobs to work it out.\n\nInstead, I see a global paralysis driven by fear, confusion and woeful lack of leadership.\n\nAnd it will only get worse.\n\nHate Donald Trump all you like, but at least he seems to recognize the magnitude of the threat and at least he has firm proposals for how to try to defeat it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Is he so wrong?\".05/27/2016 2:02:33AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"Is he so wrong?\"", "title": "Piers Morgan: Let's Face It, We Should Take Trump More Seriously On Terrorism", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/23/piers-morgan-lets-face-it-we-should-take-trump-more-seriously-on-terrorism-n2138337", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/81/2f74c86b-12f4-4f2d-9afe-bdc9cc4eaad3.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"Is he so wrong?\"", "title": "Piers Morgan: Let's Face It, We Should Take Trump More Seriously On Terrorism", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/23/piers-morgan-lets-face-it-we-should-take-trump-more-seriously-on-terrorism-n2138337", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/81/2f74c86b-12f4-4f2d-9afe-bdc9cc4eaad3.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Piers Morgan: Let's Face It, We Should Take Trump More Seriously On Terrorism , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Some might find Donald Trump incorrigible, bigoted, and a total joke, but after the horrific terrorist attacks in Brussels\u2013he\u2019s finding a new ally: Piers Morgan.\nTrump told me countries must tighten their borders in light of these terror attacks, especially to anyone related to an ISIS fighter in Syria.\nMorgan, who has known Trump for over a decade, says he\u2019s not a racist.\n[\u2026]I spoke to Trump for 40 minutes.\nBut he also spoke in more detail about his plans to combat ISIS and I found myself nodding more than I expected."}
