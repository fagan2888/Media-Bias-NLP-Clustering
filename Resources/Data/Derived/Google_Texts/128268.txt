TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — A federal audit shows the average wait for a new patient at five veterans’ medical treatment facilities in Michigan is longest at a center in Detroit.

Data released Monday by the Department of Veterans Affairs say the average wait there is nearly 31 days, more than twice as long as the department’s 14-day goal. The VA hospital in Ann Arbor was close behind at nearly 30 days.

The wait was nearly 28 days at Battle Creek. There, the audit shows, there were 22,509 appointments scheduled as of May 15, 2014. Of those, 21,521 had been scheduled within 30 days — that 96%. 988, or 4%, had been scheduled outside of 30 days.

Other medical centers’ average wait times included 23 days in Iron Mountain and 22 days in Saginaw.

The audit also shows that 1,555 veterans in Michigan have waited more than three months for medical appointments, while 1,686 who signed up for VA health care within the past decade have yet to see a doctor.
