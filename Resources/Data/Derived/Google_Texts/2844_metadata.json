And this is not the only shift affecting the long-term services and supports (LTSS) market \u2013 there is increased implementation of managed long-term services by state Medicaid programs.\n\nManaged long-term services and supports (MLTSS) programs finance and deliver institutional care and/or HCBS through managed care organizations (MCOs). Historically these services, in particular HCBS, have been provided through the fee-for-service delivery system. States have begun to move to managed LTSS in an effort to control cost, as well as provide a more comprehensive benefit either through additional services or serving additional individuals.\n\nAs of October 2015, there are 18 states that have an MLTSS program in operation. (This excludes states with dual eligible demonstrations and Programs for All Inclusive Care of the Elderly, or PACE.) Additionally, there are seven states with plans to implement LTSS and two states that are expanding their current MLTSS programs.\n\nThe OPEN MINDS team has conducted a new analysis of these MLTSS programs. There are some observations that we found in our analysis:\n\nStates are including dual eligibles, but not the I/DD population \u2013 Of the 18 states with MLTSS programs, 16 use MLTSS to serve the dual eligible population. However, only five states are using MLTSS programs to serve the I/DD population. Historically, both populations are \u201chigh users\u201d of all Medicaid services. What may account for the difference is the large push from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to coordinate care for dual eligibles and the pushback from I/DD stakeholders (see States Grapple With The ACA\u2019s Intellectual & Developmental Disabilities Provisions).\n\nMLTSS is not synonymous with integrated care \u2013 Although many states are providing MLTSS, few are proving a comprehensive set of benefits. Only eight of the eighteen states provide a comprehensive array of benefits (HCBS, institutional care, physical health, behavioral health, and pharmacy services) in a single MCO contract. And three states have MCO contracts that only cover LTSS services. Whether having all services integrated under one organizations is good or bad depends on your perspective (see Carve-Out Or No ).\n\n1115 waivers are authority of choice \u2013 In order to use managed care to finance and deliver MLTSS, states need two approvals from CMS, an HCBS approval and a managed care approval. Although there are a number of ways and combinations that states can use to implement MLTSS, the majority (ten states) have chosen to use a stand-alone 1115 waiver and one state is transitioning to a 1115 waiver. An 1115 waiver gives states greater flexibility in designing their program and can allow them to provide a more comprehensive benefit. For example, five states use their 1115 waiver to provide services to HCBS to individuals who typically do not qualify for these services.\n\nManaged care is likely to continue in LTSS \u2013 with seven more states implementing MLTSS programs in the near future.
