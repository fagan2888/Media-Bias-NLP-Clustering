After introducing President Barack Obama during the Obamacare signing ceremony in 2010, Biden turned to Obama and said, \u201cThis is a big f\u2014\u2014 deal.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the famous and at times infamous Biden gaffes, Aiken said that those moments should not be referred to as gaffes and are, in fact, \u201cmoments of authenticity\u201d that voters respond to positively.\n\n\u201cI think there is something refreshing about it and I think people are starting to recognize that,\u201d Aiken said\n\nAiken previously called Clinton \u201cstiff\u201d and advised her to \u201cloosen up.\u201d\n\n\u201c@HillaryClinton, I love you. But why are you the stiffest and most scripted looking person in this video? #loosenup,\u201d Aiken tweeted.\n\nAiken said such moments of authenticity seem to be resonating with voters and making candidates more likable.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the person who has said more things that would be considered gaffes than anybody else \u2014 Donald Trump \u2014 seriously, and he\u2019s at the top of the pack,\u201d Aiken said. \u201cI don\u2019t think gaffes are a liability. I don\u2019t think they should be called gaffes.\u201d\n\nClinton, who recently appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has sought to become more spontaneous as her campaign moves forward.\n\n\u2018Big mistake\u2019 not to take Trump seriously\n\nAiken, who is also a former competitor on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d knows Trump personally and was actually fired by him on the show. (He came in second to Arsenio Hall in 2012.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a friend of his. I like him as a person. He\u2019s always been very kind to me except for when he made me lose on \u2018The Apprentice,'\u201d Aiken joked of Trump. \u201cBut he\u2019s a good guy and I certainly think people are mistaken if they don\u2019t take him seriously and we see that in the poll numbers.\u201d\n\nAiken likens Trump to \u201cthat uncle, who embarrasses the hell out of you sometimes and you still love them, but damn, you wish they\u2019d shut up.\u201d\n\nBut for Aiken, the \u201cbiggest testament\u201d to Trump being a nice guy are his children.\n\nIvanka, Eric and Donald Jr. \u201care some of the most grounded, smart, un-entitled individuals that you\u2019d ever care to meet,\u201d Aiken said. \u201cThey are incredibly respectful and smart and driven and grounded and I think that\u2019s a testament to somebody as a father.\u201d\n\nWhy he ran for office\n\nAiken said that becoming a father is one of the reasons that prompted him to run for public office. He lost his congressional bid to represent North Carolina\u2019s 2nd District to Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers in 2014.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t run because I wanted to be a politician. I ran because I saw a need. I think that need still exists,\u201d Aiken said, naming education as one of his top issues.\n\nHe said he was disappointed that the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union has already endorsed Clinton.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the NEA, I would have hoped that they had been a little bit more patient to see, first \u2026 to really let us hear the positions of everyone before they endorsed,\u201d Aiken said.\n\nBut he added that none of the candidates on either side have talked about education enough to make him happy.\n\nAiken is an admirer of southern politicians willing to \u201cbuck the trends in the South\u201d and cited former North Carolina Gov. Terry Sanford as his political idol.\n\n\u201cHe was the first and only governor in the South who spoke up against segregation so vocally and he consolidated the university system in North Carolina and really understood the importance of education to improving the economy,\u201d Aiken said.\n\nBut Aiken won\u2019t be running again \u201canytime soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll run in 2016 \u2014 that\u2019s for sure. Probably not in 2018, maybe not even in 2020. I think eventually, I\u2019ll run again,\u201d Aiken said.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "40.712784;-74.005941", "description": "NEW YORK -- Former \"American Idol\" star Clay Aiken once was ready for Hillary, but now the one-time Democratic congressional candidate has passionately endorsed Vice President Joe Biden.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "myfox8.com", "description": "NEW YORK \u2014 Former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d star Clay Aiken once was ready for Hillary, but now the one-time Democratic congressional candidate has passionately endorsed Vice President Joe \u2026", "title": "Clay Aiken drops Clinton; endorses Vice President Joe Biden", "url": "http://myfox8.com/2015/10/09/clay-aiken-drops-clinton-endorses-vice-president-joe-biden/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwghp.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/capture1.jpeg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwghp.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/capture1.jpeg?w=640"}, "site": "@myfox8", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@myfox8"}, "keywords": "news, clay aiken", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Weather, Sports and more from WGHP Fox 8 Television", "google-site-verification": "Yn8rglGvxxL_bChOFSZTPKslhj-7-DDnVf-rpVixhQs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=576468704", "fb": {"pages": 66055982622}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "myfox8.com", "ICBM": "40.712784, -74.005941", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox8news", "published_time": "2015-10-09T18:39:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T18:39:39+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox8news"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://myfox8.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d6825caa4f715bb372290d2344aae986?s=16"}, "article_summary": "\u00d7 Clay Aiken drops Clinton; endorses Vice President Joe BidenNEW YORK \u2014 Former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d star Clay Aiken once was ready for Hillary, but now the one-time Democratic congressional candidate has passionately endorsed Vice President Joe Biden.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think gaffes are a liability.\nBut Aiken won\u2019t be running again \u201canytime soon.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll run in 2016 \u2014 that\u2019s for sure.\nI don\u2019t think they should be called gaffes.\u201dClinton, who recently appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has sought to become more spontaneous as her campaign moves forward.\nAiken said such moments of authenticity seem to be resonating with voters and making candidates more likable."}
