But as they point out, it could all fall apart. The migrant problem could get worse. President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats could still reject the GOP\u2019s plans to step up background checks of Syrian and Iraqi refugees. \u201cOr hardline Republicans might demand its consideration as part of the government funding bill \u2014 which could threaten a shut down,\u201d they write. For now, the details on the GOP plan, here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTODAY: WAYS AND MEANS MUSICAL CHAIRS \u2014 The Ways and Means committee will meet today to iron out subcommittee chairmanships. Sources on and off the Hill still expect the health gavel to go to Rep. Patrick Tiberi, whose office tells us he's \"thoroughly considering his options.\" More today, of course.\n\nGOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING and welcome to PULSE, where we want to applaud President Barack Obama for keeping his promise to quit smoking. He tells GQ it's because he pledged to do so if health care passed, though we recall that two years ago he said he quit because he's scared of Michelle. The interview: http://bit.ly/1HUkrYa. And of course, send those tips and comments: emershon@politico.com and behley@politico.com.\n\n\"Oh yeah, all right. Take it easy, baby. Make it PULSE all night. She was an American girl.\"\n\nSCOOP: LAWMAKERS CALL FOR NIH FUNDING BOOST \u2014 A bipartisan group of more than 100 House members, led by Rep. Suzan DelBene, are urging House Appropriations Committee leaders to provide at least $32 billion to NIH in any forthcoming funding legislation. That's nearly $2 billion above 2015 levels. \u201cIf we are serious about breaking new ground in our understanding of complex diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer, and if we hope to accelerate the speed with which new cures, treatments and vaccines are developed, then it\u2019s absolutely essential that we increase funding for medical research at NIH,\u201d the group wrote in a letter going out today. The letter: http://politico.pro/1PMxN9Z\n\nGOP LEADERS: YES, RECONCILIATION WILL DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD \u2014 Senate leaders are doubling down on their promise to include a provision defunding Planned Parenthood in the reconciliation package they're hoping to pass after Thanksgiving. They had previously mulled dumping the provision in an effort to win over moderates like Sens. Mark Kirk, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski to get 51 votes. But that would have infuriated social conservatives on and off the Hill. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he's confident the provision will stay in. The full story, here.\n\nSCOOPLET: SJC WILL REVIEW CORNYN\u2019S MENTAL HEALTH BILL \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee in January is set to review John Cornyn\u2019s mental health legislation, the No. 2 Senate Republican told PULSE. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to having that hearing. There seems to be a lot of interest in the topic generally within the criminal justice system and how jails have essentially become warehouses for people with mental illness,\u201d Cornyn said. His measure is one of a handful of mental health bills cropping up in the Senate. Unlike the other bills, Cornyn\u2019s includes a divisive gun provision intended to keep firearms out of the hands of the seriously mentally ill. The NRA supports it, while gun control activists don't.\n\nTHIS AM: WE'RE TALKING BIOSIMILARS \u2014 Pro Health Care\u2019s Joanne Kenen and Sarah Karlin host a discussion on biosimilars this morning, along with Amgen's Kimberly Greco; the FDA's Janet Woodcock, Foley & Lardner's David Rosen, the Biosimilars Council's Bert Liang, and Harvard's Seoyoung Kim. Expect a thought-provoking conversation that will delve into issues surrounding labeling, naming, safety, pricing and reimbursement, legal hurdles, and other important topics that affect this cheaper group of biologic medicines.

POLITICO's got more on his decision, here: http://politi.co/1NCi7lp. Your health team, meanwhile, is already taking bets on which future Republican administrations would make Jindal HHS secretary.\n\nKAISER: SHOPPING KEY TO COST CONTAINMENT \u2014 Obamacare customers will need to shop around if they want to avoid serious sticker shock in 2016. That\u2019s because in roughly three quarters of the counties that utilize HealthCare.gov, the cheapest silver plan will change next year. If individuals remain in their current plans, premiums will rise by an average of 15 percent. But if they\u2019re willing to switch plans, average premium increases fall to 7 percent. The Kaiser analysis: http://kaiserf.am/1HUyVHH\n\nSCOTUS SETS LITTLE SISTERS BRIEFING SCHEDULE \u2014 The justices on Tuesday established a combined briefing schedule for the seven related nonprofit birth control cases. The seven petitioners will file briefs in two groups. The opening written arguments will be due Jan. 4. The government must reply by Feb. 10, and petitioners can reply by March 11.\n\nONDCP RELEASES DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY \u2014 The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy released an update of its strategy Tuesday and it\u2019s asking Congress to give Medicare the authority to \u201clock in\u201d at-risk patients to single primary care doctors and pharmacies to prescribe and fill their medications. Medicare has an Opioid Overutilizer program that allows Part D plans to contact doctors if they suspect a patient is at-risk of receiving the drugs from too many providers or pharmacies, but unlike many Medicaid programs and private insurers, Part D can\u2019t restrict the patients to receive services for a single provider and pharmacy. That would require Congress to act, the ONDCP report states. The strategy: http://1.usa.gov/1PMWweq\n\nWORLDWIDE PHARMA SPENDING TO HIT $1.4 TRILLION BY 2020 \u2014 That's an increase of about 30 percent from 2015, per new data from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. Most of that spending will be concentrated in developed countries, driven by new products and price increases primarily in the U.S., which IMS predicts will account for 41 percent of worldwide costs. The full report: http://bit.ly/1HUH5j\n\nCOMING IN HOT: COMMENTS ON MACRA \u2014 Midnight was the deadline for comments on how CMS should design new physician payment models as it implements MACRA. Your PULSEr surveyed a smattering of the comments filed early, and boy, are they wide ranging. Providers groups touched on everything from specific quality measures they want included to exceptions CMS should make for individual physicians or small practices. And of course, there was plenty of discussion on what should constitute an eligible alternative payment model. (The risk-based payment structures that lets physicians skip the new MIPS payment system.) We'll have more as it comes, but ICYMI, a whole host of providers groups outlined their broad hopes, here: http://politico.pro/1NChNTJ\n\nAN END-OF-LIFE PLANNING BILL BACKED BY NRL \u2014 Anti-abortion groups have dug in their heels against advance care planning bills in the past, but Sen. Chris Coons got them on board for his latest legislative effort: a bill to pay Medicare beneficiaries for using an advance directive to spell out the care they'd like to receive at the end of their lives [delete: they age in an advance directive]. Coons has backed similar legislation in the past, but he tweaked the legislation this year to bring on board anti-abortion groups and a new House co-sponsor, Rep. Diane Black, along with Mike Thompson. Sen. Bill Cassidy is the sponsor of companion legislation. More details to come today.\n\nNORM ORNSTEIN ON MURPHY\u2019S MENTAL HEALTH BILL \u2014 In a deeply personal op-ed in the New York Times, AEI\u2019s Norm Ornstein writes about his late son who struggled with mental illness and how legislation like Rep. Tim Murphy\u2019s bill in the House Energy and Commerce Committee could help people with similar conditions. \u201cThe bill is not perfect. But it does many things to improve the financing, treatment and delivery of services across the range of mental illnesses, and in particular it has provisions aimed directly at helping those like my son,\u201d he writes, specifically noting one provision of the bill that incentivizes states to implement assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) laws. Murphy\u2019s bill awaits markup in the full E&C committee. The op-ed: http://nyti.ms/1SWLoM2\n\nLAWMAKERS TO OBAMA: LET'S SIT AND TALK CADDY TAX \u2014 A bipartisan, bicameral group of the lawmakers who have sponsored legislation to repeal the Cadillac tax \u2014 Sens. Dean Heller, Martin Heinrich, Sherrod Brown and Reps. Joe Courtney and Frank Guinta \u2014 are asking for a meeting with the president to press their case. Their letter: http://1.usa.gov/1NCdMyC\n\nCSRxP: IOWA VOTERS WANT ACTION ON DRUG COSTS \u2014 Ninety percent of likely Iowa voters believe it\u2019s important for presidential candidates to address high drug costs, and almost 70 percent say the government should ensure drug price increases are limited, per new polling from the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing. Large majorities also supported transparency proposals, including requiring companies to disclose research and development costs and marketing and sales data.\n\n\u2014 The group, led by John Rother with backing from insurers and hospitals, among others, has been driving attention to the issue. It plans to release additional polls from New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina in coming days. The Iowa poll, conducted by Morning Consult, has a margin of error of 4 percentage points: http://bit.ly/1j6cGT6\n\nICYMI: CALIFF GETS BIPARTISAN LOVE, BUT SASSE IS STILL HOLDING \u2014 It was a bipartisan love fest for FDA nominee Robert Califf at Tuesday's Senate HELP hearing, and that committee is expected to vote next month on his nomination. But Sen. Ben Sasse says he\u2019ll place a hold on all HHS nominees until he gets answers about the failed Obamacare-funded co-ops.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\nProPublica looks at HIPAA and how it fails to protect a lot of the health data that consumers consider sensitive, like paternity test results:http://bit.ly/1HUgUZR\n\nSelf-induced abortions have been rising in Texas since the state passed new legal restrictions, Slate reports: http://slate.me/1NCgjsu\n\nFormer Senate staffer Chris Condeluci thinks that despite the current Cadillac tax politics, whomever wins the White House will still want to limit the exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance.

Understanding the out-of-pocket costs your insurer may require to access the care and treatments you need is important. Here are some questions to ask before picking your plan: (1) Are the health care providers, pharmacies and hospitals you prefer in the plan\u2019s network? (2) How much will you pay per month for coverage? (3) How much do you have to pay out of pocket before coverage kicks in? (4) Are you aware of the other costs required to access care? (5) Are your regular prescriptions covered by your plan? Get the check list at AccessBetterCoverage.org - http://onphr.ma/20OMheI **\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): Many Medicare drug plans effectively require the use of \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies that are inconvenient for patients. That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
