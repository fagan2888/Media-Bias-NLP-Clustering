Bradbury became concerned that patients were losing access to medicinal marijuana after Los Angeles voters passed Proposition D in 2013\u2014a law which restricted the number of pot shops that could operate within city limits.\n\n\"We don't have a lot of dispensaries in Los Angeles and that kind of limits the amount of growers that people have access to,\" states Bradbury.\n\nThe concept proved popular with consumers\u2014an estimated 2,500 people attended on the first day alone to purchase goods from over 30 vendors.\n\nBradbury maintains that the market is legal because the collective is grandfathered in under the Prop D law. To attend the market, patients must provide documentation that shows they are able to legally purchase marijuana in the state.\n\n\"This is exactly the way the law is written,\" says Bradbury. \"Patients are supposed to be getting their medicine directly from the growers within the collective and that's exactly what's happening here.\"\n\nBradbury plans to continue staging the market each weekend.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/07/12/getting-high-on-the-fourth-of-july-a-mar", "type": "article", "site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Los Angeles celebrated Independence Day non-traditionally last weekend, with a farmers' market for marijuana.
