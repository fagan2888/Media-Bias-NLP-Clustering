Shane Vander Hart was sans Brian Myers this week. Shane discussed three things that happened over the past week that showed he was getting older. Plus Wes Enos joined Shane in the first segment to discuss what happens if the GOP presidential nomination is decided by a contested convention.

Shane with our producer Ron Carlson discussed Donald Trump’s bad behavior this week and how Ted Cruz responded. Also State Representative Matt Windschitl (R-Missouri Valley) goes to the floor of the Iowa House to warn Iowans about a group masquerading as a gun rights group, but he says are just scam artists and charlatans.

Megan Toombs of the Cornwall Alliance on the Stewardship of Creation called in to mark what would have been Norman Borlaug’s 102 birthday. Borlaug is a native Iowan who quietly saved hundreds of millions of people, why is it important to remember his work?

Plus what led to the Brussels terrorist attacks? Is it fair for a man to be forced to pay child support for a child that isn’t his? Also, a Colorado school district has begun to allow atheist and Satanic literature to be distributed at school.
