— Herb Greenberg, owner of WHIG-TV in Rocky Mount, died of a heart attack Sunday.

After his textile plant closed in 1997, Greenberg started WHIG to be more involved in the area. The station broadcasts community events, from city council meetings to parades and festivals, and produces local talk shows.

“Always behind the scenes at the heart of so many good things happening in our area,” the Rocky Mount Area Chamber of Commerce said of Greenberg on its website after presenting him with their Woody Brown Award in 2013. “The recipient boldly stepped out into uncharted territory, developed a vision and executed a plan to support the area. In so doing, this person became one of our area’s most passionate, community-oriented individuals.”

Funeral arrangements were not immediately available Sunday night.
