It's stressful,\" Matthew told ABC News.\n\nSo she worked with the hospital's therapy dog program for patients to bring the animals directly to staff.\n\n\"I've had people say to me, 'I walked in here with the worst headache and I instantly feel better.' And then they go out and they then go on to provide even better care for their patients,\" Matthew said.\n\nIn addition to giving clinicians a much-needed break from the daily work stresses, the program also aims to find forever homes for the puppies and kittens up for adoption.\n\nThe program is the first in the country to use animals to relieve employee stress, according to PennMedicine. But it's been such a success at the hospital that Matthew said she plans to promote the program to other hospitals across the country.\n\n\"Basically, when you take that five-minute break out of your day, the pick-me-up that makes all the difference,\" Matthew said in the PennMedicine article. \"That animal isn't judging you, they don't know that maybe you've had to give a family some bad news and your heart is breaking over it.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- watch the ABC News coverage\n\n- here's the PennMedicine article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAnimal therapy benefits research inconclusive\n\nRobotic animals make strides in therapeutic patient care\n\nMore hospitals open doors to family pet visits\n\nMore hospitals allow personal pet visits", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although hospitals have long used\u00a0therapy dogs to help patients, the animals can also help relieve the stress of emergency room doctors and nurses who must handle life-and-death situations every day.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Although hospitals have long used\u00a0therapy dogs to help patients, the animals can also help relieve the stress of emergency room doctors and nurses who must handle life-and-death situations every day.", "title": "Not just for patients: Animal therapy benefits ER docs, nurses", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/not-just-patients-animal-therapy-benefits-er-docs-nurses-too/2014-08-29", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "animal therapy,emergency room doctors,emergency room nurses,Heather Matthew,Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Pet a Pooch program", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5cb\"", "article_summary": "And then they go out and they then go on to provide even better care for their patients,\" Matthew said.\nSo she worked with the hospital's therapy dog program for patients to bring the animals directly to staff.\nAlthough hospitals have long used therapy dogs to help patients, the animals can also help relieve the stress of emergency room doctors and nurses who must handle life-and-death situations every day.\nThe hospital launched the \"Pet a Pooch\" program this summer when Heather Matthew, M.S.N.\nBut it's been such a success at the hospital that Matthew said she plans to promote the program to other hospitals across the country."}
