The two hugged, and as Thweatt went to undergo the drug protocol as required at national championships, Troop turned, with tears welling up, and said,\n\n\"That is what champions do.\"\n\nWhat Thweatt, 26, did was dominate a strong field in winning the national title in front of her hometown crowd with a surge on the last lap that left 2012 winner Sara Hall behind. Thweatt earned a trip to the 2015 IAAF World Cross Country Championships March 28 in Guiyang, China; more than that, she made the jump to being the top national runner that Troop and others think she can be.\n\n\"This is the race that can change the landscape for Laura,\" said Troop. \"I believe she can be a top international runner.\"\n\nThweatt will get her chance to mix it up with the big when she competes in China. There, she will race against the best women in the world in a race considered by most fans the toughest in the world. The two junior and two senior races Saturday were selection races for the U.S. team going to China. Saturday's race was also one of 11 championship races over varying distances on the 2015 USATF Running Circuit.\n\n\"This is a huge win for me,\" said Thweatt, who had perhaps more vocal support than anyone in the field. She is a former high school runner from Durango who went on to a solid career at the University of Colorado. After joining up with Troop, a three-time Olympian from Australia, she had a breakthrough track season last year, clocking 15 minutes, 4 seconds for 5000 meters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is an assistant distance coach at Louisville's Monarch High School, which had a large and loud cheering section of prep runners on hand chasing Thweatt around the course as she broke away from Hall on the final lap to get the win.\n\n\"Their energy really helped,\" said Thweatt, who looked poised and in control the entire race. On the first of the four 2 kilometer laps, she was content to remain in a pack of 14. A \"surge\" \u2014 a sudden, faster change of pace \u2014 on the second lap strung out the field, with only Hall hanging on as they entered the final lap.\n\nDathan Ritzenhein finished in third place at the USA Cross Country Championships on Saturday.

But while she looked in control to many of the fans who lined the start/finish area and parts of the course, she said afterwards she did not feel like she had it won until the final 50 meters.\n\n\"I did it,\" she said she thought as she neared the finish. \"This is actually happening.\"\n\nWhile some of the women behind her fell to the ground, spent from the hard effort and the heat, Thweatt looked calm and collected after finishing the 8K in 27:42.\n\n\"Laura deserves this more than anyone,\" said CU assistant coach Billy Nelson, who was on the Colorado team with Thweatt. \"She is a great person and a hard worker. We are all proud of her, and it will be fun to see her toe the line against the best in the world.\"\n\nWhile Thweatt made the jump to top U.S. runner on Saturday, men's winner Chris Derrick has been there for a while. Derrick, who runs for the Bowerman Track Club, won his third straight U.S. cross country title. He had a bit of fun as he finished, putting his hand to his eye in a \"3-goggle\" sign basketball players use when they are on hot streak.\n\n\"I've always wanted to do that and had been thinking about it since a month after winning last year,\" said Derrick, who played a lot of hoops as a middle school kid growing before going on to beome an Illinois state champ and then a 14-time All American at Stanford. \"It has been a childhood dream of mine; I just wanted to have some fun.\"\n\nLike Thweatt, Derrick, 24, was not bothered by the unseasonably warm temperatures. A pack of 24 men went through the first of the six laps in just under 6 minutes, and were still together after the second lap. But half a lap later, Derrick increased the pace, taking the lead over local favorite and former CU star Dathan Ritzenhein.\n\n\"I heard Dathan and Ben (True, who placed 11th) breathing hard, and surged\" said Derrick, who finished the 12K in 36:18. \"It was really hot, and once I got the lead, I knew that Dathan had not been training at altitude for a while.\"\n\nRitzenhein, 32 and a three-time Olympian and former U.S. 5,000 meter record holder, now lives in Rockford, Mich. where the temperature was -6 degrees when he left earlier in the week. Ritzenhein said he felt the altitude \"as soon as we started, in the first 100 meters. I was breathing hard, and I thought, 'Whoa, this is going to be a long day.' \"\n\nBut good training for \"Ritz,\" who is healthy and getting ready for the Boston Marathon. He and his wife and two children are living in his in-law's basement while their home is being built in Rockford, where Ritz also helps out with the Grand Valley State cross country team.\n\n\"I heard people cheering for me all along the course,\" he said, \"saying 'Go Ritz,' and, 'Go Dathan.' I came here as an 18 year old, and this is where I found my own path, and where I became a man. Boulder is a special place.\"", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-02-07T18:48:24-0700", "modificationDate": "2015-02-07T18:49:20-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0207/20150207__08TCSUSAw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Michael Sandrock \n \n  For the Times-Call", "description": "Laura Thweatt kept moving after she crossed the finish line to win the 2015 USA Cross Country Championships Saturday afternoon at the Flatirons Golf Course in Boulder.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27483204:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0207/20150207__08TCSUSAw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Laura Thweatt kept moving after she crossed the finish line to win the 2015 USA Cross Country Championships Saturday afternoon at the Flatirons Golf Course in Boulder.", "title": "CU alumna Laura Thweatt wins national title"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Laura Thweatt kept moving after she crossed the finish line to win the 2015 USA Cross Country Championships Saturday afternoon at the Flatirons Golf Course in Boulder.", "title": "CU alumna Laura Thweatt wins national title", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0207/20150207__08TCSUSAw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-07T18:48:24-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-02-07T18:47:38-0700", "sailthru.title": "CU alumna Laura Thweatt wins national title", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Michael SandrockFor", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0207/20150207__08TCSUSAw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-02-07T18:50:19-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont, TimesCall, Colorado, news, sports, features, schools, education, jobs, homes, real estate, lifestyles"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd273d\"", "article_summary": "Derrick wins third straight on men's sideFormer CU runner Laura Thweatt crosses the finish line in first place on Saturday during the USA Cross Country Championships at Flatirons Golf Course.\nDathan Ritzenhein finished in third place at the USA Cross Country Championships on Saturday.\nLike Thweatt, Derrick, 24, was not bothered by the unseasonably warm temperatures.\nDerrick, who runs for the Bowerman Track Club, won his third straight U.S. cross country title.\nThe two hugged, and as Thweatt went to undergo the drug protocol as required at national championships, Troop turned, with tears welling up, and said,\"That is what champions do.\""}
