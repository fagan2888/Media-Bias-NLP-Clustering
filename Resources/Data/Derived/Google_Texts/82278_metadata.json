At issue is whether a state\u2019s voters have the authority to empower a citizens commission \u2014 rather than state legislators \u2014 to draw congressional boundaries.  Arizona\u2019s 2000 voter initiative set up a bipartisan commission to handle the decennial redistricting process.  Republicans who control the Arizona Legislature are challenging that system in the case that has reached the U.S. Supreme Court.  The Arizona Republicans\u2019 argument is based on a very narrow reading of Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution that gives state legislature the authority to determine the \u201ctimes, places and manner\u201d of federal elections.  Defenders of the independent commission maintained that legislatures should be defined more broadly to include the legislative process \u2014 including the ability of citizens to enact laws at the ballot box.  While it\u2019s always risky to presume the justices\u2019 ultimate decisions by their questions during oral arguments, the direction of the March hearing clearly was not favorable to the independent commission.  The court\u2019s conservatives \u2014 along with Justice Anthony Kennedy, a potential swing vote \u2014 expressed skepticism at the notion that the framers intended to define legislature so broadly as to include voter initiatives.  While Republicans hold the reins in Phoenix, Democrats have a firm grip on both houses of the Legislature in Sacramento.  In California, voters similarly set up independent commissions to draw the boundaries for state legislative seats (Prop. 11, 2008) and congressional seats (Prop. 20, 2010).  A longtime observer of politics might wonder if those hearings might be used to provide political cover for the ruling Democrats to tinker with \u2014 or even overhaul \u2014 the boundaries.  When politicians draw the lines, it becomes mostly the art of protecting incumbents and advancing party interests \u2014 two elements that were expressly prohibited by the reform initiative.  [...] de Le\u00f3n insisted that skeptics who think \u201cwe\u2019re all pining and foaming at the mouth\u201d to jump back into redistricting are mistaken.  If the Supreme Court rules against citizen redistricting commissions, then California\u2019s legislative leaders should allow its independently drawn lines to stay in place until new boundaries are required after the 2020 census.  The U.S. Constitution\u2019s elections clause gives Congress the authority \u201cat any time\u201d to \u201cmake or alter\u201d the rules.  In California, lawmakers could appoint a citizens commission to draw the lines \u2014 keeping the fair-play criteria in the 2010 initiative \u2014 subject to ratification by the Legislature.  To take the responsibility for drawing boundaries for state Senate and Assembly out of the hands of legislators.  To invalidate a 2000 ballot initiative that created a bipartisan commission to draw congressional boundaries.
