But he\u2019s never seen anything like what he\u2019s seeing now: private equity investors lining up to get into the treatment business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 40 years, and I\u2019ve been doing presentations at private equity firms [that] want to understand behavioral health because they want to understand and invest in it,\u201d Tamasi said. \u201cI\u2019ve done more of those in the past year than I\u2019ve done in my entire career.\u201d\n\nTamasi says several things are fueling this interest \u2014 the biggest of which is the opioid epidemic.\n\nOnly 10 percent of the estimated 700,000 Massachusetts residents who could use substance treatment actually are able to get it. There are also state and national legislative and insurance changes that have made substance use treatment a projected $35 billion-a-year business in the United States.\n\nHundreds of new treatment beds are being created in New England this year alone. One of the largest projects \u2014 which also represents one of the biggest private equity investments in addiction treatment \u2014 is now under construction in Danvers. Recovery Centers of America (RCA) is spending some $20 million to renovate the former Hunt Hospital into what will eventually be a 210-bed substance use treatment center. It\u2019s set to open Aug. 1. Brad Greenstein, CEO of Recovery Centers of America, Danvers, says the center will help with the state\u2019s opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cMassachusetts has great need, and for whatever reason doesn\u2019t have a lot of capacity with respect to inpatient treatment beds,\u201d Greenstein said. \u201cSo we saw great opportunity to bring a medically focused treatment center here to Massachusetts.\u201d\n\nThe facility will provide both inpatient and outpatient care, and Greenstein says it will feel almost like a boutique hotel \u2014 with well-appointed bedrooms, private therapy rooms, coffee shops and cyber cafes. Although he says eventually RCA plans to build other facilities that will accept those with public insurance, this center in Danvers will only accept commercially insured patients or those who pay out of pocket. These are people, Greenstein says, who are now underserved.\n\n\u201cFor people who lack resources, there are a lot of programs that are funded to work with that population, and on the opposite extreme are people who have tremendous resources [who] can go really anywhere they want,\u201d Greenstein said. \u201cWhat we found, not just in Massachusetts but nationwide, is this lack of availability for your average everyday individual who has been dutifully paying insurance premiums \u2014 those are the ones having a hard time accessing care.\u201d\n\nThe Danvers clinicians will use several methods of treatment, designed around a patient\u2019s needs, according to Deni Carise, the company\u2019s chief clinical officer.\n\n\u201cWe owe it to every patient to throw everything we have at this disease and figure out what helps and how that will fit for them,\u201d Carise said. \u201cThat\u2019s everything from medications to 12-step programs to yoga. You need to look at the person as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe Danvers facility is one of eight centers RCA is building in the northeastern U.S. Carise says that will help keep patients in treatment longer, which usually means they have a better chance of staying sober. She says because of the lack of treatment beds in the Northeast, many residents have had to go to places like Florida or California for inpatient care. But when they return home after 30 days, many have a hard time connecting with supports to help them in early recovery. So she says staying closer to home will make it easier for residents to transition to outpatient care.\n\n\u201cWe want to eliminate break points and have people stay here and continue treatment with the same people in one campus.\u201d Carise said.\n\nCarise believes the building boom in treatment will also result in something that hasn\u2019t happened in the industry before: proof that treatment works by having providers document outcomes to both attract patients and to satisfy investors.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do anything small at RCA,\u201d Carise said. \u201cOur initial funding is for almost a quarter of a billion dollars for eight centers for addiction medicine, and this center [in Danvers] is the largest at this time.\u201d\n\nThe $231.5 million to RCA is from the New York private equity firm Deerfield Management, which specializes in health care investing. Deerfield\u2019s Leslie Henshaw says there are several reasons why money is flowing into treatment right now \u2014 mainly the laws requiring insurers to pay for care and the Affordable Care Act provision allowing dependents to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until age 26. A law that went into effect in Massachusetts last year requires insurers to pay for up to 14 days of inpatient treatment. Henshaw says increased investment will result in better care.\n\n\u201cWe feel it\u2019s an industry that unfortunately is seeing exploding demand. It\u2019s an industry that to date has had very little accountability with regard to delivering on effective outcomes, so we see both an enormous need and an imperative to change the model in which care is delivered,\u201d she said.\n\nEven longtime Massachusetts treatment providers are looking to get in on the more lucrative end of addiction treatment. Spectrum Health Systems, which operates 13 facilities in Massachusetts, just opened a new 36-bed facility in Westborough: the New England Recovery Center.\n\nChuck Faris, president and CEO of Spectrum Health, says the center is in response to demand.\n\n\u201cI think that we\u2019re probably the most state-of-the-art facility in the state right now,\u201d Faris said.\n\nFaris says the facility will also accept only private insurance or patients paying cash. A monthlong stay will cost about $15,000.\n\nIt\u2019s a sign the market is responding to the new face of opioid use: young adults with more well-off parents who either have good insurance or are willing to pay high prices to get their child healthy.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there was a demand for that part of the market. We saw that there was a niche that wasn\u2019t being filled,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw a lot of private pay customers going out of state for services. At the same time, they shouldn\u2019t be put in a publicly funded bed if they have the resources to pay for it.\u201d\n\nAbout half of the patients at the New England Recovery Center pay cash; the other half use insurance. Faris doesn\u2019t call it luxury \u2014 especially when compared with some of the spa-like centers in other areas of the country. He describes this new center as mid-range treatment. He says the higher end treatment offers more personalized care, provides family support, and has a lower staff to client ratio than Spectrum\u2019s facilities that accept patients on public insurance such as MassHealth. In contrast to the new center\u2019s tall windows and wood beams, the other facility on the same Westborough campus has a dated brick facade and dark hallways. Faris says having a higher level of treatment also helps offset the cost of caring for lower income patients, for which the state pays $100 a day.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stay at a Motel 6 for $100 a day \u2014 you might get continental breakfast with that,\u201d he said.\n\nRegardless of the rates, business is booming. Faris says Spectrum\u2019s revenues this year will be around $70 million, up from $60 million last year.\n\nPaula Torch \u2014 senior analyst with Avondale Partners, which helps manage public offerings for treatment providers \u2014 says substance use treatment is one of the hottest health care investments right now, and it\u2019s only going to continue.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the market is growing at about a 5 percent-plus rate per year,\u201d Torch said. \u201cPart of that is because of a lot of strong fundamentals: mental health parity, the Affordable Care Act and just the opioid epidemic in general. And there are thousands of sophisticated players getting into the market.\u201d\n\nOne of the largest players in the treatment field is American Addiction Centers, which last year became the first business focused solely on addiction to go public and raised $75 million in an IPO. The well-known local player in luxury treatment is McLean Hospital in Belmont. McLean is now expanding out of state and is running Internet ads about its new facility in Camden, Maine, called Borden Cottage. The ads for the facility say: \u201cMcLean Hospital, located just outside Boston, has long been known as one of the top psychiatric hospitals in the world. Now, for the first time in our 200-year history, we\u2019ve taken our expertise outside of Massachusetts.\u201d\n\nMcLean opened the eight-bed Borden Cottage last year. It does not accept insurance and charges more than $2,200 a day. Borden Cottage officials say they provide highly intensive treatment from doctoral level clinicians. They also say paying cash allows patients, not insurers, to determine the course of treatment \u2014 and keeps care strictly confidential.\n\nWhile there are concerns that focusing on higher end treatment could leave behind those without resources, many welcome the increased number of treatment beds.\n\nBoston University public health professor David Rosenbloom says the growth will lead to better quality for everyone.\n\n\u201cI would like to see providers take all patients, so I\u2019m not in favor of discrimination based on insurance, but we need to expand the total size of the treatment community and if this is a step toward increasing the size and accountability and quality of the system, then this is a step we have to take,\u201d Rosenbloom said.\n\nGov. Charlie Baker has said over a two-year period ending this December, there will be 1,000 new mental health and substance use beds will have been created in Massachusetts.\n\nAmid the trend toward higher end forms of treatment, state Health and Human Services Secretary Mary Lou Sudders says the state will closely monitor the new beds and who is using them.\n\n\u201cAs we increase with 1,000 new beds, I need to ensure there is access to care for the MassHealth population, as well as those with commercial insurance, and I\u2019m going to watch that carefully,\u201d Sudders said.\n\nSudders says she remains hopeful that more treatment \u2014 of any kind \u2014 and the 21 percent increase in opioid-related expenses in the governor\u2019s budget for the next fiscal year will put a dent in the current rate of four deaths per day in this state because of opioid overdoses.\n\nClarification: This post has been updated to clarify that an estimated 700,000 Massachusetts residents meet the medical criteria for having a substance use disorder.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"[I]t's an industry that unfortunately is seeing exploding demand,\" said Leslie Henshaw, of a New York private equity firm that specializes in health care investing.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "\"[I]t's an industry that unfortunately is seeing exploding demand,\" said Leslie Henshaw, of a New York private equity firm that specializes in health care investing.", "title": "The Opioid Treatment Business Is Booming", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2016/03/opioid-treatment-business", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2016/02/0226_opioid-treatment-danvers01-620x413.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2016/03/opioid-treatment-business", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2016/02/0226_opioid-treatment-danvers01-620x413.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "The Opioid Treatment Business Is Booming"}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-01", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Tue, 01 Mar 2016 05:22:56 -0500"}, "article_summary": "The Opioid Treatment Business Is BoomingRay Tamasi, the president and CEO of Gosnold on Cape Cod, has been working in addiction treatment for more than four decades.\nRecovery Centers of America (RCA) is spending some $20 million to renovate the former Hunt Hospital into what will eventually be a 210-bed substance use treatment center.\nAmid the trend toward higher end forms of treatment, state Health and Human Services Secretary Mary Lou Sudders says the state will closely monitor the new beds and who is using them.\nBut he\u2019s never seen anything like what he\u2019s seeing now: private equity investors lining up to get into the treatment business.\nEven longtime Massachusetts treatment providers are looking to get in on the more lucrative end of addiction treatment."}
