[ Charlie ]TRY ZINC FREE SUPER POLIGRIP. >>> IN TOWNS, CITIES AND STATES ACROSS AMERICA, A DEBATE IS NOW RAGING OVER THOSE CAMERAS THAT SNAP A PICTURE WHEN YOU RUN A RED LIGHT. YOU THEN GET A TICKET IN THE MAIL, USUALLY WITH A HEFTY FINE. BUT WHILE SOME PLACES HAVE DECIDED TO TURN THEM OFF, OTHERS ARE BUYING MORE OF THEM. OUR REPORT FROM NBC'S KRISTEN DAHLGREN. >> Reporter: RUNNING A RED LIGHT. NOBODY ARGUES IT ISN'T DANGEROUS. BUT THERE IS NOW A HUGE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER CAMERAS THAT CATCH OFFENDERS HAVE A PLACE IN AMERICA'S INTERSECTIONS. >> I WANT TO GET THEM OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. >> Reporter: THIS TOWN IN NEW JERSEY, ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES TO GET THE CAMERAS, JUST BANNED THEM. POLICE TOLD THE NEW MAYOR THEY WEREN'T MAKING INTERSECTIONS SAFER. >> T-BONE CRASHES ACTUALLY INCREASED 400%. >> Reporter: BRICK ISN'T ALONE. ON THURSDAY ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA PULLED THE PLUG ON ITS CAMERAS AFTER THREE YEARS SAYING THEY DIDN'T MAKE FISCAL SENSE. ON WEDNESDAY, ELLISVILLE, MISSOURI, VOTED TO TERMINATE ITS CONTRACT AFTER PUBLIC OUTCRY. CRITICS SAY THE CAMERAS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND CREATE A DRIVING HAZARD. >> IT PUTS PEOPLE IN A REALLY TOUGH SPOT BETWEEN MAKING A CHOICE TO PERHAPS GET INTO A REAR-END ACCIDENT OR FORCE THEMSELVES TO RUN THAT INTERSECTION AND GET A TICKET. >> Reporter: NATIONWIDE THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES USING RED LIGHT CAMERAS IS DOWN ABOUT 6% SINCE 2012.

LOUIS POLICE CHIEF SAM DODSON, SAYS IN HIS CITY HE'S NOTICED NO INCREASE IN CRASHES. HIS OFFICERS SORT THROUGH SOME 500 VIOLATIONS A DAY. >> THERE WE HAVE ANOTHER VIOLATION. NO STOP. >> Reporter: DODSON SAYS WITHOUT THE CAMERAS, HIS FORCE WOULD BE STRETCHED TOO THIN. >> IT WOULD TAKE OVER 200 POLICE OFFICERS TO DO WHAT THE CAMERAS ARE DOING TODAY. >> Reporter: HE AGREES WITH THE CAMERA PROVIDER'S STATISTICS THAT SAY CITATIONS ARE WORKING. >> MORE THAN 90% OF THE PEOPLE THAT RUN RED LIGHTS DON'T GET ANOTHER TICKET. THEY DON'T DO IT AGAIN. >> Reporter: DRIVER REACTION IS MIXED. >> I MEAN THEY AIN'T THERE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. >> IT IS A SIMPLE HONEST TO GOD
