Really, water?\u201d Obama asked rhetorically. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s not new. It doesn\u2019t come in different colors or shapes. In fact, it doesn\u2019t even have a color or a shape. And to be honest with you, not long ago, I might have been thinking the same thing.\u201d\n\nToday, though, her attention was on spreading the word about the perks of consuming more H2O \u2014 drinking more water helps individuals have more energy to do more, longer and with better focus, a press release preceding the event stated \u2014 and leveraging the help of the water community.\n\nYes, there is such thing as \u2018the water community\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got everybody up here,\u201d Obama said at the event. \u201cWe\u2019ve got representatives from tap water. We\u2019ve got water filter companies. We\u2019ve got the bottled water companies with us. It was like a who\u2019s who of water as I was meeting them today.\n\n\u201cIt felt like I knew them personally \u2014 Dasani and Aquafina. Everybody was there,\u201d Obama continued. \u201cIt\u2019s like, I know you, I know you! I\u2019ve drank you. It\u2019s very empowering.\u201d\n\nActress Eva Longoria, who is helping the First Lady tout the campaign, pointed to the benefits and simplicity of staying hydrated.\n\n\u201cLots of people want to live healthier, but life gets busy and sometimes making the healthier choice can seem difficult,\u201d Longoria said. \u201cDrinking more water is a simple, easy choice that most people can make every day. I\u2019m thrilled that so many organizations have come together today to help remind people that you are what you drink, and drinking water is you at your best.\u201d\n\nWhile there was widespread agreement that drinking water is, in fact, good, an unnamed White House official told Politico that \u2018Drink Up\u2019 isn\u2019t designed to tell people how much.\n\n\u201cThis campaign isn\u2019t about drinking a certain amount of water a day (i.e., a certain number of glasses or ounces, etc.), we\u2019re just asking people to drink more water,\u201d the aide told the publication.\n\nThat same Politico story quoted several public health experts whose descriptions of the new campaign ranged from \u201cbizarre\u201d to \u201cno-brainer\u201d. They all agreed, however, that there is no hard scientific evidence to back the claim that boosting water intake provides a bevy of health benefits.\n\n\u201cThere is strong indication, but there is not absolute scientific confidence, regarding the benefits of increased water consumption,\u201d Dr. David Ludwig of Boston\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, who is supportive of the \u2018Drink Up\u2019 campaign, said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "First Lady Michelle Obama asked America to 'Drink Up' on Thursday.
