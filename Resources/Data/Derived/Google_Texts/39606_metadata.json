He was featured in a Jan. 3 piece in The New York Times titled \u201cIn Israeli City of Haifa, a Liberal Arab Culture Blossoms.\u201d The article, written by Times reporter Diaa Hadid, characterizes the Israeli city as a hub of \u201ca self-consciously Arab milieu that is secular, feminist and gay-friendly,\u201d juxtaposing it as \u201ca striking secular counterpoint to the conservatism of many of Israel\u2019s Arab communities.\u201d\n\nThe Times claims Haifa \u201chas embraced its diversity\u201d and is \u201ca comfortable place for liberal Palestinians who want not only to escape the constraints of conservative Arab communities but also to be among their own people.\u201d In order to do so, it quotes young progressive Palestinians like Fadel.\n\nThere is a problem, however. Fadel says the Times took his quotes completely out of context.\n\nThree other people interviewed for the article also felt they were misrepresented.\n\nAccording to Fadel, the U.S. newspaper of record removed all of his criticisms of Israel and its illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories.\n\n\u201cThere are so many points missing, crucial ones, that the lack of them make this article shallow, offensive and degrading,\u201d Fadel explained.\n\nOn social media, the young Palestinian man described the Times interview as a \u201ctrap,\u201d in order to contribute to an article making Israel look good. He said he \u201cfound this piece disturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt refers to certain aspects and neglects so many others that I personally mentioned during the interview,\u201d Fadel explained. \u201cIt portrays the modern Palestinian in a \u2018Western\u2019 image that comforts white readers and make them say, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re just like us!'\u201d\n\n\u201cI do agree our community has developed and evolved, and I love going to the places mentioned in this article. They feel like home, and because they feel like home, it\u2019s disturbing the way they were illustrated,\u201d Fadel added.\n\nSalon reached out to The New York Times for comment. The author, Diaa Hadid, relayed her response for Salon to Margaret Sullivan, who edits the Times\u2019 Public Editor\u2019s Journal. Sullivan included Hadid\u2019s comments in a post published on Jan. 8, a sequel to a previous post published earlier in the morning that summarized criticisms the piece has received from all across the political spectrum.\n\nHadid stood by her work, which she said she thought \u201cwas ultimately fair.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I had conveyed what they meant \u2013 which is my duty as a writer: to not take things out of context, and to be fair to what people mean,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI wrote this story really because I wanted to pay tribute to Haifa\u2019s unique culture, and particularly how Palestinian citizens of Israel had carved their own dynamic, liberal scene in the city,\u201d Hadid explained.\n\n\u201cFor that reason, I was mortified to find out that at least four people I had interviewed felt that I had misrepresented them in the story, and that it had garnered more criticism than any other story I have written in nearly a decade of coverage the Middle East,\u201d she added.\n\nIn his previous statements on social media, Fadel strongly disagreed that the representation was fair and accurate.\n\nFadel says that for \u201c90 percent of the interview we were talking about how the culture of the cultural resistance is growing and taking place in so many levels, such as music, art spaces, etc., and how the Palestinian underground scene is getting bigger and bigger and full of creativity and how literally it is being a place full of intelligence and rebel agenda.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ayed Fadel says the \"disturbing, offensive\" piece whitewashed his criticism of Israel. 3 other interviewees agreed", "title": "Palestinian says New York Times edited and censored his quotes to shine positively on Israel", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ayed Fadel says the \"disturbing, offensive\" piece whitewashed his criticism of Israel. 3 other interviewees agreed", "title": "Palestinian says New York Times edited and censored his quotes to shine positively on Israel", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/09/palestinian_says_new_york_times_edited_and_censored_his_quotes_to_shine_positively_on_israel/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/nyt_haifa_story.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ayed Fadel says the \"disturbing, offensive\" piece whitewashed his criticism of Israel. 3 other interviewees agreed", "title": "Palestinian says New York Times edited and censored his quotes to shine positively on Israel", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/nyt_haifa_story.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ben Norton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ayed Fadel, Israel-Palestine, New York Times", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Salon reached out to The New York Times for comment.\nOn social media, the young Palestinian man described the Times interview as a \u201ctrap,\u201d in order to contribute to an article making Israel look good.\nTopics: Ayed Fadel, Israel-Palestine, New York Times, News, Politics News\u201cI think that this interview was my last interview ever, I am done with media!\u201d exclaimed Ayed Fadel.\nHe said he \u201cfound this piece disturbing.\u201d\u201cIt refers to certain aspects and neglects so many others that I personally mentioned during the interview,\u201d Fadel explained.\nFadel is the Palestinian owner of Kabareet, a bar in Haifa, Israel."}
