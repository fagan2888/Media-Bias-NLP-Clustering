Candidate Barack Obama weaponized the crisis by blaming greedy bankers, unleashed when financial regulations were \u201csimply dismantled.\u201d He would go on to blame them for taking \u201chuge, reckless risks in pursuit of quick profits and massive bonuses.\u201d\n\nThat mistaken diagnosis was the justification for the Dodd-Frank Act and the stifling regulations that shackled the financial system, stunted the recovery and diminished the American dream.\n\nIn fact, when the crisis struck, banks were better capitalized and less leveraged than they had been in the previous 30 years. The FDIC\u2019s reported capital-to-asset ratio for insured commercial banks in 2007 was 10.2%\u201476% higher than it was in 1978. Federal Reserve data on all insured financial institutions show the capital-to-asset ratio was 10.3% in 2007, almost double its 1984 level, and the biggest banks doubled their capitalization ratios. On Sept. 30, 2008, the month Lehman failed, the FDIC found that 98% of all FDIC institutions with 99% of all bank assets were \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d and only 43 smaller institutions were undercapitalized.\n\nIn addition, U.S. banks were by far the best-capitalized banks in the world. While the collapse of 31 million subprime mortgages fractured financial capital, the banking system in the 30 years before 2007 would have fared even worse under such massive stress.\n\nLearn more: Crony capitalism, Dodd-Frank style\n\nVirtually all of the undercapitalization, overleveraging and \u201creckless risks\u201d flowed from government policies and institutions. Federal regulators followed international banking standards that treated most subprime-mortgage-backed securities as low-risk, with lower capital requirements that gave banks the incentive to hold them. Government quotas forced Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to hold ever larger volumes of subprime mortgages, and politicians rolled the dice by letting them operate with a leverage ratio of 75 to one\u2014compared with Lehman\u2019s leverage ratio of 29 to one.\n\nRegulators also eroded the safety of the financial system by pressuring banks to make subprime loans in order to increase homeownership. After eight years of vilification and government extortion of bank assets, often for carrying out government mandates, it is increasingly clear that banks were more scapegoats than villains in the subprime crisis.\n\nSimilarly, the charge that banks had been deregulated before the crisis is a myth. From 1980 to 2007 four major banking laws\u2014the Competitive Equality Banking Act (1987), the Financial Institutions, Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (1989), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (1991), and Sarbanes-Oxley (2002)\u2014undeniably increased bank regulations and reporting requirements. The charge that financial regulation had been dismantled rests almost solely on the disputed effects of the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).\n\nLearn more: Did the Dodd-Frank Act fail?\n\nPrior to GLBA, the decades-old Glass-Steagall Act prohibited deposit-taking, commercial banks from engaging in securities trading. GLBA, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, allowed highly regulated financial-services holding companies to compete in banking, insurance and the securities business. But each activity was still required to operate separately and remained subject to the regulations and capital requirements that existed before GLBA. A bank operating within a holding company was still subject to Glass-Steagall (which was not repealed by GLBA)\u2014but Glass-Steagall never banned banks from holding mortgages or mortgage-backed securities in the first place.\n\nGLBA loosened federal regulations only in the narrow sense that it promoted more competition across financial services and lowered prices. When he signed the law, President Clinton said that \u201cremoval of barriers to competition will enhance the stability of our financial system, diversify their product offerings and thus their sources of revenue.\u201d The financial crisis proved his point. Financial institutions that had used GLBA provisions to diversify fared better than those that didn\u2019t.\n\nMr. Clinton has always insisted that \u201cthere is not a single solitary example that [GLBA] had anything to do with the financial crisis,\u201d a conclusion that has never been refuted. When asked by the New York Times in 2012, Sen. Elizabeth Warren agreed that the financial crisis would not have been avoided had GLBA never been adopted. And President Obama effectively exonerated GLBA from any culpability in the financial crisis when, with massive majorities in both Houses of Congress, he chose not to repeal GLBA. In fact, Dodd-Frank expanded GLBA by using its holding-company structure to impose new regulations on systemically important financial institutions.\n\nLearn more: Dodd-Frank 'reforms' deserve attention\n\nAnother myth of the financial crisis is that the bailout was required because some banks were too big to fail. Had the government\u2019s massive injection of capital\u2014the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP\u2014been only about bailing out too-big-to-fail financial institutions, at most a dozen institutions might have received aid. Instead, 954 financial institutions received assistance, with more than half the money going to small banks.\n\nMany of the largest banks did not want or need aid\u2014and Lehman\u2019s collapse was not a case of a too-big-to-fail institution spreading the crisis. The entire financial sector was already poisoned by the same subprime assets that felled Lehman. The subprime bailout occurred because the U.S. financial sector was, and always should be, too important to be allowed to fail.\n\nConsider that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, bailing out the depositors of insolvent S&Ls in the 1980s on net cost taxpayers $258 billion in real 2009 dollars. By contrast, of the $245 billion disbursed by TARP to banks, 67% was repaid within 14 months, 81% within two years and the final totals show that taxpayers earned $24 billion on the banking component of TARP. The rapid and complete payback of TARP funds by banks strongly suggests that the financial crisis was more a liquidity crisis than a solvency crisis.\n\nWhat turned the subprime crisis and ensuing recession into the \u201cGreat Recession\u201d was not a failure of policies that addressed the financial crisis. Instead, it was the failure of subsequent economic policies that impeded the recovery.\n\nThe subprime crisis was largely the product of government policy to promote housing ownership and regulators who chose to promote that social policy over their traditional mission of guaranteeing safety and soundness. But blaming the financial crisis on reckless bankers and deregulation made it possible for the Obama administration to seize effective control of the financial system and put government bureaucrats in the corporate boardrooms of many of the most significant U.S. banks and insurance companies.\n\nLearn more: Dodd-Frank Act leaves America less stable, less prosperous, less free\n\nSuffocating under Dodd-Frank\u2019s \u201cenhanced supervision,\u201d banks now focus on passing stress tests, writing living wills, parking capital at the Federal Reserve, and knowing their regulators better than they know their customers. But their ability to help the U.S. economy turn dreams into businesses and jobs has suffered.\n\nIn postwar America, it took on average just 2 1/4 years to regain in each succeeding recovery all of the real per capita income that had been lost in the previous recession. At the current rate of the Obama recovery, it will take six more years, 14 years in all, for the average American just to earn back what he lost in the last recession.
