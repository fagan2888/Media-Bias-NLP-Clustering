Rape and sexual assault are defined by the NCVS to include: a) completed and attempted rape, b) completed and attempted sexual assault, and c) threats of rape or sexual assault, so the study provides a pretty comprehensive analysis of rape and sexual assault among young women. The report includes both: a) students (enrolled in college, university, trade school, or vocational school) and b) nonstudents for the 18 to 24 age group, which allows for a comparison of \u201ccampusrape/sexual assault\u201d and offenses that take place for that age group among nonstudents. Here are some of the report\u2019s findings:\n\n1. Over the 1995-2013 period, the rate of rape and sexual assault victimization was almost 25% higher for nonstudents ages 18-24 (7.6 cases per 1,000 females) compared to students enrolled in a post-secondary institution in that age group (6.1 cases per 1,000 females), see chart above. So despite all of the media attention on campus sexual assault, women enrolled in colleges and universities are actually much safer compared to women in that age group who are not attending a post-secondary institution.\n\n2. Over the 1995-2013 period, the rate of rape and sexual assault victimization for both students and nonstudents has been falling (see chart). For women attending college, the rate of rape/sexual assault has fallen by more than 50%, from 9.2 incidents per 1,000 women in 1997 to 4.4 cases per 1,000 in 2013. According to the media, politicians and gender activists, there is supposed to be a college \u201crape epidemic\u201d when in fact, the rate of college female victimization has been trending downward for the last two decades.\n\n3. What might be the most important statistic (and was not provided in the report and is not being reported by the media, except Ashe Schow at the Washington Examiner) is that the data provided by the NCVS show that only about 1 in 41 women were victims of rape or sexual assault (threatened, completed and attempted; and reported and unreported) while in college for four years during the entire period investigated from 1995 to 2013, based on this analysis:\n\n6.1 women per 1,000 = \u201c1 in 163.9 women\u201d per year, and over four years attending college would then be = \u201c1 in 41 women\u201d while in college.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/12/new_justice_department_study_reveals_white_house_exaggerating_campus_rape_problem_by_a_factor_of_ten.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: New Justice Department study reveals White House  exaggerating campus rape problem by a factor of ten"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc77c\"", "article_summary": "Rape and sexual assault are defined by the NCVS to include: a) completed and attempted rape, b) completed and attempted sexual assault, and c) threats of rape or sexual assault, so the study provides a pretty comprehensive analysis of rape and sexual assault among young women.\nOver the 1995-2013 period, the rate of rape and sexual assault victimization for both students and nonstudents has been falling (see chart).\nThe report was based on the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) of women ages 18-24 for both reported and unreported cases of rape and sexual assault.\nSo despite all of the media attention on campus sexual assault, women enrolled in colleges and universities are actually much safer compared to women in that age group who are not attending a post-secondary institution.\nFor women attending college, the rate of rape/sexual assault has fallen by more than 50%, from 9.2 incidents per 1,000 women in 1997 to 4.4 cases per 1,000 in 2013."}
