RENO, NV - The flu has hit many of us hard this season and a lot of times it can come at the early hours of the morning. That is where registered nurse Natalie Smith comes in as she answers calls on REMSA’s nurse health line at 775-858-1000.

“People can call in if they are having non-emergent health care needs,” said Elaine Messerli with REMSA.

The program was started with nearly a $10 million grant from the federal government due to the Affordable Care Act. It is an effort to stop non-emergencies from clogging up hospital emergency rooms.

“The nurses assess and triage callers over the phone to get them to the right level of care,” said Messerli.

The service is free and REMSA started taking calls last September just in time for flu season.

“We average about 2,000 calls a month,” said Messerli. “Over the last month we have noticed a lot of fevers, flu and cold-like symptoms, abdominal pain, those types of things.”

The nurse health line is intended to point the caller in the right direction. They do not refill prescriptions or give medication guidance as many callers tend to ask about. However, the feedback from hospitals so far has been positive.

“The hospitals, the urgent care centers and the physicians' offices that we work with seem very happy with our service,” said Messerli.

After the grant money runs out in July of 2015, REMSA hopes local hospitals and the community will continue to support the Nurse Health Line.
