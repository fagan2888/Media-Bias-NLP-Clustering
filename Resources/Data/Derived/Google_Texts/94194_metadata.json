One of them is the fact that the two signature policies of Barack Obama \u2014 the Affordable Care Act and the nuclear agreement with Iran \u2014 are unpopular with most voters.\n\nYou heard little from the president about Obamacare or his approach to Iran during his 2012 reelection campaign. You\u2019ve heard little about them from Democratic candidates for Congress in 2010, 2012, and 2014 or those running for next year.\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear that these policies would have been pursued in the same form if Hillary Clinton had been elected president in 2008. Would she have taken a mono-partisan approach to health care and hewn to it after the election of a Republican as senator from Massachusetts? Would she have banked so heavily on the notion that concessions could make Iran a friendlier power in the Middle East?\n\nMaybe, maybe not. But as the certain Democratic nominee and as Obama\u2019s former secretary of state, she is saddled with them.\n\nRichard Nixon in 1960, George H. W. Bush in 1988, and Al Gore in 2000 sought third presidential terms for their parties when their incumbent presidents had job approvals well above 50 percent. Bush, after turbulent primaries, won a solid victory. Nixon and Gore, nominated with only brief opposition, lost by a hair.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s job approval is currently 44 percent, and Clinton, like Nixon and Gore, seems unlikely to undergo serious testing in the primaries and caucuses.\n\nWhen the public has soured on Democratic policies, party rebels double down and demand more.\n\nThere is a larger problem here, not just for Clinton but also for her party. Since the 1930s it has been dedicated to the proposition that expanding government will help ordinary citizens make their way through the perils of (then) an industrial-age and (now) an information-age society.\n\nThe problem is that these seven years of the Obama administration, quite contrary to the president\u2019s intention, have discredited government as an instrument to improve people\u2019s lives.\n\nThe most glaring failure has been Obamacare, from the implosion of the HealthCare.gov website to the recent announcement of the nation\u2019s largest health insurer that it would no longer offer policies on Obamacare\u2019s exchanges.\n\nDesigning government policies that can produce positive results without negative unanticipated consequences is a tricky business. Social Security required government to collect taxes and send out checks on time \u2014 something a competent bureaucracy can do. Obamacare requires government to do many more things, some of which government is not very good at. Voters have noticed.\n\nThey have noticed, as well, that government is no longer very good at doing things almost everyone thinks it should do, such as providing health care for military veterans. Democrats can argue that the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital system\u2019s problems antedate 2008. But government is their baby, and they\u2019ve been in charge for seven years.\n\nLast week\u2019s mass murders in San Bernardino have underlined government\u2019s limits. Obama and Clinton have called for more gun-control measures. But California already has the laws they want Congress to pass. Overall trends in Pew Research Center polling data in the last 20 years show an increase in the percent of Americans who support gun rights and a decrease in the percent of Americans who support gun control.\n\nA third problem for Democrats is apparent in the fact that near the end of multiple Democratic presidential terms, sizable forces in the party turn left. A few examples are: Henry Wallace\u2019s Progressives in 1948; the anti-Vietnam War movement in 1968; Edward Kennedy\u2019s challenge of Jimmy Carter in 1980; and Ralph Nader\u2019s third-party candidacy in 2000.\n\nSimilar things are happening today \u2014 in the Bernie Sanders candidacy, the Black Lives Matter movement, and rebellions on college campuses. When the public has soured on Democratic policies, party rebels double down and demand more.\n\nRepublicans have faced similar discontent on the right, from Barry Goldwater in 1960, Ronald Reagan in 1976, Pat Buchanan in the 1990s, and the Tea Party movement in the wake of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut the problem is more acute for the Democratic party, which has always been a coalition of disparate groups: the top and bottom of the income and education scales, ghetto blacks and gentry liberals, left-wing academics and labor unions.\n\nHolding that coalition together is easier when faith in government is strong. It\u2019s harder today, when, as Pew reports, only 19 percent of Americans say they can trust the government all or most of the time. For Democrats, that\u2019s a big problem.\n\n\u2014 Michael Barone is senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner. \u00a9 2015 the Washington Examiner.
