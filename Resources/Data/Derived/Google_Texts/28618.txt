The production won five Tony awards in 2011.

"It's a really magical experience for young children to see these creatures brought to life, to see these beautiful horses and I just can't think of anything else that's out there that's quite like it,‚Äù associate director Sarna Lapine said.

War Horse will kickoff its tour in Sioux Falls on Thursday and Friday night before heading to Canada.
