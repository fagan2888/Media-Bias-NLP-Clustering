The park is stepping up in a big way to keep everyone safe.\n\nWhite tents now take up space at Disney World entrances with metal detectors inside. Park officials say visitors will be randomly selected to secondary screenings. Several major league sports and entertainment venues already do this.\n\nDisney has also added \"visible\" and \"non-visible\" security measures. Those include uniformed officers and specially trained dogs.\n\nOnce inside the parks, guests will no longer see toy guns or even water pistols. Those are being removed from Disney stores and visitors will not be allowed to bring them into the parks. Officials do not want fake guns to become distractions or cause confusion.\n\nAnother change, anyone 14 years and older can no longer wear costumes. This helps to move along the screening process.\n\nDisney is not the only place making these changes. SeaWorld and Universal are taking similar precautions.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Visitors to Disney theme parks in California and Florida will notice tighter security and some new rules.\u00a0The park is stepping up in a big way to keep everyone safe.", "author": "Justin Dougherty", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30784527/theme-parks-including-disney-step-up-security", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9486757_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Visitors to Disney theme parks in California and Florida will notice tighter security and some new rules.\u00a0The park is stepping up in a big way to keep everyone safe.", "title": "Theme Parks, Including Disney, Step Up Security"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9486757_G.jpg", "description": "Visitors to Disney theme parks in California and Florida will notice tighter security and some new rules.\u00a0The park is stepping up in a big way to keep everyone safe.", "card": "summary", "title": "Theme Parks, Including Disney, Step Up Security"}, "wnreadableurl": "theme-parks-including-disney-step-up-security", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/12/18", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local, disney, theme parks, california, florida, security, rules, news 9, kwtv, news9.com", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS27", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local, disney, theme parks, california, florida, security, rules, news 9, kwtv, news9.com"}, "article_summary": "Visitors to Disney theme parks in California and Florida will notice tighter security and some new rules.\nPark officials say visitors will be randomly selected to secondary screenings.\nThose are being removed from Disney stores and visitors will not be allowed to bring them into the parks.\nWhite tents now take up space at Disney World entrances with metal detectors inside.\nDisney has also added \"visible\" and \"non-visible\" security measures."}
