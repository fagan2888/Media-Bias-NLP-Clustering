Another tip-off is the lack of a face, as poachers hack off the tusks to be sold for ivory. That ivory is then made into valuable trinkets in Asia or even parts of violin bows in Europe and North America. The proceeds often fund terrorism and other criminal enterprises. And such poaching is causing populations of African elephants to decline by at least 2 percent per year since 2010, according to a new paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. At least 100,000 elephants have died in just the last three years. If this rate continues, African elephants could go extinct in a few decades.\n\nPoaching has been on the rise since 2008; and in 2011 alone as many as 40,000 elephants died for their tusks. The new field census of carcasses provides the first assessment of just how bad such poaching has become in recent years. In Kenya, at least, the rate of elephant kills matched up almost perfectly with black market ivory prices, suggesting that as ivory gets more expensive, more elephants will be killed for their ivory.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences highlights just how perilous their survival has become", "title": "Poaching could drive elephants to extinction in decades", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences highlights just how perilous their survival has become", "title": "Poaching could drive elephants to extinction in decades", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/20/poaching_could_drive_elephants_to_extinction_in_decades_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/elephant.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences highlights just how perilous their survival has become", "title": "Poaching could drive elephants to extinction in decades", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/elephant.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Biello", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Africa, elephants, Ivory, Poaching, Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad34\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Africa, elephants, Ivory, Poaching, Scientific American, Life NewsThis article was originally published by Scientific AmericanTwo or more dead elephants in one place means one thing: poaching by professional killers.\nIf this rate continues, African elephants could go extinct in a few decades.\nPoaching has been on the rise since 2008; and in 2011 alone as many as 40,000 elephants died for their tusks.\nAnd such poaching is causing populations of African elephants to decline by at least 2 percent per year since 2010, according to a new paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe new field census of carcasses provides the first assessment of just how bad such poaching has become in recent years."}
