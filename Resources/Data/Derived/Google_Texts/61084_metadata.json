Cyprych\u2019s responsibilities include facilitating the department\u2019s strategic and tactical planning, leading business process modeling and redesign activities, developing business requirements and test plans, and managing the operational data submission processes. Risk adjustment is a government reimbursement program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n\u201cI am passionate about identifying an organization\u2019s business goals and developing people, process, and technology strategies to support these goals,\u201d said Cyprych, who was a member of the campus' Honors program. \u201cI enjoy bringing cross-functional teams together to accomplish a common goal.\u201d\n\nA frequent guest speaker in IST classes at the campus, Cyprych enjoys interacting with the students and sharing her experiences in the corporate world. In addition, she has sponsored projects for the senior capstone course, and she has participated as an employer partner of the GREAT (Growing Regional Excellence through Experience, Academics, and Training) program for promising students in engineering and technology fields.\n\nNew Kensington\u2019s IST program gives students a background in the core technical areas of networking, databases, programming, and system integration. Graduates are trained in key business areas, such as project management and organization theory. The capstone course, \u201cInformation Sciences and Technology Integration and Problem Solving,\u201d provides students with real-life problems faced by organizations. Each semester, nationally-known corporations bring campus students on-board as interns for special projects. At the end of the semester, the students present their results to the company, usually in front of its top management. The campus program is one of best in the Penn State system.
