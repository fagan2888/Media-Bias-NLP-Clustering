Bush\u2019s blunders and occasional triumphs during the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq after 9/11.\n\nSpeaking in the passive tense popular with politicians trying to dance around inconvenient truths, Jeb Bush told a gathering of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, \u201cThere were mistakes made in Iraq for sure.\u201d\n\nOn the Bush administration\u2019s long-discredited assertion that Iraq president Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction that justified an invasion in 2003, Jeb Bush said his brother fell victim to faulty intelligence.\n\n\u201cUsing the intelligence capability that everybody embraced about weapons of mass destruction turns out not to be accurate,\u201d Bush said.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush Assails President Obama for Poor Leadership\n\nAs for President Bush\u2019s decision to dismantle the Iraqi military that drove some military officers into the arms of rebels and terrorists, Jeb Bush conceded, \u201cNot creating an environment of security after the successful taking out of Hussein was a mistake because Iraq wanted security more than anything else.\u201d\n\nBut Bush praised his brother\u2019s 2007 decision to increase substantially the American troop count in Iraq to provide security to Baghdad and Al Anbar Province \u2013 even as the public and political leaders clamored for an end to the war.\n\n\u201cMy brother\u2019s administration through the surge was one of the most heroic acts of courage politically that any president has done,\u201d Jeb Bush said. \u201cIt was hugely successful and it created a stability that when [President Obama] came in, he could have built on it to create a fragile but more stable situation that would have not allowed for a void to be filled.\u201d\n\n\n\nBringing his colloquy on Iraq full circle, he sharply blamed Obama for weak and myopic military and foreign policy leadership in Iraq and neighboring Syria.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush Could Rake in Record Campaign Funds\n\nBush said the president\u2019s missteps and indecisiveness paved the way for the rise of ISIS and contributed to a costly and destructive civil war in Syria in which President Bashar Hafez al Assad has gained the upper hand. Bush said the power vacuum also encouraged Iran to exert more influence among Shiite forces in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe void has been filled because we have created the void,\u201d Bush said. \u201cSo the lesson I think is [the importance of] engagement. Whether it\u2019s always the United States, that\u2019s another subject. I don\u2019t think it has to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cISIS didn\u2019t exist three or four years ago,\u201d Bush reminded his audience. \u201cIn fact, the guy who is the supreme leader [Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi] . . . he was in a prison in southern Iraq.\u201d\n\nCan Jeb Bush Sell America on His Foreign Policy\n\nOne thing Jeb Bush will have to come to terms with: Recent polls suggest many GOP voters are suffering from Bush fatigue. A new Quinnipiac University survey of the battleground states of Colorado, Iowa and Virginia found voters are saying by 4 to 1 margins that Bush\u2019s family ties make them less likely to vote for him when balloting begins.\n\nRelated: Kurdish Leader Doubts Obama Has An ISIS Plan\n\nDuring his speech, Bush distanced himself from the record of his father and brother, declaring that while he loves his family, \u201cI\u2019m my own man \u2013 and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experience.\u201d\n\nOverall, Bush\u2019s brief discourse on his brother\u2019s role in the Middle East was deft and insightful, while occasionally stretching the truth. Some scholars note, for example, that it\u2019s disingenuous to blame the CIA and intelligence community for faulty information about the Iraqi threat when the Bush White House repeatedly invoked the specter of an Iraq allied with al-Qaeda terrorists and in possession of nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile Obama has been criticized for prematurely declaring an end to the Iraq War and withdrawing most U.S. troops by the end of 2011, Iraqi officials had by then nearly nine years to prepare to stand on their own.\n\nStill, as Bush argues, Obama\u2019s unwillingness to attack Assad\u2019s murderous regime or arm moderate Syrian rebels to fight Assad left the door open to the rise of ISIS and other terror groups in Syria and Iraq.\n\nRelated: 20 Facts about Baghdadi, the Elusive ISIS Leader\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clever framing by Bush because he obviously is re-litigating the whole thing,\u201d noted Michael E. O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who specializes in defense and foreign policy issues.\n\nO\u2019Hanlon said Bush is essentially asking Americans for \u201ca little deference\u201d in determining how far he must go to re-litigate his brother\u2019s decision to invade Iraq, while launching broadsides against Obama\u2019s conduct in the Middle East. \u201cIf it\u2019s fair for him to go after Obama, then it\u2019s fair for the whole war to be reconsidered, including the initial decision,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon said. \u201cIt means you can\u2019t escape, no matter who your brother is.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said recently that when he finally spelled out his fo", "title": "Jeb Bush on His Brother: \u2018Mistakes Were Made\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/19/Jeb-Bush-His-Brother-Mistakes-Were-Made", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-bush-jeb_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/19/Jeb-Bush-His-Brother-Mistakes-Were-Made", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-bush-jeb_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said recently that when he finally spelled out his fo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd618e\"", "article_summary": "he was in a prison in southern Iraq.\u201dCan Jeb Bush Sell America on His Foreign PolicyOne thing Jeb Bush will have to come to terms with: Recent polls suggest many GOP voters are suffering from Bush fatigue.\nSpeaking in the passive tense popular with politicians trying to dance around inconvenient truths, Jeb Bush told a gathering of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, \u201cThere were mistakes made in Iraq for sure.\u201dOn the Bush administration\u2019s long-discredited assertion that Iraq president Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction that justified an invasion in 2003, Jeb Bush said his brother fell victim to faulty intelligence.\n\u201cMy brother\u2019s administration through the surge was one of the most heroic acts of courage politically that any president has done,\u201d Jeb Bush said.\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush said recently that when he finally spelled out his foreign policy views, he would focus on the future and not \u201cre-litigate\u201d the wars his brother led in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\u201cUsing the intelligence capability that everybody embraced about weapons of mass destruction turns out not to be accurate,\u201d Bush said."}
