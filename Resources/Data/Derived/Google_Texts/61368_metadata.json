What are other sources of fiber?\n\nA: Your questions are important because they focus on two healthful eating goals: 1) Eat more whole grains and 2) Eat more dietary fiber.\n\nWhole grains contain the essential parts and naturally occurring nutrients of the entire grain seed \u2014 the bran, germ and endosperm. Oats and barley are whole grains. Whole-wheat flour is a whole-grain ingredient in bread and pasta.\n\nOver 40 percent of Americans never eat any whole grains. Surprising? Not with all the bread, baked goods and pizza made with refined flour that we eat.\n\nDietary fiber includes the portions of plant-based foods that are not digested plus beneficial fibers added by manufacturers. Our foods contain hundreds of fibers \u2014 some help with digestion and regularity, others improve blood fats and others help with weight control. You need all types.\n\nDietary fiber is found in whole grains, legumes (beans and peas), fruits and vegetables. To eat enough, get it from all food sources.\n\nMost Americans get nowhere close to the 25 grams per day recommended for adults.\n\nTo eat more whole grains:\n\n\u2022 Get to know the whole grains and which ones contain lots of fiber.\n\n\u2022 Choose brown rice over white rice (even in restaurants) and whole-wheat over white pasta.\n\n\u2022 Select whole-grain (and high-fiber) cereals. For hot cereal, try oatmeal, oat bran or quinoa. With dry cereals, look for a whole-oat or whole-grain cereal that's also high in fiber.\n\n\u2022 Select whole-grain bread, rolls or pizza crust. If there's no stamp or claim, check the ingredients. It needs to say whole-grain, whole wheat, whole or stone-ground whole.\n\nTo eat more fiber:\n\n\u2022 Educate yourself about fiber content by checking labels or looking them up with a food nutrient app.\n\n\u2022 Eat 2 1/2 cups each of fruit and vegetables per day \u2014 more if you've got the calories to spare.\n\n\u2022 Eat more legumes \u2014 dried, frozen or canned.\n\n\u2013Hope Warshaw, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/02/iStock_000017854219Small.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce62d\"", "article_summary": "To eat more fiber:\u2022 Educate yourself about fiber content by checking labels or looking them up with a food nutrient app.\nWhole grains contain the essential parts and naturally occurring nutrients of the entire grain seed \u2014 the bran, germ and endosperm.\nQ: Do all whole grains contain dietary fiber?\nA: Your questions are important because they focus on two healthful eating goals: 1) Eat more whole grains and 2) Eat more dietary fiber.\n\u2022 Select whole-grain bread, rolls or pizza crust."}
