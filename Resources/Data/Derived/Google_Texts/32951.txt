LAS VEGAS (AP) - The Nevada Division of Insurance is asking a state court to place the Nevada Health Co-Op into receivership and appoint the state’s insurance commissioner to oversee it.

The agency said Friday it filed a petition with the eighth judicial district court in Carson City.

The Nevada Health Co-Op created as part of the Affordable Care Act had announced in August it would close by the end of the year because of high costs.

The state agency says it has concerns with the co-op’s ability to manage and meet its obligations through the end of the year based on a plan the co-op submitted to the Division of Insurance.

The co-op enrolled 14,000 people last year and the agency says members can still see their doctors and receive benefits through 2015.
