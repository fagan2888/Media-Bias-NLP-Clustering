(Delaware State News photo by Jen Rini)\n\nDOVER \u2014 In 1968, Dr. Mario Disabatino, fresh out of his dental residency with the U.S. Navy, was one of two practicing dentists in Smyrna.\n\nHe remembers the backlog of patients, with no ability to finagle the schedule to accommodate additional ones at Glenwood Dental Associates.\n\nThe shortage of doctors existed until about 2000, when dentists slowly started to come to the area.\n\n\u201cEver heard of Dagsboro?\u201d he quipped.\n\nCurrently, the Sussex County town of about 829 people has three local dentists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting to fill in,\u201d he said, adding that there are seven now in Smyrna and expects that number to go up.\n\nAccording to a study prepared by the University of Delaware for the Delaware Division of Public Health, there are 381 active dentists in the state. Although the number has decreased by 16 since 2008, the number of specialists has increased by five.\n\nJill Rogers, executive director of the Delaware Health Care Commission, said the issue is one of geography.\n\nBy the numbers, there are 238 general or pediatric dentists in New Castle County, 48 in Kent County and 40 in Sussex. In terms of specialists, such as oral surgeons, there are 39 in New Castle, seven in Kent and nine in Sussex.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the map and look at the number of providers, there are more providers in New Castle County per capita,\u201d Ms. Rogers said. \u201cThe distribution is the problem, not the number.\u201d\n\nRecruitment efforts\n\nDr. Greg McClure, director of the Bureau of Oral Health and Dental Services in the Division of Public Health, said when he began his tenure in Delaware in 1999, Kent and Sussex counties were definitely considered shortage areas, especially in terms of pediatric dentistry.\n\n\u201cI think they are in short supply nationally,\u201d Ms. Rogers added.\n\nFrom 2010 until August 2013, the bureau ran a pediatric dentist recruitment program with a concerted effort to bring two pediatric dentists to Sussex County.\n\nSince its inception in 2001, the State Loan Repayment Program has been crucial for such recruitment efforts.\n\nDental applicants can apply for a combination of state and federal funds in exchange for relocating to a practice area designated as a health professional shortage area.\n\nThe program states the average awards for advanced-degree practitioners range from $25,000 to $35,000 for a two-year contract, while average awards for mid-level practitioners range from $10,000 to $15,000 for a two-year contract. All awards are evaluated on a graduated scale.\n\nAlthough the bureau was unable to recruit two dentists, Dr. McClure said the addition of just one pediatric dentist made a significant difference.\n\n\u201cWe see it as important as people should be coming for dental care at age 1,\u201d he said.\n\nPennsylvania-educated Dr. Jessica DiCerbo was the pediatric dentist who benefitted from the program.\n\nSince opening her practice in Rehoboth Beach this August, she said she\u2019s seen an influx in patients.\n\n\u201cThe word of mouth has gotten out,\u201d she said.\n\nPreviously, some of her patients would have to drive to Salisbury, Md., for children\u2019s dental care.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a real convenience for parents,\u201d Dr. DiCerbo said, adding that her practice takes Medicaid insurance, which is an advantage for families of different economic backgrounds.\n\nDental decay in children is the top chronic childhood disease, she said, so advance care is crucial.\n\n\u201cChildren do not complain about their teeth until it is really bad,\u201d Dr. DiCerbo said.\n\nLapse in care?\n\nEven though dental care is connected to overall health, it may be the one component that is most neglected.\n\nAnd with the economy at a standstill, Dr. Disabatino said individuals who have lost insurance are reluctant to come in for yearly check-ups.\n\nNow kicking in with the Affordable Care Act in 2014, dental care for children is considered an essential benefit.\n\nHowever, unlike health insurance, if adults do not sign up for dental insurance, they will not be required to pay the yearly penalty.\n\n\u201cWe will have to wait and see,\u201d Dr. Disabatino said of the new health care law.\n\nDr. Amit Patel, of American Dental Care in Dover, would be ecstatic to have more patients.\n\nThey are seeing a lot of open blocks of time during office hours five days a week.\n\n\u201cWe do try to make ourselves accessible,\u201d Dr. Patel said.\n\nBut the issue of the number of people actively seeking dental care still remains.\n\n\u201cWe need to get the awareness out there so people are taking a personal [stake] in their hygiene,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe do have space for new patients and we do welcome them.\u201d\n\nStaff writer Jen Rini can be reached at 741-8250 or jrini@newszap.com.
