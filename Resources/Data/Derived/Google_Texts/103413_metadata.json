He further alleged that his questions and requests for information were ignored by officials in the Fire Department.\n\n\u201cFor far too long, AMR has been the only one responding to bids,\u201d Stuckart said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen this time.\u201d\n\nLast week, Mayor David Condon said he was meeting with members of his administration to discuss rebidding the five-year contract. Brian Coddington, the mayor\u2019s spokesman, said a decision could come as early as Monday.\n\nFire Chief Bobby Williams dismissed Stuckart\u2019s allegation that he and his administration were playing favorites by adding a line into the bidding papers that said an ambulance company had to operate in at least one city with a population of at least 150,000 within the United States.\n\nFalck, a company based in Denmark that claims to be the world\u2019s largest ambulance provider, didn\u2019t meet the U.S. qualification. Michael Collins, the CEO of Falck Northwest, said \u201cthere was a high probability we would have bid\u201d if his company hadn\u2019t been barred by the U.S. provision. He wouldn\u2019t say if Falck would consider a new bid. Falck currently serves some cities with populations lower than 150,000 within the United States. Falck Northwest currently provides ambulance service between medical facilities in Western Washington.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll certainly evaluate it,\u201d he said.\n\nWilliams, the fire chief, said he was \u201cshocked that this was brought up as an issue.\u201d He said the U.S. provision, which was not part of any previous ambulance contract in Spokane, was added because of rules and regulations stemming from reimbursement policies for Medicare and Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. A contract could be endangered if a company was unprepared for such rules, Williams said.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure from a community protection standpoint that they won\u2019t walk away, leaving our citizens holding the bag,\u201d Williams said.\n\nStuckart called Williams\u2019 argument \u201cthe most condescending thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d He added that he considered the City Council a \u201cwatchdog\u201d of government affairs and that he expected competition to be part of a competitive bidding process.\n\nJason Sorrick, a spokesman for AMR, said the bidding process was open and transparent and that the company expects to be awarded the contract.\n\n\u201cWe know the system inside and out. We are the best equipped to provide for that system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were the selected bidder.\u201d\n\nThe company has operated in the area for 50 years, has 165 employees in Spokane and averages about 18,000 transports within the city every year. Sorrick said the company\u2019s prime concern with redoing the bid is other potential bidders could have access to information in its bid, such as pricing and its deployment model.\n\n\u201cThe other football team has the playbook and now they\u2019re going to play us for the championship,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Spokane, the fire department provides first-response care at a medical emergency while AMR transports patients to the hospital. AMR paramedics provide first-response care when they arrive before firefighters.\n\nAMR was last awarded a contract in 2003. It signed a five-year extension in 2008, followed by a one-year extension last year, while the city waited for the Fire Service Task Force to issue recommendations. That extension ends next month.\n\nIf the city decides to rebid the contract, it likely will ask AMR to sign yet another extension while the process plays out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve signed an extension in the past, and we\u2019ll remain that provider until they decide how to move forward,\u201d Sorrick said. \u201cHow many times do we go through that process before we are given the contract for which we were selected?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spokane leaders may rebid an ambulance contract after no competition emerged to challenge the firm that already provides the city\u2019s emergency transportation.
