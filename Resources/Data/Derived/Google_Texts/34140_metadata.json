The accusations led one Democratic lawmaker to label the hearing \u201ca monkey court.\u201d\n\nIn heated exchanges, Reps. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Joe Barton (R-TX) pressed the contractors responsible for writing the code behind HealthCare.gov about why some of their employees had access to \u201cthe database servers storing the enrolling information,\u201d and questioned source code informing users that they \u201chave no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting stored on this information system.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow in the world can this be HIPAA compliant when HIPAA is designed to protect the patient\u2019s privacy and this explicitly says in order to continue you have to accept this condition that you have no privacy \u2014 no reasonable expectation of privacy?\u201d Barton asked Cheryl Campbell, senior vice president of CGI, one of the firms that wrote the website. He was referring to The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the law that guarantees \u201cfederal protections for individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates and gives patients an array of rights with respect to that information.\u201d\n\nRep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) pushed back against the implications, arguing that \u201cHIPAA only applies when there\u2019s health information is being provided,\u201d not the biographical enrollment information that\u2019s being entered by programmers. \u201cHIPAA doesn\u2019t apply. There is no health information in the process. You\u2019re asked about your address, your date of birth. you are not asked health information,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Washington & Lee Law Professor Timothy S. Jost explained to ThinkProgress in an email, \u201cHIPAA only applies to health care providers, clearinghouses (and this is a narrowly defined term) health plans, and their business associates.\u201d \u201cEven so, access is available to data without consent for health care operations, which this would be.\u201d Deven McGraw, of the Health Privacy Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology, agreed, adding, \u201cIt does not violate HIPAA \u2013 it\u2019s not even covered by HIPAA.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not yield to this monkey court or whatever it is,\u201d Pallone said in response to Republican interruptions. \u201cWhy are we going down this path?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause you are trying to scare people so they don\u2019t apply and so therefore the legislation gets delayed or the Affordable Care Act gets defunded or it\u2019s repealed. That\u2019s all it is, hoping people won\u2019t apply.\u201d Watch it:\n\nAll of the contractors at the hearing indicated that they had received HIPAA training and were HIPAA compliant.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "House Republicans sought to portray HealthCare.gov as an insecure website that will endanger the privacy of Americans' medical information.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "House Republicans sought to portray HealthCare.gov as an insecure website that will endanger the privacy of Americans' medical information.", "title": "Democrat Blasts GOP\u2019s Obamacare Hearing: \u2018I Will Not Yield To This Monkey Court\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/24/2830271/democrat-blasts-gop-health-care-committee-hearing-yield-monkey-court/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/110710_frank_pallone_ap_328.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Republicans sought to portray HealthCare.gov as an insecure website that will endanger the privacy of Americans' medical information.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/110710_frank_pallone_ap_328-321x214.jpg", "title": "Democrat Blasts GOP\u2019s Obamacare Hearing: \u2018I Will Not Yield To This Monkey Court\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/110710_frank_pallone_ap_328.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/110710_frank_pallone_ap_328.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-24T10:56:18+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe0b\"", "article_summary": "you are not asked health information,\u201d he said.\nThere is no health information in the process.\n\u201cBecause you are trying to scare people so they don\u2019t apply and so therefore the legislation gets delayed or the Affordable Care Act gets defunded or it\u2019s repealed.\nThat\u2019s all it is, hoping people won\u2019t apply.\u201d Watch it:All of the contractors at the hearing indicated that they had received HIPAA training and were HIPAA compliant.\nHealth Democrat Blasts GOP\u2019s Obamacare Hearing: \u2018I Will Not Yield To This Monkey Court\u2019 CREDIT:Rather than focusing on the real problems plaguing HealthCare.gov, House Republicans sought to portray the website as an insecure portal that will endanger the privacy of American\u2019s medical information during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing focusing on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act."}
