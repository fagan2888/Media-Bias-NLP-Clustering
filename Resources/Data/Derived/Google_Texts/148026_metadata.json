Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Rep. Erik Paulsen, R-Minn., just introduced companion legislation that would boost the power of Health Savings Accounts, which allow consumers to set aside money tax-free for health care expenses.\n\nThey\u2019re right to bet on HSAs, whose popularity has exploded in recent years. By empowering patients to take control of their care, HSAs have injected some consumerist discipline into the marketplace.\n\nIn so doing, they\u2019re helping to reduce overall health spending, which reached $3 trillion last year.\n\nHere\u2019s how HSAs work. The federal government allows contributions of up to $3,350 for individuals or $6,750 for families, as long as consumers have a high-deductible insurance policy. But \u201chigh\u201d doesn\u2019t mean sky high. Currently, anyone with at least a $1,300 annual deductible for an individual or $2,600 for a family can qualify for an HSA.\n\nThe money going into the account is untaxed, as is any interest it earns. Consumers can also withdraw the funds without paying tax, provided they go toward a qualified medical expense, a copayment, the cost of a prescription drug, or other medical bills.\n\nThe money in an HSA account rolls over from year to year. And a consumer can keep it forever, even if he changes jobs or switches insurance plans.\n\nBecause consumers have direct control over their HSA dollars, they have a strong incentive to spend their money wisely. Perhaps they\u2019ll pick the low-cost generic over the name-brand drug \u2014 or compare what different hospitals charge for an elective procedure.\n\nThe high-deductible policy, meanwhile, protects them from financial ruin in the event of a catastrophe.\n\nLast year, enrollment in HSA-compatible plans climbed 13%, to almost 20 million. One in 5 workers is now enrolled in an employer-sponsored HSA plan. More than 2 million people have bought HSA plans on the individual market.\n\nAs of the middle of last year, these HSA accounts contained $28.4 billion in assets. Those billions belong to consumers \u2014 not insurance companies.\n\nHSA-driven consumerism has helped drive down health costs. A study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research looked at spending data on 13 million people working for 54 large companies and found that costs were \u201csignificantly lower in each of the first three years\u201d after a company included an HSA plan in its benefits mix.\n\nPresident Obama promised that his health reform law wouldn\u2019t interfere with HSAs. But that hasn\u2019t happened. For instance, ObamaCare blocks people from spending HSA dollars on over-the-counter drugs.\n\nThe law\u2019s looming \u201cCadillac tax\u201d \u2014 now delayed until 2020 \u2014 is supposed to discourage overly generous health insurance plans by taxing individual plans that cost more than $10,200 and family plans beyond $27,000. But it may end up whacking HSA-compatible plans because the tax treats HSA contributions as part of the cost of a policy.\n\nThat makes little sense. HSA contributions don\u2019t go to insurance companies \u2014 they\u2019re savings owned by consumers. And the data show that HSA contributions help lower long-term healthcare spending \u2014 which is exactly what the Cadillac tax intends to do.\n\nThe Hatch-Paulsen initiative aims to bolster HSAs \u2014 not hinder them.\n\nFirst, the two lawmakers would allow seniors to contribute to HSAs after they become eligible for Medicare at age 65; they can\u2019t do so under current law, even if they\u2019re still working.\n\nThey\u2019d also make it easier for HSA-holders over the age of 55 to make $1,000 catch-up contributions. That would allow people nearing retirement, when they\u2019re likely to face hefty medical bills, to build up their health-care nest eggs faster.\n\nThe two lawmakers would also allow employees who have on-site medical coverage at their workplaces to open HSAs. And they\u2019d restore HSA-holders\u2019 ability to use the funds for over-the-counter medicines.\n\nBut lawmakers shouldn\u2019t stop there. They should consider making the HSA contribution caps equal to those for individual retirement accounts \u2014 $5,500 per person, and $6,500 per person over the age of 50.\n\nTwelve years ago, HSAs didn\u2019t exist. Today, 20 million people count on them. They\u2019ve empowered consumers to take charge of their care and saved the healthcare system money. Lawmakers should be doing everything they can to get them in the hands of more people.\n\nPipes is president, CEO and Thomas W. Smith Fellow in Health Care Policy at the Pacific Research Institute.
