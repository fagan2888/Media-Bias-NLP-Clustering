He said the core of his ruling is whether a union has to provide free services.\n\n\u201cThe decision boils down to something as simple as \u2018there is no free lunch,\u2019\u201d the judge said.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Brad Schimel, who is defending the law, immediately said he\u2019ll seek a stay from a state appeals court \u201cwhere we feel confident this law will be upheld.\u201d\n\nRight-to-work laws prohibit businesses and unions from reaching agreements that require all workers, not just union members, to pay union dues. Since unions must represent all employees in a workplace, the laws essentially allow non-union workers to benefit from union representation for free. Twenty-five states have such laws. Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed Wisconsin\u2019s version last year.\n\nThree unions \u2014 the AFL-CIO\u2019s Wisconsin chapter, Machinists Local Lodge 1061 and United Steelworkers District 2 \u2014 filed a lawsuit challenging the law in March 2015, arguing the statutes amount to an illegal taking of their services without compensation.\n\nFoust found the law unconstitutional earlier this month. The state Justice Department asked Foust last week to stay the ruling. They filed notice of appeal the same day with the Wausau-based 3rd District Court of Appeals.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Steven Kilpatrick argued at a hearing Monday that the judge should grant the stay because the state likely will win the appeal, all statutes are presumed constitutional and the state suffers harm any time it can\u2019t enforce a law and unions aren\u2019t likely to suffer substantial harm if the law remains in place pending the appeal.\n\nFred Perillo, the unions\u2019 attorney, countered that a stay would harm the unions. He said keeping the law in place would cost the unions thousands of dollars in potential dues, prevent them from negotiating contracts requiring due payments and prohibit contract clauses reinstating union dues if right-to-work was struck down from taking effect.\n\nThe Wisconsin AFL-CIO issued a statement praising Foust for again affirming that the right-to-work law is unconstitutional.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "A Dane County judge refused Monday to stay his ruling striking down Wisconsin\u2019s right-to-work law.", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.gazettextra.com/storyimage/JG/20160425/ARTICLES/160429825/EP/1/1/EP-160429825.jpg", "height": 710}, "type": "article", "description": "A Dane County judge refused Monday to stay his ruling striking down Wisconsin\u2019s right-to-work law.", "title": "Judge refuses to stay Wisconsin right-to-work ruling"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Dane County judge refused Monday to stay his ruling striking down Wisconsin\u2019s right-to-work law.", "title": "Judge refuses to stay Wisconsin right-to-work ruling", "url": "http://www.gazettextra.com/20160425/judge_refuses_to_stay_wisconsin_right_to_work_ruling", "image": "http://www.gazettextra.com/storyimage/JG/20160425/ARTICLES/160429825/EP/1/1/EP-160429825.jpg", "site": "@gazettextra", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 184800176}, "article": {"published_time": 20160425122449}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3f2\"", "article_summary": "Judge refuses to stay Wisconsin right-to-work rulingA Dane County judge refused Monday to stay his ruling striking down Wisconsin\u2019s right-to-work law.\nThe Wisconsin AFL-CIO issued a statement praising Foust for again affirming that the right-to-work law is unconstitutional.\nMADISON \u2014 A Dane County judge refused Monday to stay his ruling striking down Wisconsin\u2019s right-to-work law, reiterating his position that the legislation wrongly enables non-union workers to receive free representation.\nThe state Justice Department asked Foust last week to stay the ruling.\n\u201cThe decision boils down to something as simple as \u2018there is no free lunch,\u2019\u201d the judge said."}
