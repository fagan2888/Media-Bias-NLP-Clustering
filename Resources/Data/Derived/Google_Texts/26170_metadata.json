In the years that followed, the tentacles of this policy crept into other federally funded health plans, standing in the way of abortion coverage for federal employees, as well as women serving in the military and Peace Corps.\n\nIt\u2019s time to restore federal funding for abortion care.\n\nThe impact of denying abortion coverage is devastating, especially for women struggling to make ends meet. In the Northwest, where the average cost of a first-trimester abortion is $650 and the monthly income of a full-time, low-wage worker is about $1,400, the coverage bans force women to choose between rent and medical care.\n\nBecause six out of 10 women who terminate pregnancies are mothers, these bans force parents to cut back on necessities like groceries and diapers for their children. They also force one in four poor women seeking abortion to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. And a woman who wants to end a pregnancy but is denied is more likely to fall into poverty than one who got an abortion.\n\nHowever we feel about abortion, politicians shouldn\u2019t be allowed to deny a woman\u2019s health coverage just because she\u2019s poor. When a health plan covers the costs of all pregnancy care, including abortion, it means a woman can make decisions based on what is best for her circumstances.\n\nIt\u2019s time to ensure that every woman has access to affordable abortion care if she needs it.\n\nWe\u2019re making progress regionally. Last year, the Seattle City Council unanimously approved a resolution calling on Congress and President Obama to repeal all federal bans on public coverage of abortion, noting that more than 4,000 Seattle women of reproductive age are insured through the federal government and are therefore impacted by the current coverage bans. And the Reproductive Health Act, introduced but not passed this year in the state Legislature, would require insurance companies to equitably serve all women by covering abortion care if the companies cover maternity care. In addition, Washington and Oregon cover abortion with their own state Medicaid funds. But Idaho, along with 31 other states and the District of Columbia, currently withholds state Medicaid coverage of abortion.\n\nWhen a woman in our region needs an abortion but can\u2019t afford it, she calls the Northwest\u2019s abortion fund, The CAIR Project. CAIR runs a hotline and provides referrals, fundraising counseling and financial help in the form of grants to the caller\u2019s clinic for her abortion care.\n\nI serve on The CAIR Project board and volunteer on the hotline. There are no typical callers, only typical barriers: no insurance, insurance that won\u2019t pay for abortion or insurance with a deductible so high \u2014 \u201cBronze\u201d plans in Washington have deductibles ranging from around $3,750 to $6,500 \u2014 the entire procedure must be paid for out of pocket. I\u2019ve spoken to a woman in the Navy whose insurance didn\u2019t cover abortion, so she and her husband were struggling to scrape together the $700; a woman with only $75 in her checking account; a woman who, to afford her $450 abortion, had to return the Christmas gift she\u2019d purchased for her toddler.\n\nBut there\u2019s a growing national movement, All* Above All, that gives me the hope that someday our hotline will no longer ring. The centerpiece is the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH Woman) Act, a bold and visionary bill introduced in Congress this year to ensure abortion coverage for every woman \u2014 no matter her income, source of insurance or ZIP code.\n\nThis is what our lawmakers should be focusing on: expanding access to health care, not trying to take it away.\n\nWhen it comes to the most important decisions in life \u2014 like whether to become a parent \u2014 a woman\u2019s decision should be based on what is best for her and her family\u2019s circumstances, not on what she earns, how she is insured or where she lives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When it comes to reproductive rights, lawmakers should focus on expanding access to health care, not trying to take it away.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "When it comes to reproductive rights, lawmakers should focus on expanding access to health care, not trying to take it away.", "title": "Time to restore abortion funding, helping low-income women", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/its-time-to-restore-funding-for-abortion/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/c7948224-7460-11e5-b18f-7ddd8da15963-1020x1036.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When it comes to reproductive rights, lawmakers should focus on expanding access to health care, not trying to take it away.", "site": "@seattletimes", "card": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/c7948224-7460-11e5-b18f-7ddd8da15963-780x792.jpg", "title": "Time to restore abortion funding, helping low-income women"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2015-10-18 16:01:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-16 16:52:31"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Opinion"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb21a\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s time to restore federal funding for abortion care.\nThe impact of denying abortion coverage is devastating, especially for women struggling to make ends meet.\nCAIR runs a hotline and provides referrals, fundraising counseling and financial help in the form of grants to the caller\u2019s clinic for her abortion care.\nThis is what our lawmakers should be focusing on: expanding access to health care, not trying to take it away.\nHowever we feel about abortion, politicians shouldn\u2019t be allowed to deny a woman\u2019s health coverage just because she\u2019s poor."}
