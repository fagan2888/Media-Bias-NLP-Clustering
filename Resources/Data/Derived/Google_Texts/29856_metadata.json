Khalifa Hifter\u2019s comments underscored the obstacles to any agreement between rival governments in Libya. The international community is pushing for a deal, fearing that Libya\u2019s chaos could destabilize its neighbors.\n\nLibya effectively split in half last year when forces allied to Hifter attempted to drive rival militias out of Tripoli and were defeated, leaving Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government and elected parliament confined to the eastern cities of Tobruk and Bayda.\n\nThe two sides have been negotiating in Morocco to end months of fighting, the bloodiest since the 2011 overthrow of dictator Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nU.N. envoy Bernadino Leon has visited both Tripoli and Tobruk, where he has proposed keeping Libya\u2019s elected parliament and setting up a unity government of independents. A new round of talks is to begin Wednesday.\n\nHifter, who commands forces loyal to the Tobruk government, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he doesn\u2019t oppose negotiations outright. He said he would abide by decisions of his government, but said it was not clear how the political rivals could reach a deal. He would not agree to any cease-fire with militias, he said.\n\nHifter said that if peace talks go nowhere, \u201cthen the military solution is a must because it is decisive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe military solution is a painful solution,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when we are forced to, when we see our homeland torn apart as it is happening now, between militias and terrorists, we resort to a military solution. We are betting on the military solution.\u201d\n\nThe general said he believes his forces could win such a battle even though they currently control only a small area of Libya and no major cities.\n\nMilitants affiliated with the Islamic State group and other jihadists have gained a foothold in the vast, petroleum-rich country. The gunmen who attacked a Tunisian museum last month, killing 22 people, mostly tourists, were reportedly trained in Libya and the Islamic State group\u2019s Libyan affiliate claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nHifter spoke during a visit to Jordan, a member of a U.S.-led military coalition that has carried out airstrikes against Islamic State targets in neighboring Syria and Iraq.\n\nOn Monday, Hifter met with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II and with army chief, Lt. Gen. Mashal Zaben. Abdullah told Hifter that Jordan supports Libya\u2019s efforts to fight militants, according to the official news agency Petra. Zaben and Hifter talked about closer coordination between the two armies.\n\nAssociated Press writers Omar Akour in Amman, Jordan, Paul Schemm in Rabat, Morocco and Mohammed Daraghmeh in Ramallah, West Bank contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The military chief of Libya's internationally recognized government expressed skepticism Tuesday about U.N.-backed talks aimed at ending the country's political split and said in an interview that he is \"betting on a military solution\" if a deal remains elusive.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The military chief of Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government expressed skepticism Tuesday about U.N.-backed talks aimed at ending the country\u2019s political split and said in an interview that he is \u201cbetting on a military solution\u201d if a deal remains elusive.", "title": "AP Interview: Libya army chief bets on military solution", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/14/ap-interview-libya-army-chief-bets-on-military-sol/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/14/cf1e5fa5c062a910730f6a70670086df.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/14/cf1e5fa5c062a910730f6a70670086df.jpg", "description": "The military chief of Libya's internationally recognized government expressed skepticism Tuesday about U.N.-backed talks aimed at ending the country's political split and said in an interview that he", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "AP Interview: Libya army chief bets on military solution"}, "Author": "KARIN LAUB", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict, Khalifa Hifter, Libya, Jordan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7aa\"", "article_summary": "Hifter said that if peace talks go nowhere, \u201cthen the military solution is a must because it is decisive.\u201d\u201cThe military solution is a painful solution,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut when we are forced to, when we see our homeland torn apart as it is happening now, between militias and terrorists, we resort to a military solution.\nAMMAN, Jordan (AP) - The military chief of Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government expressed skepticism Tuesday about U.N.-backed talks aimed at ending the country\u2019s political split and said in an interview that he is \u201cbetting on a military solution\u201d if a deal remains elusive.\nAbdullah told Hifter that Jordan supports Libya\u2019s efforts to fight militants, according to the official news agency Petra.\nOn Monday, Hifter met with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II and with army chief, Lt.
