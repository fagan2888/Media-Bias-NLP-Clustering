Though you suspect stress caused yesterday\u2019s cold and last winter\u2019s flu, a study from researchers at Stockholm University\u2019s Stress Research Institute may shed a bright enough light to help you identify the exact source of tension. Surprisingly, the root cause is not your temperamental boss or the overload of daily responsibilities. Oh, no... It\u2019s more simple and much more insidious than you imagined: It\u2019s the open-plan office layout causing you grief.\n\nIn fact, the team of researchers who came to this surprising conclusion found employees working in open-plan offices, women in particular, are at a \u201chigher risk\u201d for sick leave. Men seemed to respond most poorly to open-plan flex-offices, those where no individual workstations are assigned.\n\nTo better understand the relationship between office architecture and illness, the researchers analyzed data from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (that\u2019s SLOSH, to you). First, the researchers identified 1,852 possible participants. Next, they analyzed short and long-term illnesses and total sick days taken by each employee. And finally, they assessed the seven types of office layout: the cell-office (an unshared room); shared-room office (two to three people per room); small open-plan office (four to 9 people sharing an open plan room); medium-sized open-plan office (10 to 24 people); large open-plan office (more than 24 people); flex-office (open layout, no individual workstations); and combi-office (more than one-fifth of the work is team-based).\n\nWhat did they discover? People working in open-office plans were most at risk of becoming sick. The authors believe the cause of greater stress in open-plan offices is \u201cthe lower potential to exert personal control,\u201d combined with \u201ca lack of visual and acoustic privacy\u201d along with an added dollop of \u201clack of autonomy, freedom, and so on.\u201d In short, employees feel constantly exposed, consistently out of control, and this leads to that feeling at once familiar to most of us yet somewhat difficult to define.\n\nWhat is stress?\n\nThe simplest way to describe stress is as a physical response to a demand or threat. To prepare you for either \"fight or flight,\" your body releases a flood of nerve chemicals and hormones and your pulse quickens, you breathe faster, your muscles tense, and your brain uses more oxygen as it increases activity. Your body, then, aims full force at survival and in the short term, stress may boost your immune system.\n\nPsychologists tend to categorize stress as falling in one of three categories:\n\nRoutine stress, arising from work, family and other daily responsibilities\n\nSudden change stress, resulting from a lost job, divorce, or illness\n\nTraumatic stress, stemming from assault, a major accident, war, or a natural disaster\n\nGenerally, those who experience traumatic stress will find it most difficult to adjust, but for most people, the problem is chronic stress, the kind doled out on a daily basis at a low but persistent level. People who experience chronic stress are prone to more frequent and severe viral infections, such as the flu or common cold. Nervous system responses to stress may save your life in short bursts, but replayed again and again on a daily basis and they begin to suppress those autonomic and physiological functions unnecessary for immediate survival. For example, repeated stress can lower immunity, impede digestion, and harm both the excretory and reproductive systems. Anytime the source of stress is constant \u2014 or if your physical response continues long after the danger has passed \u2014 is considered unhealthy stress, which may lead to symptoms including headaches, sleeplessness, depression, anger, and irritability.\n\nThe Key\n\nToo much stress for one person may be another person\u2019s happy place. There\u2019s no one opinion on what constitutes too little or too much and no one way to handle it best. Everyone, though, understands \u2014 simply by feeling it \u2014 when they\u2019ve reached the level with enough stress to inspire but not too much to cause grief. Attitude may be central to how you respond.
