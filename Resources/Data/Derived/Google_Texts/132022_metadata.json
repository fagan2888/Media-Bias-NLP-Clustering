That casts a depressing light on the debate over why the labor force participation rate has rolled downhill in recent years. Folks saying the economy isn't as sucky as it looks claim that demographic changes\u2014especially an aging population\u2014drive the plunge. Others say the job market is sluggish at best and that people are just giving up. The poll lends support for that depressing second bunch\u2014and maybe for the idea that some job seekers need a nudge.\n\nThe April poll of 1,500 unemployed, conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Express Employment Professionals, finds some not-so-encouraging results:\n\n47 percent agree with the statement, \"I've completely given up on looking for a job.\" (7 percent said they \"agree completely,\" 7 percent \"agree a lot,\" 15 percent \"agree somewhat,\" and 18 percent \u201cagree a little.\u201d)\n\n46 percent report not having gone on any job interviews in the prior month. Among those unemployed for more than two years, 71 percent report not having gone on any interviews in the prior month.\n\n23 percent say their last interview was in 2012 or before.\n\n60 percent say looking for work has been harder than expected. 10 percent say it\u2019s been easier than expected.\n\nIn recent years, the Labor Force Participation Rate nosedived from above 66 percent of the potential workforce to below 63 percent, which is the lowest level since 1978. This has engendered much rending of garments and gnashing of teeth\u2014and the public debate mentioned above about \"why.\"\n\nAn aging work force gets some of the \"credit\" for the drop. Americans age and retire and there are relatively fewer young workers to take their place. A report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, published earlier this year, attributed about two-thirds of the decline since 2000 to a combination of retirement and disability, with a surge in retiring Baby Boomers over the past couple of years. (Disturbingly, \"the number of disabled persons has been steadily rising.\")*\n\nBut the report found that discouraged workers, with a big increase in that category during the recession, explained 30 percent of declining labor force participation. In addition, \"nonparticipation due to schooling has been steadily increasing,\" which could well reflect another form of dropping out, as potential workers continue along or return to the education track after taking a look at the job market.\n\nThe poll does raise some concerns over whether all turned-off job seekers are willing to go the extra mile to find a paying gig. Forty-four percent are not willing to change towns in search of work, and 60 percent won't cross a state line.\n\nThat might have something to do with the 72 percent who call unemployment compensation a \"cushion\" and the 48 percent who say they \"haven't had to look for work as hard\" because of it.\n\nOr maybe they just think things are lousy all over.\n\n*H/T: Sarcasmic", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A new poll of unemployed Americans finds that almost half of them have given up looking for a job.
