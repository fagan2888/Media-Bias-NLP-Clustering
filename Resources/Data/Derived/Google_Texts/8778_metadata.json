But we can say something about where it began: the 1850s. That\u2019s when the Republican Party emerged from the collapse of the Whigs. But it was not alone. Another party emerged alongside it in the 1850s \u2014 the conspiracy-minded anti-immigrant/anti-Catholic American Party, also known as the \u201cKnow-Nothings,\u201d which initially overshadowed the Republicans \u2014 winning 52 House seats in 1854 to 13 for the Republicans \u2014 but quickly faded from sight. Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cGangs of New York\u201d is a fictionalized account of the actual ground-level conflicts out of which the Know-Nothings arose. Daniel Day Lewis\u2019s character, Bill the Butcher, was based on an actual Know-Nothing leader, William Poole \u2014 a Joe the Plumber type with homicidal tendencies. Now, Cantor\u2019s out-of-the-blue defeat is the clearest signal yet that the Know-Nothings and their bleak vision are back, full force. Ultimately, they didn\u2019t have to knock off the Republicans; they\u2019ve simply taken them over from within.\n\nThe Know-Nothings began as a grassroots, anti-immigrant/anti-Catholic movement based in local lodges. When asked about their activities, members were sworn to say \u201cI know nothing\u201d \u2014 hence the name. But the willingness to embrace ignorance also reflected something broader about them: a focus on their own self-defined cultural values, and a disdain for learning anything outside the sphere of what they already \u201cknew.\u201d This is what the term \u201cknow-nothing\u201d has come to signify ever since, and though it gets the exact letter of its origins wrong, it captures their spirit precisely.\n\nThe most obvious tip-off that the Know-Nothings are back is the salience of immigration in Cantor\u2019s upset. Although immigration wasn\u2019t everything, as early stories took it to be, it did play a crucial role in mobilizing activist support, shaping the campaign narrative, and highlighting how Cantor\u2019s careerist ambitions clashed with the sentiments of his political base. Still, the most important way immigration figures into this story is in terms of the party\u2019s future, not Cantor\u2019s past: it further derails the GOP\u2019s efforts to escape from the consequences of feeding their own paranoid, xenophobic base, lo these many decades. That base is what\u2019s transformed the Republicans into Know-Nothings right before our very eyes \u2014 but it was politicians like Cantor (like Bush, Gingrich, Reagan and Nixon before him) who manipulated the base to that point in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that PPP\u2019s poll on immigration attitudes in Cantor\u2019s district does not refute the role that immigration played in this race. PPP asked about specifically described legislation, and found broad support by a substantial margin \u2014 but that\u2019s not at all the way in which immigration is discussed among Republicans generally, and in the Cantor/Brat primary in particular, where the rhetorical flavor is much more reminiscent of the Know-Nothing movement, as Wikipedia describes:\n\nIt promised to purify American politics by limiting or ending the influence of Irish Catholics and other immigrants, thus reflecting nativism and anti-Catholic sentiment. It was empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by German and Irish Catholic immigrants, whom they saw as hostile to republican values and controlled by the Pope in Rome.\n\nThe objects of demonization have changed, but today\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric, and its embedding in the broader rhetoric of \u201ctaking our country back,\u201d along with various means of voter suppression to limit the influence of cultural others is virtually identical to what the Know-Nothings were up to, but bears no resemblance at all to the Republicans of that same time.\n\nThe contrast between the Republicans and the Know-Nothings can be captured in terms of two recurring American traditions \u2014 progressivism and populism \u2014 but not in an overly simplistic way. Both traditions have their own strengths and weaknesses. It just so happens that the Republicans of that period represented progressivism at its best, while the Know-Nothings represented populism\u2019s ugliest attributes.\n\nOn Wednesday, Digby wrote a piece at her blog, \u201cThe American right wing populist strain was perfectly realized in David Brat\u2019s campaign,\u201d in which she referenced a fascinating 1995 paper by Yale law professor Jack Balkin, \u201cPopulism and Progressivism as Constitutional Categories,\u201d an excellent source for mapping out the complexities involved in these traditions. As he explains:\n\nBy \u201cpopulism\u201d and \u201cprogressivism,\u201d I mean to invoke the spirit of two successive reform movements in American history, the first primarily agrarian and the second urban\u2026. Although populism and progressivism share a desire for reform, they diverge most significantly in their attitudes towards the beliefs, attitudes, and actions of the mass of ordinary citizens. They take different views about ordinary citizens\u2019 private activities, their cultural attachments, and the possibility of their participation in mass politics.", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Brat's victory over Eric Cantor represents the triumphant return of an awful GOP strain best left to history", "author": "Paul Rosenberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "David Brat's victory over Eric Cantor represents the triumphant return of an awful GOP strain best left to history", "title": "Ugly, paranoid, divisive politics: The GOP are all Know-Nothings now", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/14/ugly_paranoid_divisive_politics_the_gop_are_all_know_nothings_now/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/eric_cantor_gangs_of_ny.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "David Brat's victory over Eric Cantor represents the triumphant return of an awful GOP strain best left to history", "creator": "@PaulHRosenberg", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/eric_cantor_gangs_of_ny.jpg", "title": "Ugly, paranoid, divisive politics: The GOP are all Know-Nothings now", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Ugly, paranoid, divisive politics: The GOP are all Know-Nothings now", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, David Brat, Editor's Picks, Eric Cantor, Know Nothings, Republicans", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ac7\"", "article_summary": "Now, Cantor\u2019s out-of-the-blue defeat is the clearest signal yet that the Know-Nothings and their bleak vision are back, full force.\nThe contrast between the Republicans and the Know-Nothings can be captured in terms of two recurring American traditions \u2014 progressivism and populism \u2014 but not in an overly simplistic way.\nThe most obvious tip-off that the Know-Nothings are back is the salience of immigration in Cantor\u2019s upset.\nMartin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cGangs of New York\u201d is a fictionalized account of the actual ground-level conflicts out of which the Know-Nothings arose.\nIt just so happens that the Republicans of that period represented progressivism at its best, while the Know-Nothings represented populism\u2019s ugliest attributes."}
