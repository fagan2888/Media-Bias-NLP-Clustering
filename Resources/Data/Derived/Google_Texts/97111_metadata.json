ICU complications are especially common in patients with sepsis, the leading cause of death in American hospitals, the article said, killing more than 258,000 people a year worldwide, leaving 1.4 million survivors at risk for a disability and costing more than $20 billion between 2000 and 2009.\n\nA Vanderbilt University study looked at survivors of critical illness with cognitive and physical disabilities as a result of their condition, and compared those that participated in physical therapy and rehab against those that didn't receive the interventions. The group that received the therapy and rehab scored better when tested to perform tasks with multiple steps. A separate study at Indiana University saw reduced numbers of emergency room visits and hospital readmissions in patients that underwent therapy after leaving the ICU, the Journal reported.\n\nHospital-acquired pneumonia was associated with 16.9 percent of ICU stays, bloodstream infection with 14.5 percent, ventilator-acquired pneumonia with 3.7 percent and surgical-site infection with 1.5 percent, FierceHealthcare previously reported, adding an extra $16,000 in expenses to each ICU stay.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Wall Street Journal article\n\nRelated articles:\n\n28% of ICU patients have missed diagnosis\n\nHospital-acquired infections quadruple ICU deaths\n\nMortality risk increases with slow ICU transfers\n\nStudy: Busier ICUs discharge patients more efficiently", "article_metadata": {"description": "Post-intensive care syndrome among ICU patients is becoming more common, doctors say, with as many as 80 percent of ICU survivors suffering some sort of cognitive or brain dysfunction, negatively impacted by the very medication or technology that save their lives,\u00a0according\u00a0to the\u00a0Wall Street Journal.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Post-intensive care syndrome among ICU patients is becoming more common, doctors say, with as many as 80 percent of ICU survivors suffering some sort of cognitive or brain dysfunction, negatively impacted by the very medication or technology that save their lives,\u00a0according\u00a0to the\u00a0Wall Street Journal.", "title": "Hospitals battle ICU complications, sepsis with rehab, physical therapy", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospitals-battle-icu-complications-sepsis-rehab-physical-therapy/2013-11-26", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,ICU complications,Patient Care & Outcomes,post-intensive care syndrome,Sepsis,Wall Street Journal", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd125f\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the Wall Street Journal articleRelated articles:28% of ICU patients have missed diagnosisHospital-acquired infections quadruple ICU deathsMortality risk increases with slow ICU transfersStudy: Busier ICUs discharge patients more efficiently\nThe group that received the therapy and rehab scored better when tested to perform tasks with multiple steps.\nA separate study at Indiana University saw reduced numbers of emergency room visits and hospital readmissions in patients that underwent therapy after leaving the ICU, the Journal reported.\nPhysical therapy is just as crucial to ICU patients as it is to heart attack and stroke survivors, Theodore Iwashyna, a critical-care physician and researcher at the University of Michigan Health System, told the Journal.\nA Vanderbilt University study looked at survivors of critical illness with cognitive and physical disabilities as a result of their condition, and compared those that participated in physical therapy and rehab against those that didn't receive the interventions."}
