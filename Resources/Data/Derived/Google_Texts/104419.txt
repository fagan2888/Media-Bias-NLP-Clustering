A Sacramento City firefighter was arrested Saturday on charges of burglary and elder abuse.

Citrus Heights police responded to 6525 Sunrise Blvd., in the Sunrise Vista mobile home park in response to a person who said he was a firefighter and needed to perform smoke and carbon monoxide detector inspections inside their home.

Authorities later determined the person had allegedly stolen items from at least two homes.

On Saturday, additional victims came forward with information that led investigators to identify and arrest 30-year-old Craig White in connection with the burglaries.

White is a firefighter and paramedic with the Sacramento City Fire Department.

He was booked into the Sacramento County Jail and charged with five counts of burglary and three counts of elder abuse.

Citrus Heights police detectives continue to investigate the burglaries.

“We want to remind the public to be mindful of public safety impersonators,” fire officials said in a press release. “If there is any question as to the true identity of any public safety officer, citizens are encouraged to call the police. Remember, public safety officials will arrive in official government vehicles and be clearly marked in uniforms and identification.”

The Sacramento City Fire Department said White is currently on paid administrative leave.
