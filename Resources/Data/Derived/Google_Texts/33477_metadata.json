Businesses and jobs are going to be coming,\u201d said Councilman David Toro, who has been involved in the Sands Fly saga for years.\n\n\u201cIf people who live in this area can hang in there for the next two years, they are going to see an improvement in the quality of life, and home values are going to increase considerably,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cColton is going to become an economic center (for the Inland Empire),\u201d he said.\n\nA critical part of that new economic engine will be the California University of Science and Medicine, which is expected to open its doors in fall 2016.\n\nFounders of the Cal Med medical school expect to start pharmacy, nursing, physician assistant and physical therapy training later, on land southeast of Arrowhead Regional Medical Center.\n\nJohn Husing, a Redlands-based economist who studies the Inland Empire, said \u201cmy instinct tells me\u201d that because the region is under-served medically, and because the Affordable Care Act creates many more paying patients, and because the \u201cBaby Boomers\u201d are aging, the area around the medical school and Arrowhead Regional will largely be developed for medically related projects.\n\nToro noted that the LA Fitness Center group is planning to open a gym near the hospital and a nearby gas station/convenience mart plans significant expansion.\n\n\u201cHallelujah. About time,\u201d said Lori Pierson Cripe, whose family owns land across from Arrowhead Regional and for more than two decades has been unable to develop it.\n\nEarlier this month, the Fish and Wildlife Service posted notice of the Habitat Conservation Plan in the Federal Register, one of the few bureaucratic procedures remaining before the city can begin issuing building permits for the large \u201ccan\u2019t touch\u201d slice of Colton.\n\nA key part of the environmental plan includes a set-aside of about 50 acres of what one environmental group calls \u201chigh-quality, Delhi Sands Fly habitat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe endangered fly, a carnivore as a grub most of its life below ground, emerges for August and September as an airborne vegetarian to breed, feed on nectar and lay eggs.\n\nDr. Dan Silver, executive director of the Los Angeles-based Endangered Habitats League, said the plan for this endangered species\u2019 survival \u201cis a good one.\n\n\u201cWe reviewed it and it is biologically sound,\u201d he said.\n\nSilver said that while the effort to preserve this species has been ridiculed by politicians and residents for years, that 50-acre preservation site will \u201cbe an amenity to the city.\n\n\u201cIt will preserve a sense of history and natural place,\u201d he said.\n\nIt will be a site \u2014 in the middle of the city \u2014 where schoolchildren can be educated about what the area was like before human settlement.\n\n\u201cIt will give the city a competitive edge,\u201d Silver said.\n\nIn 2011, then-Rep. Joe Baca, D-San Bernardino, authored a bill that would have taken the fly off the endangered species list, clearing the way for development.\n\nAt one point, Baca said that fly species was extinct or at least hadn\u2019t been seen for 10 years.\n\nBut federal wildlife and Colton officials then showed there had been recent sightings.\n\nBaca withdrew that statement and the bill went nowhere.\n\nAfter some more bureaucratic formalities, city officials say they will be able to issue building permits \u201cin a few months.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "COLTON >> There is a buzz about what\u2019s going to happen here.After 21 years, this city of 53,000 is about to shed a major impediment to its economic growth.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the city have come to terms wi", "title": "Colton nears solution to endangered species impediment", "og": {"url": "http://www.sbsun.com/environment-and-nature/20140718/colton-nears-solution-to-endangered-species-impediment", "image": {"width": "988px", "identifier": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20140718/NEWS/140719398/AR/0/AR-140719398.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "656px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Colton nears solution to endangered species impediment"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sbsun.com", "description": "COLTON >> There is a buzz about what\u2019s going to happen here.After 21 years, this city of 53,000 is about to shed a major impediment to its economic growth.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the city have come to terms wi", "title": "Colton nears solution to endangered species impediment", "url": "http://www.sbsun.com/environment-and-nature/20140718/colton-nears-solution-to-endangered-species-impediment", "image": {"src": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20140718/NEWS/140719398/AR/0/AR-140719398.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@sbsun", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563372734", "iphone": "id503662617", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sanbernardinosun"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Colton,Delhi Sands Flower-loving fly, Endangered and extinct species", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Colton,Delhi Sands Flower-loving fly, Endangered and extinct species"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd802c\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Dan Silver, executive director of the Los Angeles-based Endangered Habitats League, said the plan for this endangered species\u2019 survival \u201cis a good one.\nAt one point, Baca said that fly species was extinct or at least hadn\u2019t been seen for 10 years.\nIn 2011, then-Rep.
