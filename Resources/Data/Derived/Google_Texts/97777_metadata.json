Whether one believes in small government or limited government (there is a difference), one could agree that the stimulus bill and Obamacare were ineffective and counterproductive pieces of legislation that unwisely grew the federal government. Likewise, on opposition to tax increases, cap-and-trade and excessive Environmental Protection Agency regulations, there was no daylight between libertarians and conservatives.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) speaks at an event on Aug. 6 in Urbandale, Iowa. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nIn the second Obama term, however, and with candidates running on an affirmative message in 2014 and readying themselves for 2016, the tension between the groups is straining to the breaking point. In part this is because of the re-emergence of social issues and even more so because of foreign policy.\n\nLongtime conservative and evangelical leader Gary Bauer questions the political viability of libertarianism, noting that a recent Pew study showed that most self-described libertarians are not very libertarian. \u201cAn even bigger problem is that once people find out what libertarianism means, most reject it. Pew found that just 11 percent of Americans both know what libertarianism means \u2014 defined by Pew as \u2018someone whose political views emphasize individual freedom by limiting the role of government\u2019 \u2014 and embrace the label.\u201d He wonders, \u201cWould libertarians abolish Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare, an idea that many libertarians endorse but which is unlikely to win over middle America?\u201d\n\nIt is on social issues and foreign policy, however, that push really comes to shove. Classic conservatives recoil at what Bauer describes as the libertarians\u2019 \u201d \u2018anything goes\u2019 view of life \u2014 the legalization of prostitution and all drugs, for example \u2014 and reject the idea that virtue should be encouraged and rewarded.\u201d And on foreign policy Bauer is unsparing:\n\nOne of the main tenets of libertarianism is a less active foreign policy. But at the moment most Americans want exactly the opposite. A late August Pew Research poll concluded \u201cAs new dangers loom, more think the U.S. does \u2018too little\u2019 to solve world problems.\u201d . . . Perhaps this widespread support for a strong American presence in the world is why Rand Paul surprised many people recently by invoking Reagan and claiming that if he were president he would \u201cseek congressional authorization to destroy ISIS militarily.\n\nSome libertarians, including Richard Epstein, argue that an isolationist foreign policy reflects a misunderstanding of true libertarian principles, but in practice the overwhelming number of libertarians vehemently oppose U.S. interventionism and want to eliminate foreign aid and slash defense spending. This, after all, was part and parcel of Paul\u2019s pitch to non-Republican voters \u2014 with him they can have a foreign policy more like liberal Democrats\u2019 than conservative Republicans\u2019.\n\nThe difference between conservatives and libertarians also arises in the context of fighting Islamist terror. Libertarians have gotten the notion that the Bill of Rights supplants the laws of war and protects, for example, American jihadists from being droned and data gathering to detect terror plots. In that they often seem to be mimicking the Obama administration\u2019s fetish with applying criminal justice concepts to anti-terrorism policy. Most Republicans resist that leap of logic and constitutional misinterpretation.\n\nBauer is also right that there is a tonal difference between the two groups. (\u201cRepublicans won\u2019t be able to close the \u2018empathy gap\u2019 by embracing a political philosophy based on extreme self-interest and a cranky \u2018leave-us-alone\u2019 mentality.\u201d) Libertarians\u2019 single-minded focus on liberty and rooting out government\u2019s presence wherever possible puts them at odds with many conservative reformers, who, for example, think fighting poverty, increasing opportunity and public investment in human capital (e.g. education, scientific research) are legitimate aims of government. The difference becomes clear in the tax reform debate where libertarians want to root out all social policy from the tax code while conservatives are interested in, for example, expanding the child tax credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, in order to promote broad social goals. Libertarians don\u2019t much care if a flat tax is regressive; conservatives for the most part do.\n\nWe saw the difference when Paul took on civil rights laws (before he changed 180 degrees) on TV with Rachel Maddow, arguing that the portion of those laws regulating private property were problematic. Invoking property rights to defend the \u201cright\u201d to discriminate is an argument that the overwhelming number of conservatives would reject.\n\nIn sum, fighting against big-government liberals draws libertarians and conservatives together. But when it comes to articulating their own vision, we see how different the philosophies are. And judging from Paul\u2019s contortions on everything from civil rights laws to destroying the Islamic State, we see it is hard to be both libertarian and conservative on some critical issues. Trying to be both conveys a lack of principle and candor.\n\nOne might conclude then, as Bauer does, that \u201clibertarian conservatives certainly have a role to play in the future of the Republican Party,\u201d but still agree that the GOP cannot be subsumed to a libertarian philosophy without losing its appeal \u2013 and many of its current voters. Republican voters will decide which way to go in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The conflicts between libertarians and conservatives grow sharper.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The conflicts between libertarians and conservatives grow sharper.", "title": "Why conservatives and libertarians are at odds", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/09/11/why-conservatives-and-libertarians-are-at-odds/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/govbeat/Images/453248670.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/09/11/why-conservatives-and-libertarians-are-at-odds/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "libertarians, conservatives, conservatives vs. libertarians, rand paul civil rights, rand paul, social conservatives and rand paul, gary bauer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "libertarians, conservatives, conservatives vs. libertarians, rand paul civil rights, rand paul, social conservatives and rand paul, gary bauer"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdece4\"", "article_summary": "Likewise, on opposition to tax increases, cap-and-trade and excessive Environmental Protection Agency regulations, there was no daylight between libertarians and conservatives.\nIt was easy in President Obama\u2019s first term for libertarians and conservatives to stick together.\nThe difference between conservatives and libertarians also arises in the context of fighting Islamist terror.\nLibertarians don\u2019t much care if a flat tax is regressive; conservatives for the most part do.\nIn sum, fighting against big-government liberals draws libertarians and conservatives together."}
