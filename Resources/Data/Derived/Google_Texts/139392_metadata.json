Rand Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said they strongly supported protecting religious liberty during the 9 p.m. debate for the top tier of GOP contenders, as did Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal during the 5 p.m. debate.\n\nPaul gave a largely libertarian-leaning answer when he was asked by a woman on Facebook what he would do to ensure that Christians were not prosecuted for speaking out against gay marriage, and asked if Christians will be forced to do business that conflicts with their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want my marriage, or my guns, registered in Washington,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd if people have an opinion, as a religious opinion that is heartily felt, obviously they should go out and practice that, and no government should interfere with them.\u201d\n\nBut Paul also pivoted to attack Houston Mayor Annise Parker for subpoenaing the sermons of ministers who spoke about homosexuality, gender identity or Parker specifically as part of an ongoing squabble over the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO). The HERO, which will go before voters this November, prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing, public accommodations, and a number of other areas.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that really got to me was the thing in Houston, where you had the government, the mayor, actually trying to get the sermons of ministers,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWhen the government tries to invade the church and force its own opinion on marriage, that\u2019s when it\u2019s time to resist.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ted Cruz rattled off his defense of religious liberty as part of his conservative bona fides when it comes to social issues. He did this several times throughout the debate. Quoting Scripture, Cruz said, \u201cYou shall know them by their fruits,\u201d accusing \u2014 though not by name \u2014 some fellow Republicans of not being sufficiently conservative enough.\n\n\u201cWe see lots of campaign conservatives,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBut if we\u2019re going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative, someone who\u2019s been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative. There are real differences among the candidates on issues like amnesty, like Obamacare, like religious liberty, like life and marriage, and I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty\u2026for my entire career, and I will be proud to continue to do so as President of the United States.\u201d\n\nEarlier, in the first debate, Jindal had said that he would issue an executive order, similar to one he signed in Louisiana, protecting the religious freedom of people who oppose homosexuality or same-sex marriage. Jindal has since been sued over that executive order and received a rebuke from the mayor of New Orleans, who signed his own executive order designed to counter Jindal\u2019s, and from IBM, which cancelled a ribbon cutting in Baton Rouge after having previously pleaded with Jindal not to support a bill that the company felt would allow anti-LGBT discrimination.\n\nJindal also pledged to make sure that the Internal Revenue Service was \u201cnot going after conservative or religious groups,\u201d a reference to an alleged \u201cscandal\u201d within the Obama administration having to do with targeting groups \u2014 primarily conservative in their political bent \u2014 based on words or themes that appeared in their names. IRS employees had selected the groups in question for further investigation to ensure that they were not illegally obtaining tax-exempt status while engaging in nakedly political or partisan lobbying.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable moment of the night with respect to LGBT rights came when Ohio Gov. John Kasich broke from party orthodoxy when answering a question from FOX News\u2019 Megan Kelly about same-sex marriage. Kelly asked Kasich what he would tell one of his children about his opposition to same-sex marriage if they happened to be gay.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m an old-fashioned person here, and I happen to believe in traditional marriage,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also said the court has ruled and I said, \u2018We\u2019ll accept it.\u2019 And guess what? I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine, who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn\u2019t think they way I do, doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t care about them or I can\u2019t love them.\n\n\u201cWe need to give everybody a chance, treat everybody with respect, and let them share in this great American dream that we have.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them, and I would accept them,\u201d Kasich said as the crowd in the arena broke into applause, with some audience members registering screams of approval. \u201cBecause you know what? That\u2019s what we\u2019re taught when we have strong faith. Issues like that are planted to divide us. I think the simple fact of the matter is \u2014 and this is where I would agree with Jeb [Bush], and I\u2019ve been saying it all along \u2014 we need to give everybody a chance, treat everybody with respect, and let them share in this great American dream that we have\u2026. God gives me unconditional love, I\u2019m going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.\u201d\n\nBy comparison, during the earlier debate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum urged conservatives not to give up on their opposition to same-sex marriage, saying they could pursue other avenues, such as passing laws to nullify the Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing marriage equality. Santorum even compared the idea that marriage equality could be considered \u201csettled law\u201d to the infamous Dred Scott decision that allowed a slaveholder to retain ownership over his slave, even in states and territories were slavery was abolished, because people of African descent were not considered citizens under the Constitution. Santorum, like Jindal, also said that one of the first actions he would take as president would be to issue an executive order protecting religious liberty.\n\nMeanwhile, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee went out on a limb when asked a question about how he would deal with allowing transgender military members to serve openly.\n\n\u201cThe military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is to kill people and break things,\u201d Huckabee said to cheers and applause. \u201cIt is not to transform the culture by trying out some ideas that some people think would make us a different country and more diverse. The purpose of the military is to protect America. I\u2019m not sure how paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, makes our country safer.\u201d\n\nPoll: Who won last night\u2019s GOP debate?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kasich draws huge applause for advocating respect for same-sex marriage during debate", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Metro Weekly", "description": "Kasich draws huge applause for advocating respect for same-sex marriage during debate", "title": "GOP hopefuls tackle marriage, trans military service and religious liberty during debate - Metro Weekly", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/903008_630x354-e1438949764971.jpg", "height": 348}, "updated_time": "2015-08-19T17:39:50-04:00", "url": "http://www.metroweekly.com/2015/08/gop-hopefuls-tackle-marriage-trans-military-service-and-religious-liberty-during-debate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kasich draws huge applause for advocating respect for same-sex marriage during debate", "creator": "@JohnAndresRiley", "image": "http://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/903008_630x354-e1438949764971.jpg", "title": "GOP hopefuls tackle marriage, trans military service and religious liberty during debate - Metro Weekly", "site": "@metroweekly", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 118031275134}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-squareLogo_black-270x270.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MetroWeekly", "section": "Nation", "tag": "ticker", "published_time": "2015-08-07T08:12:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-19T17:39:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut if we\u2019re going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative, someone who\u2019s been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative.\nJohn Kasich broke from party orthodoxy when answering a question from FOX News\u2019 Megan Kelly about same-sex marriage.\nKelly asked Kasich what he would tell one of his children about his opposition to same-sex marriage if they happened to be gay.\nI\u2019m not sure how paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, makes our country safer.\u201dPoll: Who won last night\u2019s GOP debate?\nSantorum, like Jindal, also said that one of the first actions he would take as president would be to issue an executive order protecting religious liberty."}
