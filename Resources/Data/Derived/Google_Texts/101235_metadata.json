It was expected to cost state Medicaid programs $14 billion over 10 years.\n\n\u201cIncluding a one-year delay of the annual excise tax on health insurers for calendar year 2017 in this bipartisan legislation shows the widespread opposition to this nonsensical policy,\" Jeff Myers, president and CEO of Medicaid Health Plans of America, wrote in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe health insurance tax, or HIT, is among two other ObamaCare taxes that would also be frozen under the budget package. Negotiators also agreed to pause the \u201cCadillac tax\" on high-benefit health plans, a priority for Democratic leaders, and the medical device tax, which has been largely pushed by Republicans.\n\nThe premium tax, which was projected to bring in more than $100 billion over 10 years, was expected to be delayed at least a year, The Hill reported earlier this week.\n\nRepublicans have long been in favor of repealing the premium tax, and a growing number of Democrats have also signed on. A bill in the House to abolish the tax has the backing of 228 Republicans and seven Democrats.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The omnibus would suspend the tax for one year.", "description": "The omnibus would suspend the tax for one year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The omnibus would suspend the tax for one year.", "title": "Budget deal gives health insurers respite from 'premium tax'", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/263420-budget-deal-would-give-health-insurers-one-year-break-from-tax", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/263420-budget-deal-would-give-health-insurers-one-year-break-from-tax", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-16T09:27-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-16T09:27:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/263420-budget-deal-would-give-health-insurers-one-year-break-from-tax", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The omnibus would suspend the tax for one year.", "card": "summary", "title": "Budget deal gives health insurers respite from 'premium tax'"}, "dcterms.title": "Budget deal gives health insurers respite from 'premium tax'"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18dc\"", "article_summary": "Republicans have long been in favor of repealing the premium tax, and a growing number of Democrats have also signed on.\nHealth insurers nabbed a victory in the $1 trillion spending bill unveiled late Tuesday night, earning a one-year freeze on the so-called premium tax.\nThe tax has also been opposed by groups representing Medicaid health plans, who have argued that the government is essentially \"taxing itself\" with the provision.\nThe health insurance tax, or HIT, is among two other ObamaCare taxes that would also be frozen under the budget package.\nNegotiators also agreed to pause the \u201cCadillac tax\" on high-benefit health plans, a priority for Democratic leaders, and the medical device tax, which has been largely pushed by Republicans."}
