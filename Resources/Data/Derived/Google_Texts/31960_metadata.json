The glitches, technologically, are incidental to the value of what the Affordable Care Act is.\u201d\n\nWith many provisions of Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1, the rollout has been plagued with problems. The federal website that oversees new health care exchanges for several states has been unable to handle the large volume of traffic. Obama administration officials have apologized, taken responsibility for the website problems and pledged to fix them. There has also been anger over reports that a number of people who buy health insurance individually will have their plans cancelled, even though Obama previously pledged that people who like their plans can keep them.\n\nObama visited Boston Wednesday to deliver a speech in which he pointed to Massachusetts\u2019 success with health care reform as an indication that the Affordable Care Act will work.\n\nPelosi, a California Democrat and the former U.S. House speaker, flew to Massachusetts with Obama. She attended an event at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard on Thursday and campaigned with Clark, a state senator and the Democratic nominee in the 5th District special congressional election, on Friday.\n\nWhile most of the event focused on women and family-related issues, Pelosi and Clark, after the event, both defended the president\u2019s health care law.\n\nPelosi said she did not think the problems with the Affordable Care Act rollout will hurt Clark or future Democratic candidates. \u201cThese are glitches. We\u2019ll get through them,\u201d Pelosi said. Though Pelosi called the glitches \u201cunacceptable,\u201d she said, \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is a great thing for our country, and I think it\u2019s going to work just fine.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the implementation of Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit for seniors, under Republican President George W. Bush. There were serious technological problems with that program at the beginning. The Washington Post reported at the time that the administration got tens of thousands of complaints from seniors and pharmacists who could not get the correct medication at the correct price.\n\n\u201cThere were glitches for months, and Republicans at the time said this happens when you roll out a big program,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThey\u2019re a little less patient this time.\u201d\n\nPelosi also addressed the cancellation of plans, saying, as Obama has, that the plans will be dropped so they can be replaced with better ones, which conform to the standards of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 for example, with no lifetime or annual limits. \u201cThere has to be some clarity about what the dropping is,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIt is to improve.\u201d\n\nPelosi added that the implementation of the health care law \u201chas been incredible for one year,\u201d with people already enjoying benefits. (Several benefits already went into effect such as allowing children to stay on their parents\u2019 health plan until age 26, requiring health plans to cover certain preventive care without co-pays and starting to close the gap in prescription drug benefits for seniors on Medicare.)\n\nClark, in an interview with The Republican/MassLive.com, said similarly that the technological problems should not distract from the benefits of the law. \u201cThere have been some technological problems with the website. I know they are trying to address them,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t take away from the overarching principal that this is a chance to expand health care, which is so critical to families.\u201d\n\nClark said she thinks any temporary discouragement will be overshadowed in the long term as Americans receive better access to health care. \u201cThese changes and improvements are going to make such a substantial difference that I think the technological glitches as this rolls out will be\u2026 in the rearview mirror,\u201d Clark said.\n\nThe problems have provided further ammunition to Republicans, who have been strongly opposed to the Affordable Care Act all along. Rob Cunningham, executive director of the Massachusetts Republican Party, called the Affordable Care Act \u201can absolute broken mess right now.\u201d \u201cPeople are being kicked off their insurance. They can\u2019t sign up,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cFor Nancy Pelosi and Katherine Clark to stand together and refer to people losing their insurance as glitches, they should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@boston','@homepage','@mobile','affordable-care-act','health-care-law','health-insurance','katherine-clark','ma-5','nancy-pelosi'", "title": "Nancy Pelosi says Affordable Care Act website problems 'incidental' to health care law as a whole", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Nancy Pelosi says Affordable Care Act website problems \\u0027incidental\\u0027 to health care law as a whole\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/nancy_pelosi_affordable_care_act_website_incidental.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/13692643-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11553742\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-01T16:53:11Z\", \"author\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"tags\": [\"@boston\",\"@homepage\",\"@mobile\",\"affordable-care-act\",\"health-care-law\",\"health-insurance\",\"katherine-clark\",\"ma-5\",\"nancy-pelosi\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.masslive.com/politics_impact/photo/13692643-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@#!/shiraschoenberg", "site": "@masslivenews", "card": "summary", "description": "Pelosi, campaigning with Democratic congressional candidate Katherine Clark, said the problems with the Affordable Care Act are \"glitches\" but should not mar people's opinions of the overall law."}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, November 01, 2013, 12:53 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.masslive.com/politics_impact/photo/pelosi-clarkjpg-ef1d99aec301fc76.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"sschoenberg\", \"author_nickname\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"author_id\": \"10164552\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Politics - MassLive.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "Pelosi, campaigning with Democratic congressional candidate Katherine Clark, said the problems with the Affordable Care Act are \"glitches\" but should not mar people's opinions of the overall law.", "title": "Nancy Pelosi says Affordable Care Act website problems 'incidental' to health care law as a whole", "url": "http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/nancy_pelosi_affordable_care_act_website_incidental.html", "image": "http://www.masslive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "masslive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, November 01, 2013, 12:52 PM", "article_author": "Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com", "Description": "Pelosi, campaigning with Democratic congressional candidate Katherine Clark, said the problems with the Affordable Care Act are \"glitches\" but should not mar people's opinions of the overall law."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbac5\"", "article_summary": "CAMBRIDGE \u2013 U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on Friday called the problems with the Affordable Care Act website \u201cincidental\u201d to the law as a whole.\nObama visited Boston Wednesday to deliver a speech in which he pointed to Massachusetts\u2019 success with health care reform as an indication that the Affordable Care Act will work.\nThe problems have provided further ammunition to Republicans, who have been strongly opposed to the Affordable Care Act all along.\nPelosi said she did not think the problems with the Affordable Care Act rollout will hurt Clark or future Democratic candidates.\nRob Cunningham, executive director of the Massachusetts Republican Party, called the Affordable Care Act \u201can absolute broken mess right now.\u201d \u201cPeople are being kicked off their insurance."}
