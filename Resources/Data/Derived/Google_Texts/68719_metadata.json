The IG said the investigation centers around the misuse of charge cards by DOD employees at casinos and adult entertainment establishments.\n\nHowever, Pentagon officials seem to be pushing back on the IG report, telling Politico that the findings don\u2019t necessarily mean that the government footed the bill since employees must submit receipts for reimbursements.\n\nThe Pentagon did not address whether the employees sought reimbursement for the improper charges.\n\nRegardless, the report still highlights the government\u2019s ongoing problem trying to prevent waste and fraud within its government charge-card program. The cards are supposed to help streamline the federal procurement process, so employees are able to quickly purchase things. However, without proper supervision over how the cards are being used, millions of dollars are lost to improper or inappropriate purchases.\n\nRelated: More Federal Workers Abusing Government Credit Cards\n\nIt\u2019s not just DOD. The issue is prevalent across the federal government. The IG for the Veterans Affairs Department reported last year that VA employees spent $650,000 in improper credit card purchases.\n\nLikewise, the EPA\u2019s IG reported that some agency\u2019s employees had used their federal charge cards to buy gym memberships for themselves and their family members, as well as lavish dinners.\n\nThe Jobs Corps was also flagged by auditors for similar abuse. A handful of workers and students were caught using their cards to pay for personal cell phone bills, trips to the hair salon and shopping sprees.\n\nThe spate of stories prompted legislation intended to curb the improper use of government credit cards. The 2012 Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act, sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) required agencies to increase oversight of and issue IG reports to Congress on charge-card expenditures each year.\n\nGrassley commented on the forthcoming report, saying he is eager to see the findings and hopes that his measure has helped catch improper payments and prevent future problems.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested to see the report and find out more about what\u2019s being done, right and wrong, at DOD to prevent abuse,\u201d Grassley said in a statement.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Every year, the government loses millions of dollars to fraudulent charges on governme", "title": "Poker and Escorts on Government Credit Cards", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/07/Poker-and-Escorts-Government-Credit-Cards", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01092012_Poker_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/07/Poker-and-Escorts-Government-Credit-Cards", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01092012_Poker_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Every year, the government loses millions of dollars to fraudulent charges on governme", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The spate of stories prompted legislation intended to curb the improper use of government credit cards.\nThe IG said the investigation centers around the misuse of charge cards by DOD employees at casinos and adult entertainment establishments.\nThe IG for the Veterans Affairs Department reported last year that VA employees spent $650,000 in improper credit card purchases.\nRelated: More Federal Workers Abusing Government Credit CardsIt\u2019s not just DOD.\nLikewise, the EPA\u2019s IG reported that some agency\u2019s employees had used their federal charge cards to buy gym memberships for themselves and their family members, as well as lavish dinners."}
