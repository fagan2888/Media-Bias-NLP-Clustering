But consider the dust jacket of Paul Ryan\u2019s The Way Forward: Renewing the American Idea.\n\nA smiling Ryan is walking down a banner-festooned rope line, hands grasping those of supporters along the way, his hair a youthful black, his blue-shirt-and-chinos outfit crisply pressed.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAnd\u2013oddly\u2013almost no one is making eye contact with Ryan. Some seem to be looking past him.\n\nRyan might be a national leader without a national constituency. He was embraced by the Tea Party in 2010, when his bold stand against Obamacare electrified the conservative base, and his ambitious plan for entitlement reform provided the new movement with a solid policy foundation.\n\nToday, amidst his budget compromises and enthusiasm for immigration reform, the Tea Party\u2013or its loudest voices, anyway\u2013seem to be \u201cbreaking up\u201d with him, notes Politico.\n\nSome of the new conservative opposition to Ryan is rather contrived, stoked by the need to find targets among the Republican \u201cestablishment.\u201d Ryan is somewhat bemused\u2013and frustrated\u2013to find himself portrayed as a member of that elite, after spending years on the outside, railing against big-spending Republicans and offering ambitious fiscal reforms in a \u201cPlan for Prosperity\u201d that the GOP leadership was afraid to touch before 2011.\n\nRyan denies any split. \u201cI know the conservative movement comes into conflict with each other now and then, and that\u2019s healthy,\u201d he told Breitbart News on Sunday. \u201cBut ultimately, we need to focus on winning converts.\u201d\n\nThat is the basic purpose of The Way Forward, he says.\n\n\u201cMy goal is just to do my part in trying to build a unified conservative movement that can focus on winning converts and expanding our appeal, so that we can ultimately win national elections,\u201d he says. He wants to \u201cexpand the appeal of conservatism and constitutional principles\u2026in a way that\u2019s appealing, attractive, and aspirational, so that we can have a 1980-type of election again, which is what I think we\u2019re going to need if we\u2019re going to fix our problems and get our country back on track.\u201d\n\nStill, Ryan understands that he must hold onto traditional conservative support while courting non-traditional voters. And his sense of the party\u2019s grass roots has sometimes been wide of the mark.\n\nWhen I interviewed him about immigration reform in April 2013, for example, he called the Senate\u2019s \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill \u201ca good step in the right direction,\u201d though he did not endorse it. He had underestimated the strength of public opposition to the bill\u2013and to Obama\u2019s immigration policy more broadly.\n\nIn The Way Forward, Ryan emphasizes that border security is primary: \u201cFirst, we must secure the border and enforce the laws we have on the books,\u201d he says, before going on to propose reforms that address the \u201c12 million undocumented immigrants\u2026in a commonsense way.\u201d He also explains why he voted to defund Obama\u2019s \u201cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u201d because of concerns about the Constitution and the rule of law\u2013a position he defended again at a book signing recently when confronted by amnesty activists.\n\nOne suspects that such explanations may not quite be enough to heal the conservative breach.\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart News, Ryan says he wants \u201cto make sure our movement stays unified and principled so that we can win elections and save the country.\u201d\n\nYet his aim in the book is to reach a different audience, perhaps those who took their cues from Obama propagandists and wrote him off in 2012 as a heartless budget-cutter, or as somehow dishonest for insisting that an entitlement system running out of money needed to be fixed.\n\nThe book dwells sentimentally on stories from Ryan\u2019s past\u2013standard fare for political memoirs, perhaps, but serving a particular purpose here.\n\nThat purpose is to convince readers that Ryan understands the poor, and those who must rely on various forms of public assistance, even as they struggle to become self-sufficient, and even as he tries to undo some of the welfare state programs on which they depend.\n\nRyan acknowledges that he wanted to highlight his capacity for empathy in the book, especially in writing about his father, who struggled with alcohol before dying of a heart attack while Ryan was still in high school.\n\n\u201cEverybody has their own experiences. And having someone with addiction in your family, and having tragedy in your family\u2013the argument I\u2019m making is that you can have a comeback in your family,\u201d Ryan told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t talk about the important parts in my life,\u201d he added, \u201cthe book would be whitewashing, inaccurate, incomplete.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also something important to relating to people in that way.\u201d\n\nIn one notable passage, Ryan describes how he has stopped using the rhetorical contrast between \u201cmakers\u201d and \u201ctakers,\u201d because it disparages those on the receiving end.\n\nAfter hearing a Democrat rip into him at the Wisconsin State Fair in 2012, Ryan recalls, he began to reconsider his language. \u201cAlthough he doesn\u2019t know it,\u201d Ryan says, \u201cthat guy taught me a valuable lesson that day. It took me a while to completely come around, but I soon realized that the phrase I\u2019d been using implied a certain judgment about the group that receives government benefits\u2013one that is in deep conflict with the American idea.\u201d\n\nThat story may provide ammunition to conservative critics who have charged that Ryan is buckling under the weight of pressure from Democrats and the media: \u201cAll that wears on a person,\u201d one recently wrote accusingly.\n\nRyan denies that he is backing away from the political fight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2013it\u2019s that I was shutting a whole group of people off from our message. If we\u2019re going to bring people into the fold, if we\u2019re going to bring our message to non-traditional voters, we have to do so in a way that brings them into the conversation.\n\n\u201cUsing a clumsy message can cut people off from hearing the message in the first place.\u201d\n\nPerhaps. More cynically, one could speculate that Ryan senses an opening in 2016 for a moderate candidate\u2013that, as Ted Cruz and Rand Paul pull the Republican Party to the right, there is more space in the center, and that Ryan gauges that he could occupy it more successfully than an opportunist like Jon Huntsman did.\n\nBut there is also a simpler explanation, which goes beyond politics and posturing, to the person beneath the policy debate: Ryan is simply finding his voice, while trying to find the best way to achieve the widest appeal for his conservative ideas.\n\nAnd, like his mentor Jack Kemp, he is particularly concerned about reaching the poor, whom he believes would benefit most from policies promoting opportunity and self-reliance, rather than redistribution and dependence.\n\nIn that vein, earlier this month, Ryan released a new plan for addressing poverty, \u201cExpanding Opportunity in America.\u201d The plan, which focuses on shifting spending from the federal government to the states and to local organizations, won praise from some die-hard liberals.\n\nConservatives fretted about squaring Ryan\u2019s plan with his support for immigration reform, which some fear would grow the ranks of the indigent, a concern Ryan has disputed.\n\nThe trouble is that the poor tend to find promises of big government seductive, even as big government fails.\n\nThey are not alone: a recent Reason-Rupe poll found that two-thirds of young Americans see government as wasteful and inefficient than ever before\u2013and yet they want more of it. Ryan puts that paradox down to the \u201ccustomization\u201d that young people expect in their lives, believing they can have the good of government without the bad.\n\nYet convincing them otherwise will take more than Ryan\u2019s evident sincerity: it will take political skill, and sensitivity. That remains Ryan\u2019s greatest challenge.\n\nHe writes, for example, that he believes he won the Vice Presidential debate with Joe Biden in 2012 by ignoring Biden\u2019s wild gestures and interruptions: \u201cI didn\u2019t take the bait and delivered most of the points I was hoping to make.\u201d\n\nYet while Ryan may have edged Biden in post-debate polls, Biden\u2019s performance was a crucial lift for Democrats, who wanted to see their ticket in fighting spirit after Obama\u2019s weak performance in his first debate.\n\nIt is that fighting spirit that some conservatives find lacking in Ryan today\u2013and that, more than any change in tactics or rhetoric, probably counts for much of the mistrust.\n\nThere are occasional moments of fireworks, as in June, when Ryan confronted the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service over the lost emails of Lois Lerner, the former head of the Exempt Organizations division that targeted Tea Party groups for several years.\n\nMore often, in the wake of the 2012 defeat, and especially since the failure of the shutdown over Obamacare in 2013, Ryan has sought ways to work with Democrats\u2013not just to show a will to compromise, but to wrest incremental conservative policy gains when large ones are impossible.\n\n\u201cLike the Founders and like Lincoln,\u201d Ryan writes, \u201cwe must stay true to our principles but, like them, we must make practical decisions to advance our principles under the circumstances in which we find ourselves. Sometimes we must be bold, and other times we must be careful and bide our time.\u201d\n\nThat pragmatic approach bespeaks a political maturity rare in Washington. Unfortunately, it is also a tough way to rally the political base. It is also a difficult way to sell a book.\n\nWhat Ryan offers in The Way Forward is less a policy manifesto and more a personal profile: the memoir is perfectly timed to fuel speculation about the Republican presidential field in 2016.\n\nHe notes that the book tour has given him the opportunity to consider the presidential path. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of folks I got to see before, familiar faces from the campaign trail,\u201d he told Breitbart News on Sunday.\n\nRyan has left the door open to running\u2013if not in 2016, then certainly in the long future ahead. His greatest challenge will be to build a wider base of support. In that sense, the way forward remains a difficult one.\n\nImage: Amazon.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Ryan: The Loneliest Man in Washington (Review: 'The Way Forward')", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Paul Ryan: The Loneliest Man in Washington (Review: 'The Way Forward')", "title": "Paul Ryan: The Loneliest Man in Washington (Review: 'The Way Forward') - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/08/24/Screen-Shot-2014-08-24-at-82234-AMpng.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/24/washington-s-loneliest-man-review-paul-ryan-s-the-way-forward/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paul Ryan: The Loneliest Man in Washington (Review: 'The Way Forward')", "title": "Paul Ryan: The Loneliest Man in Washington (Review: 'The Way Forward') - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/08/24/Screen-Shot-2014-08-24-at-82234-AMpng.png", "creator": "@joelpollak", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Paul Ryan, Senate, Ted Cruz,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2014-08-24T14:39:00-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf3b8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut ultimately, we need to focus on winning converts.\u201dThat is the basic purpose of The Way Forward, he says.\nBut consider the dust jacket of Paul Ryan\u2019s The Way Forward: Renewing the American Idea.\nIn that sense, the way forward remains a difficult one.\nConservatives fretted about squaring Ryan\u2019s plan with his support for immigration reform, which some fear would grow the ranks of the indigent, a concern Ryan has disputed.\nWhat Ryan offers in The Way Forward is less a policy manifesto and more a personal profile: the memoir is perfectly timed to fuel speculation about the Republican presidential field in 2016."}
