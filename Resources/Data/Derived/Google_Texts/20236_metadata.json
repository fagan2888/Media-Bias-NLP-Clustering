Cornerbacks coach Joe Whitt called that game a turning point for Shields. Credit: Rick Wood\n\nBy of the\n\nGreen Bay \u2014 For 20 filibustering minutes, Bill Belichick heaped praise upon the Green Bay Packers. Through this conference call with Wisconsin reporters and each trip to the podium in New England, the Patriots commander-in-chief saluted his opponent Sunday.\n\nIn truth, Belichick probably would've cut or traded many of the Packers' players long ago.\n\nMaybe Mike Neal, hounded by injuries his first three seasons. Maybe Sam Shields, the speed demon whose tackling skills reached embarrassing proportions for parts of 2011. Maybe T.J. Lang, who cleaned up his act off the field to earn a starting spot and long-term contract. Or Brad Jones, the goat in the Week 1 loss at Seattle. Or Mason Crosby, who endured a career-worst slump in 2012.\n\n\"When you put an investment in a guy,\" cornerbacks coach Joe Whitt Jr. said, \"the players that come here understand that we're not looking to get rid of people. Even if you have a rough start, we're going to develop you and make you ours.\"\n\nNow, the only two teams to reach the postseason each of the last five years meet Sunday at Lambeau Field. And they've gotten here in polar-opposite ways.\n\nYes, both are built on franchise quarterbacks. But whereas New England signs players Tuesday and cuts 'em Friday \u2014 Belichick has fostered a stone-cold, you-are-replaceable climate \u2014 the Packers are more apt to develop prospects within. They'll be counting on several such prospects in this cross-conference showdown, too.\n\nNeal to generate pass rush. Shields as a quick-reacting antidote to Tom Brady's accuracy. Jones as the dime linebacker.\n\nWhitt is one assistant central to the development. He molded a former University of Miami wide receiver into a $39 million man.\n\nWould Belichick really have tolerated the growing pains after that brutal sight Nov. 20, 2011, against Tampa Bay? Human sledgehammer LaGarrette Blount broke eight tackles en route to a 54-yard touchdown, and Shields' miss was the most egregious. With a perfect angle at the back, Shields' merry-go-round attempt epitomized the team's tackling woes.\n\nYet general manager Ted Thompson, Whitt, everyone stuck with him. And in 2012, he responded.\n\nAll along, Whitt said he told coach Mike McCarthy and defensive coordinator Dom Capers that Shields was a worker, he was mature. He'd get it.\n\n\"Sam had so much raw ability, it'd be hard to throw that raw ability out,\" Whitt said. \"When you put that (work ethic) with his ability, you knew if he did it the right way, he was going to be a quality player because he had the skill set.\"\n\nThe breakthrough? Whitt doesn't hesitate. A third and 2 in the 2012 season opener. San Francisco's Frank Gore caught a swing pass left, rumbled toward the sideline and Shields, mano a mano, was the aggressor.\n\nSaid Whitt, \"It showed that he had the ability and the courage to tackle.\"\n\nShields has been beat at times this season, but his ball skills remain a potential game-changer in this prime-time setting. From press coverage, when \"he doesn't see the ball,\" Whitt said, Shields still can make a play on the ball. He sees \"flashes\" and reacts. Through 70 career games, the 5-foot-11, 184-pound cornerback has 85 pass breakups and 19 interceptions.\n\nElsewhere, Neal transformed from college defensive tackle to 3-4 defensive end to the outside linebacker the Packers need against Brady with Nick Perry (shoulder) listed as questionable again.\n\nThis is after missing 28 of a possible 48 games his first three seasons, echoes of bust Justin Harrell getting louder and louder.\n\n\"Obviously, they won't quit on you,\" said Neal, who has 32 tackles and three sacks. \"They'll give you as much opportunity as you need. You just have to be ready to capitalize on it. It has benefited me.\n\n\"It works. Even if sometimes it seems murky, we still have a winning record, still go to the playoffs and see people in our system thrive and get better. So I think that it's a positive.\"\n\nOf course, the Patriots' cutthroat approach works for them.\n\nWide receiver Wes Welker \u2014 his six years of service, 672 receptions, 37 touchdowns \u2014 was low-balled in free agency and departed for Denver. Veterans are routinely whisked away, recycled. Blount rampaged through the 2013 postseason, left in free agency, was cut by Pittsburgh and then was signed again by New England. Thus, Shields will get a shot at personal redemption Sunday.\n\nRemember Tiquan Underwood? The Patriots cut him less than 24 hours before the Super Bowl. Belichick constantly reshuffles the bottom of his roster.\n\nThere is a value in fear, in players always wondering if they're next.\n\nIn Green Bay, the Packers' faith in Jones at inside linebacker led to midseason scrambling. Clay Matthews, their best pass rusher, is now lining up inside instead.\n\nThe Packers don't want trust to be confused with complacency.\n\n\"Tomorrow is not promised to anyone,\" wide receivers coach Edgar Bennett said.\n\n\"So we want to make the most of our opportunities. Yes, bring them along. But don't put anything on the backburner as far as the ultimate goal \u2014 and Coach Mike talks about it at the beginning of every season \u2014 where we want to be at the end of the year. Our standards will never change.\"\n\nAdds Whitt, \"We're all under the pressure that we understand we have to perform. And we've had enough success around here that we don't panic when we do get hard days.\"\n\nThe players seem to get that memo. Whenever a player is cut in Green Bay \u2014 be it Jerron McMillian last year or Ryan Taylor this year \u2014 it resonates in the locker room.\n\nJames Starks, another player the Packers stayed patient with through injuries, said both the Packers and Patriots \"have an eye\" for talent, a \"knack\" for roster building.\n\n\"And I know it's a business,\" Starks said. \"You're here to perform. That could happen anywhere, that's the way of the league. You never know where you're going to go.\"\n\nSo here inside an interview room, asked about when Randall Cobb truly broke through, Bennett even calls his star slot receiver a \"work in progress.\"\n\nWith everyone, they want more.\n\nStill, Sunday features a stark contrast in styles. Two different ways of doing business in today's NFL.\n\nWhitt uses himself as an example. When he arrived as a quality control coach in 2008, he knew in the back of the Packers' brass minds, they wanted him to eventually to take the cornerback room over.\n\nAll assistants operate with one team ethos in mind. Thompson did so hoping it'd lead to winning games like this.\n\n\"You bring in talent, you grow your talent,\" Whitt said, \"and it might not necessarily flourish Day 1 but you saw something in that individual that fits the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\"So we hold onto it and we grow our players.\"\n\nSUNDAY\n\nOpponent: Patriots (9-2).\n\nWhen: 3:25 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lambeau Field.\n\nTelevision: CBS.
