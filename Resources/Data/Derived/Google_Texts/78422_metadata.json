She was 0-9 entering Saturday\u2019s Eastern Maine Class B championship game at the Cross Insurance Center.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t allow the Wildcats to end her career, pouring in 25 points and hauling down 16 rebounds, both game-highs, as Mount Desert Island ended defending two-time state champ Presque Isle\u2019s 64-game winning streak with an impressive 63-51 victory.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make it this far to lose,\u201d said Hannah Shaw whose 19-2 Trojans will take on 20-1 Lake Region of Naples in Friday\u2019s 7:05 p.m. state final at the Cross Center.\n\nIt is the MDI girls\u2019 first EM B title since 2003.\n\nPresque Isle, with just one senior on its roster, wound up 20-1.\n\nThe Trojans used a 19-6 spurt spanning the first and second quarters to build a 26-14 lead they would never relinquish and they were able to withstand some runs by the determined Wildcats in the second half to notch the triumph.\n\nKelsey Shaw, Hannah\u2019s sophomore sister, had 13 points, nine rebounds and three assists and and junior guard Sarah Phelps had 12 points, seven rebounds and two assists.\n\nWildcat sophomore guard Taylor Williams scored 16 points and standout junior guard Hannah Graham wound up with 13 points, five rebounds and three assists. All of Graham\u2019s points came in the second half. Freshman Emily Lagerstrom came off the bench and hit three 3-pointers for her nine points and Regan Nelson had a team-high eight rebounds to go with five points.\n\nPresque Isle rattled off 12 straight points in the fourth quarter to pull within 51-47 with 2:40 remaining.\n\nGraham had a hand in all 12 points with two 3-pointers and assists on 3-pointers by Lagerstrom and Williams.\n\nBut Hannah Shaw fed sister Kelsey under the basket for what turned into a traditional three-point play with 2:26 left and, after Phelps grabbed a defensive rebound and Molly Carroll made a steal, Carroll sank a foul shot and Sierra Tapley hit two more to make it 57-47 with 1:10 left.\n\nMDI outrebounded Presque Isle 25-12 in the first half en route to manufacturing a 13-point halftime lead and finished with a 38-21 edge.\n\n\u201cThey were on a mission and played better than we did,\u201d said Presque Isle coach Jeff Hudson. \u201cThey made a lot of shots. We knew if they made a lot of shots and Hannah Shaw stayed out of foul trouble, we\u2019d have a hard time. And we didn\u2019t rebound.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans also did an exceptional job defensively, extending on their 2-3 zone to contest most of Presque Isle\u2019s shots.\n\n\u201cWe changed our philosophy since we played them last during the regular season,\u201d said MDI coach Brent Barker. \u201cWe were getting beat on our man-to-man so we went to a 2-3 zone. We wanted to pack it in and close out on their shooters. We did a great job of that today.\n\n\u201cHannah Graham still got her points but she had some tough looks [to earn them],\u201d said Barker who credited Carroll with doing an outstanding job against Graham when Graham ventured to her side of the zone.\n\n\u201cI just tried to play real tough defense on her and faceguard her,\u201d said Carroll. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t get too close because she\u2019d go by me. She\u2019s an amazing player. It was a real good challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cMolly Carroll and Sierra Tapley were on me just about all the time and they did a good job,\u201d said Graham who admitted her team came out \u201cflat\u201d in the first half.\n\nPhelps had four 3-pointers in the first half to help build the lead. She had 13 points, four assists and two steals in the semifinal loss to PI last year.\n\n\u201cFor some reason I get so motivated to play Presque Isle in the tournament. They\u2019re real good competition so they bring out the best in our team,\u201d grinned Phelps.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BANGOR, Maine \u2014 Mount Desert Island senior forward Hannah Shaw had never beaten Presque Isle during her exemplary basketball career.
