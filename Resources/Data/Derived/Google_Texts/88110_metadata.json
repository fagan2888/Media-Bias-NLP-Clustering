Jim McDermott, D-Wash., says of the Republican leadership, referring to votes teed up to challenge President Barack Obama legacy in his final year in office.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, tea-party conservatives warned former House Speaker John Boehner's successor that their patience is already wearing thin\n\n\n\n\"I think it is fundamentally unfair to try and judge the speakership of Paul Ryan over the last month or so. But, as I have also said, the honeymoon is over,\" said Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, a co-chair of the House Freedom Caucus. \"I think he needs to start putting up real conservative reform in the House and doing the things that are necessary to show the voters that he is a different speaker than John Boehner because frankly, everything he has done so far is no different than what John Boehner would have done.\"\n\nObama Re-Opens the Gun Debate\n\nObama Re-Opens the Gun Debate Carolyn Kaster/AP What Happened:\n\n\n\nObama kicked off 2016 by announcing new executive actions meant to reduce gun violence. On Tuesday, the president announced an executive action to\n\n\n\nclarify existing rules on who must be licensed as a gun seller \u2013 an attempt to more deftly delineate people who sell or gift firearms to friends or family from those who sell hundreds a weapons a year online and at gun shows.\n\n\n\nHe also called for the hiring of 230 more FBI staffers to handle the increase in background checks, tightened a reporting requirement for manufacturers and retailers in the event a gun is lost or stolen in transit, and removed barriers preventing states from reporting information that would prohibit a potential buyer from purchasing a weapon for mental health reasons.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\n\n\nThe changes are fairly limited \u2013 Obama admitted they likely would not have prevented many of the high-profile mass shootings in recent years \u2013 but his announcement had gun rights advocates sounding warnings that the move was the latest step in his efforts to eliminate Americans\u2019 gun rights.\n\n\n\nRepublican lawmakers roundly criticized the actions as executive overreach, and the GOP presidential candidates vowed to roll them back immediately upon taking office.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the biggest impact of the actions may be to recenter the national debate ahead of November\u2019s elections. A CNN poll taken this week found 67 percent of Americans in favor of the changes \u2013 and surveys consistently find nearly 9 in 10 support closing the so-called gun show loophole, including 8 of 10 Republicans \u2013 but GOP lawmakers tend to be almost unanimously opposed to any increase in gun control.\n\nSymbolic Repeal of Obamacare Passes, Gets Vetoed\n\nSymbolic Repeal of Obamacare Passes, Gets Vetoed Mark Wilson/Getty Images What Happened:\n\n\n\nIt took until December for the Senate to follow through on promises Republicans made at the beginning of 2015 to pass legislation repealing the Affordable Care Act using a special budgetary procedure known as reconciliation to keep Democrats from filibustering.\n\n\n\nOn Dec. 3, the Senate approved legislation that would unravel the health care law\u2019s provisions authorizing the federal government to operate insurance exchanges, eliminate subsidies helping people pay for coverage, roll back the penalties enforcing the individual and employer mandates requiring the purchase of coverage, and undo the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\n\n\nThe bill also would block federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\n\n\nAs its first order of business upon returning to Washington, the House passed the reconciliation bill, sending it to Obama, who waited less than 24 hours before vetoing it.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\n\n\nThe House has voted dozens of times in past five years to pass legislation repealing all or part of Obamacare, but Thursday\u2019s vote was the first time they were able to get that bill as far as the president\u2019s desk.\n\n\n\nDespite the certain veto \u2013 and will full knowledge they lack the votes to override it \u2013 Republicans immediately declared victory. The vote allowed GOP lawmakers to claim they had to kept a campaign promise to take all possible action to trash the law, while demonstrating that doing so is within reach, should a Republican win the White House in November.\n\n\n\nA vote to override the veto, which will fall short of the necessary two thirds of each chamber, is scheduled for Jan. 26. Iran Missile Tests Aggravate Region as Sanctions Near End\n\nIran Missile Tests Aggravate Region as Sanctions Near End Craig Ruttle/File/AP What Happened:\n\n\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry announced Thursday that Iran may be within days of meeting the requirements laid out in this summer\u2019s nuclear agreement that would instigate the suspension of sanctions.\n\n\n\nBut at the same time, Congress began preparing legislation to impose new sanctions against Iran for conducting missile tests in the fall.\n\n\n\nThe House Foreign Affairs Committee also moved forward on legislation to stop the Obama administration from lifting the sanctions as part of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the agreement reached between Iran, the U.S., the U.K., Russia, China, Germany and France unless the administration were able to verify that the Iranian financial institutions set to benefit from the lifted sanctions had not knowingly funded foreign terrorism operations or several entities.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\n\n\nWhile Iran\u2019s ramping up of missile activity does not violate the terms of the nuclear deal, it may defy the U.N. Security Council resolution that prohibits Iran from action \u201crelated to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\n\n\nCongress failed to muster the two thirds opposition that would have prevented the U.S. from entering into the nuclear deal, but Iran\u2019s increasing aggression and deteriorating relations with its neighbors has U.S. lawmakers, including those who supported the nuclear deal, suggesting more sanctions be imposed.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has so far resisted their calls, but both options have potential pitfalls: Reasserting sanctions could push Iran to break from the deal and restart its nuclear program, while allowing it to proceed with its missile tests would further exacerbate regional tensions.\n\nNorth Korea Tests a Nuclear Weapon", "article_metadata": {"zone": "slideshows", "keyword": "gun control and gun rights", "title": "5 Things to Know About Congress This Week: 1/8/16", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "U.S. News breaks down what happened on Capitol Hill.", "title": "5 Things to Know About Congress This Week", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/slideshows/5-things-to-know-about-congress-this-week-1-8-16", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/ee/a3f750a54e4da3aae190a86c1cc7ae/media:24842e334a1c4685a756bdbc01626995CongressReturns.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "U.S. News breaks down what happened on Capitol Hill.", "card": "summary", "title": "5 Things to Know About Congress This Week: 1/8/16"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Jan. 8, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "slideshow", "keywords": "Gabrielle Levy,Pulse,Congress,Democratic Party,House of Representatives,gun control and gun rights", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "U.S. News breaks down what happened on Capitol Hill."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05d2\"", "article_summary": "But at the same time, Congress began preparing legislation to impose new sanctions against Iran for conducting missile tests in the fall.\nWhy It Matters:The return to partisanship may mean that even less gets accomplished by Congress this year than last.\nObama Re-Opens the Gun DebateObama Re-Opens the Gun Debate Carolyn Kaster/AP What Happened:Obama kicked off 2016 by announcing new executive actions meant to reduce gun violence.\nBut, as I have also said, the honeymoon is over,\" said Rep.
