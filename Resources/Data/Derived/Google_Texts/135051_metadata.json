In August the Denver Water Department \u2014 the one organization that can make CDOT look like pikers \u2014 voted to spend $195 million on the redevelopment of its 34.6-acre \u201ccampus\u201d at 1600 W. 12th Avenue. (Watch out for next year\u2019s water rates.)\n\nDoesn\u2019t working at the CDOT or Denver Water campus sound like the joyful recapture of a long-lost youth? Football scholarships! Friday night pep rallies! Fraternity parties! Co-ed dorms!\n\nBut no crippling student loans to pay off, just paychecks to cash. \u201cGo State!\u201d\n\nCDOT\u2019s plans came as a surprise to lawmakers because they weren\u2019t consulted. Apparently, under a 1990 law, CDOT and higher education can finance capital projects without a legislative appropriation. The department is going straight to state Treasurer Walker Stapleton for a $2 million bond issue to pay for the planning of the larger construction bond issue.\n\nLawmakers were particularly upset because CDOT declined to support a bill last session authorizing $3.5 billion in transportation bonds to be paid back with half of CDOT\u2019s federal gas tax revenues. It failed.\n\n\u201cI have a huge concern that that they can say \u2018no\u2019 to roads, bridges and public safety and \u2018yes\u2019 to bonding for themselves,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Bill Cadman told The Denver Post.\n\nIf indeed CDOT has the financial ability to finance the project, the state must agree to the issuance of bonds, said Deputy Treasurer Jon Forbes.\n\n\u201cI can understand [CDOT] having some flexibility to manage without constant legislative review,\u201d Cadman told CompleteColorado. \u201cBut this has given us an indication that the authority is a little too broad.\u201d\n\nIn a memo dated last May 20, CDOT said upgrading its offices will help the department \u201cbrand itself as the largest engineering employer in the state of Colorado, as well as recruit and train top level employees.\u201d\n\nThe branding comment rankled Cadman. \u201cThat supports their mission but their mission ought to be transportation,\u201d he said.\n\nShould the law be changed? Perhaps legislators should keep tighter control over CDOT and higher ed ambitions. On the other hand, they\u2019ve had their own problems with capital construction.\n\nBack in 2003, Republicans \u2014 under pressure from corrections officials \u2014 wanted to build a new high-security prison in Ca\u00f1on City, but Democrats favored building new medical school near the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Aurora. Each party thought the other\u2019s proposal was a waste of money. They reached a classic legislative compromise: Instead of saving money by building neither, they lumped the projects together in a single bill and overspent by building both.\n\nSens. Andy McElhany, R-Colorado Springs, and Peggy Reeves, D-Fort Collins, tried hard to put the financing on the ballot. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to put people in debt for 25 years, they need to have a vote in the process,\u201d said McElhany\n\nSenate Majority Leader Norma Anderson, R-Lakewood, led the fight to use lease-purchase agreements that would need no public input. Apparently addressing school children in the gallery, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s your money. It\u2019s also your future. It\u2019s good-paying jobs. It\u2019s going to bring us out of the doldrums.\u201d\n\nAnderson\u2019s side won and the legislature voted to use lease-purchase agreements.\n\n(Anderson, now retired, joined numerous Democrats as a plaintiff in a 2011 anti-TABOR lawsuit. It claims that giving the people the right to vote on taxes violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s guarantee that the states have a \u201crepublican\u201d form of government. The suit is still alive, but barely.)\n\nTaxpayers will end up paying $208 million for Colorado State Penitentiary II, aka Centennial South. It consists of 948 solitary-confinement cells. Part of it was briefly used starting in 2010, but prison population unexpectedly went down and solitary confinement fell out of favor. The prison was closed completely two years later and sits empty today.\n\nHmmm. We have one government department that needs new space, and another that has way too much.\n\nGet the picture? Why not move CDOT into the empty prison, thus freeing up $150 million for highways? You say it\u2019s not reasonable to put CDOT employees in a prison? But what are solitary-confinement cells but private offices? You don\u2019t have to lock the door.\n\nEach cell comes with a computerized kiosk \u2014 I am not making this up \u2013that was supposed to let prisoners order library books, watch TV, take classes make phone calls to relatives. Easy enough to convert to regular government use.\n\nEach office also comes with its own executive washroom \u2014 very close at hand!\n\nCDOT could call it the Norma Anderson No-Doldrums Ca\u00f1on City Campus.\n\nDo I have to do all the heavy thinking around here?\n\nLongtime Rocky Mountain News political columnist Peter Blake now writes twice a month for CompleteColorado.com.
