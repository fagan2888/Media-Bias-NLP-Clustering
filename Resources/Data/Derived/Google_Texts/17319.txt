David Wise won his third consecutive X Games ski halfpipe title Friday night in Aspen, delivering the Nevada father a boost of momentum as head to Sochi leading the first-ever U.S. Olympic Halfpipe ski team.

Linking lofty double-cork trickery under the lights, the 23-year-old spun back-to-back-to-back X Games gold, a feat not seen in six years since the halfpipe reign of pioneer Tanner Hall.

Frenchman Kevin Rolland took second in the best-of-three-run format, pushing hard with enormous airs that included a highest-of-the-night 19-foot double cork 1260.

After late-run bobbles in his first two runs, Aspen’s X Games-rookie Ferreira stuck a clean and buoyant final run to grab a podium position in his first-ever X Games competition.

“The level of competition is really crazy. If you want to be on the podium, you have to do one of the best pipe runs you have ever done,” Rolland said.

Aspen’s Torin Yater-Wallace qualified for the finals but dropped from the competition late Friday. He was pushing against his doctors recommendations when he skied in qualifying. He collapsed a lung during a physical therapy session in December, which required a week in the hospital. Then a crash during practice at the Breckenridge Dew Tour collapsed the same lung again and broke two ribs. He estimates he’s spent about seven days skiing halfpipe this winter.

Still, the 18-year-old won a coach’s discretion position on the first-ever U.S. Olympic Halfpipe Team, based on his dominating performances in last season’s contests.

Yater-Wallace said he will spend the next week training “all day, every day” in the Buttermilk X Games halfpipe as he prepares for Sochi.
