O\u2019Rourke has mixed feelings about that.\n\nJoe, the Democrats don\u2019t like you. That\u2019s fine by me. I\u2019m a Republican. I don\u2019t like you either. But, to quote the universally acknowledged definitive study of practical politics, which starred Marlon Brando, \u201cIt\u2019s not personal\u2026 It\u2019s strictly business.\u201d\n\nPersonally, I think you\u2019re a great guy. But I\u2019m scared that you, a Democrat, could get elected\u2014by a wide electoral and popular vote margin.\n\nSo, Joe, you and I understand each other. What I don\u2019t understand is your fellow Democrats. I\u2019ve seen what they\u2019ve been saying about you in the mainstream media\u2026\n\nLet me pause for a moment in writing this well-informed and insightful analysis and clear something up for readers.\n\nPolitical pundits like myself speak a different language, \u201cPunditese.\u201d When a conservative political pundit says \u201cmainstream media,\u201d that\u2019s Punditese for \u201cass-kissing pink-o milksops.\u201d (The clever type of conservative political pundits sometimes alter the phrase to \u201clamestream media.\u201d)\n\nLikewise, when a liberal political pundit says \u201cright-wing-fringe talk radio,\u201d that\u2019s Punditese for \u201cclear-eyed, sober assessment of the facts.\u201d\n\nAs I was saying, Joe, it doesn\u2019t look good. You\u2019d think you were a Republican, the way our liberal pals in politics and the press are letting you have it.\n\nOn September 2, CNN called you \u201ca reliable fundraiser for the Democratic Party.\u201d In Punditese, a bagman. And, to add slur to slander, they called you a \u201cdutiful emissary of the administration\u2019s initiatives.\u201d That is to say, \u201ccomic sidekick.\u201d\n\nOn August 28, Politico\u2019s Katie Glueck wrote, \u201cThe vast majority of Democratic insiders\u2026 don\u2019t believe Joe Biden will run for president.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s hardly an insult too bitter to swallow since \u201cpolitical insiders\u201d is a Punditese term for \u201cI\u201d or \u201cme.\u201d But Ms. Glueck went on to cite Politico\u2019s \u201cweekly bipartisan survey of the top strategists, activists, and operatives in Iowa and New Hampshire\u201d (which roughly translates as \u201cpeople who bothered to answer my emails\u201d). And a number of Cornball and Granite-Pants anonymous Dems unleashed derision and scorn upon you.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, he is a loyal Democrat.\u201d (Translation: \u201cAs was FDR\u2019s dog, Fala.\u201d)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a truly wonderful man universally loved by NH Democrats.\u201d (\u201cLike Jimmy Carter, but with a worse long-term political prognosis.\u201d)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late in the game for Biden to mount a serious bid.\u201d (\u201cBiden\u2019s running? Nobody told me!\u201d)\n\n\u201cI have the utmost respect for him.\u201d (\u201cJoe who?\u201d)\n\nThe Atlantic, the official journal of the American bien pensant, called you \u201canother Beltway veteran\u201d (i.e., liar, thief, and cheat). America\u2019s permissive libel laws not withstanding, surely that\u2019s actionable.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

It\u2019s not like you believe in the same things as Edmund Burke. But Richard the Lionheart didn\u2019t believe in the same things as Saladin, and they were both stand-up guys. Your Democratic opponents are a couple of worthless little \u201csits.\u201d One was the babysitter for two juvenile presidents and the other is an Occupy Wall Street protester unaccountably holding his sit-in in Vermont.\n\nAnd, Joe, you\u2019ve borne more personal sorrow than all the other presidential candidates, Democratic or Republican, combined. Borne it manfully.\n\nIndeed, you\u2019ve known more grief than all the other presidential candidates combined will give to the poor electorate over the next 15 months. Which is a lot. And we Americans would be a happier people if you were in the race, even we Republican-Americans.\n\nBut you\u2019re not going to be.\n\nThe Big Donkeys want you kicked out of the Democrat candidate stable. They say you\u2019re \u201ctoo prone to gaffes.\u201d\n\nHere are a few of your \u201cgaffes\u201d from a Time magazine feature, \u201cTop 10 Joe Biden Gaffs.\u201d\n\nYou said about Obamacare on live TV, \u201cThis is a big f______ deal.\u201d\n\nYou told the House Democratic Caucus, \u201cIf we do everything right, if we do it with absolute certainty, there\u2019s still a 30 percent chance we\u2019re going to get it wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd when you were running against Obama for the 2008 nomination you described him as a \u201cmainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.\u201d And said of his candidacy, \u201cI mean, that\u2019s a storybook, man.\u201d\n\nPunditese doesn\u2019t have a word for \u201ctruth.\u201d And it\u2019s hard to explain, in English, the meaning of \u201cgaffe.\u201d The closest I can come is \u201csaying the thing that is so.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not the real problem, Joe. The real problem is you\u2019re an old, white European male. The Democrats are determined to elect \u201cthe first (fill in the blank) American president.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve checked off No. 1 (African-American) and are determined to go down the list in order of historical victimhood.\n\nDemocrats are liberals and\u2014to their profound embarrassment\u2014liberalism is a philosophy rooted in the thinking of old, white European males.\n\nLiberalism is based upon the philosophical inquiries of John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine and\u2014oh, the shame of it\u2014slave-owning, woman-exploiting Thomas Jefferson. America\u2019s first great liberal populist was Andrew Jackson, perpetrator of the Tail of Tears and annihilator of the Second Bank of the United States\u2014and hence of centralized economic control.\n\nPlus liberalism is painfully un-hip. Say Great Society to today\u2019s with-it young Democratic voters and they assume you\u2019re being fashionably ironic and hear air quotes around the \u201cGreat.\u201d Say New Deal and they think you\u2019re talking about the Texas Hold\u2019em they play on their smartphones.\n\nJoe, you\u2019re the Democrats\u2019 best choice not just because you\u2019re a decent, intelligent and experienced man who is, by all accounts, cooperative with your political allies, respectful of your political opponents and considerate to your staff.\n\nYou\u2019re the Democrats\u2019 best choice because you\u2019re so far ahead of every other candidate, from either party, in the \u201cRoad Trip Poll.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith which presidential candidate would you rather go on a road trip?\u201d\n\nIn the 17 presidential elections since 1948, the Road Trip Poll has had an accuracy rate of 88.2% (with a 5.9% plus or minus margin of error).\n\nSalty, poker-playing Harry Truman beginning each day with a shot of Old Grand-Dad or Thomas E. \u201clittle man on the wedding cake\u201d Dewey?\n\nJolly golfer Ike or po-face Adlai Stevenson?\n\nCharming, charismatic JFK or\u2014no adjectives needed\u2014Nixon?\n\nBullroaring longhorn LBJ or Barry \u201cNuke \u2019Em\u201d Goldwater?\n\nTricky Dick (at least he was a drinking man) or the sanctimonious RFK fill-in Hubert \u201cHump\u201d Humphrey?\n\nGeorge McGovern or Trick? Tough one. Dick, I guess. McG\u2019s VP pick Thomas Eagleton was a veteran of McGovern road trips and had to have electro-shock therapy.\n\nCarter or Ford? Okay, we were wrong.\n\nHappy-go-lucky Ron or Persimmon-Puss Jimmy?\n\nReagan or whoever that stiff was?\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush or \u201cI have to go take a Dukakis\u201d? (A word-for-word off-the-record quote from Bush 41 obtained on deep background.)\n\nGeorge Bush or Bill Clinton? \u201cToga! Toga!\u201d to quote Bill\u2019s Washington colleague, Senator John Blutarski.\n\nThe guy in the Viagra ads or the guy getting his food laced with saltpeter by Hillary?\n\nAl Gore\u2014nickname \u201cAlbert\u201d\u2014or the frat boy from Yale\u2019s DKE Animal House?\n\nW. or Kerry, who\u2019d be ordering Chateauneuf-du-pape (\u201990) at the Billy Goat Tavern in Chicago, wondering where the Ritz Carlton was located in Tucumcari, New Mexico, and worrying about getting stone chips on his BMW 7 Series?\n\nObama or McCain? All right, we were wrong again.\n\nObama or a Mormon wearing special underpants that, according to LDS church literature, provide \u201cprotection against temptation and evil\u201d?\n\nHowever, all that said, far be it from me to tell the Democrats how to avoid losing the presidency\u2014and the Senate and the House\u2014in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "PJORourke"}, "keywords": "Joe Biden, 2016, 2016 Election, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201509050401, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "There\u2019s no way Joe Biden becomes the Democratic nominee, and P.J.
