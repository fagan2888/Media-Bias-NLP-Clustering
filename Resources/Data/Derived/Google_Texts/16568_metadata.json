Meanwhile, the amount of money spent by each patient on other diabetes medications fell 16 percent, to $502 from $600, according to a research letter published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n\u201cInsulin is a life-saving medication,\u201d said Dr. William Herman, a coauthor of the analysis and a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. \u201cThere are people with type 1 diabetes who will die without insulin. And while there have been incremental benefits in insulin products, prices have been rising. So there are people who can\u2019t afford them. It\u2019s a real problem.\u201d\n\nThe analysis also found that the cost of various widely used oral diabetes drugs either dropped in price or did not rise nearly as significantly as insulin. Metformin, for instance, which is available as a generic, fell to 31 cents in 2013 from $1.24 per tablet in 2002. And the newer class of diabetes drugs known as DPP-4 inhibitors rose 34 percent since becoming available in 2006.\n\nThe researchers analyzed data from nearly 28,000 diabetes found in the Medical Expenditure Panel, a database on health care costs maintained by the US Department of Health and Human Services. About 1 in 4 people used insulin and two-thirds took a pill. Toward the end of the study period, a small percentage began taking new injectable medicines that are designed to complement pills.\n\nThere have been previous efforts to track insulin prices in recent years, but the researchers explained this is the first attempt to examine national pricing data in this way for an extended period of time. And the findings are likely to further fuel the hot-button national debate over the rising cost of prescription medicines, which has also become a talking point in the presidential campaign.\n\nMore than 29 million Americans, or 9.3 percent of the population, have some form of diabetes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Not surprisingly, there are numerous companies competing to grab a share of the market and newer forms of insulin have been introduced, notably, analog insulins that are man-made and differ slightly from human insulin.\n\nPayers report that unit costs are rising. One exception has been the widely used long-acting form of insulin called Lantus, which is marketed by Sanofi. The drug maker has been encountering pushback form insurers, and so the unit cost for the medicine fell nearly 14 percent last year, according to Express Scripts, the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy benefits manager.\n\nMore competition is expected for Lantus later this year when Eli Lilly is expected to launch a biosimilar version of the medication. But to what extent this drug will be affordable remains to be seen. Typically, when a generic version of a pill becomes available, the price drops 80 percent or more. But biosimilars are new to the United States and are forecast to cost about 20 percent to 30 percent less than a brand-name drug.\n\nMeanwhile, some doctors say diabetic patients, who are typically 60 years old or more, have difficulty paying for drugs, especially those who have trouble once they hit the donut hole in the Medicare Part D program and have to cover costs themselves. \u201cThe cost of therapy is huge,\u201d said Dr. Jane Bridges, a diabetologist in Vincennes, Ind. \u201cI have patients who tell me that they have to stretch out the use of their medicines.\u201d\n\nBut the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America argued that focusing on list prices \u201cmisrepresents\u201d reality. The industry trade group maintained that wholesale prices generally do not correspond to net prices \u2014 what companies, unions, and government agencies pay \u2014 because drug makers offer rebates. The group cited an analysis by SSR Health that net prices declined last year.\n\nSpokespeople for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, two of the largest manufacturers of diabetes medicines, echoed that argument and both companies noted that patient-assistance programs are available. The Novo spokesman added that \u201cmaking comparisons between insulin and oral medications are not appropriate as each medication is designed to support a patient\u2019s specific glucose-control needs.\u201d\n\nA Lilly spokeswoman maintained that the net price for its Humalog insulin rose an average of 1.6 percent annually from 2010 to 2015. However, she did not respond to questions about the rebates that were offered. Drug makers and pharmacy benefits managers are facing increasing criticism for their failure to disclose rebates and discounts.\n\nOne analyst, meanwhile, contended that rising prices may not have any impact on patient outcomes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can draw a straight line from the rising cost of insulin to outcomes,\u201d said David Kliff, who publishes Diabetic Investor. \u201cVery few patients pay out of pocket for cost of insulin. So I don\u2019t think prices truly impact the patient pocket book. There\u2019s only a small percentage who don\u2019t have insurance or enough insurance.\u201d\n\nBut another author of the analysis disagreed.\n\n\u201cHigh costs can lead to reduced compliance, but more importantly the cost-effectiveness of high cost therapies \u2026 should be assessed, so they produce a greater clinical benefit for the patient,\u201d Philip Clarke, a professor of health economics at the University of Melbourne in Australia. Other countries, he noted, routinely assess cost-effectiveness when setting prices for government-subsidized drugs.\n\nThis article is reproduced with permission from STAT.
