Well, one man recently found out, and the entire ordeal, including the moth\u2019s eventual plucking, was captured on video. And as you would imagine, the man with the moth on his hear was lying down the whole time, in pain, and shouting profanities every few seconds while his friends stood around him.\n\nThe man\u2019s friends inspect his ear and see the moth inside. And it actually moved a bit. So they grabbed tweezers and all crowded around to pull it out.\n\nAnd the video of the extraction is pretty disturbing, considering 1) how close-up the camera gets to the action, and 2) the number of times it takes them to remove the whole moth.\n\nAnd when they finally extract the moth, just a heads-up, it might make you feel a little queasy. (Also: Why didn\u2019t they just use hydrogen peroxide to snuff it out?!?!)\n\nIf you still want to see the video, go ahead:\n\n[h/t The Blaze]\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "How painful and unpleasant must it be to have a small insect fly directly in your ear?
