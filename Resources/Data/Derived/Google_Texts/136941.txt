One family in Choctaw County is left picking up the pieces after rain dumped nearly a foot of water in southern portions of the county and one family is coping with the shock.

The flood waters in Gilbertown have receded and for the Barefield family, it left them with a devestating sight.

"Total liquidation inside, total liquidation," Flood victim Katie Barefield said. "No beds, no floors, no drawers, everything in our drawers was damaged, everything in the kitchen, everything under the cabinet, everything in our shed, totally underwater."

Cars damaged, a washed out bridge, all from nearly four feet of water that swept through the property.

"In the house, it was just rushing in under everything," said Barefield.

A shock for the family, but for the community it was a chance to embrace the family and come together and help them out.

"People were here at daybreak Friday morning, what can we do, what can we move, let me help, and they were," Barefield stated. "They were here till last night about midnight and they're still coming."

A community that has come together and offered the family a place to live, food, and just a helping hand.

"You know it's bad, you know it's real bad and everybody that knows me knows it's real bad when I look like this," Barefield exclaimed."I don't look like this, but it's okay we're gonna make it, we're gonna clean up and we can go on and find my makeup bag somewhere."

The Barefield's are currently living with family until they can move back into their home, and while they joke about it and say the family took them in as refugees, one thing rings true for the Barefields. A tragedy struck and the community was there to help and is still helping.

"The good Lord just helped us out," Barefield said with tears in her eyes.

The Barefield's say they are blessed and thankful from the bottom of their heart for the support from the community as they work to put the pieces back together.
