NEWARKâ€”The number of criminals walking away from halfway houses has declined dramatically a year after reports of escapes, drug use, sexual abuse and other violence inside the poorly monitored facilities, according to a report published by northjersey.com.

But several pieces of legislation introduced to reform the state's $65 million network of privately run halfway houses are still languishing in Trenton.

Gov. Chris Christie rejected an initial attempt by lawmakers to give them more oversight of the facilities, while other bills introduced to fix the system never made it to Christie's desk.

On Friday, David Goodell, one of the most notorious "walkaways," was sentenced to 45 years in prison for killing his former girlfriend after feigning an illness and escaping from a Newark halfway house.
