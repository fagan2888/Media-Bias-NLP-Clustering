It took advanced hacking techniques to access and understand the software within the drone.\n\nU.S. officials cautioned last week they are suspect the quality is equal to that of the American drone.\n\nStill, \u201cit shows how bolstered their program really is,\u201d said David Kennedy, CEO of information security company TrustedSec, which monitors cyber attacks. \u201cThat\u2019s heavily sophisticated equipment.\u201d\n\nA recent report from cybersecurity firm FireEye also described how one popular Iranian hacking group went from website defacements in 2010 to \u201cmalware-based espionage\u201d in a scant four years.\n\nIranian hackers reportedly went after oil giant Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s most valuable company, and deleted the contents of 30,000 computers. The same virus also hit Qatar-based liquid petroleum gas firm RasGas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to understand,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThey have not abandoned their cyber operations around the world. They just have not.\u201d\n\nWhile the U.S. is bombarded with cyber attacks, it has never been the subject of a large-scale destructive attack. So far, Tehran\u2019s hackers are mostly suspected of probing around U.S. infrastructure networks to understand their designs.\n\nBut that could change if the nuclear talks fall apart. And this time, an Iranian attack could be more advanced.\n\nKennedy thinks Tehran would use stealth malware to infiltrate bigger companies across more sectors.\n\nFalling worldwide oil prices would also make U.S. oil companies an attractive target, Alperovitch said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a key interest of theirs,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile no security experts think Iran would launch a destructive attack on the U.S. if the nuclear talks dissolved, Tehran\u2019s ability to embed malware in U.S. networks would give them the ability to do so.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re in the system,\u201d Alperovitch said, \u201cit\u2019s just a few keystrokes for you to delete those files.\u201d\n\nAt a House hearing Thursday, National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers said China and \u201cone or two\u201d other countries are able to shut down portions of the U.S. critical infrastructure with a cyberattack. Researchers and Rep. Rogers suspect Iran might be on that list.\n\n\u201cMy gosh, what if they actually hit one of our financial institutions and were able to take offline 30,000 computers and destroy and manipulate data in those networks?\u201d Rogers said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what keeps me up at night.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "House Intelligence chairman warns of attacks if nuclear talks fail.", "description": "House Intelligence chairman warns of attacks if nuclear talks fail.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "House Intelligence chairman warns of attacks if nuclear talks fail.", "title": "Fears grow of Iran cyber attack", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/225045-fears-grow-of-iran-cyber-attack", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/zarifjavad_kerryjohn_iran_071414getty_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-22T10:30:58-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-11-22T10:30-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/225045-fears-grow-of-iran-cyber-attack", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-22T07:51-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "cybersecurity, nuclear talks, Iran nuclear deal, Iran nuclear talks, Hacking,Michael Rogers,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-22T07:51:26-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-22T10:30:58-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/225045-fears-grow-of-iran-cyber-attack", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "House Intelligence chairman warns of attacks if nuclear talks fail.", "card": "summary", "title": "Fears grow of Iran cyber attack"}, "dcterms.title": "Fears grow of Iran cyber attack"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4144\"", "article_summary": "They just have not.\u201dWhile the U.S. is bombarded with cyber attacks, it has never been the subject of a large-scale destructive attack.\nResearchers describe Iran as a close fourth behind the U.S., Russia and China in terms of its ability to launch cyber attacks.\nStill, \u201cit shows how bolstered their program really is,\u201d said David Kennedy, CEO of information security company TrustedSec, which monitors cyber attacks.\nFalling worldwide oil prices would also make U.S. oil companies an attractive target, Alperovitch said.\nIran initially ramped up its cyber efforts in 2010, culminating with a barrage of simplistic attacks on the U.S. financial sector in 2012."}
