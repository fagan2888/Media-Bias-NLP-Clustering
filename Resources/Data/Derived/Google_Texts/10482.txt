The battle for funding is only going to get tougher once the U.S. Federal Reserve begins in earnest to taper its massive supply of cheap US dollars to the world's financial markets. Amid slowing regional economies, debt-fueled high asset prices and wild currency swings, banks are battening down the hatches for a rough ride.

Others are looking to buy their way to better funding prospects and into China's stronger economic growth. OCBC, Singapore's second-largest bank by assets, is in talks to spend about $5 billion on Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank, which has a loyal local deposit base and access to the growing off-shore renminbi market. A deal would also double OCBC's China branches to about 30.
