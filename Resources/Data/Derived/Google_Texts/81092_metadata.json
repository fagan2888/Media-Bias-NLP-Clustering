Conservative Crybabies can\u2019t be trending, because the \u201cconservative movement\u201d\u2014which is itself the fancy brand name created by the for-profit conservative media to describe the corporate-sponsored manipulation of economically aggrieved white citizens\u2014has spent decades cultivating a mindset that reframes its paranoid aggressions as legitimate and necessary forms of self-defense.\n\nConsider Donald Trump, the Capo di tutti capi of this scam. The moment some hapless pundit works up the nerve to confront the presumptive GOP nominee for president, he opens his gaping mouth-anus and excretes his go-to phrase: Politically Correct!\n\nYes, it\u2019s the mean old PC police who are the antagonists here, who are trying to silence innocent billionaires by raising moral questions about, for instance, his fascistic plan to register Muslims, or his eerily terroristic call to kill the families of alleged ISIS members, or his triumphant slandering of entire nationalities.\n\nThis rhetorical jujitsu has become such a habitual and unchallenged aspect of conservative agitprop that it\u2019s often hard to detect, even in plain sight. Think of it as the right wing\u2019s very own \u201cPC movement\u201d\u2014a relentless blaring Persecution Complex meant to drown out any facts deemed inconvenient to the narrative.\n\nYou will, for instance, remember the fake \u201cclimategate\u201d scandal, in which a bunch of renegade researchers were supposedly being frozen out because their data contradicted the scientific consensus on climate change. Only that story turned out to be total bullshit.\n\nAs did the whole notion of death panels, which the Obama administration was going to institute to rub out any conservative grannies who dared to oppose the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe conservative PC movement is what allows gun-toting madmen to see themselves as religious martyrs when they gun down human beings whose \u201ccrime\u201d is that they provide reproductive health services to poor women. At its extreme, it\u2019s what prompts men like Timothy McVeigh to perpetrate acts of mass murder in response to the \u201ctyranny\u201d of the U.S. Government.\n\nAnd the conservative PC movement is on full display right now, even as we speak, in the manufactured controversy over Facebook.\n\nA brief summary of the current silliness ensues:\n\nLast week, the tech site Gizmodo published a report in which a former Facebook employee\u2014who remained anonymous, conveniently\u2014alleged that the social networking site suppressed news stories from conservative media outlets in its Trending Topics section.\n\nThis allegation fit right into the narrative fostered by decades of conservative trolling: that the good old lamestream media is out to get white folks who believe in guns, God, and corporate tax loopholes.\n\nThe result was an immediate PC Red Alert, with Mandatory Grandstanding. Senator John Thune\u2014chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee\u2014took a break from his busy schedule of not confirming Supreme Court nominees or voting on any meaningful legislation to fire off a letter to Facebook Boss Mark Zuckerberg demanding answers, dammit! With publicity circus hearings to follow.\n\nMeanwhile, Zuckerberg went into a predictable corporate panic and immediately invited a bunch of Conservative Crybabies to a meeting, including Glenn Beck, who is apparently still alive, along with a senior Trump advisor.\n\nZuckerberg will no doubt plead forgiveness, while also, perhaps, serving these luminaries ecologically sourced Freedom Fries.\n\nWhy? Because Zuckerberg is the head of the largest media company in the world\u2014one that is pretty much an unregulated monopoly\u2014and he can ill-afford the perception that his website has a bias against conservative users, whom he prefers to think of as loyal customers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Facebook has a bias against propaganda.
