But when the combination includes Webbie + The Breakfast Club trio, consider an exception to the rule found. Piggybacking from his sit down with Boss Lady and DJ Steel yesterday, the topic of tossing salad arises again, only this time with a twist. Oprah is brought into equation, and despite the financial security of Mama Winfrey, Young Savage\u2019s stance on the subject remains true.\n\nMoving forward, the hilarity fails to ease up as Webbie reveals something horrible happened to him last night with \u201ctwo thick stallions,\u201d he has every episode of The Jeffersons and Good Times (possibly The Wayans Brothers, too), but has no interest whatsoever in Love & Hip-Hop-anything. Webbie\u2019s also huge fans of LeBron James and Baton Rouge native Glen Davis, yet admits he has not the first clue who Kim Kardashian or Kendrick Lamar are or what they do (despite soon saying he has no interest in a Kendrick/Drake beef because that\u2019s not \u201cbeef\u201d anyway).\n\nIn all honestly, I\u2019m running out of ways to say \u201cWebbie\u2019s interviews are great,\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the modern day version of a Renaissance painter (with words),\u201d \u201cWebbie For Attorney General\u201d or \u201cWebbie\u2019s wisdom can cure clinical depression.\u201d Someone\u2019s going to make a lot of money \u2013 or at least enough to pay off a few months of student loan payments \u2013 shooting a documentary about the life of Webbie. How can I be so sure of this? Simple. The man is still, for the most part, an untapped goldmine of information, comedy, life lessons and \u2013 you got it \u2013 quotes!\n\nOn Obamacare: Charlamagne: What you think about Obamacare? Webbie: I really don\u2019t think nobody care, man. Cause look, with this Obama thing, that was the first Black President. I know me and my people, we walked around, we screamed Obama, first Black President, whatever. I\u2019m ridin\u2019! Let\u2019s roll! Let\u2019s go! But damn they say you gon\u2019 either be rich or you gon\u2019 be poor. I got to pay more money for taxes and they say that\u2019s how the Obamacare work. I say, \u2018Damn, Obama, what we doin\u2019?\u2019 But I\u2019m still with it! I\u2019ll keep him in there. Straight up. Cause I\u2019m ridin\u2019 and when I ride, I ride to the wheels fall off.\n\nOn Michael Jackson: Webbie: Michael Jackson, man. Y\u2019all don\u2019t know nothing about Mike. If you don\u2019t like Mike, you crazy. If you don\u2019t love Mike, shoot yourself. Charlamagne: You think Michael was touching them little boys, man? Webbie: Yeah. Charlamagne: That don\u2019t make you love him no less? Webbie: I love him for what I know. I mean, he ain\u2019t touch me and he ain\u2019t touchin\u2019 none of my muthafuckin\u2019 kids. Get his ass killed! Oh, he already dead. I\u2019ll go to heaven and kill his his mothafuckin\u2019 ass! Fuck that! You know that\u2019s serious, man. But yeah, shout out to Janet Jackson, his whole family. I like Joe. Joe a pimp, boy. Joe a thug, man.\n\nSavage Life 4 in stores November 19, ladies and gentlemen. And don\u2019t you dare forget it.\n\nShare This Video Facebook Twitter EMAIL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Webbie's back for another interview.
