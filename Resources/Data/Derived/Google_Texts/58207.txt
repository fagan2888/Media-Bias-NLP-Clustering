In recent letters about the Affordable Care Act, a doctor listed with useful facts and information on how to enroll. It covered many of the benefits of this program, which offers affordable insurance coverage to millions, many of whom had pre-existing conditions and had been denied coverage.

Another letter, by a Tea Party member, gave Fox News talking points but little factual information, evidenced by the use of the words “train wreck.” It stated that President Obama and Harry Reid are at fault for the government shutdown because they will not compromise on defunding or delaying the health care law implementation, a plan she calls socialism.

The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. It was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court. Obama was re-elected on a platform that included implementation of the act. Had the Democrats not compromised, Americans would have a single-payer plan run by the government, aka Medicare for all.
