And, some prosecutors are also against another bill giving judges more discretion in handing out mandatory 10-20-Life sentences.\n\nListen to the story!\n\nLast year, a bipartisan bill died in the legislature, that would have made tweaks to Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground law. Included in the measure was changing the role of a prosecutor during a pre-trial hearing, when a self-defense claim is made.\n\nUsually, a person claiming self-defense must go before a judge to prove the claim is justified. Now, a new bill by Rep. Dennis Baxley (R-Ocala) shifts that burden onto the prosecutors. He also helped write Stand Your Ground 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cOne of my concerns too is that there were people pleading to lesser charges, simply because they can\u2019t take the risk with a 20-year possibility of jail time,\u201d said Baxley. \u201cSo, many people that were exercising self-defense wind up making pleadings, which they shouldn\u2019t be put in the corner.\u201d\n\nHis bill comes on the heels of a recent ruling by the Florida Supreme Court that states shifting the burden would require prosecutors to prove their case twice.\n\n\u201cI think we need to provide legislative clarity that we fully intend to stand with the person that\u2019s exercising self-defense, and that the burden of proof should be with the state attorney,\u201d added Baxley. \u201cYou know, in this country, you\u2019re innocent, until you\u2019re proven guilty, particularly when we have passed legislation to give you that presumption in your favor.\u201d\n\nBut, Gainesville State Attorney Bill Cervone disagrees. He represents the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association on a number of legislative issues.\n\n\u201cOur position on the law as it exists now is this has always been that this has always been an affirmative defense, which under law is something for the defense to raise and the Supreme Court recently ruled that, that was the proper interpretation of the statute, and we think that, that\u2019s the way it should be,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, National Rifle Association\u2019s Marion Hammer says she disagrees with the majority opinion, saying the current system wasn\u2019t always that way.\n\n\u201cFollowing passage of the Castle Doctrine Law, prosecutors and some judges created, without any legislative authority, a special Stand Your Ground hearing and reversed the burden of proof requiring an individual who has exercised lawful self-defense to prove before a judge that he or she was innocent. That flies in the face of our judicial system,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth Baxley and Hammer agree with the dissenting opinion by Justices Charles Canady and Ricky Polston. It states making someone prove the claim during the immunity hearing \u201ccurtails the benefit of the immunity from trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you just need to remember the dissenting opinion is the side that lost, and so, that\u2019s probably not the best approach to do legislation: \u2018Let\u2019s see what the loser said and follow it.\u2019 But, that would not be untypical of our government,\u201d said Tallahassee State Attorney Willie Meggs.\n\nMeggs, who's opposed to the Stand Your Ground law , is also an opponent of Baxley\u2019s bill. He\u2019s also against a bill by Rep. Neil Combee (R-Polk City) that gives judges discretion when it comes to handing out the mandatory 10-20-Life law.\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s a lot wrong with that bill,\u201d added Meggs. \u201cFirst off, if you have a mandatory 10-20-Life, that it\u2019s not mandatory, then that\u2019s kind of a contradiction in itself.\u201d\n\nCombee calls it the \u201cSelf-Defense Protection Act.\u201d He says it builds on the so-called \u201cWarning Shot\u201d bill he filed for the 2014 session seeking to address the unintended consequences of the 10-20-Life law. It\u2019s inspired by Marissa Alexander, a Jacksonville woman who received a 20-year prison sentence for firing a warning shot during an alleged domestic violence dispute with her husband.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately you get into situations where folks who are unwilling to accept plea deal or subject to the mandatory minimum: 20 years,\u201d said Combee. \u201cAnd, judges\u2014I would say\u2014have complained about not having any choice, but to impose that sentence. And, they\u2019re really not imposing it. It\u2019s imposed by statute right now.\u201d\n\nBut, Meggs says it\u2019s not needed, because prosecutors are already making decisions based on whether they want to depart from the 10-20-Life law because they\u2019ve investigated the case. He adds judges only have a partial view of an entire trial.\n\n\u201cFirst off, a judge, 1) cannot even sit on a case where a judge has gone out and interviewed the witnesses, gone out and interviewed the victim of the crime, gone out and done an investigation,\u201d said Meggs. \u201cSo, the person in the courtroom that has the least knowledge about the case to decide what to do on the sentence is the judge because they\u2019ve interviewed no one, if they interviewed anybody. Now, if the judge doesn\u2019t want to impose a sentence, move over to civil where they don\u2019t have to do the hard task of being a criminal judge.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Combee says he worked with Families Against Mandatory Minimums on this bill. And, while the bill wasn\u2019t brought forth by the NRA, Hammer says she intends to support it.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Some Florida lawmakers are hoping to revive an effort that could change the role of State Attorneys prosecuting a \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d case.
