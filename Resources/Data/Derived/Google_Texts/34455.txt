A Louisiana restaurant owner is offering a 10 percent discount to gun-toting customers, making the argument that the presence of more guns makes his establishment safer.

“As long as everybody has a gun, we’re all the same size,” Kevin Cox, owner of Bergeron’s Restaurant in Port Allen, told a local NBC affiliate.

Mr. Cox said the discount began with gun-carrying police officers, but then customers soon began to ask if they could also bring in their firearms. He said he was happy to oblige.

“I keep hearing so much about people banning guns,” Mr. Cox told the station. “Target’s banning guns and these people are banning guns. Don’t they realize that that’s where people with guns are going to go? I want to take the opposite approach. How can I make my place safer?”

He said he gives out about 15 to 20 discounts every day, adding, “If you have a gun on you, I’m going to give you a discount.”

Olivia Carambat said that she brought in her .38 Smith and Wesson to grab a bite and protect her Second Amendment rights.

“There’s so many people who are trying to take our guns away and the government makes stricter gun laws,” she told the NBC affiliate. “They forget that we really do, we’re given the right in the Constitution to keep and bear arms.”

“If somebody walked in here with a gun and wanted to hurt us, we’re not defenseless,” she added.

Mr. Cox said he feels safer with more guns in the restaurant.

“My friends and relatives would come in with their guns on their holster. I felt good about that,” he told a local CBS affiliate. “It made me feel safer that they were there with their gun, so why not include all good citizens with the officers too.”
