That\u2019s the purview of philosophy.\u201d\n\nThe drill goes like this: They boggle my mind with the ways they\u2019re beginning to be able to dissect and tweak the brain processes that underlie our moral selves, from decisions to judgments to feelings. (See Beyond Good And Evil: New Brain Science Casts Light On Morality In The Brain.) I eventually ask something like, \u201cBut if it\u2019s all the brain, if it\u2019s all biology, then what does that mean for free will? For moral responsibility? Blame for bad deeds? Credit for good?\u201d And they reply, a bit apologetically, \u201cThat\u2019s not a scientific question. It\u2019s a normative one. Try philosophy.\u201d\n\nSo I did. I reached Tufts University philosophy professor Daniel C. Dennett on an island off the coast of Maine. A seasoned veteran of the free-will debate \u2014 see his recent back-and-forth with \u201cFree Will\u201d author Sam Harris \u2014 he courteously interrupted his sailing and writing and ocean-gazing to field my frustrated questions. Our conversation, lightly edited:\n\nGiven that we now know \u2014 and can even perturb \u2014 some of the brain mechanisms of morality, and we see perhaps more clearly than ever that this is biological, what are the implications for blame, credit and free will to us, to everyday people?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s no news that your mind is your brain, and that every decision you make and every thought you have and every memory you recall is somehow lodged in your brain and involves brain activity. Up until now, we haven\u2019t been able to say much more than that. Now, it\u2019s getting to the point where we can. But it has almost no implications for morality and free will.\n\nWhy not?\n\nKnowing where somebody has a thought doesn\u2019t tell you anything about whether it\u2019s an evil thought, whether they shouldn\u2019t have thought it, whether they have their wits about them. You can\u2019t even tell much about whether they\u2019re sane or crazy from just looking at the activity of their brain. We can get some purchase on that, but not much.\n\nBut doesn\u2019t it give a whole new weight to the idea of \u2018Blame the brain, not me\u2019?\n\nSomebody wrote a book called \u2018My Brain Made Me Do It,\u2019 and I thought, \u2018What an outrageous title! Unless it\u2019s being ironic.\u2019 Of course my brain made me do it! What would you want, your stomach to make you do it?\n\nIf you said, \u2018My mind made me do it,\u2019 then people would say, \u2018Yes, right.\u2019 In other words, you\u2019re telling me you did this on purpose, you knew what you were doing. Well, if you do something on purpose and you know what you\u2019re doing and you did it for reasons good, bad or indifferent, then your brain made you do it, of course. It doesn\u2019t follow that you were not the author of that deed. Why? Because you are your embodied brain.\n\n\n\nYou see, what\u2019s hiding here, and it\u2019s hiding actually in plain sight, is the leftover dualism, the leftover Cartesianism of the 17th century: The idea that a person is an immaterial soul or ego or \u2018thinking thing,\u2019 as Descartes called it, that unless some act is caused by this pearl of specialness, then it isn\u2019t a deed. That\u2019s just preposterous and you don\u2019t need fancy neuroscience to learn that. There is no little homunculus in your brain who is you or your ego, and there is no little res cogitans, no soul in there that\u2019s pushing the buttons and deciding what to do next. The whole brain is involved in controlling your body, and if your brain makes you do it, that\u2019s just the way it should work.\n\nThe leftover dualism \u2014 I would imagine this comes from how things feel. It feels to us, we have this tremendous illusion that there is a homunculus or little controller in there.\n\nWe have been fooled, deluded, by our own experience, to some degree. It feels like we\u2019re sitting there in a little inner theater watching an inner show and deciding whether we like the show and deciding on the basis of what we see on the stage what we should do next. That\u2019s an illusion. There is no inner theater. There is no inner show. There are things that are rather like an inner show, things going on in the brain, but it\u2019s not in Technicolor or in Dualismcolor either.\n\nAnd people are shocked when they encounter this because they are used to the dualism idea \u2014 that you\u2019ve got the body and the mind, and the mind is distinct from the body and is made of entirely different stuff. But no, the mind is part of the body. It is the nervous system plus some other parts that play big roles by being a sounding board for the nervous system. So, embodied minds \u2014 that\u2019s what we are.\n\nI\u2019ve found myself saying to neuroscientists that I have this old Biblical idea of morality that must have been instilled in me during my childhood Bible classes. It portrays mortality as a battle between the angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other. And we as humans are supposed to use our higher selves to choose the good. They tend to say, \u2018There\u2019s only your brain.\u2019 But then I keep saying, \u2018But there\u2019s your more recent brain and there\u2019s your reptilian brain.\u2019 I grant you that many of us find the biblical view very outmoded, but what do we replace it with? Because it does feel like there are times when we can rise above and choose the better thing, and we should.\n\nYes, and actually philosophers have had a pretty good handle on this for a quite a while, long before brain science came along to reinvent the wheel. We give children, or we should give children, a sort of moral education. They learn from their elders what to do and why. This is acquired knowledge, or it\u2019s acquired behavioral tendencies \u2014 let\u2019s call it that and leave knowledge out of it. People learn how to be good and how to be bad, and they learn the difference. And this is all embodied in their brain one way or another.\n\nNow, it turns out that there\u2019s a lot of variation in how readily some people succumb to temptation. Some people almost always give in to temptation. They just have very little capacity to find that higher perspective from which you can say, \u2018Wait a minute, I really don\u2019t want to do this because if I get in the habit of doing this it will turn me into a bad person.\u2019 That\u2019s a perfectly real perspective, there\u2019s nothing mysterious about it, and it\u2019s embodied in your brain just the way everything else is embodied in your brain. But it\u2019s variable in its strength and cogency in individuals. That\u2019s why we have a moral education \u2014 to give people the sort of tools for thinking to make the right choices under difficult circumstances.\n\nBut then it does bring you back to the question of blame. Because if you just happen to have been born with a worse capacity to look at that longer term, then that\u2019s not fair. How can I blame you if you have succumbed to this weakness you were born with?\n\nFirst of all, although we are born with strengths and weaknesses, we can also change them or others can change them for us. Like Walter Mischel\u2019s famous marshmallow test. The bad news is that some kids just reach for that marshmallow \u2014 they have very little self-control. The good news is that there are non-invasive ways of educating and training kids so that they develop self-control. And so if the kid says, \u2018Well, I was born that way.\u2019 Well, why didn\u2019t you do something about it, why did your parents not do something about it?\n\nOf course, luck is always there. It\u2019s an imperfect world. We wouldn\u2019t really want it any other way. We do the best we can with what we\u2019ve got.\n\nSome people are, through no fault of their own, are simply not competent to be moral agents, so we put them in institutions, we take care of them, and we don\u2019t allow them to hold positions of responsibility. We sort of treat them like infants because they don\u2019t have the wherewithal. But the ones that do have the wherewithal do have the wherewithal \u2014 they have the power of reflection and self-control. And we can expect them to use it. We brace them up a little bit and say, \u2018Look, you want the freedom of the road, you want to be a citizen with all the rights and opportunities of citizenship? Then learn to behave yourself.\u2019 And it works.\n\nThere are always people who succumb. And then what should happen to them? First of all, we shouldn\u2019t be over-impressed with the fact that they\u2019re saying \u2018I can\u2019t help it, I was born this way.\u2019 Well, if that\u2019s really true, then we\u2019ll take away your rights of citizenship and put you in an institution, is that what you want? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nResearch has found that when people are exposed to neuroscience, they give criminals shorter prison sentences. Becoming familiar with brain biology, and the added questions it raises about free will, seems to make people interested somewhat less in retribution and more in pragmatic concerns like deterring crime and keeping the streets safer. Do you think that\u2019s a good thing?\n\nSome of it is at least pretty sound research, but I don\u2019t think it has the implications that some people want to draw from it. There is a move afoot in some scientific quarters to decide that the whole idea of punishment, or moral responsibility, has been disproven by science. It hasn\u2019t \u2014 not at all. Those are freshman-grade errors of reasoning. Responsibility is alive and well and will go on being alive and well.\n\nTom Wolfe, the novelist and commentator, has this wonderful line where he says: \u201cThe conclusion people out beyond the laboratory walls are drawing is:\u2026We\u2019re all hardwired\u2026 Don\u2019t blame me! I\u2019m wired wrong!\u201d Some people are wired wrong, but some people are wired right. The fact that we\u2019re wired doesn\u2019t show that we\u2019re wired wrong. This is something the neuroscientists have to come to grips with.\n\nSome people are indeed wired wrong and we treat them differently, whether they\u2019re insane, demented, developmentally challenged, psychopathic, or uncontrollably impulsive. We do identify people and we distinguish that they are not normal. They have deficits; they have problems that remove competence from them. Those people are wired wrong. But that doesn\u2019t meant everybody is wired wrong. That step from \u2018Well, those folks can\u2019t help it, but they have brains and we have brains, so I guess we can\u2019t help it either\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s just bad reasoning.\n\nThe question that neuroscience raises when it gives us more granular detail about cause and effect. This is a question that\u2019s already millennia old: How can there be free will if everything basically works on cause and effect? So now we have a new layer on that age-old argument, which is that we can see more about the actual workings of the brain. Do you see that adding anything or is it the same-old same-old?\n\n\n\nIn one sense, it\u2019s the same-old same-old. It doesn\u2019t show that we don\u2019t have free will, but it does show something interesting. And that is: An important element of free will, not often publicly and articulately or explicitly discussed, but an important one, is that we keep our thinking to ourselves. We want to have certain privacy about our thoughts, because if we wear our hearts on our sleeves all the time, then people will exploit that. They\u2019ll charge us too much for everything we buy. If they know too much about what we\u2019re thinking, if they can read our minds, then we are to some degree disabled as agents. There\u2019s a very important moral to this story that\u2019s not too hard to follow. If your head is in an fMRI machine, don\u2019t play rock-paper-scissors for money. That\u2019s about the only practical moral.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Philosopher Daniel C.
