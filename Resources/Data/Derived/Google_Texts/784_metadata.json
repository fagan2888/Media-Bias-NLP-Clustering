Right now Americans are angrier and more divided than I\u2019ve seen them since the 1960s. What fires this rage is that we\u2019ve become a post-Constitutional society,\" he said, according to The Washington Times \"Right now the prognosis is not good. We have an incompetent zealot taking the nation down the road of weakness and centralized governmental control of every aspect of our daily lives. Just as individuals snap when the pressure becomes too great, so, too, does a nation.\" The book, published Tuesday by Center Street/Hachette, is poised to become Savage's seventh New York Times bestseller, and has already rocketed to a No. 1 spot on Amazon a day after its release. Savage writes in the book that the \"Civil War\" he speaks of is not \"Not a war of bullets and blood\" but rather a \"possibly irreparable\" polarization of those on the political right and left.\"No one but 'We the People' can save the country we love,\" he warns, explaining that it is up to traditionally-minded Americans to stop a liberal agenda that aims to \"tilt the country's axis ever closer to socialism.\" MLive.com reported that Savage will be promoting his book throughout the month on his widely syndicated radio show, \"The Savage Nation,\" which airs weekdays from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Detroit's WJR 760 AM.The book's publisher has also released an excerpt of the book , seen below.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "michael savage, new, book, civil war", "pubdate": "2014-10-08T08:03:33", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Michael Savage's new book, \"Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth,\" is the prominent radio host's 30th, and warns of President Barack Obama's divisive effect on the nation.", "title": "Michael Savage's New Book Blames President Obama for 'Coming Civil War'", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/michael-savage-new-book-civil-war/2014/10/08/id/599321/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=6fa89098-0963-4ca4-a1a8-8c6277aa4a0f&SiteName=Newsmax", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/michael-savage-new-book-civil-war/2014/10/08/id/599321/", "description": "Michael Savage's new book, \"Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth,\" is the prominent radio host's 30th, and warns of President Barack Obama's divisive effect on the nation.", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Michael Savage's New Book Blames President Obama for 'Coming Civil War'"}, "epoch": 1412755413, "keywords": "michael savage, new, book, civil war", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "TheWire", "published_time": "2014-10-08T08:03:33"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/michael-savage-new-book-civil-war/2014/10/08/id/599321/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Michael Savage's new book,  Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth,  is the prominent radio host's 30th, and warns of President Barack Obama's divisive effect on the nation."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93e1\"", "article_summary": "Michael Savage's new book, \"Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth,\" is the prominent radio host's 30th, and warns of President Barack Obama's divisive effect on the nation.\nWhat fires this rage is that we\u2019ve become a post-Constitutional society,\" he said, according to The Washington Times \"Right now the prognosis is not good.\nThe book, published Tuesday by Center Street/Hachette, is poised to become Savage's seventh New York Times bestseller, and has already rocketed to a No.\nSavage writes in the book that the \"Civil War\" he speaks of is not \"Not a war of bullets and blood\" but rather a \"possibly irreparable\" polarization of those on the political right and left.\nRight now Americans are angrier and more divided than I\u2019ve seen them since the 1960s."}
