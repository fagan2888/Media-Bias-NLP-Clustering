Kit Bond was tapped by the Missouri Chamber of Commerce to get Medicaid expansion across the finish line.\n\nHe didn\u2019t succeed. Despite the attempts of several Republicans in the House and Senate to pass some form of expansion this year, Bond told St. Louis Public Radio on Monday that \u201cwe were just a few filibustering senators short of getting it done.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the former Republican lawmaker is giving up the fight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose $2 billion by not doing it this year,\u201d Bond said after the groundbreaking of an expansion to the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. \u201cBut we have no intention of quitting. Because this means too much to Missouri, and it means too much to the people who are losing health care.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government would pay the full cost of expanding Medicaid up to 138 percent of the poverty level \u2014 with the state gradually picking up the tab up to 10 percent. While Republican lawmakers have been opposed to expansion for various reasons, several GOP legislators floated proposals that would alter and expand the health care program.\n\nAmong other things, a plan floated by state Sen. Ryan Silvey, R-Kansas City, would have diverted money already being spent on Medicaid recipients to pay for the expansion when the federal match is reduced. The plan from Silvey \u2014 a former Bond aide \u2014 also would have encouraged Medicaid recipients to work and placed some patients into private insurance.\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. Kit Bond talks with St. Louis Public Radio reporter Jason Rosenbaum about his efforts to help pass Medicaid expansion.\n\nBond said that while Silvey tried hard to get people on board with his proposal, \u201cstill some people were hung up on saying no, despite the fact that I believe we proved that we could take care of all the pressing health-care needs in the Medicaid area.\u201d\n\nIndeed, nearly a half-dozen Republican senators in March threatened to kill any Medicaid expansion. And when Silvey tried to amend his proposal onto another bill late in the legislative session, he faced opposition from state Sen. Rob Schaaf, R-St. Joseph.\n\nDuring an exchange on the Senate floor, Schaaf told Silvey that \u201cif you\u2019re wanting to expand Medicaid, which is really your true intent here, then really I\u2019m just not that interested.\u201d While Silvey said he tried to incorporate some of Schaaf\u2019s ideas into his proposal, Schaaf responded there were \u201cso many important reforms that you did not put in that I would be very disappointed about.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy major problem with your bill is that you expand health welfare. You put more people on welfare,\u201d said Schaaf, who put forth legislation changing how new hospitals are approved and publicizing the prices of medical procedures. \u201cI think it\u2019s the wrong thing to do here. There are a lot of market-based reforms that would bring down the costs of health care.\u201d\n\nBond said the consequences for inaction would be stark. Not only will the state not get $2 billion to pay for the expansion, but he also added health-care providers would feel the ripple effect.\n\n\u201cHospitals are laying off people. Community health centers are shutting down,\u201d Bond said. \u201cThat means for people of lower incomes, the only place to get health care may be the emergency room \u2014 which is terribly costly and inefficient and not healthy for them.\u201d\n\nSome lawmakers who threatened to filibuster Medicaid expansion \u2014 such as state Sens. Brad Lager, R-Savannah, and John Lamping, R-Ladue \u2014 won\u2019t be returning to the Senate next year. Asked if Medicaid expansion will fare better because of that fact, Bond said: \u201cI hope it will. But the problem is there\u2019s going to be a lot of people without health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome national studies say more people will die because they won\u2019t have access to health care. It\u2019s a frightening prospect,\u201d Bond said. \"You don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s going to happen. We do know that Missouri is going to lose $2 billion. And there are a lot of people \u2014 needy people \u2014 who are not going to get health care. And I worked for my entire career to make sure that we had a good health-care safety net.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health, Science, Environment", "description": "Former U.S. Sen.
