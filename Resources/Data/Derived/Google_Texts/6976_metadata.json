The Chicago-based system and community-focused KishHealth System have signed a letter of intent to explore an affiliation.\n\nThis would be the second deal in less than a year for Northwestern. In September, Winfield-based Cadence Health became part of Northwestern, making it a four-hospital network.\n\n\u201cOur board of directors employed a thoughtful process that led them to conclude that Northwestern Memorial HealthCare would best enable KishHealth to build upon its already high standard of care,\u201d KishHealth CEO Kevin Poorten said in a statement. \u201cThe proposed alignment positions us to serve the future needs of our patients and community.\u201d\n\n\"KishHealth is recognized for their commitment to high-quality care and clinical excellence,\" Northwestern CEO Dean Harrison said in the statement. \"Together with the physicians and staff of KishHealth, we look forward to the opportunity to provide patients in DeKalb County and northern Illinois more convenient access to enhanced clinical innovation and breakthrough research as part of our integrated academic health system.\"\n\nDeKalb-based KishHealth, about 70 miles west of Northwestern, has two hospitals: Kishwaukee Hospital in DeKalb and Valley West Hospital in Sandwich. The health system also provides hospice, home health and behavioral health services, according to its website.\n\nNorthwestern had $2.4 billion in 2014 revenue, nearly 11 times more than KishHealth's $221.7 million, according to financial statements.\n\nWhile the two systems will take the next few months to define how they would affiliate, KishHealth likely would become part of Northwestern as Cadence did, Northwestern spokesman Chris King said.\n\nOBAMACARE CHANGES DROVE DECISION\n\nKing traced the ties between the health systems to the relationship between KishHealth and Cadence. Some Cadence physicians also practice at KishHealth facilities.\n\n\u201cAs Cadence merged with Northwestern, the opportunity presented itself again to continue down the path,\u201d King said.\n\nThe deal would give patients in DeKalb and northern Illinois access to the clinical innovation, research and physicians of an academic medical center, King said.\n\nMike Kokott, KishHealth assistant vice president of marketing and planning, said there was no \u201caha moment\u201d when KishHealth board members decided the system needed a partner. It was more of an evolution, particularly driven by federal health care reform and the need to coordinate patient care.\n\nUnder Obamacare, health systems and physicians are paid to keep patients healthy and away from expensive overnight stays and unnecessary procedures. Otherwise, they could take a financial hit to their bottom lines.\n\nWhile Cadence physicians already come to campus to provide cardiology services, and doctors at Maywood-based Loyola University Health System provide cancer care, Kokott said KishHealth was looking to fill gaps in services.\n\nAmong the biggest: patients typically must leave the community for specialty services that KishHealth doesn\u2019t have. And that doesn\u2019t bode well for preventing patients from slipping through the cracks.\n\n\u201cOnce a patient leaves our health system, once they get discharged from that academic medical center, they may or may not have that care switched back to their primary care physician,\u201d Kokott said.", "article_metadata": {"taxo_Industries": "Hospitals", "byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160527_00:54:37", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "published_at": "2015-5-28", "title": "Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, KishHealth System in talks to affiliate", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/150529800", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150528/NEWS03/150529800/AR/0/AR-150529800.jpg", "taxo_People": "Dean Harrison", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Chicago powerhouse Northwestern Memorial HealthCare is pursuing its second deal within a year, exploring an affiliation with much smaller KishHealth System in DeKalb.", "title": "Northwestern Memorial, KishHealth in talks to affiliate", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150528/NEWS03/150529800/northwestern-memorial-kishhealth-in-talks-to-affiliate", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150528/NEWS03/150529800/AR/0/AR-150529800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "summary": "Chicago powerhouse Northwestern Memorial HealthCare is pursuing its second deal within a year, exploring an affiliation with much smaller KishHealth System in DeKalb.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Northwestern Memorial HealthCare", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150528/NEWS03/150529800/AR/0/AR-150529800.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, KishHealth System in talks to affiliate"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "article_summary": "The Chicago-based system and community-focused KishHealth System have signed a letter of intent to explore an affiliation.\nThe health system also provides hospice, home health and behavioral health services, according to its website.\nIt was more of an evolution, particularly driven by federal health care reform and the need to coordinate patient care.\n\u201cOur board of directors employed a thoughtful process that led them to conclude that Northwestern Memorial HealthCare would best enable KishHealth to build upon its already high standard of care,\u201d KishHealth CEO Kevin Poorten said in a statement.\nIn September, Winfield-based Cadence Health became part of Northwestern, making it a four-hospital network."}
