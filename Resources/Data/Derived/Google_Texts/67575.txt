New discovery revealed that newly find the fossils gave a global group of paleontologists the chance to fill in giant gaps in their data about Spinosaurus, one of history’s giant dinosaurs and the result gave them a massive shock that this dinosaur was adapted to swim in rivers as well as walk on land.

Dr Ibrahim visited Morocco in 2008 for field tour, he able to find out an unusual blade-shaped bone in the custody of a local fossil hunter so he assumed it looked like the Spinosaurus’ distinctive spine. He found that it must create from the very same animal whose incomplete skeleton had come into the custody of an Italian museum, so he immediately returned to Morocco and started searching for the fossil hunter, when he met him again he started to find the rest of fossil in Morocco.

In Morocco Dr. Ibrahim and his group recovered a collection of fossils from a single Spinosaurus and all those parts were accurately matched to Stromer’s records and bits of fossils from different museums, ultimately giving a life-size version of Spinosaurus.

A latest reform of this aquatic huge specie identified as Spinosaurus, shows its skeleton only measured 9 meters longer than a than a Tyrannosaurus rex. In its previous days of 97 million years ago, it swam in rivers hunting with sharks, huge fish and crocodile-like creatures and It also traveled on solid ground and thus can lay claim to being the major predator ever to walk the earth.

Paul Sereno, one of the scientists who stated in this week’s Science, told journalists on Wednesday that it perhaps had huge arms, strong teeth and jaws with irregular hack-like claws, maybe it wouldn’t have been speedy move on land, but you would not want to encounter this animal.

The body structure of Spinosaurus shows the animal would have found it simple to swim, but extremely hard to walk, the nostrils were situated beyond back on the skull so the animal could breathe when part of its head was submerged and the limb parts, muscular thighs, short hind legs were more distinctive of the ancestors of modern whales.
