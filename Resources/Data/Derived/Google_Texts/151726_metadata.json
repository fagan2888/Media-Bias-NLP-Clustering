But in 2014, Democrats are in desperate need of help from four Southern states and the women running in them: Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky, Sen. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, Sen. Kay Hagan in North Carolina and charity CEO Michelle Nunn in Georgia.\n\n\n\nAll but Hagan are members of deeply rooted political families in their respective states, and Hagan has acquired that aura through her unassuming charm and prodigious fundraising.\n\n\n\nThe consensus of public polls has each of the four neck and neck in her race. The overall Senate math is complex and ever-changing, but Democrats probably need Hagan and Landrieu to hold onto their seats and either Grimes or Nunn to win.\n\n\n\n\"We're the ballgame,\" said Grimes adviser Jonathan Hurst.\n\n\n\nThat the Southern Quartet is even in the ballgame is remarkable.\n\n\n\nThe national political environment heading into the fall is bleak for Democrats, especially in the deep red and dark pink states.\n\n\n\nThe recovery from the Great Recession is tepid; international events seem to be spinning out of control; the Affordable Care Act is working but not popular; and President Barack Obama's job-approval number hovers around 40 percent -- historically a danger sign for a president's party.\n\n\n\nThat environment and the cyclical history of midterms lead the geek squad of algorithmic pundits to predict the GOP is likely to win the six seats it needs to take control of the Senate.\n\n\n\nThe four don't run as a group, even though they have gotten some combined attention in the past year. But the mere fact that the Southern Democratic women are hanging on is worth noting, and it leads party strategists to look for ways to boost grass-roots turnout -- especially among women -- to allow them to hang on though November.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have no choice but to try to get it done the hard way.\n\n\n\nWith ample campaign funds, Democrats not only are planning their largest TV campaign but are putting more emphasis than ever on social media, voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\n\n\n\"We're spending at least a third of our money on organization,\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said in a small briefing last week. \"I don't think that TV has the bang for its buck that it used to.\"\n\n\n\nReid is also using the floor of the Senate as a stage to highlight issues of special relevance to the party's base, and especially to women.\n\n\n\nFor example, Reid used his power to control the floor to try to get a vote on a bill to reverse the U.S. Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby contraception decision. The bill was filibustered, but Democrats were able to make their point.\n\n\n\nThe women's vote is so important that some of these senators have taken the risk of collateral political damage to target it. Grimes recently welcomed Elizabeth Warren to Kentucky, despite the Massachusetts senator's record of raising environmental concerns about reliance on coal.\n\n\n\nClose-to-home issues such as education, health care and pay equity are key, said Grimes pollster Mark Mellman.\n\n\n\n\"Women voters are of course central,\" he said, \"but those issues aren't just 'women's issues.' Pay equity is a concern for everyone, especially men and women in two-income families.\"\n\n\n\nThe four are navigating tricky territory, however, especially in the South, where the name \"Barack Obama\" is an epithet to some.\n\n\n\nThey avoid mentioning let alone praising the Affordable Care Act, even less so \"Obamacare,\" and tout the ways they have disagreed with it or tried to change it to suit local conditions.\n\n\n\nIn Kentucky, Grimes has left prideful talk about the program to the state's popular Democratic governor, Steve Beshear.\n\n\n\nThough Nunn and Grimes come from political families (the former's dad was a senator; the latter's was state party chairman), they have a double advantage: They are not incumbents and by definition they aren't part of an \"old boy network.\"\n\n\n\nAt a time of sulfurous disgust with Washington, the Congress and old-line establishments of all sorts, being a woman is an advantage.\n\n\n\nIn Louisiana, Landrieu has long since built a brand of conservative Democratic independence, thanks in part to the pro-business reign of her father when he was mayor of New Orleans.\n\n\n\nIn Kentucky, Democrats have had some success framing the race as a referendum on the ultimate GOP insider, Sen. Mitch McConnell.\n\n\n\n\"Team Mitch\" has yet to find a way to discombobulate Grimes, a young good ol' gal who rides horses, is handy with a rifle and is raising record amounts of money.\n\n\n\nMcConnell's handlers claim not to be worried, even as they plan to spend record amounts on what could be the most expensive Senate race ever. (Grimes is matching Mitch in the money department.)\n\n\n\nThey say they think Obama's deep unpopularity in the state (and that of \"Obamacare\"), coupled with the \"anti-coal\" environmental positions of D.C. Democrats, will be enough.\n\n\n\nMcConnell adviser Jesse Benton says he has numbers that show the Affordable Care Act is unpopular even with urban women in Louisville and elsewhere in Kentucky.\n\n\n\nWe shall see -- and that could be the ballgame.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- \"Southern women are different,\" says Garden &amp; Gun, the cheeky...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-07-21 06:30:23 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "WASHINGTON -- \"Southern women are different,\" says Garden &amp; Gun, the cheeky...", "title": "It's All About Southern Women In The 2014 Elections", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/20/southern-women-elections_n_5601185.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1919204/images/o-SENATEWOMEN-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- \"Southern women are different,\" says Garden &amp; Gun, the cheeky...", "title": "It's All About Southern Women In The 2014 Elections", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1919204/images/o-SENATEWOMEN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "howardfineman", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-20 06:30:23 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5601185", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "women politicians,Political Read,Southern women,Alison Lundergan Grimes,Senate races,michelle nunn,Mary Landrieu,2014 elections,kay hagan,female politicians", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "women politicians,Political Read,Southern women,Alison Lundergan Grimes,Senate races,michelle nunn,Mary Landrieu,2014 elections,kay hagan,female politicians", "published_time": "2014-07-20 06:30:23 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-07-20 06:59:03 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6ee3\"", "article_summary": "But the mere fact that the Southern Democratic women are hanging on is worth noting, and it leads party strategists to look for ways to boost grass-roots turnout -- especially among women -- to allow them to hang on though November.\nIn Kentucky, Democrats have had some success framing the race as a referendum on the ultimate GOP insider, Sen.
