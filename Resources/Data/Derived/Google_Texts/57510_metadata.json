The program allows students to write, edit and produce news stories.\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules to eliminate insurance subsidies for millions of Americans, mental health care in Florida would be especially hard hit.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFlorida has the most at stake in this case since it has more people receiving subsidies than any of the 34 states that depend on the federal exchange. Of about 6.4 million people affected, 1.3 million Floridians could potentially lose federal advocates subsidies, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe state ranks 49th in per capita spending on mental health care, which is about $37.28 per person. As such, a loss of subsidies would leave Florida\u2019s \u201cunderfunded system\u201d even more crippled, said Dr. Steven Ronik, chief executive officer for Henderson Behavioral Health in Hollywood, Florida.\n\nThis month, the high court is expected to decide whether the Affordable Care Act allows people who buy medical coverage from the federal exchange are eligible to receive subsidies. Mental health advocates say these subsidies have been crucial in making it possible for the mentally ill to afford health care. As a result, a loss of subsidies could have devastating health effects and strain the health care system, advocates and providers say.\n\n\u201cI think what's going to happen is most people \u2014 without the subsidies, they won\u2019t be able to afford insurance. They will become uninsured, and their options would be, if they get sick, to essentially go to an emergency room,\u201d Ronik said. \u201cSo it would be a terrible decision \u2026 because we\u2019re going to pay for it in other ways.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, Florida is stuck in political limbo over Medicaid expansion, which could potentially bring health coverage to about 800,000 Floridians.\n\nAnd though Florida legislators have introduced at least 22 bills in an effort to reform their state\u2019s mental health care this past legislative session, most of the measures went nowhere, including bills that would have improved coordination between state and mental health programs. Some of the efforts also sought to reform the way people with mental illness are dealt with in prisons, schools and other public institutions.\n\nOverall, the Affordable Care Act increases access to mental health care by requiring most insurance companies to offer coverage for mental health and substance abuse services with coverage being comparable to coverage for medical and surgical care. People with mental health issues have often struggled to afford care, advocates and providers say.\n\n\u201cThe affordability of mental health and addiction coverage has been one of the major barriers to people getting appropriate mental health and addiction services,\u201d said Mark Covall, president and CEO of the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems. \u201cSo obviously, any change that would make those insurance policies more expensive \u2014 or in many cases, unaffordable \u2014 that would be a major negative for people who have mental and addictive disorders.\u201d\n\nWhen people go without coverage and treatment, a mental illness can fester into psychotic episodes, suicidal and homicidal urges and can lead to incarceration, said Denise Marzullo, director of Mental Health America of Northeast Florida.\n\nEven though states form contracts with hospitals and clinics to provide funding for the uninsured, Florida\u2019s second-to-last-place funding for mental health treatment forces hospitals and clinics to reserve resources for people with the most serious conditions, Ronik added.\n\nIn addition, Florida law requires that patients be provided with 30 days of medication once discharged from a hospital or clinic. But if those patients don\u2019t have health insurance, they are not likely to continue treatment, Marzullo said.\n\nOne option for the uninsured is community-based mental health programs, but Marzullo said there aren\u2019t enough of these programs in Florida and there aren\u2019t enough psychiatrists participating in these organizations.\n\nUntreated mental health disorders can have a domino effect on other aspects of a patient\u2019s health and life, notes Jay Wolfson, a public health, medicine and pharmacy professor at the University of South Florida. Since mental and physical health are intimately connected, accessing mental health services can affect access to other care, such as treatment for diabetes or cardiovascular disease, Wolfson said.\n\nIn addition, untreated mental health disorders can lead to job loss, addiction and other hardships for families, Wolfson noted. \u201cMental health has a double-pronged effect.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The high court is expected to decide whether the Affordable Care Act allows people who buy medical coverage from the federal exchange are eligible to receive subsidies.", "title": "Mental health advocates: Loss of subsidies would take big toll in Florida", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/mental-health-advocates-warn-loss-of-subsidies-would-be-harmful-to-health-118885.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/11/150611_obamacare_ap_1160_pji.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Health Care", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The high court is expected to decide whether the Affordable Care Act allows people who buy medical coverage from the federal exchange are eligible to receive subsidies.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce07f\"", "article_summary": "Mental health advocates say these subsidies have been crucial in making it possible for the mentally ill to afford health care.\nPOLITICO JOURNALISM INSTITUTE Mental health advocates: Loss of subsidies would take big toll in FloridaThis story is part of the POLITICO Journalism Institute, a journalism training program offered to students by POLITICO.\nIf the Supreme Court rules to eliminate insurance subsidies for millions of Americans, mental health care in Florida would be especially hard hit.\nThe state ranks 49th in per capita spending on mental health care, which is about $37.28 per person.\nAs a result, a loss of subsidies could have devastating health effects and strain the health care system, advocates and providers say."}
