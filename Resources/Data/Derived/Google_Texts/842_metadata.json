Indeed, 34 percent of those interviewed for this study said they were \u201csomewhat worse off\u201d or \u201cmuch worse off\u201d financially than they had been five years earlier.\n\nMoreover, about one in four people said they had delayed a major purchase or expense because of economic concerns while 18 percent acknowledged having postponed a \u201cmajor life decision\u201d such as getting married or buying a home as a result of the recession.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s new \u201cReport on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households\u201d also found that many Americans were woefully unprepared for retirement while others have concluded that retirement just isn\u2019t in the cards for them for the foreseeable future.\n\nA startling 31 percent of non-retirees admitted they have absolutely no retirement savings or pension \u2013 and that includes 19 percent of people 55 to 64 years old who are nearing retirement.\n\n\u201cAmong those ages 55 to 64 who had not yet retired,\u201d the report said, \u201conly 18 percent planned to follow the traditional retirement model of working full time until a set date and then stop working altogether.\u201d About a quarter of the people in that group say they expect to keep working as long as possible, while 18 percent expected to retire and then work part-time.\n\nRelated: Gallup Finds Stunning Drop in Economic Confidence\n\nThe report also provides some insights to the impact of college debt \u2013 now totaling more than $1 trillion annually -- on average Americans. Nearly a quarter of the population holds some type of education debt, either for themselves, their spouses or children, according to the Fed study. The average amount of education debt was $27,840.\n\n\u201cSome households struggle to service this debt, with 18 percent of those with debt for their own education indicating that they were behind on payments for these loans or reporting that they had loans in collections,\u201d the Fed study said.\n\nThe new Fed study was designed to \u201ccapture a snapshot\u201d of the financial well-being of American households and the problems they face, according to its authors. It also attempts to gauge the country\u2019s recovery from the recession and identify \u201cperceived risks to their financial stability.\u201d\n\nRelated: July Jobs Disappoint as Unemployment Ticks Up to 6.2 Percent\n\n\n\nJosh Bivens, director of research and policy at the Economic Policy Institute, said, that public perception of the economy reflected in the report squares with his view that the economy \u201cis obviously better than during the absolute teeth of the Great Recession but is still not a normal economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an economy where people sort of reliably expect that they\u2019re going to see some real wage increases or household income increases any time in the near future,\u201d Bivens said in an interview Friday. \u201cMy view of the data is that we still have a very damaged economy, and I feel like that\u2019s coming through in this survey as well.\u201d\n\nThe survey was conducted for the Federal Reserve Board by GfK, an online consumer research firm, between Sept. 17 and Oct.4, 2013. A little more than 4,100 people completed the survey.\n\nThe release of the Fed study coincides with the findings of the Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll this week showing that Americans are feeling highly pessimistic about the economy and their families\u2019 futures. Despite the steady improvement in the job picture, 71 percent of adults think the country is on the \u201cwrong track\u201d and 76 percent of adults lack confidence that their children will enjoy a better life style than they have.\n\nAmong other findings of the Fed report:\n\nHomeowners have a generally positive outlook for their local housing market. A plurality of homeowners anticipates that house prices where they live will increase over the 12 months following the survey.\n\nMany complained of the lack of availability of credit. Thirty-one percent of those surveyed said they had applied for some kind of credit in the previous year, and about a third of them were turned down or granted less credit than they applied for. Moreover, 19 percent of respondents said they put off seeking credit because they assumed they would be turned down.\n\nMany reported that their savings had been depleted. \u201cAmong those who had savings prior to 2008, 57 percent reported using up some or all of their savings in the Great Recession and its aftermath,\u201d according to the report. And less than half said they could cover a hypothetical emergency expense of $400 without having to sell something or borrowing the amount.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s new survey of the economic well-being of Americans certainly put", "title": "Fed Study: One-Fourth of Americans \u201cJust Getting By\u201d Financially", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/08/Fed-Study-One-Fourth-Americans-Just-Getting-Financially", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222012_Piggy_Preserver_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/08/Fed-Study-One-Fourth-Americans-Just-Getting-Financially", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222012_Piggy_Preserver_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s new survey of the economic well-being of Americans certainly put", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The new Fed study was designed to \u201ccapture a snapshot\u201d of the financial well-being of American households and the problems they face, according to its authors.\nNearly a quarter of the population holds some type of education debt, either for themselves, their spouses or children, according to the Fed study.\nWhile many say they are \u201cdoing okay\u201d or \u201cliving comfortably,\u201d according to the Fed report, one fourth of Americans said they were \u201cjust getting by\u201d financially and another 13 percent said they were struggling to do so.\nThe release of the Fed study coincides with the findings of the Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll this week showing that Americans are feeling highly pessimistic about the economy and their families\u2019 futures.\nA startling 31 percent of non-retirees admitted they have absolutely no retirement savings or pension \u2013 and that includes 19 percent of people 55 to 64 years old who are nearing retirement."}
