This means physicians must deliver care that has been proven successful through widely accepted research. However, that same rigorous approach seems to be absent when it comes to most policies regulating the practice of medicine.In other words, evidence-based regulation is missing.And what\u2019s missing as well is physicians seated at the table when policy is determined. Why?\u201cOther people get paid to spend their time determining policy,\u201d says Joseph Valenti, MD, board member of the Physicians Foundation . \u201cWe do not. So, we are volunteering time for these things. And ultimately we\u2019re not always invited to the table.\u201dAbsent that presence, Valenti says the time and care spent on patients is suffering.Valenti says that physicians\u2019 primary objective each day is their relationship with patients. But the amount of regulatory requirements that must be addressed affects their ability to care for their patients.\u201cSo much time is being spent on things that are not patient care,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I call it evidence-based regulation. If we have to practice safe medicine\u2014and we do\u2014then I think whatever we\u2019re doing from here out has to benefit the patient and/or benefit the physician\u2019s ability to take care of the patient. And if it doesn\u2019t do that, then we don\u2019t need it.\u201dAs an example, Valenti points to ICD-10. He says that switching over to ICD-10 provides no tangible benefit to patients. Some electronic medical records, he says, are not programmed with the new codes that must then be downloaded. And if diagnoses and procedures are coded incorrectly, physicians will not be reimbursed.\u201cICD-10 sounds like a way to not pay us for the things we do,\u201d Valenti says. \u201cOtherwise, why would we need this? I mean, is calling something a different code changing the way I treat the patient? The answer is no.\u201dValenti says another problem is that the medical playing field is very uneven. Physicians have little power. And the entities that do have power donate so much \u201csoft money\u201d lobbyists whose power far outweighs that of the physician.\u201cThe real thing that is missing here is that the patients need to use their voices in order to be heard,\u201d Valenti says. \u201cBecause together, patients and physicians, I think, can change what\u2019s going on.\u201dHealthcare regulations, Valenti says, that are implemented minus physician voices can increase the cost of a medical practice doing business, as well as decreased reimbursement. For example, he says the American Medical Association pegs the cost of conducting pre-authorizations at between $2,000 and $3,000 annually for medical practices.\u201cThat\u2019s a huge amount of money,\u201d Valenti says. \u201cIf someone made a comprehensive list of all the [regulations] a doctor has to meet to see a patient, you would see that the actual relationship with the patient isn\u2019t what we do anymore.\u201dHe believes that, at least in part, is why there\u2019s a physician shortage. Physicians are retiring earlier because they\u2019re fed up.\u201cWe can\u2019t be efficient in the office any more because it takes more people to see the same number of patients.\u201dValenti says that while there\u2019s enormous frustration regarding reimbursement, regulations, and the expectation of physicians working harder, it all comes down to patient care. Because in the end, that\u2019s what physicians do.\u201cBut getting slapped in the face every time you try to do that is not exactly an encouraging motivator,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a motivator for young people to pursue private practice and become a primary care doctor. We\u2019re not creating incentives for smart people to become doctors. We\u2019re creating roadblocks.\u201dValenti says he wants to see physicians actively involved at all levels of healthcare regulation where patient care is concerned. But for real change to occur it will take more than involvement. It will require a level playing field that allows physicians to have the same voice as other players.To that end, the Physicians Foundation is actively involved on many fronts that can have a positive impact on patients, and physicians\u2019 ability to take care of their patients. That includes workforce issues, research and development. But the system, Valenti says, is eroding.\u201cI don\u2019t have every answer,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I do know that practicing physicians\u2019 voices need to be heard if we\u2019re going to have a system that works for patients. Because ultimately, when it comes to patient care, the buck stops with the physician.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More and more physicians are being called on to prove that their healthcare decisions are evidence-based.
