A native of Britain, Haines was working for a French aid organization in Syria last year when he was kidnapped.\n\nDavid Haines worked with ACTED to coordinate delivery of clean water, food and tents in a region near Syria\u2019s border with Turkey. He was staying with other aid workers near a town called Atmeh when he and an Italian colleague, Federico Motka, were kidnapped last year.\n\nThe 44-year-old Haines had a daughter, Bethany, with his high school sweetheart. He also had a four-year-old daughter from a second marriage. Family members say Haines only wanted to do good in the world, recently serving in a UN mission in the Balkans. He had also worked in Croatia for five years between 1999 and 2004 and was the head of Handicap International during its work in war-torn Libya. Haines \u201chelped whoever needed help, regardless of race, creed or religion,\u201d family members said.\n\nIn a statement after ISIS released the beheading video of David Haines, ACTED said it was \u201cdeeply shocked\u201d by the murder.\n\n\u201cDavid has been working as a humanitarian since 1999, helping victims of conflict in the Balkans, Africa and the Middle East. When he was taken hostage in March 2013, David was in Syria as part of ACTED\u2019s humanitarian effort in support of tens of thousands of people affected by the crisis,\u201d the organization said. \u201cA man\u2019s life should never be threatened on account of his humanitarian commitment.\u201d\n\nThe nearly two minute video clip of David Haines\u2019 beheading contained a message to the UK, blaming British Prime Minister David Cameron for joining forces with the United States.\n\n\u201cYou entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor Tony Blair did, following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who can\u2019t find the courage to say no to the Americans,\u201d said the masked executioner.\n\nWorld leaders are also decrying the beheading of David Haines, with Cameron calling it an \u201cact of pure evil.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Haines was beheaded by ISIS in a newly released video, a violent end to a life that had been spent trying to promote peace and help those hurt by wars", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "David Haines was beheaded by ISIS in a newly released video, a violent end to a life that had been spent trying to promote peace and help those hurt by wars", "title": "David Haines: Briton Beaheaded By ISIS Devoted Life To Helping War-Torn Countries", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1474062/david-haines-briton-beaheaded-by-isis-devoted-life-to-helping-war-torn-countries/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/r-DAVID-HAINES-huge.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-14T06:09:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-14T08:09:53+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/r-DAVID-HAINES-huge.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-09-14T06:09:54+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "david haines,david haines beheading,david haines murder,isis,isis beheading video,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/r-DAVID-HAINES-huge.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "David Haines was beheaded by ISIS in a newly released video, a violent end to a life that had been spent trying to promote peace and help those hurt by wars"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0aa\"", "article_summary": "David Haines worked with ACTED to coordinate delivery of clean water, food and tents in a region near Syria\u2019s border with Turkey.\nIn a statement after ISIS released the beheading video of David Haines, ACTED said it was \u201cdeeply shocked\u201d by the murder.\nWorld leaders are also decrying the beheading of David Haines, with Cameron calling it an \u201cact of pure evil.\u201d\nA native of Britain, Haines was working for a French aid organization in Syria last year when he was kidnapped.\nDavid Haines was beheaded by ISIS in a newly released video, a violent end to a life that had been spent trying to promote peace and help those hurt by wars."}
