This historic change will be very upsetting for a sizable minority but eruptions could be muted, for three reasons.\n\n* First, some who consider Bible-based tradition a make-or-break conscience matter have already quit the PC(USA).\n\n* Second, conservatives who remain risk loss of their properties if they leave.\n\n* Dissenting clergy and congregations are told they won\u2019t be forced to change their stand or conduct gay nuptials.\n\nBut Carmen LaBerge, president of the conservative Presbyterian Lay Committee, is wary. \u201cIf this is a genuine justice issue\u201d and the traditionalists are \u201cdiscriminatory hatemongers\u201d as liberals believe, she wonders how long the church can \u201climp along between two opinions\u2026. That\u2019s a lot of tension for an organization to endure for long.\u201d\n\nWhile Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and evangelical Protestantism are resolute in opposition, the PC(USA) becomes the second major U.S. Christian denomination to sanction same-sex marriages. In 2005 the United Church of Christ endorsed them for secular law and asked congregations to consider the same policy.\n\nThe Episcopal Church is expected to redefine marriage at its June 25 \u2013 July 3 convention. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America allows leeway and eventually may give gay marriage formal endorsement. However, the United Methodist Church has consistently upheld a conservative belief defined in the 1970s that\u2019s unlikely to change at next year\u2019s conference or beyond, though liberals persistently defy their church\u2019s teaching.\n\nFor the troubled PC(USA), will this decision finally conclude an anguishing debate and bring some healing?\n\nContinue reading \"How will its doctrinal shift on gay marriage affect the Presbyterian Church (USA)?\" by Richard Ostling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DUANE\u2019S QUESTION:\r\n\r\nWhat do you think will happen to the Presbyterian Church (USA) now that it \r\nhas voted to officially sanction gay marriage?\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGION GUY\u2019S ANSWER:\r\n\r\nMaybe not much.\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian Church (USA) announced March 17 that a nationwide \r\nreferendum among regional bodies (\u201cpresbyteries\u201d) has redefined marriage as \r\n\u201cbetween two people, traditionally a man and woman\u201d so same-sex couples can \r\nwed in church.
