Here is Donald Trump recently on \u2018Meet The Press\u2019 and he sounds like he is in your court. Let\u2019s watch.\u201d\n\n[clip starts]\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThey do some very good work, cervical cancer, lots of women\u2019s issue \u2014 women\u2019s health issues are taken care of\u2026.Planned Parenthood does a lot of good job \u2014 a really good job at a lot of different areas but not on abortion. So, I\u2019m not going to fund it if it\u2019s doing the abortion. I\u2019m not going to fund it. Now they say it\u2019s 3 percent and it\u2019s 4 percent, some people say it\u2019s 60 percent. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s 60 percent by the way, but, I think it\u2019s probably a much lower number. But Planned Parenthood does some very good work.\u201d\n\n[clip ends]\n\nRICHARDS: \u201cWell, this \u2014\u201c\n\nSIGN THE PLEDGE: I Pledge to Vote for a Pro-Life Candidate for President\n\nMITCHELL: \u201cSo, it\u2019s a mixed blessing I guess. But, your response?\u201d\n\nRICHARDS: \u201cWell, this is one thing I agree with Donald Trump on, is that Planned Parenthood does amazing work for 2 1/2 million patients every single year. I think the disturbing thing is that Donald Trump as well as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have said if they were president, they would end women\u2019s access to family planning, to cancer screening, to basic affordable health care as well as overturning the Affordable Care Act which is now covering family planning and other preventive care for for 55 million women. That\u2019s what\u2019s really at stake here. And so, I appreciate his kind words. We\u2019re very proud of our work, but I think women in this country and families and men are going to be very concerned about a president who wants to roll back access to affordable health care in America.\u201d\n\nTrump has pro-life voters in disagreement with each other about whether he is truly pro-life \u2014 as he calls for defunding Planned Parenthood on one hand while praising the abortion company on the other for it\u2019s \u201cgood works\u201d or good things.\u201d\n\nAfter his most recent comments saying , \u201cI have many, many friends who are women, who understand Planned Parenthood better than you or I will ever understood it,\u201d one MSNBC host said that may make Trump \u201cmore electable.\u201d\n\nTrump continues to claim that he opposes abortion and the abortion component of the Planned Parenthood abortion business and maintains he opposes federal taxpayer funding of the billion-dollar corporation.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood does a really good job at a lot of different areas. But not on abortion,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to fund it if it\u2019s doing the abortion. I am not going to fund it.\u201d\n\nThis past week, for the first time, Trump has specifically promised he would sign a bill as president to de-fund Planned Parenthood. Trump has repeatedly indicated he opposes Planned Parenthood funding but has always stopped short of committing to sign legislation to stop the flow of taxpayer funds to the nation\u2019s biggest abortion business.\n\nIn a new interview with David Brody of CBN, Trump made that promise. Although his promise will go a long way towards reassuring pro-life voters he would implement specific pro-life policy on abortion as president, Trump continued to praise Planned Parenthood \u2014 following up on his \u201cgood things\u201d and \u201cwonderful work\u201d comments that have turned off some pro-life voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump said he thinks the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case that ushered in an era of 48 million abortions was \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d Trump said he would appoint \u201cvery good judges\u201d who would ultimately \u201cchange it\u201d but he opposed Roe without specifically saying it should be overturned.\n\nIn the last presidential debate, Trump feuded with Ted Cruz over the issue of Planned Parenthood funding. Cruz made the claim that Trump was a long-time supporter of abortion. Even though Trump has changed his mind and become pro-life, Cruz maintains that Trump supports taxpayer funding of the nation\u2019s largest abortion business.\n\nAs far as Trump\u2019s comments on Planned Parenthood funding are concerned, Trump has fairly consistently said he opposes taxpayer funding but he\u2019s also made some remarks about the \u201cgood things\u201d Planned Parenthood does that have alarmed pro-life voters \u2014 as if any \u201cgood thing\u201d could make up for the fact that planned Parenthood kills 330,000 unborn babies a year in abortions and then sells their body parts for profit.\n\nHere are some of the headlines we\u2019ve carried at LifeNews.com in recent months that provide further details on what Trump has said regarding Planned Parenthood funding:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cecile Richards: I Appreciate Donald Trump's Kind Words About Planned Parenthood", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been taking criticism from pro-life voters for his repeated claims that the Planned Parenthood abortion busin", "title": "Cecile Richards: \u201cI Appreciate Donald Trump\u2019s Kind Words About Planned Parenthood\u201d", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2016/02/24/cecile-richards-i-appreciate-donald-trumps-kind-words-about-planned-parenthood/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cecilerichards55.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "cecile richards: i appreciate donald trump\\'s kind words about planned parenthood", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is one thing I agree with Donald Trump on,\u201d Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards said.\nIn the last presidential debate, Trump feuded with Ted Cruz over the issue of Planned Parenthood funding.\nBelow is the transcript and video of Richards\u2019 interview with MSNBC:MITCHELL: \u201cCecile, as the head of Planned Parenthood, you\u2019ve been through the mill with all of the controversy in the past couple of months.\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood does a really good job at a lot of different areas.\nHere are some of the headlines we\u2019ve carried at LifeNews.com in recent months that provide further details on what Trump has said regarding Planned Parenthood funding:"}
