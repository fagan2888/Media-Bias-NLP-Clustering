House Speaker John Boehner just can't stop talking about how horrible Obamacare is for the economy. That's even after jobs reports that regularly prove him wrong. In fact, look what happened by last fall:



The hospital sector has now gained more than 100,000 jobs in the past year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday. The last time the hospital sector gained this many jobs was in 2008, before the recession's effects really kicked in.

There's one sector of the economy that's doing really well, one that has a lot of professional, living-wage paying jobs. That's hospitals, where the news is very good this month.After five years of this, you'd think Boehner and his Republican pals could come up with some new talking points, but don't hold your breath. If they acknowledge that Obamacare has done anything at all good for the country, they'd have to come up with a plan for saving it from the Supreme Court. Clearly they are totally not capable of doing that.
