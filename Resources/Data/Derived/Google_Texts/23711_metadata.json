It was just one example of Trump attempting to mend fences, or at least establish contact, with his most determined detractors as he tries to consolidate support as the Republican presidential nominee.\u201d\n\n\n\nYork then shares a couple other such overtures Trump or his campaign made to former or current \u201cenemies.\u201d\n\n\n\nYork concludes, \u201cIt's not clear what long-term good the Trump peace initiative will do. Both sides have called each other a lot of names, and the #NeverTrump forces have invested a lot in opposing him. But it might lead to some interesting conversations.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs I\u2019ve written a number of times, this type of behavior has been very typical of Trump all throughout the campaign. He plays to win (which means playing dirty at times), deploying any number of tactics to not only bruise and weaken his opponents, but also keep his most ardent supporters motivated and aggressive.\n\n\n\nHe wins and then says nice things about his defeated and rendered hopeless opponents. It\u2019s like a gladiator remembering his foes with fondness for the gallant fight they put up before he finally ended the match by stabbing them through the heart.\n\n\n\nTrump is continuing the pattern now by asking for help from the same people he vanquished. What can I say, it\u2019s a smart strategy.\n\n\n\nI myself was impressed with the names Trump offered up as his top choices for Supreme Court vacancies, though I\u2019m not familiar with all the judges listed. He named people who weren\u2019t fans of his, too \u2013 which might actually help them get confirmed when the time comes.\n\n\n\nBut I also think Trump realizes he has a lot to gain by appeasing the concerns of conservatives while not really jeopardizing a whole lot in the process. A list of appointees for the Supreme Court is a low-risk venture. For most Americans, the concept of the Supreme Court is a bit mysterious. They generally don\u2019t see Justices in the media the way they do congressmen, senators and administration officials.\n\n\n\nJustices don\u2019t go to the microphones to explain themselves after a major case decision is announced. They aren\u2019t showcased on news talk shows. They aren\u2019t interviewed for news stories \u2013 at least about the individual case rulings. Federal judges of all levels have to be the most powerful people no one\u2019s ever heard of.\n\n\n\nAnd the Americans who can actually name all nine justices (well, eight now) are probably in the low single digits by percentage. Probably half the country couldn\u2019t name a single sitting Justice. Sad, but true.\n\n\n\nWhen average people think of the Supreme Court, they likely envision a bunch of white haired old men wearing black robes sitting around a big table with stacks of books discussing whether abortion should be legal or not\u2026and then flipping a coin to vote.\n\n\n\nPeople know nothing of the power the Court wields to steer the direction of American society, literally holding the ultimate say in whether laws such as Obamacare will dominate their lives for the next few decades; or whether their state would have the power to determine its own marriage laws; or whether a Christian baker or photographer should be forced against his will to service a same-sex wedding.\n\n\n\nThe fact is, the entire federal court system as well as federal administrative agencies, with their rule-making power, has incredible sway over all of our existences.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why this election matters. Donald Trump wants to win. He needs conservatives in order to beat Hillary. It\u2019s only natural he would reach out to people like #NeverTrump who have sworn oaths to never vote for him. If he can convince his most ardent skeptics to come around, he greatly increases his chances to win.\n\n\n\nJudging by the sound of it, they\u2019re still not convinced.\n\n\n\nJonah Goldberg writes in National Review, \u201cI honestly believe that a President Trump would do enormous, perhaps fatal, damage to the conservative movement as we know it. I also believe that without the conservative movement, this country is toast. But I further believe that Hillary Clinton would do obvious and enormous damage to the country. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not voting for either of them. That\u2019s why this election sucks.\u201d\n\n\n\nGoldberg essentially argues his single vote doesn\u2019t matter and he needs to stick to principle in order to do his job of writing for National Review.\n\n\n\nFair enough. I get the #NeverTrump position and I also understand Trump\u2019s late efforts to reach out to them. If he\u2019s smart, Trump will be sending hand-written notes to everyone who\u2019s opposed to him up until Election Day. He\u2019s got nothing to lose and everything to gain by doing so. If for nothing else, the news media will continue writing stories about his peace offerings. It makes him look good.\n\n\n\nBut this election is not just a matter of supporting Trump or the Republican Party. It\u2019s a matter of participation, at the very least. People who decide not to support Trump because they believe he\u2019s a loutish idiot without principles who will damage the conservative movement are also basically admitting that they\u2019re no longer participating.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re leaving the game to sit on the couch and watch reruns of \u2018I Love Lucy.\u2019 That\u2019s the easy way out.\n\n\n\nAnd their only purpose at this point is to try and convince more people not to participate. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise \u2013 or healthy.\n\n\n\nMany of us are unsure of what to do about the election this year. But what we shouldn\u2019t do is stop participating. Participation means staying informed and staying in the race and continually making demands of both candidates\u2026protecting our interests.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump owes a lot of us little notes of contrition. But when he does so, he deserves some credit for the deed.\n\n\n\nConservatives don\u2019t always know what we want, but we know what we don\u2019t want\n\n\n\nAnother consequential happening of last week was Mitt Romney\u2019s announcement that he was ending his search for a conservative third-party challenger to Trump and Clinton, ruling himself out of the candidate pool in the process.\n\n\n\nUpon reading the news, I thought \u2018this is the end\u2019 of the third-party talk.\n\n\n\nNot so fast. Respected conservative blogger Erick Erickson says Mitt Romney should re-open the search and focus on the 2012 Republican nominee as the White Knight candidate. Erickson wrote in The Resurgent, \u201cI opposed Romney in 2008 and 2012, but I think the time has come for Mitt Romney. I\u2019d gladly work for a Romney Presidency given the choices between Clinton and Trump\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even writing this. But seriously, Mitt Romney should run for President again and transcend party for the good of the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it either -- a conservative who is actually calling for a \u201cDraft Romney\u201d movement?\n\n\n\nErickson is no ideological fence-sitter and has been extremely critical of the GOP establishment in most cases. He\u2019s not a Republican honk by any means. But this is nuts, pure and simple. The 40-something percent of people who already support Trump would not be inclined to drop him for Romney. Ditto in spades for Clinton voters.\n\n\n\nSure, something like two-thirds of respondents in a poll said they\u2019d be open to a not-Trump/not-Clinton alternative. But if you start naming names on who that \u201creplacement\u201d would be, I\u2019d bet that total drops dramatically. I\u2019m guessing a healthy number of those disgruntled people are leftist Bernie Sanders supporters who would never, ever, consider Mitt Romney even over Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nMitt Romney had his chance. Conservatives supported him, by and large. While we don\u2019t always know what we want in a candidate, but we know what we don\u2019t want. Romney would be near the top of that list this year.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s poll numbers are rising because Republicans are accepting him\n\n\n\nWhile many conservatives remain skeptical of Donald Trump and are looking for more clues that he\u2019ll govern as a conservative, yet another sign that #NeverTrump\u2019s dreams of a third-party candidate are fading quickly is Trump\u2019s improving poll numbers.\n\n\n\nPractically speaking, they\u2019re going up because Republicans are begrudgingly accepting him.\n\n\n\nSteven Shepard of Politico reports, \u201cThe main reason for Trump\u2019s surge over the past few weeks? He is earning increasingly larger shares of the Republican vote \u2014 even as some prominent GOP leaders, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, haven\u2019t yet committed to supporting their party\u2019s apparent nominee. But rank-and-file Republican voters are lining up behind Trump in large numbers, closing the gap with Clinton\u2019s support among Democrats, which had been higher during earlier stages of the campaign.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe polls also show Clinton with a slight drop in support from Democrats, likely because of the protracted primary fight with Bernie Sanders. Common sense says most of those displeased Democrats will head back to Hillary once the party establishment has dumped Sanders along with the rest of the garbage from the Democrat convention.\n\n\n\nIn the end, it looks like a pretty traditional Democrat vs. Republican general election contest is taking shape after all. The question will be whether Trump can rally enough of his non-traditional voters to make up for the numbers gap that has existed between the parties in recent national elections.\n\n\n\nTrump is going to need those votes because he\u2019s already way behind Clinton in terms of the size of his campaign operation, too.\n\n\n\nKenneth P. Vogel and Isaac Arnsdorf of Politico report, \u201cAt the outset of the general election, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign looks like a well-oiled juggernaut next to Donald Trump\u2019s vastly smaller, self-funded operation, a POLITICO analysis of Federal Election Commission reports filed Friday found.\n\n\n\n\u201cThrough the end of last month, the period covered by the most recent FEC filings, Trump\u2019s campaign had spent less than a third as much Clinton\u2019s ($57 million to $182 million) and had assembled a staff about one-tenth the size of her (70 employees to 732), with a fraction as many offices (Trump last month paid $101,000 in rent vs. $328,000 for Clinton), the analysis found.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Trump has gotten by thus far on universal name recognition, cooperative news outlets, social media and the enthusiasm of his supporters. He was able to beat all his Republican opponents through the most unconventional campaign ever attempted.\n\n\n\nGood for him. But I also can\u2019t help but believe if Trump and the RNC are unable to quickly build a \u201ctraditional\u201d campaign for him for the general election, it will be extremely difficult to win against Clinton.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton \u201cmachine\u201d is real, folks.\n\n\n\nLack of campaign infrastructure could be the reason why potential conservative independents have stayed away from challenging Trump. Facts are facts \u2013 they\u2019d be starting out much further behind\u2026even Mitt Romney would have difficulty competing with Trump now that the party (even Lindsey Graham) is getting behind its nominee.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s improving poll numbers are encouraging for him, as is the fact Republicans are warming up to him. But it\u2019s clear he still needs a lot of help with the \u201crest\u201d of his campaign. Will he get it?\n\n\n\nTrump now top dog in the Real Clear Politics average\n\n\n\nFinally today, all of Donald Trump\u2019s good fortune of late has resulted in his first overall lead in the Real Clear Politics polling average.\n\n\n\nRebecca Savransky of The Hill reports, \u201cPresumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has overtaken Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in an average of head-to-head national polls, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls.\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump leads Clinton by 0.2 percentage points, 43.4 percent to 43.2 percent in the average, overtaking the Democratic front-runner for the first time in the average of polls.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf you want to see for yourself, here\u2019s the link.\n\n\n\nThe naysayers will keep insisting Trump will lose big in the fall. He still might. But it\u2019s becoming clear that Americans are at least taking a glimpse at The Donald and in comparison to Hillary Clinton, maybe he doesn\u2019t look so bad.\n\n\n\nExpect him to tout these new poll numbers quite a bit in the coming days and weeks.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "Presidential Horse Race 2016: Trump reaches out to #NeverTrump, but will they listen?"}}, "article_summary": "But I further believe that Hillary Clinton would do obvious and enormous damage to the country.\nBut it\u2019s becoming clear that Americans are at least taking a glimpse at The Donald and in comparison to Hillary Clinton, maybe he doesn\u2019t look so bad.\nByron York of the Washington Examiner reports, \u201cRecently the Trump campaign reached out to National Review, whose \u2018Against Trump\u2019 edition galvanized the #NeverTrump movement, seeking input in compiling a list of possible Supreme Court nominees.\nRebecca Savransky of The Hill reports, \u201cPresumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has overtaken Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in an average of head-to-head national polls, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls.\nI\u2019m guessing a healthy number of those disgruntled people are leftist Bernie Sanders supporters who would never, ever, consider Mitt Romney even over Hillary Clinton."}
