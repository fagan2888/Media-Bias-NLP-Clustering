Les Schissler, a six-time winner on the Professional Bowlers Association tour and a member of the U.S. Bowling Congress Hall of Fame, died Saturday in Brighton, the PBA said. He was 83.

Back when professional bowling was scored with a pencil and paper and balls were made of hard rubber, Brighton’s Schissler dominated the golden age of Colorado lanes — and really the Denver sports scene.

Before even the Broncos and Nuggets started taking up space in The Denver Post sports section, Schissler was a mainstay in ink. He won the 1967 U.S. Open in Miami (then called the All-Star Tournament) and, the same year, he bowled a 300 game at the USBC Classic team tournament — the first perfect game in a pro bowling team event.

“I could make adjustments to how and where I’d throw the ball,” Schissler told The Denver Post in 2010. “I heard from a lot of people that I was the most accurate bowler they had seen.”

Schissler was inducted into the USBC Hall of Fame in 1991.

Fellow hall of famer Carmen Salvino said of Schissler:

“If the (lane) condition ever called for bowling from the corner of the lane, he was unbeatable. He had one of the classic styles in the sport and was very accurate.”

Schissler, who served in the U.S. Navy, was born in Brighton and graduated from Brighton High. A cause of death was not immediately known. Funeral services are pending, according to the PBA.
