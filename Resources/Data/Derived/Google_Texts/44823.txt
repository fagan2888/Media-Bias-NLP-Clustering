Days after the head of the largest police union in the country issued a threat to filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, warning that “something is in the works” after the director dared to speak out against police brutality, Fox News Eric Bolling followed suit, reminding Tarantino that “everyone thinks they don’t need a cop until they do.”

Bolling, co-host of “The Five,” has repeatedly railed against Tarantino for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. Tarantino has recently come under conservative fire after speaking at an anti-police brutality protest last month.

“Remember the two guys who were executed over here in Brooklyn? In days after that, that protest. People, as Dana [Perino] points out, people look up to Quentin Tarantino,” Bolling asked during a recent show. “They look up to Hollywood actors and directors, and it feeds into that narrative. Cop violence is going up.”

On Thursday’s edition of “The Five,” Bolling, once again, had an opportunity to strike Tarantino, this time by praising another most unlikely Hollywood staple, South Park, for highlighting the dangers of criticizing the police. On Wednesday’s episode, the animated residents of South Park decide to oust cops in their town, otherwise known as “racist, trigger-happy assholes” but find themselves helplessly run amok without police protection.
