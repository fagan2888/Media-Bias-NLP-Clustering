Similar laws have already been passed in other states, so the ruling gives a green light for more. The ruling allows states to create obstacles that in effect deny voting rights to people of color, the elderly, youth and rural people the most \u2014 and to thousands of women in the process. It is a ruling that violates the 19th Amendment.\n\nSo it\u2019s hypocritical to commemorate Women\u2019s Equality Day when state and federal governments do not promote women\u2019s equality.\n\n\u2018Most misogynist U.S. governor\u2019\n\nTake the dirty deeds Texas Gov. Rick Perry has recently dealt women. Not only did Perry sign the Texas voting bill, but he vetoed a state bill mandating equal pay for women. (State bills, passed by 42 states, make it much less costly for women to bring discrimination suits in state court rather than in federal court.)\n\nThe Houston Chronicle revealed in early August that Perry had vetoed the bill after being lobbied by the Texas Retailers Association at the behest of million-dollar Macy\u2019s and Kroger Food stores. For that veto, Perry earns the title of \u201ccapitalist stooge.\u201d\n\nFor signing one of the most stringent anti-abortion laws in the nation, Perry wins the title of \u201cmost misogynist U.S. governor.\u201d The law will force 90 percent of abortion clinics in Texas \u2014 all but five out of 42 \u2014 to close because they do not meet totally irrelevant physical requirements as ambulatory health centers.\n\nThat means thousands of poor women, mostly those affected by the voting law, will also be denied many additional life-saving health care services provided at women\u2019s clinics. What adds luster to Perry\u2019s misogynist crown is that he has also refused to expand Medicaid coverage to people in Texas as mandated by Obamacare, denying thousands of needy women no-cost health care coverage.\n\nState governors in Wisconsin, North Carolina, Ohio and Colorado are runners up in the misogynist category, since they also signed laws limiting women\u2019s right to legal abortion. According to a Guttmacher report released July 8, states adopted 43 restrictions on access to abortion in the first half of 2013 \u2014 as many as enacted in all of 2012.\n\nOn June 18, the House of Representatives passed a bill (228-196) that would restrict abortions after 22 weeks on the unscientific supposition that a fetus feels pain at that point in its development. Since it is a direct challenge to the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, the bill will never be passed by the Senate. The impetus for it, as noted by many sources, was to \u201cenergize\u201d the Republicans\u2019 Tea Party base \u2014 as if limiting women\u2019s rights was an invigorating, kick-ass sport.\n\nWomen rising up\n\nThe fact that Sen. Wendy Davis conducted an 11-hour filibuster to try to stop the anti-abortion bill inspired a pro-choice upsurge lasting days at the Texas Capitol. Thousands of women, many wearing orange shirts, converged on Austin, with 1,200 signing up to testify at hearings against the bill on July 2. Meanwhile, 5,000 pro-choice protesters demonstrated outside. Their activism inspired women in states like Wisconsin and North Carolina to likewise defend their right to legal abortion.\n\nOne of the most far-reaching signs of an upsurge of women fighting for equality is their participation in the movement to end poverty-level wages in the fast-food industry. Strikes at places like McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and Wendy\u2019s have mushroomed from seven cities a month ago to about 60 cities on Aug. 29. And it\u2019s women, often single mothers, who are leading chants like \u201cWe can\u2019t survive on $7.25!\u201d Women are also demanding living wages and benefits at Walmart.\n\nTaking note of that and of the fact that women are now 49 percent of the workforce, with an increasing number being their families\u2019 primary breadwinners, the AFL-CIO, in preparation for its Los Angeles convention Sept. 8-12, held several sessions for women workers to discuss their most pressing issues. The list included things like good paying jobs for all; equal pay for equal work; paid family leave; and quality, free education, child care and health care with the full range of reproductive justice issues, including no discrimination against lesbians, transwomen and women with disabilities. These are topics the women\u2019s movement has demanded action on over the past 40 years.\n\nWhat\u2019s significant is that the organized labor movement appears, at long last, to be seriously listening to women. But it will take a long, hard, united fight to destroy capitalism, an economic system based on oppression and exploitation, before U.S. women can truly celebrate equality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The date of Aug. 26 was named Women\u2019s Equality Day in 1971 because that\u2019s the day in 1920 when women, after years of intense struggle, finally won the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.", "og": {"site_name": "Workers World", "description": "The date of Aug. 26 was named Women\u2019s Equality Day in 1971 because that\u2019s the day in 1920 when women, after years of intense struggle, finally won the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.", "title": "The struggle continues for women\u2019s equality", "url": "http://www.workers.org/2013/09/04/struggle-continues-womens-equality/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.workers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/fastfood_0912.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 666}, "updated_time": "2014-01-22T13:39:15+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The date of Aug. 26 was named Women\u2019s Equality Day in 1971 because that\u2019s the day in 1920 when women, after years of intense struggle, finally won the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
