Secret Service director Julia Pierson offered unsatisfactory explanations for the agency\u2019s Keystone Kops investigation of a 2011 incident in which several shots were fired at the White House, and the more recent debacle in which a man armed with a knife managed to scale the White House perimeter fence and make it all the way into the executive mansion. The committee members, meanwhile, took the opportunity to vent outrage, browbeat Pierson with diatribes masked as questions, and mug for the television cameras. All this was done in the name of \u201coversight.\u201d\n\nThe competition for who could make the grander spectacle of themselves was stiff. Rep. John Mica held up an ADT sign and suggested that the Secret Service buy some \u201cinexpensive vegetation\u201d to bolster White House security. Rep. Trey Gowdy cranked his volume knob all the way to eleven and then broke it off. But the winner has to be committee-chair-in-waiting Jason Chaffetz, who demanded to know why, when it comes to fence jumpers, the Secret Service doesn\u2019t use \u201coverwhelming force.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want it to be crystal clear. You make a run at the White House, we\u2019re going to take you down,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cI want overwhelming force. Would you disagree with me?\u201d The day before, Chaffetz blamed the Secret Service security failures on the desire to be \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d\n\nNo one disputes that, in the wake of all these incidents, the Secret Service either has to rethink its procedures or recommit itself to ensuring that existing security measures are properly enacted. The problems with Chaffetz\u2019s recommendation for using \u201coverwhelming force,\u201d however, are numerous.\n\nFirst, the level of physical protection surrounding the executive mansion already screams \u201coverwhelming force.\u201d Anyone who\u2019s been to the White House has likely paused to take note the heavy visible security presence. There are uniformed Secret Service agents everywhere, patrolling on foot or on bicycles and heavily armed. There are usually black armored SUVs stationed in the pedestrian-only promenades. There are guard stations, fences, concrete barriers, anti-vehicle obstacles, checkpoints \u2013 the security you can see sends the very clear message that there are places you cannot go.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the unseen security presence that everyone knows exists. There are sensors above and below ground to detect intruders, and snipers on the roof. If you\u2019re like me, when you stroll past the White House you can\u2019t shake the discomfiting sensation that someone could be peering at you through a scope and scrutinizing your movements.\n\nAll this to say that the Secret Service already does a pretty good job of communicating the fact that they are capable of inflicting physical violence upon you if you get out of line. So if someone jumps over the perimeter fence, chances are they\u2019re either mentally unstable or a very determined assailant and already are not deterred by that threat. And, quite often, the people who do intrude upon the White House grounds are suffering from some sort of mental illness. Omar Gonzalez, the man who made it through the front doors and into the East Room, apparently has post-traumatic stress disorder from his time in the military.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jason Chaffetz wants the Secret Service to use \"overwhelming force\" on White House intruders.
