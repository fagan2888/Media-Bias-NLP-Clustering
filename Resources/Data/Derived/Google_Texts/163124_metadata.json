This is not because they have any specific objections to them, but simply because they want to preserve the court's conservative majority even though they lost the election. Greg Sargent reports that this is such a sweeping position that Harry Reid no longer thinks there's any chance of brokering a compromise on the matter. The only option left, according to a senior leadership aide, is to go nuclear and do away with the filibuster entirely:\n\n\u201cReid has become personally invested in the idea that Dems have no choice other than to change the rules if the Senate is going to remain a viable and functioning institution,\u201d the aide says....Asked if Reid would drop the threat to go nuclear if Republicans green-lighted one or two of Obama\u2019s judicial nominations, the aide said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to fly.\u201d Reid has concluded Senate Republicans have no plausible way of retreating from the position they\u2019ve adopted in this latest Senate rules standoff, the aide says. Republicans have argued that in pushing nominations, Obama is \u201cpacking\u201d the court, and have insisted that Obama is trying to tilt the court\u2019s ideological balance in a Democratic direction \u2014 which is to say that the Republican objection isn\u2019t to the nominees Obama has chosen, but to the fact that he\u2019s trying to nominate anyone at all. Reid believes that, having defined their position this way, Republicans have no plausible route out of the standoff other than total capitulation on the core principle they have articulated, which would be a \u201cpretty dramatic reversal,\u201d the aide continues.\n\nBut does Reid have the votes? The New York Times reports that Republican obstruction has finally gotten so outrageous that even previously cautious Democrats are now supporting Reid's position:\n\nMr. Reid, of Nevada, has picked up crucial support from some of his more reluctant members recently. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the longest-serving member of the Senate today, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has endorsed putting limits on the filibuster despite his history of being protective of Senate institutions. The two senators from California, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, said separately on Tuesday that they were leaning toward a rules change. ....The stakes seem higher this time for many Democrats. Many of them strongly believe that if Mr. Obama is not able to appoint any judges to the court \u2014 Republicans have rejected four of the five nominees he has submitted \u2014 it will retain its conservative bent for decades. It is a crucially important court for any White House because it often decides cases that relate to administration or federal agency policies.\n\nAt various points over the past year, Republicans have refused to confirm any nominees to the NLRB so that it would lose its quorum and be unable to pass new rules; they have refused to confirm any chairman of the CFPB in order to prevent it from functioning at all; they have threatened to destroy America's credit unless Obamacare was defunded; and now they're refusing to confirm any nominees to the DC circuit court in order to preserve its conservative tilt. Reid eventually managed to cut deals on the NLRB, the CFPB, and Obamacare, but as Feinstein says, \"We left with a very good feeling there would be a new day. Well, the new day lasted maybe for a week.\"\n\nAdd all this up\u2014the NLRB, the CFPB, the debt ceiling extortion, and the DC court filibusters\u2014and it's now clear that Republicans have no intention of allowing Obama to govern normally. Instead, they have adopted a routine strategy of trying to nullify legislation they don't like via procedural abuse. As Sargent puts it:\n\nThe GOP position is not grounded in an objection to Obama\u2019s nominees or to the function of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; it\u2019s grounded in the argument that Obama should not have the power to make these appointments to the court at all. As Jonathan Chait argues, Republicans may not have even thought through the full implications of the position they\u2019ve adopted. But Dems have, and taking it to its logical conclusion, they believe Republicans have presented them with a simple choice: Either they change the rules, or they accept those limits on Obama\u2019s power. And that really leaves only one option.\n\nYep.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "It would stay for legislation, but be eliminated for judicial and executive branch nominations.", "title": "Democrats finally getting ready to kill the filibuster", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/democrats-finally-getting-ready-kill-filibuster", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_party_of_no.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Democrats finally getting ready to kill the filibuster", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/democrats-finally-getting-ready-kill-filibuster", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_party_of_no.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_party_of_no.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Congress,Supreme+Court", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4fe\"", "article_summary": "Republicans have now made clear that they're willing to filibuster all of President Obama's nominees to the DC circuit court.\nAs Sargent puts it:The GOP position is not grounded in an objection to Obama\u2019s nominees or to the function of the D.C.\nAs Jonathan Chait argues, Republicans may not have even thought through the full implications of the position they\u2019ve adopted.\nGreg Sargent reports that this is such a sweeping position that Harry Reid no longer thinks there's any chance of brokering a compromise on the matter.\nThe two senators from California, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, said separately on Tuesday that they were leaning toward a rules change."}
