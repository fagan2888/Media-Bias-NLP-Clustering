On days like this, they're everywhere, pulling together for breast cancer patients and survivors alike.\n\nNationwide, an estimated three million women live with breast cancer, and while the survival rate continues to climb, doctors are recommending a proactive approach.\n\nKathleen Fesler ran for the E Team to support her friend Jenn's mother.\n\n\"When we found out Jenn's mom had cancer, we wanted to be there for her,\" Fesler said.\n\nBreast cancer survivor Susie Winter has been in remission for a little over two years.\n\n\"They wanted to take every step possible to make sure that I was cancer-free,\" Winter said.\n\nEarly detection is key to winning the fight against breast cancer. That's why Avera is working to keep screenings convenient with their mobile imaging truck.\n\n\"You're able to find cancer far before you would ever be able to feel it,\" Avera Breast Center Quality Control Mammographer Jasele Brue said.\n\nAvera also has a Mobile Digital Mammography unit. The truck is helping their doctors to reach patients who might not otherwise stop at a clinic.\n\n\"We go to various businesses, libraries, fairs. It's just a yearly preventative screening test that every woman about age 40 should do,\" Brue said.\n\nFighting cancer can feel like a marathon, but not knowing how the race will end doesn't mean you shouldn't run.\n\nSaturday's race raised $400,000 for cancer care and research.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
