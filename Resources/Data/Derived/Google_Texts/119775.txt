Re "Misreading Pope Francis," Opinion, Sept. 29

While Pope Francis is clearly a force for good in the world, Charlotte Allen's analysis certainly is not.

She claims that we live in "degraded times," apparently because the number of religious people in the world continues to decline and hence the moral fiber of society does as well. Considering that most active military or civil conflict in the world today is fueled by religious fanaticism (or religion-based sectarianism), this strikes me as an absurd conclusion.

One of the great hopes for a future of world peace and prosperity is that organized religion will gradually wither away into a marginal and powerless position in civilization.

Congratulations to Allen. She got Francis exactly right. Hooray for her and him. Long may he reign.
