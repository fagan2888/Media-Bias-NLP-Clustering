This year, it also provided a starting gun for the nation\u2019s sprint to Election Day. Organizers said the crowd, which was spilling out of the shed 15-deep, was the biggest ever.\n\nMr. McConnell seized on the nationalization of their race, with each side attracting money from around the country, to slam Ms. Grimes as a favorite of Hollywood and Eastern elites, who \u201cmake fun of us at cocktail parties.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe also attacked the national news media assembled. \u201cObama and his liberal buddies coming to Kentucky is like foreign travel,\u201d he said, a line that drew a big cheer from his supporters, who occupied one half of the shed, opposite Ms. Grimes\u2019s supporters, like two sides of a wedding.\n\nMs. Grimes, who raised more money in the most recent quarter than any Senate candidate in the country, embraced the out-of-state attention, accusing Mr. McConnell of losing touch with Kentucky after 30 years in Washington.\n\n\u201cSenator, the women of Kentucky and nationally are here today to send you a message,\u201d she said.\n\nShe repeatedly emphasized her youth and gender, while portraying Mr. McConnell as, well, old and stuck in the past.\n\nHis approval ratings, she joked, were lower than her age, which is 35. His views of equal pay for women are from a bygone era, she charged.\n\n\u201cIf Mitch McConnell were a TV show, he\u2019d be \u2018Mad Men,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nMr. McConnell, 72, zeroed in on Ms. Grimes\u2019s lack of experience, comparing her brief political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as secretary of state in Kentucky to that of President Obama\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have any qualifications at all,\u201d he said. \u201cSound familiar?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time he got in trouble, and his inexperience became obvious,\u201d he added, \u201che called in Bill Clinton. Sound familiar?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Clinton plans to campaign for Ms. Grimes in the coming days.\n\nThat the race is close \u2014 polls show the candidates in a statistical tie \u2014 is perhaps surprising, given Kentucky\u2019s conservative tilt. Mr. Obama twice lost by landslides in Kentucky, and the state\u2019s other senator is Rand Paul, a hero to libertarians and Tea Party supporters.\n\n\u201cThe national image of Kentucky comes from the Congressional delegation, but the state is a lot different,\u201d Gov. Steven L. Beshear, a Democrat, said in an interview. \u201cWe are one of the most progressive states in the nation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKentucky early on embraced the Common Core education standards, and it is the only Southern state with its own health care exchange under Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law, championed by Mr. Beshear, which has brought health coverage to large numbers of the rural poor.\n\nMs. Grimes has shown no inclination to run as a liberal, though. She has dodged questions of whether she supports the Affordable Care Act, and was similarly evasive when asked recently if she supported Mr. Obama\u2019s request for funds to ease the border immigration crisis.\n\nBoth candidates are running essentially a one-note campaign.\n\nMs. Grimes\u2019s campaign has focused narrowly on the theme that Mr. McConnell has lost touch with Kentucky in his 30 years in Washington. \u201cOne of us represents the past, one of us represents the future,\u201d Ms. Grimes shouted, pointing a finger behind her at Mr. McConnell.\n\nThe senator is running an equally narrow and safe campaign. He is doing his best to join Ms. Grimes to the hip of the unpopular president. His supporters in the boisterous crowd twirled signs with Mr. Obama\u2019s face on one side and Ms. Grimes\u2019s on the other. Others wore masks of Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader.\n\nThat message was driven home by Mr. Paul, who spoke on the Fancy Farm stage immediately after Mr. McConnell. Setting aside for the day the issues he has advanced as he moves toward a 2016 presidential run, Mr. Paul echoed the McConnell campaign\u2019s talking points \u2014 delivered in the spirit of the day in the form of a verse. \u201cGrimes\u2019s real pledge is for Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cHer first vote is for Reid. As for Kentucky, it\u2019s too bad indeed.\u201d\n\nBoth campaigns tried to claim they would be better supporters of coal, an issue with deep cultural power in Kentucky, even as the industry diminishes in economic impact.\n\n\u201cEnvironmental extremists who are trying to kill Kentucky jobs are bankrolling the Grimes campaign,\u201d Mr. Paul said. Ms. Grimes, who has denounced Mr. Obama\u2019s effort to cut greenhouse gases from coal plants, announced on Saturday her endorsement by the United Mine Workers of America.\n\nMr. McConnell had the sharper zingers, arguably because he had better material, using recent stumbles by Ms. Grimes, including misidentifying Israel\u2019s Iron Dome missile shield as a defense against Gaza tunnel-diggers. \u201cThis week she came up with her own plan to keep folks from streaming into our country: missile defense,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.\n\nBut Ms. Grimes arguably gave the stronger speech, one of the best of her race so far. She was steely voiced and composed, rousing supporters with a rising refrain of \u201cMitch McConnell doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt one point Mr. McConnell, a master of the political attack, looked on, agape.", "article_metadata": {"ad-sponsor": "Elections, Senate", "tone": "news", "ptime": 20140802204635, "twitter": {"description": "A day after Congress ingloriously left Washington for summer break, members shifted to their real focus this year: the midterm elections.", "creator": "tripgabriel", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/us/politics/senate-rivals-exchange-barbs-at-kentucky-picnic.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003036134"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Senate Rivals Exchange Barbs at Kentucky Picnic", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/us/FANCYFARM1/FANCYFARM1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/us/politics/senate-rivals-exchange-barbs-at-kentucky-picnic.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003036134", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/us/politics/senate-rivals-exchange-barbs-at-kentucky-picnic.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 2, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Kentucky,McConnell  Mitch,Grimes  Alison Lundergan,Elections  Senate,Midterm Elections (2014),Elections  Senate", "description": "A day after Congress ingloriously left Washington for summer break, members shifted to their real focus this year: the midterm elections.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Trip Gabriel", "SCG": "politics", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "per": "Grimes, Alison Lundergan", "slug": "03fancyfarm", "byl": "By TRIP GABRIEL", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A day after Congress ingloriously left Washington for summer break, members shifted to their real focus this year: the midterm elections.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/us/FANCYFARM1/FANCYFARM1-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Kentucky", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 2, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/trip_gabriel/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-08-10", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Midterm Elections (2014)", "published": "2014-08-02", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Kentucky", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140810000021, "hdl_p": "Senate Rivals Exchange Barbs at Kentucky Picnic", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/us/politics/senate-rivals-exchange-barbs-at-kentucky-picnic.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/us/FANCYFARM1/FANCYFARM1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A day after Congress ingloriously left Washington for summer break, members shifted to their real focus this year: the midterm elections.", "title": "Senate Rivals Exchange Barbs at Kentucky Picnic"}, "pdate": 20140802, "des": "Midterm Elections (2014)", "articleid": 100000003036134, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Senate Rivals Exchange Barbs at Kentucky Picnic", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/us/FANCYFARM1/FANCYFARM1-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2ef\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEnvironmental extremists who are trying to kill Kentucky jobs are bankrolling the Grimes campaign,\u201d Mr. Paul said.\nShe repeatedly emphasized her youth and gender, while portraying Mr. McConnell as, well, old and stuck in the past.\nThat message was driven home by Mr. Paul, who spoke on the Fancy Farm stage immediately after Mr. McConnell.\n\u201cThis week she came up with her own plan to keep folks from streaming into our country: missile defense,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.\nMs. Grimes\u2019s campaign has focused narrowly on the theme that Mr. McConnell has lost touch with Kentucky in his 30 years in Washington."}
