Some readers of The Oakland Press agreed with the report\u0092s findings that in many areas, the state doesn\u0092t stack up.\n\nReader Matt Towers said, \u0093The services and the roads are among the worst in the country.\u0094\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGayle Smith Barton added: \u0093If my grandchildren weren\u0092t here I\u0092d be out if this state in a minute. Roads, services, you name it.\u0094\n\nAccording to WalletHub spokeswoman Jill Gonzalez, a large reason for the state\u0092s poor ranking is the high rate of taxes in general, which are higher than many other states.\n\n\u0093People are paying 22 percent above the national average for taxes, which equates to about $6,900 annually,\u0094 Gonzalez said.\n\n\u0093Property taxes definitely hit Michigan the hardest, and there\u0092s also a vehicle property tax, which 23 states don\u0092t have.\u0094\n\nOne area the study said Michigan could improve on is an issue that has been on voters\u0092 minds for some time \u0097 infrastructure.\n\n\u0093We see infrastructure every day,\u0094 said Gonzalez. \u0093We can always say our roads don\u0092t look good. ... According to the National Transportation Research Group, in Michigan, 41 percent of our roads are in poor condition.\n\n\u0093Only California has more roads in bad shape.\u0094\n\nGonzalez added the study notes that 28 percent of the state\u0092s bridges were deemed deficient.\n\nState officials are trying to address part of the infrastructure issue with a May 5 ballot question asking voters whether to pass an increase in state sales taxes from 6 percent to 7 percent and boost road funding by $1.2 billion.\n\nResidents, local officials and state legislators have been vocal about the proposal, Proposal 1, since the deal was reached between Gov. Rick Snyder and legislators ahead of the governor\u0092s State of the State speech.\n\nThe WalletHub study also used 22 metrics to compare the quality and efficiency of state government services across six distinct categories: Infrastructure, Education, Health, Safety, Economy and Pollution. The report looked at different rates at which citizens are taxed in each state.\n\nAccording to WalletHub, Michigan ranks:\n\n\u0095 46th in Overall Return on Investment (ROI)\n\n\u0095 45th in Tax Rate\n\n\u0095 46th in Infrastructure\n\n\u0095 33rd in Education\n\n\u0095 47th in Health\n\n\u0095 26th in Safety\n\n\u0095 39th in Economy\n\n\u0095 11th in Pollution\n\nKathy Walker, owner of Liberty Tax Service in Waterford, said this year, there have been mixed emotions among taxpayers filing their returns.\n\n\u0093The biggest issue I\u0092ve seen is with those who have seen penalties related to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare,\u0094 said Walker, a Waterford resident.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s been a hard pill for them to swallow that their refund went down because they have to pay a penalty for not having health care insurance ... but we\u0092ve been diligent in trying to eliminate or reduce the penalties.\u0094\n\nWalker said she hasn\u0092t seen many making the connection with services from the state compared to how much in taxes they\u0092re paying. However, she has seen some dissatisfaction regarding the pension tax law, which now requires some retirees to pay a state income tax on their pensions.\n\nPeople have been happy to see the \u0093waver\u0094 smiling at passing cars along Dixie Highway, where her business is located, she said.\n\n\u0093I think people are just happy to get their taxes done.\u0094\n\nGonzalez said that while the state ranked low in some tax areas, Michigan\u0092s sales and excise taxes ranked 11th \u0097 likely due to the fact that groceries are excluded from the sales tax, she said.\n\nAbout 23 percent of the state\u0092s revenue comes from the sales and excise tax, more than 25 percent comes from property taxes, and about 14.5 percent is derived from income taxes, added Gonzalez. The rest of Michigan\u0092s revenue comes from total non-tax sources.\n\nMichigan ranked low in the study\u0092s health category, which looked at out-of-pocket medical expenses, number of state and local hospitals per 1,000 residents, average life expectancy, infant mortality rate per 1,000 births, and average health insurance premiums.\n\nWhile Michigan\u0092s public hospital system made the top 20, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the infant mortality rate ranked 42nd, with four to nine per 1,000 births.\n\nThe average out-of-pocket expenses for Michigan residents total about $1,800 per household annually, as well, according to the group Families USA.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Oakland County news, MI news, US news, world news.", "title": "Study: Michigan among the bottom 5 states for taxpayer return on investment", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailytribune.com/article/DT/20150414/NEWS/150419784", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailytribune.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DT/20150414/NEWS/150419784/AR/0/AR-150419784.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "932px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Study: Michigan among the bottom 5 states for taxpayer return on investment"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailytribune.com", "description": "Michigan residents filing their taxes have higher-than-average tax rates, vehicle property taxes and other factors to thank for a ranking among the lowest states for taxpayer return on investment, ac", "title": "Study: Michigan among the bottom 5 states for taxpayer return on investment", "url": "http://www.dailytribune.com/article/DT/20150414/NEWS/150419784", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailytribune.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DT/20150414/NEWS/150419784/AR/0/AR-150419784.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@dailytrib", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id571776405", "iphone": "id520219522", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.dailytribune"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "News, Oakland County news, MI news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Michigan residents filing their taxes have higher-than-average tax rates, vehicle property taxes and other factors to thank for a ranking among the lowest states for taxpayer return on investment, ac"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce794\"", "article_summary": "The study, released by Wallet Hub, shows Michigan ranking 46th in the in-depth look at the states with 2015\u0092s Best and Worst Taxpayer Return on Investment.\nMichigan residents filing their taxes have higher-than-average tax rates, vehicle property taxes and other factors to thank for a ranking among the lowest states for taxpayer return on investment, according to a recent study.\nFAQs Visit www.irs.gov/filing for answers to most tax filing and preparation questions, and <URL destination=\"http://www.irs.gov/Refunds/Tax-Season-Refund-Frequently-Asked-Questions\">irs.gov/Refunds/Tax-Season-Refund-Frequently-Asked-Questions </URL> for information about tax refunds.\nYou can get an extension of time to file your taxes, according to the IRS.\nThat doesn\u0092t sit well with many who are preparing their taxes on or before April 15, the IRS tax filing deadline."}
