By contrast, most countries have seen considerable decreases, including many in east Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe researchers estimated that 18.5 mothers died for every 100,000 births in the U.S. in 2013, a total of almost 800 deaths. This compares to 7.2 in 1987.\n\nAs a result, the U.S. now ranks 60 for maternal deaths on a list of 180 countries, down markedly from its rank of 22 in 1990. China, by contrast, is up to number 57.\n\nWhy Are So Many Women Dying In Childbirth?\n\nAccording to Priya Agrawal, obstetrician and director of Merck for Mothers, there are three leading causes of maternal death in the U.S.: heavy bleeding after giving birth, high blood pressure during pregnancy, or preeclempsia and complications arising from pre-existing health conditions.\n\nI know from personal experience about preeclempsia: my niece in the U.K. has an excellent doctor, who detected preeclempsia when she was six months pregnant and rushed Catharine into hospital. She gave birth two days later, and baby Eliza weighed in at just under three pounds. The alternative, waiting longer to give birth, would almost certainly have meant that neither mother nor baby would have survived. The next few months were hard, but both Catharine and her child are doing well now, four years later.\n\nFor the third cause of maternal death, pre-existing health conditions, Agrawal explains that women getting pregnant are increasingly less healthy. \u201cThis year, one in five women [in the US] who become pregnant are obese,\u201d said Agrawal at this year\u2019s Women in the World conference. \u201cThen there\u2019s diabetes and hypertension.\u201d\n\nNot only are women in poorer health when they get pregnant, but then they fail to get proper care. Obesity, hypertension, diabetes and heart disease are all increasingly common among pregnant American women, and each of them makes delivery more dangerous.\n\nAfrican-American Women Four Times More Likely To Die Than White Women\n\nHowever, the picture is uneven across the U.S., and the risk varies dramatically by race. In some parts of the country, African-American women are nearly four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women. Poor women are less likely to have access to proper health care, including contraception and prenatal care; African-Americans are more than twice as likely as their non-black peers to live below the poverty line.\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Danielle Paquette explained:\n\n\u201cExperts I have spoken to tell me that certain parts of the country there is \u2014 there are gaps in health insurance coverage, especially in the South. For example, Mississippi has one of the highest maternal mortality rates, that the state did not expand Medicaid.\n\nThere\u2019s something like 100,000 people who don\u2019t have access to any healthcare. And many of them are women. We have in Mississippi 160 doctors for every 100,000 residents. That drives part of this problem.\u201d\n\nCan Obamacare make a difference? By widening access to health care, let\u2019s hope that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will begin to force a change in these shocking statistics.\n\nIn the 31 states plus Washington, D.C., that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, poorer women will have access to medical care. This ensures that they are in better shape when they become pregnant and have access to frequent check-ups during and after their pregnancies.\n\nIt\u2019s not true that all women in the U.S. run a higher risk of maternal mortality than other industrialized countries. Poor women, and especially African-Americans, are the ones at the greatest risk.\n\nThis is yet another sign of our unequal society, and one that needs to change.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. is the only advanced economy in the world with a rising maternal mortality rate.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3150/3149038.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "women,childbirth,pregnancy,maternal mortality,preecempsia,hemorraging,poor diet,obesity,prenatal care,aftercare,poverty,mississippi,", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb111\"", "article_summary": "In some parts of the country, African-American women are nearly four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women.\nA woman giving birth in the U.S. is now twice as likely to die as a woman in Saudi Arabia, and three times more likely to die than a woman giving birth in the U.K.\nIt\u2019s not true that all women in the U.S. run a higher risk of maternal mortality than other industrialized countries.\nThe U.S. is the only advanced economy in the world with a rising maternal mortality rate.\nAfrican-American Women Four Times More Likely To Die Than White WomenHowever, the picture is uneven across the U.S., and the risk varies dramatically by race."}
