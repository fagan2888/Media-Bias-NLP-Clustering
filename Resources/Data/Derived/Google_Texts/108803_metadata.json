It\u2019s just a shame we can\u2019t change the locks while they\u2019re gone.\n\nAccording to Gallup, based on a poll conducted Aug. 5-9:\n\nNow on August recess, members of Congress returning to their districts may receive a skeptical reception from constituents, as 14% of U.S. adults approve of the job Congress is doing, down slightly from 17% in July.\n\nRasmussen, the poll of choice for Republicans, agrees, though it puts congressional approval even lower, at just 13 percent as of July 9.\n\nIt needs to be pointed out that Congress began to year in January with a 16 percent approval rating. You would have thought there was no place to go but up, when you\u2019re just north of public approval of the Bubonic Plague, but no\u2026\n\nGallup points out that even though,\n\nCongressional leaders can point to a slightly more productive session than was true for the previous two Congresses, such as passing \u201cfast-track authority\u201d \u2014 which grants the president enhanced authority to negotiate free-trade agreements \u2014 as well as the USA Freedom Act, which significantly revised some provisions of the Patriot Act\u2026Congress hasn\u2019t gained in popularity among Americans.\n\nImagine that. Not a job created, 50+ attempts to repeal Obamacare, endless Benghazi hearings and fast-track authority and the USA Freedom Act weren\u2019t enough to make Congress popular. Can you imagine that? And all Boehner is focused on now is his anti-Clinton witch hunt, insisting yesterday in a press release,\n\nIt\u2019s about time. Secretary Clinton\u2019s previous statements that she possessed no classified information were patently untrue. Her mishandling of classified information must be fully investigated.\n\nYou have to wonder at what point Congress will decide Bernie Sanders is the real threat, and begin investigating him. These men and women are supposed to be governing. The public, as their approval ratings demonstrate, isn\u2019t being fooled. Yet all Boehner and McConnell can do is fiddle while Rome burns around them.\n\nAnd, why just the other day, Boehner had photos from his Golf Channel interview put online at Speaker.gov! That\u2019s what this country needs. B-but wait\u2026Isn\u2019t it supposed to be \u2013 according to congressman Ted Cruz \u2013 the president who can\u2019t be pulled away from his golf game to run the country?\n\n\u201cMoreover,\u201d as Gallup says ominously, \u201cthe leaders of the two Republican-controlled chambers, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, are suffering a similar public image problem\u2026House Speaker Boehner and Senator Majority Leader McConnell \u2014 are not only unpopular figures with the public at large, they are also not particularly well-received even among Republicans.\u201d\n\nAnd they have graphs to prove it:\n\nBy contrast, President Obama, the guy they say is destroying the country \u2013 the guy who has been creating jobs for five straight years \u2013 held a 46.1 percent approval rating in July \u2013 over three times their own approval rating. According to a CNN/ORC poll in April, Obama\u2019s approval was even higher, at 48 percent, and the Gallup Daily Tracking Poll had him at 49 percent when Netanyahu visited.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the executive branch of our government that is a worldwide joke. It is the legislative branch. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that, scientifically speaking, Congress sucks.\n\nAnd who controls Congress? The Republicans. Obviously, Republicans and Democrats have differing reasons as to why Congress sucks. Republicans are convinced, paradoxically, that their representatives have sold out to the very corporations for which the Republican Party works(!) while Democrats realize that, factually speaking, the Republican-controlled Congress just isn\u2019t interested in accomplishing anything, that their sole purpose is to prevent President Obama from doing anything.\n\nThe only thing we agree on, apparently, is, as Rasmussen puts it, \u201cVoters think most members of Congress do a lousy job and probably have sold their vote for cash or to a contributor.\u201d Since most members of Congress are Republicans, this has the virtue of actually being true.\n\nSurprise, surprise, Republicans. Ya\u2019ll jumped for joy at Citizens United. What did you think the result would be? Your legislators laughing at corporations handing them fistfuls of cash? Those who haven\u2019t reaped the financial benefits never will, but you\u2019ve let yourself be convinced that making the rich richer and the poor poorer is a good economic plan. You\u2019ll never figure out why it\u2019s not, and the only surprise now is that you\u2019re surprised at all, and can\u2019t put 2 and 2 together.\n\nBut that\u2019s okay. Your voucher programs will make sure your kids can\u2019t either, and that\u2019s just the way all those rich folks passing cash around want it.\n\nEnjoy that Red State gulag \u2013 er, I mean paradise. You did build that. Apologies to President Obama, but that\u2019s absolutely one thing you did on your own.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our GOP Congress says people just don't like or approve of Obama, but he's the guy near 50 percent, while they're down to 14 percent approval", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Our GOP Congress says people just don't like or approve of Obama, but he's the guy near 50 percent, while they're down to 14 percent approval", "title": "Congress Pits its 14 Percent Approval Against Obama's 46 Percent", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/08/12/congress-approval-against-obamas.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mcconnell-boehner-worried.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-12T07:55:15+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,approval ratings,Barack Obama,Congress,gallup,John Boehner,Legislative Branch,mitch mcconnell,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-08-12T07:55:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-12T07:55:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "approval ratings, Barack Obama, Congress, gallup, John Boehner, Legislative Branch, mitch mcconnell"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc937a\"", "article_summary": "While the much vilified President Obama is actually reasonably popular despite a nearly seven-year, nonstop smear campaign, Congress and its leaders are not.\nIt needs to be pointed out that Congress began to year in January with a 16 percent approval rating.\nApologies to President Obama, but that\u2019s absolutely one thing you did on your own.\nwhile Democrats realize that, factually speaking, the Republican-controlled Congress just isn\u2019t interested in accomplishing anything, that their sole purpose is to prevent President Obama from doing anything.\nRasmussen, the poll of choice for Republicans, agrees, though it puts congressional approval even lower, at just 13 percent as of July 9."}
