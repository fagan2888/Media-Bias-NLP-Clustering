Several community volunteers founded Youth Emergency Services in 1974 after noticing lots of homeless youths hanging out in the Old Market. It was a grass-roots effort: They invited kids to stay in their homes, until they invested in a house.

» The 501(c)3 tax-exempt nonprofit reported income in 2014 of nearly $1.6 million from government grants, foundations’ aid, corporate givers, community groups, individual donors and special events such as a golf outing and a dance competition gala.

» Expenses last year totaled nearly $1.25 million — 79 percent to client services, 15 percent to management and 6 percent to fundraising.

» It has 19 full-time employees and 13 part-time employees.

» In the past decade, YES has helped more than 5,800 young people. Last year it helped 1,800 individuals, many multiple times. That was an 80 percent increase over the previous year. The outreach center sees between 30 and 60 kids each day and 30 to 40 new kids each month.

» The original YES house now is the agency’s six-bed emergency shelter. YES opened its street outreach center in 1999, added a transitional living program and maternity home in 2008 and launched a mentoring project in 2012.

» The outreach center serves an average of 650 hot meals a month without a stove or oven. Church groups and other civic organizations bring in food, and staffers keep it hot in roasters or reheat it in a microwave oven.

» YES also operates a Safe Place hotline for youths in crisis. Various metropolitan area locations have signed on to be a Safe Place for young people who need an immediate place to get away from difficult and possibly dangerous situations. The number is 402-578-7233 (SAFE).
