Garvey said he will attend the proceedings.\n\nUnder Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, most health insurance plans must cover contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs without cost sharing.\n\nOrganizations that object to the mandate for religious reasons are required to notify HHS and provide contact information for their health plan insurer or third-party administrator.\n\nThe insurers or third-party administrators then provide the coverage required at no cost to insured employees.\n\nThe HHS regulation under Obamacare requires dissenters to cooperate in \u201can act that we view as sinful,\u201d Garvey told The Daily Signal. \u201cWe\u2019re helping somebody to do what we view as wrong.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Pope Francis held Mass at the university on Sept. 23, 2015\u2014exactly six months to the day before the scheduled arguments.\n\n\u201cThe message that he preached at his Mass on that day was that religion is important,\u201d Garvey said, adding:\n\nIn the course of his visit, he made the point that religious freedom is important\u2014not just to protect our teaching, but also that we should go out into the world and proclaim the gospel. And what we understand him to have been saying was that we ought to live the way we talk. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to say to our students, and that\u2019s exactly what this set of regulations makes it impossible for us to do.\n\nThe university president said the institution he leads isn\u2019t interested in preventing students or employees from acquiring contraceptives or other devices, drugs, or services that the Obamacare mandate would force it to provide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just saying that it shouldn\u2019t be our obligation to pay for them, because we view them as wrong, but people are free to do as they want,\u201d Garvey said.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to release a decision in June.\n\nGarvey, who is also an attorney admitted to the Supreme Court bar, said the Feb. 13 death of Justice Antonin Scalia may have a significant impact on the outcome. Scalia, a Catholic himself, was perhaps the court\u2019s most conservative justice.\n\nThe university is exploring what actions it may take if the ruling is not in its favor, Garvey said.\n\nIf the court reaches a split 4-4 decision, he said, it is possible the justices may affirm one of the lower case decisions saying religious organizations must comply without releasing their own opinion. Or they may wait until a ninth justice is appointed, confirmed, and seated to break the tie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wrong so often that I\u2019ve given up predicting what the court is going to do. But we certainly hope that they see it our way,\u201d Garvey said.\n\nGarvey said the Constitution and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a bipartisan measure designed to guarantee protections for deeply held religious beliefs, are on the university\u2019s side:\n\nIt would be a very sad day if America, in such a brief time, were to abandon its commitment to religious freedoms. The Constitution protects it, which was one of the reasons so many of our parents, grandparents, forebears came to this country.\n\nGarvey described controversy over legal protections for religious believers, including Indiana\u2019s decision to pass a watered down Religious Freedom Restoration Act at the state level, as a \u201csad development.\u201d\n\n\u201cI personally think that what we\u2019re seeing in most of the fights we have about religious liberties these days is conflict over a sexual agenda that was formulated in my own childhood and has taken on almost a kind of religious fervor,\u201d Garvey, 67, said.\n\nJohn Vivian, president of the university\u2019s student organization, the Saint John Paul II Guild of Catholic Lawyers, told The Daily Signal that some of the group\u2019s members are \u201cgoing to be camping out and attending the oral arguments\u201d at the Supreme Court.\n\nVivian, a law student, said not upholding religious freedom can be a \u201cslippery slope, to not just infringe on people\u2019s individual freedoms and their other constitutional rights, but also it can grow into large-scale persecution.\u201d\n\nHe added:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIt would be a very sad day if America \u2026 were to abandon its commitment to religious freedoms,\" John Garvey, Catholic University of America president, says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIt would be a very sad day if America \u2026 were to abandon its commitment to religious freedoms,\" John Garvey, Catholic University of America president, says.", "title": "Catholic University Fights 'Contraceptive Mandate'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160322_CUAScotus_Barillas.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-23T22:35:25+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/25kzvXM"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIt would be a very sad day if America \u2026 were to abandon its commitment to religious freedoms,\" John Garvey, Catholic University of America president, says.", "title": "Catholic University Fights 'Contraceptive Mandate'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160322_CUAScotus_Barillas.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "obamacare,supreme court", "published_time": "2016-03-22T20:26:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-23T22:35:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "supreme court, zubik v burwell, contraceptive mandate, obamacare, Affordable Care Act, John Garvey, Catholic University of America, religious freedom, religious liberty, scotus"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bc3\"", "article_summary": "Requiring such insurance coverage in violation of deeply held religious beliefs \u201cmakes hypocrites of us,\u201d John Garvey, president of the Catholic University of America, said in the interview.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to release a decision in June.\nThe university is exploring what actions it may take if the ruling is not in its favor, Garvey said.\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Wednesday in Zubik vs. Burwell, the name for several related cases challenging the regulation imposed by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\u201cIt would be a very sad day if America, in such a brief time, were to abandon its commitment to religious freedoms,\u201d Garvey said."}
