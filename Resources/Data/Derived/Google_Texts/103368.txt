WASHINGTON , March 26 -- The House Ways and Means Committee issued a report (H.Rpt. 114-475) on legislation (H.R. 4723) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the recovery of improper overpayments resulting from certain federally subsidized health insurance. The report was advanced by Rep. Kevin Brady , R- Texas , on March 23 .

Excerpts of the report follow:

I. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND

A. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY

The bill, H.R. 4723, as reported by the Committee on Ways and Means , amends the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 relating to premium assistance credits for the purchase of health insurance by removing the limits on the amount of excess advance premium assistance payments that must be repaid. Thus, under the bill, the full amount of excess advance premium assistance payments would be required to be repaid.

B. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION

Given the Federal government's current fiscal situation and growing financial commitment to health care services, it is imperative that Congress scrutinize the Federal budget to identify potential improper payments resulting from waste, fraud, and abuse. Once identified, it is incumbent on Congress to amend statutes and address programs that fail to fully protect taxpayer dollars. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (PPACA) design of advanceable and refundable tax credits for the purchase of certain government-approved health insurance creates the potential for such waste, fraud, and abuse. The combination of income determination rules, limits on the amount of subsidy overpayments that can be recouped, and the large amount of Federal funds being expended (more than $800 billion will be spent over the next ten years on both Obamacare's advanceable refundable tax credits and cost-sharing reductions) make the program particularly susceptible to improper payments. Accordingly, the bill seeks to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse by repealing the limit on the amount of improper overpayments the government can recoup.

C. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

Background

H.R. 4723 was introduced by Representative Lynn Jenkins (R-KS) on March 10, 2016 , and was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means .

Committee action

The Committee on Ways and Means marked up H.R. 4723, the Protecting Taxpayers by Recovering Improper Obamacare Subsidy Overpayments Act, on March 16, 2016 , and ordered the bill, as amended, favorably reported by a vote of 22 yeas to 15 nays (with a quorum being present).

Committee hearings

The full Committee on Ways and Means held hearings regarding the President's Fiscal Year 2017 budget submission on February 10, 2016 , and February 11, 2016 , with Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell and Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew , respectively, in which implementation of PPACA was a focal point. The President's health care law also was discussed at hearings on the law's implementation with Secretary Burwell with the full Committee on June 10, 2015 , and on the law's mandates with the Health Subcommittee on April 14, 2015 .

II. EXPLANATION OF THE BILL

A. RECOVERY OF IMPROPER OVERPAYMENTS RESULTING FROM CERTAIN FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED HEALTH INSURANCE ( SEC . 2 OF THE BILL AND SEC. 36B OF THE CODE)

PRESENT LAW

Premium assistance credit--in general

A refundable tax credit (the 'premium assistance credit') is available for certain taxpayers who purchase health insurance (referred to as a 'qualified health plan') for themselves and their families through an American Health Benefit Exchange ('Exchange'). 1 [Footnote] The premium assistance credit, which is payable in advance directly to the insurer, subsidizes the purchase of a qualified health plan through an Exchange. 2 [Footnote]

[Footnote 1: Sec. 36B. Unless otherwise specified, all section references are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.]

[Footnote 2: Sections 1411 and 1412 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ('PPACA'), Pub. L. No. 111-148, provide rules relating to advance payment of the premium assistance credit.]

The premium assistance credit is available for taxpayers with household incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the Federal poverty level ('FPL') for the family size involved who do not receive health insurance through an employer or a spouse's employer, as discussed below, and are not eligible for certain other types of coverage, such as Medicare or Medicaid . Household income is defined as the sum of (1) the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income, plus (2) the aggregate modified adjusted gross incomes of all other individuals taken into account in determining that taxpayer's family size who are required to file a tax return for the taxable year. Modified adjusted gross income is defined as adjusted gross income increased by: (1) any amount excluded from gross income for citizens or residents living abroad, 3 [Footnote] (2) any tax-exempt interest received or accrued during the tax year, and (3) an amount equal to the portion of the taxpayer's Social Security benefits that is not included in gross income (that is, the amount of the taxpayer's Social Security benefits that are excluded from gross income). 4 [Footnote] To be eligible for the premium assistance credit, taxpayers who are married must file a joint return. Individuals who are listed as dependents on a return are ineligible for the premium assistance credit.

[Footnote 3: Sec. 911.]

[Footnote 4: The amount of Social Security benefits included in gross income is determined under section 86.]

Generally, a taxpayer who is an employee and is offered minimum essential coverage 5 [Footnote] under an employer-sponsored health plan is ineligible for the premium assistance credit.

[Footnote 5: Minimum essential coverage is defined in section 5000A(f).]

However, if an employee's share of the premium for self-only coverage exceeds 9.66 percent (for 2016) of the employee's household income, or the plan's share of total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan is less than 60 percent of such costs, and the employee declines the employer-offered coverage, the employee may be eligible for the premium assistance credit.

Amount of credit

The premium assistance credit amount is generally the lower of (1) the premium for the qualified health plan in which the individual or family enrolls and (2) the premium for the second lowest cost silver plan 6 [Footnote] in the rating area where the individual resides, reduced by the individual's or family's share of premiums. 7 [Footnote] As shown in Table 1 below, an individual's or family's share of premiums is a certain percentage of household income for household income up to 133 percent of FPL and is determined on a sliding scale in a linear manner as household income rises from 133 percent of FPL to 400 percent of FPL.

[Footnote 6: A qualified health plan is categorized by level (bronze, silver, gold or platinum), depending on its actuarial value, that is, the percentage of the plan's share of the total costs of benefits under the plan. A silver level plan must have an actuarial value of 70 percent.]

[Footnote 7: The premium assistance amount is determined on a monthly basis and the credit for a year is the sum of the monthly amounts.]

[Footnote 8: Rev. Proc . 2014-62, 2014-2 C.B. 948. The percentages are indexed to the excess of premium growth over income growth for the preceding calendar year. After 2018, if the aggregate amount of premium assistance credits (and cost-sharing reductions under section 1402 of PPACA) exceeds 0.504 percent of the gross domestic product for that year, the percentage of income is also adjusted to reflect the excess (if any) of premium growth over the rate of growth in the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year.]

Reconciliation

A taxpayer on whose behalf advance payments of the premium assistance credit for a taxable year are made is required to file an income tax return to reconcile the advance payments with the credit to which the taxpayer is entitled for the taxable year. 9 [Footnote]

[Footnote 9: A taxpayer is not required to apply for advance payments and may instead just claim the credit on his or her income tax return.]

If the advance payments of the premium assistance credit exceed the amount of credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, the excess ('excess advance payments') is treated as an additional tax liability on the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year, subject to a limitation on the amount of liability in some cases. 10 [Footnote] For persons with household income below 400 percent of FPL, the liability for the overpayment for a taxable year is limited to a specific dollar amount (the 'applicable dollar amount') as shown in Table 2 below (one-half of the applicable dollar amount shown in Table 2 for unmarried individuals who are not surviving spouses or filing as head of households).

[Footnote 10: Section 35 also provides an advanceable, refundable credit for the purchase of health insurance, the health coverage tax credit (' HCTC '), for certain individuals. Section 35(g)(12) provides rules for coordination between HCTC and premium assistance credit eligibility and advance payments.]

[Footnote 11: Rev. Proc . 2015-53, 2015-44 I.R.B. 615. The applicable dollar amounts are indexed to reflect cost-of-living increases, with the amount of any increase rounded down to the next lowest multiple of $50 .]

TABLE 2- RECONCILIATION LIMIT ON ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITY (for 2016) 11

If the advance payments of the premium assistance credit for a taxable year are less than the amount of the credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, the additional credit amount is also reflected on the taxpayer's income tax return for the year.

REASONS FOR CHANGE

The Committee believes that overpayments resulting from certain Federally-subsidized health insurance programs should be fully recouped and that failure to do so will result in the mismanagement of taxpayer funds. The Committee believes that it is appropriate to align repayment requirements for this program with those of similar tax credits, like the earned income tax credit. Given that, in the case of an exchange subsidy underpayment, the Federal government is required to pay the filer the additional appropriate amount of funds, the Committee believes it is appropriate for the government to be able to recoup overpayments. Thus, the Committee believes that recipients should be required to repay the full amount of any overpayment of the advance premium assistance credit.

EXPLANATION OF PROVISION

The provision repeals the present-law rule under which, in the case of a taxpayer with household income below 400 percent of FPL, the additional tax liability resulting from excess advance payments is limited to the applicable dollar amount. 12 [Footnote] Thus, under the provision, the full amount of the excess advance payments would be required to be repaid.

[Footnote 12: The provision includes a conforming change to section 35(g)(12).]

EFFECTIVE DATE

The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016 .

Enclosure.

H.R. 4723--Protecting Taxpayers by Recovering Improper Obamacare Subsidy Overpayments Act

H.R. 4723 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide for the recovery of overpayments resulting from certain federally subsidized health insurance. Under current law, qualified taxpayers are eligible to receive refundable tax credits to assist in the purchase of health insurance through the health insurance marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act. The amount of those premium assistance credits are based on family size and income, and the advance payments of the credits is based on income estimated for the current year. If taxpayers' circumstances change and their advance payments exceed the premium assistance credits to which they are entitled, they may be required to repay some or all of the credits, subject to certain limits based on income. Enacting H.R. 4723 would eliminate existing limits on the amounts required to be repaid by taxpayers. Taxpayers would therefore be liable for the full amount of overpayments, beginning in tax year 2017.

The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that relative to CBO's January 2016 baseline, the legislation would decrease outlays by $45.8 billion and increase revenues by $15.8 billion over the 2016-2026 period. JCT therefore estimates that the legislation would reduce federal budget deficits by $61.6 billion over the 2016-2026 period. The change in revenues includes a reduction of about $718 million over the 2016-2026 period that would result from changes in off-budget revenues (from Social Security payroll taxes).

The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending and revenues. The estimated net decrease in the deficit is shown in the following table. Only on-budget changes to outlays or revenues are subject to pay-as-you-go procedures.

CBO ESTIMATE OF PAY-AS-YOU-GO EFFECTS FOR H.R. 4723, AS ORDERED REPORTED BY THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS ON MARCH 16, 2016

To view the table, click this link: http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/34?&sid=cp114s0tv8&refer=&r_n=hr475.114&db_id=114&item=34&&sid=cp114s0tv8&r_n=hr475.114&hd_count=50&item=34&&sel=TOC_21034&.

JCT estimates that enacting the bill would not increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four 10-year periods beginning in 2027.

JCT has determined that the bill contains no intergovernmental mandates but would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). Based on information provided by JCT, the cost of the provision's private-sector mandate would exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ( $157 million in 2017, adjusted annually for inflation) beginning in 2017.

The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Nathaniel Frentz . The estimate was approved by Mark Booth , Unit Chief, Revenue Estimating.

V. OTHER MATTERS TO BE DISCUSSED UNDER THE RULES OF THE HOUSE

A. COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

With respect to clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives (relating to oversight findings), the Committee advises that it was as a result of the Committee's review of the provisions of H.R. 4723 that the Committee concluded that it is appropriate to report the bill, as amended, favorably to the House of Representatives with the recommendation that the bill do pass.

B. STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

With respect to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives , the Committee advises that the bill contains no measure that authorizes funding, so no statement of general performance goals and objectives for which any measure authorizes funding is required.

C. INFORMATION RELATING TO UNFUNDED MANDATES

This information is provided in accordance with section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. No. 104-4).

The Committee has determined that the bill contains one private sector mandate: changes to the limitations on recapture of overpayments resulting from advance premium assistance payments for Federally-subsidized health insurance. The Committee has determined that the bill does not impose a Federal intergovernmental mandate on State, local, or tribal governments.

D. APPLICABILITY OF HOUSE RULE XXI 5(B)

Rule XXI 5(b) of the Rules of the House of Representatives provides, in part, that 'A bill or joint resolution, amendment, or conference report carrying a Federal income tax rate increase may not be considered as passed or agreed to unless so determined by a vote of not less than three-fifths of the Members voting, a quorum being present.' The Committee has carefully reviewed the bill and states that the bill does not involve any Federal income tax rate increases within the meaning of the rule.

E. TAX COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS

Section 4022(b) of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 ('IRS Reform Act') requires the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (in consultation with the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department ) to provide a tax complexity analysis. The complexity analysis is required for all legislation reported by the Senate Committee on Finance , the House Committee on Ways and Means , or any committee of conference if the legislation includes a provision that directly or indirectly amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and has widespread applicability to individuals or small businesses.

Pursuant to clause 3(h)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives , the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation has determined that a complexity analysis is not required under section 4022(b) of the IRS Reform Act because the bill contains no provisions that amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and that have 'widespread applicability' to individuals or small businesses, within the meaning of the rule.

F. CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND LIMITED TARIFF BENEFITS

With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives , the Committee has carefully reviewed the provisions of the bill and states that the provisions of the bill do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.

G. DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS

In compliance with Sec. 3(g)(2) of H. Res . 5 (114th Congress ), the Committee states that no provision of the bill establishes or reauthorizes: (1) a program of the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Federal program, (2) a program included in any report from the Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public Law 111-139, or (3) a program related to a program identified in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, published pursuant to the Federal Program Information Act (Public Law 95-220, as amended by Public Law 98-169).

H. DISCLOSURE OF DIRECTED RULE MAKINGS

In compliance with Sec. 3(i) of H. Res . 5 (114th Congress ), the following statement is made concerning directed rule makings: The Committee estimates that the bill requires no directed rule makings within the meaning of such section.

VI. CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED

A. TEXT OF EXISTING LAW AMENDED OR REPEALED BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED

In compliance with clause 3(e)(1)(A) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives , the text of each section proposed to be amended or repealed by the bill, as reported, is shown below:
