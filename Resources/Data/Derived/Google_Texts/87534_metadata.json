He said a Fish and Game stocking crew was still in the area after releasing birds, and witnessed the shooting.\n\n..\n\nThe victim suffered a non-life-threatening injury when he was hit in the side of the head by \u201ca (shotgun) pellet or two,\u201d Normandeau said. The shooter apparently was aware of the accident but left the scene, he said.\n\n..\n\nNormandeau said witnesses got a license plate number for the hunter's vehicle and he expects charges will be filed.\n\n\n\nAs soon as he heard about the incident on Friday, Normandeau said, he asked Fish and Game's legal counsel for advice and then issued the emergency order. \u201cI've had enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not an isolated incident.\u201d\n\n..\n\nIn some cases, Fish and Game biologists have been in the process of releasing pheasants from their wooden crates, Normandeau said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey're still putting birds out and people are blasting away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just needs to come to an end.\u201d\n\n..\n\nSuch incidents have happened in the past, he said, but this hunting season seems to be worse than usual.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt just seems like for some reason this year, people are out there just sort of waiting for the stocking truck to show up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe appear to be having a bunch of people too anxious to be the first to get one.\u201d\n\n..\n\n\u201cI'm concerned about the public generally, but I'm especially concerned about our own folks and somebody getting hurt.\u201d\n\n\n\nNormandeau said the emergency order applies only to this week. But he said he plans to seek a permanent solution when Fish and Game undertakes its biennial rulemaking process in the spring.\n\n..\n\n\u201cI expect we're going to have a serious discussion and probably permanently design something where on stocking days you can't hunt,\u201d he said. \u201cThere shouldn't be any hunting going on when we're out there.\u201d\n\n..\n\nNormandeau said this is not a new issue. He found a study dating back to 1949, \u201cwhich illustrates that these same problems were going on back then.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey go away for a while. Then they raise their ugly head again.\u201d\n\n..\n\nPheasant hunting season continues through Dec. 31 in New Hampshire. A total of 12,200 ring-necked pheasants are being released this year at 70 sites in 46 towns, according to Fish and Game.\n\n\n\nFor a list of stocking sites, visit: huntnh.com/hunting/pheasant.html.\n\n..\n\nswickham@unionleader.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "The head of the state Fish and Game Department has issued an emergency order for later this week, barring hunters from discharging firearms at pheasant stocking sites statewide, after one hunter shot and wounded another on Friday.", "title": "Hunter shot, injured during state pheasant stocking | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "The head of the state Fish and Game Department has issued an emergency order for later this week, barring hunters from discharging firearms at pheasant stocking sites statewide, after one hunter shot and wounded another on Friday.", "title": "Hunter shot, injured during state pheasant stocking | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20151018/NEWS07/151019345", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/images/unionleaderlogo.jpg", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Public Safety", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "Animals, Hunting,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-10-18 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "The head of the state Fish and Game Department has issued an emergency order for later this week, barring hunters from discharging firearms at pheasant stocking sites statewide, after one hunter shot and wounded another on Friday.", "title": "Hunter shot, injured during state pheasant stocking | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20151018/NEWS07/151019345", "image": "http://www.unionleader.com/images/unionleaderlogo.jpg", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0520\"", "article_summary": "Hunter shot, injured during state pheasant stockingThe head of the state Fish and Game Department has issued an emergency order for later this week, barring hunters from discharging firearms at pheasant stocking sites statewide, after one hunter shot and wounded another on Friday.\nHe said a Fish and Game stocking crew was still in the area after releasing birds, and witnessed the shooting.\nFor a list of stocking sites, visit: huntnh.com/hunting/pheasant.html.\n\u201cThere shouldn't be any hunting going on when we're out there.\u201d..Normandeau said this is not a new issue.\nThe order is effective from 7 a.m. until noon on Thursday and Friday, the last two days that Fish and Game will be stocking ring-necked pheasants this year."}
