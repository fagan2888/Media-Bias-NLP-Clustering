Senate:

• NC-Sen: Republican Thom Tillis blames Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan for doing nothing to stop the rise of ISIS, accusing her of skipping Armed Services Committee meetings at a critical time. Also on the GOP side, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce features legendary NASCAR driver Richard Petty praising Tillis. As Daily Kos Elections community member JacobNC reminds us, Petty actually ran for office himself in 1996. He lost his race for North Carolina secretary of state to Democrat Elaine Marshall 53-45.

On the Democratic side, Senate Majority PAC has two new spots against Tillis (here and here). The first goes after Tillis on equal pay for women, while the second hits him on education.

• NH-Sen Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen talks about her how she puts New Hampshire first. The ad is positive, though it's no coincidence that "Put New Hampshire First" is Republican opponent Scott Brown's slogan. NextGen Climate also spends $600,000 against Brown.

Gubernatorial:

• IL-Gov: Several new ads for Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn (here, here, and here). The first portrays Republican Bruce Rauner as corrupt, accusing him of bribing a board member who voted his way on a deal (the word bribe isn't used but the ad's not subtle). The second talks about Quinn's work saving a tornado-ravaged town. The third goes back to hitting Rauner's business record.

• GA-12: Democratic Rep. John Barrow decries how much Congress sucks, and emphasizes how he turned down congressional perks. There are a billion ads by incumbent members of Congress like this, but Barrow's spot still favorably stands out.

• IL-12: The NRCC portrays Democratic Rep. Bill Enyart as someone who votes against the middle class.

• LA-05: The Club for Growth goes after Republican Rep. Vance McAllister, attacking him both over his personal problems (the congressman was caught on camera kissing a woman who wasn't his wife) and for supporting Obamacare.
