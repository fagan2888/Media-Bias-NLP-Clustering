Like members of the New York Giants, these guys are big, muscular and call New York home. But unlike the team, these giants are not very fast.

Rocket, who weighs about 600 pounds, and Abdul, who clocks in at about 400 pounds, have access to a fresh water pool and “lush vegetation” in their new home at the Zoo.

Giant Aldabra tortoises are believed to live 200 years or more and are able to swim, taking dips in water to help regulate their temperatures, according to the Zoo. Native to the Aldabra atoll in the Seychelles, they are one of only two species of giant tortoises remaining.

Giant Aldabra tortoises are classified as “vulnerable” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. An estimated 100,000 remain in the wild, according to the Zoo.

The tortoises arrived at the Bronx Zoo last year as the exhibit was being constructed and made their public debut last week.
