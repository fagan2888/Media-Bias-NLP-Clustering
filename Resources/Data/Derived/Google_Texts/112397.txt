Health-care decisions are personal. The Affordable Care Act is the most polarizing law in the United States. And using its broken website is still very frustrating. Despite all that, Barack Obama would like for you to raise the subject of health care with your family when you gather together for the holidays this year:

When your loved ones get together this holiday season, remember to talk to them about health insurance. http://t.co/6omO1vDKBj #GetTalking â€” Barack Obama (@BarackObama) November 19, 2013

Once that conversation is over perhaps you could bring up reproductive rights, immigration reform, and judicial filibusters. They're all important subjects of national concern. Why not set aside some time on Thanksgiving Day to discuss them too? Maybe just pick up the remote, turn off the football game, and ask everyone if you could have their attention while you explain how progressive public policy can improve their lives if only they do their part. They'll appreciate it!

What's that you say? Talking to your family seems too complicated to pull off without more detailed instructions? Don't worry. Some nice progressive communications professionals in Washington, D.C., have written them up in four steps.
