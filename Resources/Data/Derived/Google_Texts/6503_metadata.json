With taxes, it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\nWest Pittston Mayor Tony Denisco said one resident\u2019s policy skyrocketed to $4,000 annually.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tearing (flood houses) down, they cannot be built on that property again,\u201d said Denisco. \u201cWe\u2019re losing tax revenue there. Some of them are moving out of town.\u201d\n\nSara Pencek said the flood insurance on her home in Exeter recently increased to $500 annually, and she\u2019s hoping that lawmakers find a long-term solution.\n\n\u201cThere should be a better way to handle it than this,\u201d said Pencek. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be responsible for having to pay for flood insurance on houses that aren\u2019t in the flood zones right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "EXETER \u2013 As hundreds of homeowners in Luzerne County prepare for pricier flood insurance policies, U.S. Senator Bob Casey said he is pushing legislation that could delay the increases.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "WNEP.com", "description": "EXETER \u2013 As hundreds of homeowners in Luzerne County prepare for pricier flood insurance policies, U.S. Senator Bob Casey said he is pushing legislation that could delay the increases.
