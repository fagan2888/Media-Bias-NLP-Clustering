On Monday, the campaign offered a sneak peak to Politico, indicating that the campaign would come out of the shadows in April. In what appears to be a rebuttal to the staff assumptions from \u201ca Democrat familiar with Clinton\u2019s thinking,\u201d the news site reports today that \u201cthe actual kickoff would be in July.\u201d Clinton would submit to partial scrutiny from the Federal Elections Commission starting in April, the story says, but would keep most of her operation off the books until the beginning of July. The stated reason: the candidate wants \u201cdevelop her message, policy and organization.\u201d Because the previous 14 years of running for president haven\u2019t given them enough time to nail it down\u2026\n\n\n\n[Additional white dudes retained - Politico also reports that two 2012 Obama digital gurus are at the top of the list for Hillary\u2019s campaign-in-waiting, Teddy Goff and Andrew Bleeker.]\n\n\n\nSo who cares? - The money line in the rebuttal from whoever Politico was quoting in throne room is this: \u201c[Clinton] doesn\u2019t feel under any pressure, and they see no primary challenge on the horizon. If you have the luxury of time, you take it.\u201d This should terrify Democrats. If the campaign cocoon is so dense and so deep that courtiers are publicly quibbling in the press about the right moment for the monarch butterfly to emerge, they are farther out of touch with reality than even previous reporting had indicated. But if this really is Clinton herself speaking through an emissary, it would suggest the kind of stage fright that foretells a risk-averse, bloodless, pre-fab campaign. Sound familiar? Those were the hallmarks of Clinton\u2019s losing endeavor in 2008 and, if the leaks are to be believed, the tendencies have deepened in the past seven years. Clinton\u2019s book tour showed not a candidate who was \u201crusty\u201d but one who was unwilling to acknowledge political reality. A rusty candidate might complain about being \u201cdead broke.\u201d But only an arrogant one would insist that she was right to say so.\n\n\n\n[\u201cThe same old candidates running for President #ThingsToRunFrom\u201d \u2013 Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Twitter]\n\n\n\nDeflate - The first hazard of being so blithe as to say Clinton \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel any pressure\u201d is that it would not take long for a Democratic revolt to spring up. The presumptive nominee could be caught unawares, like this guy. While Clinton would be hard to stop from seizing the nomination, the effort of quelling an insurrection might be a strain. The other, larger, hazard is that this trend depicts a candidate who will not be ready to meet the challenges of the general election. The longer Clinton stays inside the palace, hiding her treasury and ducking behind her retainers, the harder her eventual emergence will be. She should be feeling pressure \u2013 the same pressure that drove Jeb Bush to get off the couch before Christmas. Many consultants make their livings by soothing and reassuring candidates. And with a $2 billion pot of cash at hand, there will be no shortage of people around who encourage Clinton to believe that she is a perfect and wonderful creation who only needs to be more like herself to win. That\u2019s what losing campaigns often do.\n\n\n\n[In the latest Fox News poll, only 24 percent of voters agreed with President Obama\u2019s sentiment in the State of the Union describing America as \u201ctight-knit\u201d while 73 percent see the country as dysfunctional.]\n\n\n\nBOEHNER LAYS DOWN OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT MARKER\n\nIn an interview with Fox News \u201cSpecial Report\u201d anchor Bret Baier Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner assured that a Republicans alternative to ObamaCare is in the works and will be forthcoming from Congress. It\u2019s no secret that GOP lawmakers have struggled in coalescing around an alternative due to what Boehner recently described as \u201ca lot of divergent views.\u201d Referring to an interview with CBS last week where the speaker was asked about a prospective GOP plan, Baier observed: \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t have one. Will you by the end of this Congress? \u201cThere are three committee chairmen that have the jurisdiction over the health care policy in our country.\u201d Boehner explained, \u201cAnd those three chairmen are working together to craft what we believe would be a better approach with regard to health care for the American people than ObamaCare.\u201d \u201cSo there will be one alternative?\u201d Baier pressed. \u201cThere will be an alternative and you\u2019ll get to see it,\u201d Boehner replied. Watch the interview here.\n\n\n\n[WashEx\u2019s Philip Klein examines the 5 biggest obstacles to agreement on a Republican alternative to ObamaCare: \u201cthe problem isn\u2019t that Republicans haven\u2019t released any healthcare plans, but that they\u2019ve had trouble rallying around a single one due to some fundamental differences. If Republicans are going to coalesce around an alternative, they will have to reach consensus \u2026\u201d]\n\n\n\nShortlist for new CBO boss revealed - The Hill: \u201cRepublicans on the Budget Committee are interviewing candidates to replace Douglas Elmendorf as head of the Congressional Budget Office [CBO], according to four people with direct knowledge of the process. \u2026 According to sources, those approached include Alex Brill, research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and an economist on former President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers; Jeff Brown, a finance professor at the University of Illinois who also served on the Council under Bush; and Warren Payne, who was policy director under former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp [R-Mich.].\u201d\n\n\n\n[In the latest Fox News poll, 64 percent of voters feel the country is still in a recession yet 58 percent of voters are optimistic about the economy.]\n\nPunishment meted - The Hill: \u201cAfter publicly defying Speaker John Boehner [R-Ohio], Florida GOP Reps.

Ted Cruz [R-Texas] called attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch\u2019s immigration views \u2018dangerous\u2019 Wednesday and questioned whether Majority Leader Mitch McConnell [R-Ky.] should even have the chamber consider her nomination. \u2018That is the decision the majority leader is going to have to make. I believe we should use every constitutional tool available to stop the president\u2019s unconstitutional executive action. That\u2019s what Republicans, Republican candidates all over the country said over and over again last year,\u2019 the Texas Republican said in a brief interview with CQ Roll Call as the daylong Judiciary Committee hearing on Lynch\u2019s nomination neared conclusion.\u201d\n\n\n\n[In the latest Fox News poll, the majority of voters say the White House has mostly failed on priorities including illegal immigration at 64 percent, economic improvement at 52 percent failed the economy and making the country safer at 49 percent.]\n\n\n\n\u201cI would just say that fundamentally [Loretta Lynch] openly advocated for the providing of scarce jobs in America to those who are here illegally.\u201d --Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d Watch here.\n\n\n\nFEDS: UP TO 6 MILLION WILL PAY OBAMACARE TAX\n\nThe Hill: \u201cAs many as 6 million people will have to pay a penalty under ObamaCare for going without health insurance in 2014, federal officials suggested in projections released Wednesday. That means between 2 percent and 4 percent of all taxpayers lacked medical coverage for all or part of the year and do not qualify for an exemption under the individual mandate, according to the Treasury Department. Another 10 to 20 percent of taxpayers, or 15 million to 30 million people, were uninsured but will qualify for an exemption from the mandate, shielding them from paying $95 or 1 percent of household income when they file their taxes. Wednesday's estimates are the clearest picture so far from the administration ahead of ObamaCare's first tax season.\u201d\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nThis year\u2019s breakout film at the Sundance Film Festival, Tangerine, is full of surprises according to The Verge, from the story in front of the camera to the shooting behind the camera. The camera in question wasn\u2019t even a camera but an iPhone 5S. Plenty of films have been made with iPhones but this is by far the most successful and first to make it to Sundance. The decision to use iPhones was made to accommodate the independent film\u2019s small budget according to director Sean Baker, saying \u201cIt was surprisingly easy. We never lost any footage.\u201d Baker and his team used three phones, an $8 app called Filmic Pro that allowed more control over focus, aperture and color, a Steadicam and an adapter lens to attach to the iPhone. \u201cThese phones, because they\u2019re so light, and they\u2019re so small, a human hand, no matter how stable you are, it will shake. And it won\u2019t look good.\u201d The lenses were the key ingredient to make the movie look fit for the big screen. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I wouldn\u2019t have even made the movie without it,\u201d Baker says.\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Scott Walker\u2019s [R] new leadership committee takes a shot at Hillary Clinton with its first ad. The two-minute ad, titled \u2018Our American Revival,\u2019 describes President Obama as a failed leader and offers a warning about looking to the past for answers. \u2018America stands on the brink, at a time and place in our history where failed leaders preside over a nation adrift,\u2019 a male narrator says in the ad. It criticizes Obama for a foreign policy \u2018that projects weakness abroad.\u2019 \u2018America can't stop this by looking to the past,\u2019 the ad continues as a picture of Clinton is shown, \u2018or for answers in Washington, D.C.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nFuturist - AP: \u201cWalker told reporters in Racine, Wisconsin, that he's setting up the committee to see if his ideas resonate with voters.

The dinosaur skeleton has been in the museum for over 100 years but is being forced out because he was deemed \u201cno longer relevant\u201d for the natural world today. In the summer of 2017, a real whale skeleton will be suspended from the ceiling of Hintze Hall. Meanwhile Dippy, a plaster replica skeleton, will be preserved for a possible tour of England. The change is part of a \u201cdecade of transformation\u201d according to director Sir Michael Dixon. \u201cAs the largest known animal to have ever lived on Earth, the story of the blue whale reminds us of the scale of our responsibility to the planet. This is an important and necessary change,\u201d he said. The female blue whale arrived at the museum just 10 years after opening in 1891 but remained in storage until 1938 while Dippy was first put on display in 1905 after a donation by American millionaire Andrew Carnegie.\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201c[The Taliban] slits throats, it attacks buses, it drives car bombs into markets and it's not a terrorist group?
