Either a lot of Republicans are just frustrated or stupid, or both \u2013 and they want a bomb-thrower. Or it is pro-Hillary Clinton Democrats voting in those polls. Trump is ruining the race for the serious Republican candidates and thereby helping Hillary immensely.\n\nDemocrats must be loving his clown act. It deflects attention from Hillary\u2019s emails. Over time, Trump has donated more money to Democratic candidates than Republican candidates. Does he have any positions other than the one on immigration? At least from the news clips I\u2019ve seen, I have not heard any. All he does is harp on immigration \u2013 building a wall and deporting 11 million people (um, sure) \u2013 and says really nasty things about the other Republican candidates. He is just loathsome and seriously hurting the party.\n\nI despair. \u2013 Darrell\n\nDear Darrell: I don\u2019t mind that you dislike Trump \u2013 so far \u2013 but you should at least understand the GOP grass-roots anger out there that propels his rise in the polls.\n\nA blunt, P.O.\u2019d talker like Trump strikes a nerve with people who feel like they\u2019re falling behind and, more importantly, have been let down by get-along, go-along GOP leaders. These are the Boehners and the McConnells who huff and puff about President Barack Obama and his \u201cout of control\u201d Democratic Party, but by Thursday have moved on to other issues, after having yet again been out-maneuvered by the Democratic congressional minority.\n\nHow did the Iran deal go from being a treaty to an executive initiative, which means that Obama can enact most of the Iran deal on his own and doesn\u2019t truly need Congress\u2019 approval or disapproval? How did unpopular Obamacare, navigated by clever Democratic congressional leaders, get rammed down the throats of the American people without a single Republican vote?\n\nHow does a proponent of \u201cstrict constructionism\u201d like President George W. Bush appoint Chief Justice John Roberts, who votes twice to save Obamacare from the ash heap of history? How, through executive orders, does Obama shield more than 80 percent of an estimated 11 million illegal aliens from the fear of deportation?\n\nHow does Obama preside over the worst economic recovery in our lifetime with very little concern, attention, or care from our mainstream \u201cnews\u201d media? Where is the outrage from the Republican leadership?\n\nMost folks\u2019 incomes have not come back, and their net worth has, at best, been flat over the last seven years. The stock market, boosted through Federal Reserve sleight-of-hand, has disproportionately benefited the top 1 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the net worth of all non-white families has fallen almost 20 percent since Obama took office. For blacks, it\u2019s even worse. The so-called black/white wealth gap is at a 25-year high \u2013 with black income down, homeownership down and equity down. From 2007 to 2010, blacks\u2019 net worth declined 13.5 percent. But over the next three years \u2013 from 2010 through 2013 \u2013 it plummeted another 34 percent. But allow a black kid to be shot by a white cop and CNN covers it like the first moon landing.\n\nAfter Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 loss, the GOP put out a postmortem white paper. Its conclusion? Let\u2019s \u201coutreach\u201d to Hispanics. After all, they\u2019re the fastest-growing voting bloc, they perceive the GOP as anti-Hispanic, a more \u201caccommodating\u201d immigration policy will attract them, yada, blah, etc. Bull. I live in California. And I will tell you that Hispanics loathe Republicans for many reasons; the GOP\u2019s \u201chostile\u201d attitude toward immigration is way down on the list of anti-Republican grievances.\n\nHispanics are leftists. Period. They support higher taxes on the rich, believe in an ever-expanding social safety net and believe Republicans are selfish and only care about the rich. To think that a more \u201cwelcoming\u201d position on immigration would lure Hispanics to join the GOP is to believe blacks would shift to the GOP if the leadership collectively condemned the Confederate battlefield flag. Like blacks, Hispanics consider Republicans \u201cracist,\u201d and gestures like supporting \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d would be perceived as forced change just for votes. And no matter how \u201ccomprehensive\u201d the GOP position on immigration may be, the Democrats\u2019 will be more \u201ccomprehensive.\u201d Can\u2019t win.\n\nAnd for every additional vote lost from the 27 percent of Hispanics who voted Republican in the last presidential race, many more non-Hispanics would vote Republican if the party addressed their concerns \u2013 more than offsetting any loss of Hispanic votes. Also, let\u2019s not assume that Hispanics are as monolithic as are black voters. As Trump points out, unskilled illegal immigration hurts the jobs and incomes of not just unskilled blacks, but unskilled legal Hispanic workers, too.\n\nA lot of Americans feel alienated. They feel that unless you\u2019re gay, black, Hispanic or transgender, nobody cares. A recent poll shows that whites feel they are even bigger victims of racism than blacks!\n\nBelieve me, it\u2019s not just about immigration.\n\nSo calm down. All is not lost. \u2013 Larry", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://mobile.wnd.com/2015/08/immigration-policy-is-not-why-latinos-hate-gop/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "Dear Larry: Geez, I cannot fathom the polls that have Donald Trump leading.
