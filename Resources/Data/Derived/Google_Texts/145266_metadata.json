Bring tissues.\n\nTissues are considered such a necessity that the Wall Street Journal reports Dutton Children\u2019s Books, publisher of the John Green novel on which the film is based, were handing out The Fault In Our Stars branded tissues at events last week.\n\nMonday\u2019s screening was the 11th time Green had seen the film, but even he was in for a good cry. Although his tears kicked in later, he was overcome by the emotion of the characters he created. At this viewing, he said the tears were for other reasons as well: \u201cI don\u2019t think I cried as much from the movie as from relief and joy from the reaction of the audience.\u201d\n\nCritics were quick to praise the film. The write-up in Variety was largely positive, commending the film for navigating the tough topic of The Fault In Our Stars \u2013 cancer \u2013 without slipping into exploitation territory. Variety\u2018s Andrew Barker has specific praise for one of the film\u2019s young stars, Shailene Woodley:\n\nThough her character may be 16, Woodley\u2019s performance is thoroughly adult, and offers a reminder that, while the occasional multipart blockbuster franchise like \u201cDivergent\u201d can theoretically be part of a balanced diet for a young actress, she has much more to offer the cinema than an ability to run through obstacle courses while mouthing mealy mythology.\n\nAs for Woodley\u2019s appearance at the premiere, MTV Style was quick to note the earthy actress arrived barefoot. Once on the red carpet, she complemented her yellow dress with Kurt Geiger stilettos. Shailene is known for her devotion to alternative health, making news recently for encouraging people to reconnect with the earth.\n\nThe positive reaction might come as welcome relief to producers of The Fault In Our Stars. Screenings in recent weeks had led some to speculate the film did not do justice to the book, eliminating some of its more complex themes. Some critics have disagreed, however. When the film had its cloak-and-dagger screening at the Louisiana International Film Festival last week, writer Jeff Roedel praised the movie for its handling of the subject matter:\n\n[T]he danger is in becoming overly sappy and downtrodden, and Stars does teeter on this brink more than once, but barely escapes on its merit of solid performances and a screenplay that doesn\u2019t talk down to its audience.\n\nFor fans of The Fault In Our Stars, that may be the minimum they would expect from the movie.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Fault In Our Stars doesn't hit theaters until this Friday, but stars and critics got a sneak peek of the highly-anticipated film at Monday's premiere in New", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The Fault In Our Stars doesn\u2019t hit theaters until this Friday, but stars and critics got a sneak peek of the highly-anticipated film at Monday\u2019s premiere in New", "title": "\u2018The Fault In Our Stars\u2019 A Hit At New York City Premiere", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1281540/the-fault-in-our-stars-a-hit-at-new-york-city-premiere/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shailene-woodley-laura-dern-the-fault-in-our-stars-670-409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-04T03:59:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-04T08:31:49+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shailene-woodley-laura-dern-the-fault-in-our-stars-670-409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-06-04T03:59:16+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "john green,laura dern,shailene woodley,tfios,the fault in our stars,the fault in our stars nyc premiere,movies", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shailene-woodley-laura-dern-the-fault-in-our-stars-670-409.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Fault In Our Stars doesn\u2019t hit theaters until this Friday, but stars and critics got a sneak peek of the highly-anticipated film at Monday\u2019s premiere in New"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "The Fault In Our Stars doesn\u2019t hit theaters until this Friday, but stars and critics got a sneak peek of the highly-anticipated film at Monday\u2019s premiere in New York City.\nFor fans of The Fault In Our Stars, that may be the minimum they would expect from the movie.\nThe positive reaction might come as welcome relief to producers of The Fault In Our Stars.\nThe write-up in Variety was largely positive, commending the film for navigating the tough topic of The Fault In Our Stars \u2013 cancer \u2013 without slipping into exploitation territory.\nMonday\u2019s screening was the 11th time Green had seen the film, but even he was in for a good cry."}
