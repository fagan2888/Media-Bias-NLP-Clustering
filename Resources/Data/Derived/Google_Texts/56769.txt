Speaker Paul Ryan

In a meaningless show vote that accomplished nothing, House Republicans today failed to override President Obama's veto of their previously passed bill to repeal Obamacare. The 241 to 186 vote was short of the two-thirds majority required to override a veto, as was expected.

We now return to the rest of our lives.
