In particular, Cutler, health adviser to the President\u2019s 2008 campaign, emphasized that those in charge lacked the necessary experience of running a business start-up. Noting the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as key to execution of the new healthcare law, he said both personnel and the processes in place might not be 'up to the task.'\n\n\u201cThe agency is demoralized, the best people have left, IT services are antiquated, and there are fewer employees than in 1981, despite a much larger burden,\u201d Cutler stated in his memo sent to Larry Summers, director of the United States National Economic Council, on May 11, 2010.\n\nStart-Up Woes\n\n\u201cThey were running the biggest start-up in the world, and they didn\u2019t have anyone who had run a start-up, or even run a business,\u201d Cutler told the Washington Post. In those early days of implementation, readily available information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics would suggest that over three-quarters of start-up businesses fail. Even in 2010, then, the need for experienced, knowledgeable people must have been clear.\n\nThe Washington Post suggests that the President's decision to put Nancy-Ann De\u00adParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform, in charge despite advice from his economic team who suggested he appoint someone with business expertise may have been a deciding factor in today's woes. Worse, in February 2011, the date at which DeParle was promoted and no longer had direct responsibility for implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the person chosen to be her successor, Jeanne Lambrew, also lacked the necessary expertise.\n\nInterestingly, DeParle began by convening twice-weekly meetings of representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Internal Revenue Service, among other agencies, to pore over spreadsheets and decide complex regulatory questions. A similar though higher-level meeting that was intended to hash out regulatory questions convened monthly. At first, the Washington Post reports, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, and Domestic Policy Council Director Melody Barnes regularly attended.\n\nShockingly, though, \"by late summer and early fall of 2010, the meetings petered out after some of the participants stopped attending,\u201d the Washington Post reports.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that the personnel and processes you have in place are not up to the task, and that health reform will be unsuccessful as a result,\u201d Cutler warned in his memo. Early misplaced effort, ignorance of technology, a hostile political environment, poor coordination of accountability, and other causes appear to have prevented the Affordable Care Act from sailing straight. Subtly, the Washington Post raises a painful question in its report of missteps along the way: was anyone thinking about those who would be most affected \u2014 the uninsured?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, leaked memo", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A leaked memo from Washington insider David Cutler warned the administration in 2010 that Obamacare would be unsuccessful because of personnel issues.", "title": "Leaked Memo From 2010 Warned Obamacare Will Be 'Unsuccessful'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/leaked-memo-2010-warned-obamacare-will-be-unsuccessful-because-personnel-not-task-261886", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/04/signed-document.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A leaked memo from Washington insider David Cutler warned the administration in 2010 that Obamacare would be unsuccessful because of personnel issues.", "title": "Leaked Memo From 2010 Warned Obamacare Will Be 'Unsuccessful'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/leaked-memo-2010-warned-obamacare-will-be-unsuccessful-because-personnel-not-task-261886", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/04/signed-document.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/04/signed-document.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2013-11-04T14:47:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-04T14:47:45-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A leaked memo from Washington insider David Cutler warned the administration in 2010 that Obamacare would be unsuccessful because of personnel issues."}, "article_summary": "Subtly, the Washington Post raises a painful question in its report of missteps along the way: was anyone thinking about those who would be most affected \u2014 the uninsured?\nIn particular, Cutler, health adviser to the President\u2019s 2008 campaign, emphasized that those in charge lacked the necessary experience of running a business start-up.\nShockingly, though, \"by late summer and early fall of 2010, the meetings petered out after some of the participants stopped attending,\u201d the Washington Post reports.\n\u201cI am concerned that the personnel and processes you have in place are not up to the task, and that health reform will be unsuccessful as a result,\u201d Cutler warned in his memo.\nOn Saturday, the Washington Post reported that a memo written by David Cutler, a Harvard University professor, warned the Obama administration of serious flaws in the planned roll-out of the Affordable Care Act."}
