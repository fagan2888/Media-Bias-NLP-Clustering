(Photo: Harold J. Adams) Story Highlights Bob Bottorff faces Jeremy Mull in November prosecutor's race\n\nClark County voters will elect a new prosecutor for first time since 1986\n\nAfter Clark County Democratic Party chairman Bob Bottorff officially resigned during a caucus meeting Saturday in Clarksville, precinct leaders chose a familiar face in local politics to serve as the new party head.\n\nFormer Jeffersonville Mayor Tom Galligan replaces Bottorff, who is running for county prosecutor in the November general election against Republican Jeremy Mull, the county's current chief deputy prosecutor.\n\nThe change in Democratic party leadership comes about a month before Indiana's May 6 primaries. Many other prominent county positions are up for grabs around the state this year, such as judges, sheriffs, commissioners, council members, clerks, auditors, treasurers, recorders, assessors and surveyors.\n\nBottorff, who led the party for more than a year, said afterward he believes Galligan will do a \"fine job,\" continuing to advocate for all party candidates as campaign season heats up.\n\n\"This decision was not an easy one for me to make as, philosophically, I am a believer in the Clark County Democratic Party values,\" said Bottorff, a private-practice lawyer who also previously argued cases for Prosecutor Steve Stewart's office.\n\nBottorff feels he can better serve the party in other ways.\n\n\"Since I'm going to be working hard as a candidate, I would be selling short what I consider the proper way to lead as chairman,\" he said.\n\nOut of 86 votes cast by precinct chairs and vice-chairs Saturday at Clarksville Town Hall, Galligan received 57 of them. Attorney Dustin White, who also was nominated, garnered the other 29 votes.\n\nThis year marks the first since 1986 that Clark County voters will elect a new prosecutor as Stewart isn't seeking re-election. Former Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh appointed Democrat Stewart to the position in 1989 and voters have chosen him in each election since.\n\nReporter Charlie White can be reached at (812) 949-4026 and on Twitter @c_write.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/PxBN3l", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Clark County Democratic Party has a new chairman about a month ahead of Indiana's May 6 primary elections.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "The Clark County Democratic Party has a new chairman about a month ahead of Indiana's May 6 primary elections.", "title": "Galligan to head Clark County Dems as Bottorff resigns", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2014/04/05/galligan-head-clark-county-dems-bottorff-resigns/7352293/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Clark County Democratic Party has a new chairman about a month ahead of Indiana's May 6 primary elections.", "title": "Galligan to head Clark County Dems as Bottorff resigns", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/82a6dacc62e5f438a53a0efd0b1d340920de4317/c=352-0-2464-2112&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/3jeremymull.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/charlie.white1"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/Clarksville", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/Clarksville", "title": "Galligan to head Clark County Dems as Bottorff resigns", "author": "Charlie White", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f8ee3a9f75bd1dc8926d2b096b7f5f7625ffb1fb/c=616-0-2200-2112/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/3jeremymull.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d2e79f563ea71944ad9c0b2e64d58604444cb886/c=352-0-2464-2112/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/3jeremymull.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/28a5fbdbe7b476965a2a6f3e03552b6fc56fe616/c=0-0-2816-2112/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/3jeremymull.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c0e7851811df4787a1285f0f25dfa7e09f7b42ab/c=0-264-2816-1848&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/3jeremymull.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-04-05T17:01:10.633000-04:00", "shorthed": "Clark County Dems choose new chair", "articleid": 7352293, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/684a082271aabdb2b21799b5ea8ea1b04354fa6b/c=0-264-2816-1848/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/3jeremymull.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ca21d3579623c04ecef15b5aa175b69b0c76702/c=814-0-2002-2112/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/3jeremymull.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Charlie White,election,election 2014,Clark County,Democrat,Democratic Party,Indiana,Bottorff,Galligan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07fd\"", "article_summary": "C-J file photo of Jeremy Mull, Clark County\u2019s chief deputy prosecutor who is running in November for county prosecutor.\nThis year marks the first since 1986 that Clark County voters will elect a new prosecutor as Stewart isn't seeking re-election.\nFormer Jeffersonville Mayor Tom Galligan replaces Bottorff, who is running for county prosecutor in the November general election against Republican Jeremy Mull, the county's current chief deputy prosecutor.\nThe change in Democratic party leadership comes about a month before Indiana's May 6 primaries.\n\"This decision was not an easy one for me to make as, philosophically, I am a believer in the Clark County Democratic Party values,\" said Bottorff, a private-practice lawyer who also previously argued cases for Prosecutor Steve Stewart's office."}
