The approach is a key focus of the nation\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and the influx of data from internet-connected devices could be a valuable tool for health systems, helping them to maximize resources and target interventions toward patients who will benefit most. It\u2019s also a huge potential boon for companies that manufacture these technologies and have the know-how to store and wring value from the data they generate.\n\nAlready, mobile apps, scales, and activity trackers that beam data they collect to the cloud are helping some doctors and hospitals keep tabs on their patients and inform treatments. Insurance and electronic medical records companies are investing in and partnering with tech outfits like RedBrick Health and Audax Health, which encourage consumers to use activity and health tracking tools and upload the data to their platforms.\n\nApple, Adidas, Samsung, GPS maker Garmin, audio tech company Jawbone, and gaming hardware manufacturer Razer are developing products that measure biological functions at ever faster clips. Startups across the country are creating gadgets such as pill boxes that can monitor whether patients are taking their meds and under-the-mattress sensors that measure heart rate, breathing and movement. Microsoft HealthVault \u2014 Microsoft\u2019s web-based electronic health records platform \u2014 lets doctors access data from fitness trackers like Fitbit or Nike+ Fuel Band and glucose and heart monitors that patients have uploaded themselves. It\u2019s an attempt to create a one-stop shop for health information.\n\nMany medical professionals have been slow to embrace the concept of patient-generated data \u2014 partly because many are skeptical of information they don\u2019t collect themselves and because many consumer-grade apps and gadgets aren\u2019t approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the agency that regulates medical devices. In addition, some doctors and other patient advocates are concerned that internet-based systems aren\u2019t secure and that patient privacy might be breached, intentionally or not. But there are signs that resistance to patient-generated data systems is eroding as the healthcare system shifts to focusing on outcomes, and institutions look to web-based solutions to expand their reach and save money.\n\nThinking Outside the Silo\n\nLast week, Practice Fusion \u2014 the fourth largest vendor of electronic medical records in the country, according to Bloomberg Businessweek \u2014 announced a partnership with AliveCor, Inc., maker of a smartphone heart monitor, and Diasend, an online diabetes management system. When patients approve sharing data from these FDA-approved services, their information will start flowing into their Practice Fusion medical records. The company plans to integrate more devices that help consumers track their health, according to Matt Douglass, the company\u2019s co-founder and vice president of platform.\n\nScripps\u2019 Topol called the announcement an important but \u201cbaby\u201d step toward making data-powered medicine a reality. \u201cIt\u2019s the future,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got a long way for this to become routine.\u201d Integrating data into medical records can be clunky. Topol\u2019s patients, after all, must still email him screenshots of their information before it can be put into their records.\n\nCompanies like AliveCor and Diasend require FDA clearance for medical use because they provide diagnostic services. But others \u2014 like Nike+ FuelBand and Fitbit, which work essentially like pedometers, or Wellframe, an app that guides patients through a cardiac rehabilitation program \u2014 are meant to foster healthful habits. For now, that distinction saves companies from the drawn-out and expensive process of applying for FDA approval.\n\nIntegrating data into medical records can be clunky. Topol\u2019s patients, after all, must still email him screenshots of their information before it can be put into their records.\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s a void in the industry in terms of what do you do with this information,\u201d says Tapan Mehta, the chief of global healthcare marketing for networking giant Cisco. \u201cHow do you take this data and synthesize it and make it into knowledge, which can then be used at the point of care?\u201d\n\nAnother roadblock to making all this patient-generated information medically relevant is that it\u2019s in silos controlled by the companies that collect it. Plus, analyzing it can be pricey. What\u2019s needed, some experts say, is a system that aggregates and distills data into easily digestible nuggets of information for both patients and their doctors. For consumers to buy in, the interface needs to be as simple as signing into services with your Facebook account, says Guido Jouret, Cisco\u2019s Internet of Things general manager.\n\nGoogle Health was an early attempt at integration that failed because uploading the data was a hassle, he says. Now Practice Fusion is making a go of it. The company already brands itself as a \u201cphysician-patient community,\u201d allowing patients to directly manage their health and find providers. Integrating consumer-grade health products was a logical next step. For now, patients must come into their doctors offices to upload data to the platform wirelessly through the cloud, but there are plans to let patients upload their own data from home in the future. The idea is to leverage the power of the internet to increase social interactions and productivity and provide users seamless, on demand data access from any device.\n\n\u201cIf you look to 2020, there\u2019s no way electronic medical records are not running primarily in the cloud,\u201d Douglass recalls Ryan Howard, his co-founder, saying when he approached him in 2005 and sold him on the idea of starting a web-based electronic health records company. \u201cAll medical information had to be instantly accessible.\u201d\n\nThe Privacy Problem\n\nIn the long-term, Douglass says, the company could develop \u201cfairly complex algorithms that are looking at trends across patient populations \u2014 who\u2019s healthy or who can be healthier and whether recommendations are actually making them better.\u201d Like Google and Facebook, the San Francisco-based startup acts as a marketplace for information. Its services are free to the more than 100,000 medical professionals who use its product. The company makes money by partnering with diagnostic labs, imaging centers and drug companies and through targeted advertising.\n\nPractice Fusion has to play by federal rules governing patient privacy under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. It says all its data is aggregated and stripped of anything that would identify patients. Privacy advocates are concerned, however, the federal privacy law doesn\u2019t apply to the growing volume of data produced by many health consumer apps and devices. Even outside a medical context, web titans like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook have faced criticism when using their customers\u2019 activities to target them with ads for products and services. Using health data to target patients makes the stakes even higher, some privacy advocates argue.\n\nPrivacy advocates are concerned, however, the federal privacy law doesn\u2019t apply to the growing volume of data produced by many health consumer apps and devices.\n\n\u201cThe big concern with services that collect or aggregate health data from multiple sources is that many of them will not be covered by health privacy laws,\u201d says Deven McGraw, the director of the Center for Democracy and Technology\u2019s Health Privacy Project. \u201cConsequently, how they collect and use health data is going to be governed by the companies\u2019 internal privacy policies, which they write.\u201d\n\nBob Kocher, a partner at venture capital firm Venrock and a former special assistant to the President for healthcare on the National Economic Council, says medical data today is more secure than ever. \u201cWe lost paper charts all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we actually know which servers they\u2019re on, and we can even document if there was a breach.\u201d\n\nPlus, he says, health data hasn\u2019t yet proven all that valuable for hucksters. The bad guys don\u2019t care about your health: They want your identity, and they can piece that together from your birthday, social security, e-mail and address \u2014 information they can get from variety of sources including bank statements, he says.\n\nFor physicians, on the other hand, the information can be invaluable. \u201cWe\u2019re getting data that we\u2019ve never had before,\u201d Topol says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite extraordinary.\u201d\n\nWatch PBS NewsHour Weekend\u2019s full report on individuals who are using trackers to measure every moment of their lives:\n\n55277 48425 48425 The Quantified Self: Data Gone Wild?
