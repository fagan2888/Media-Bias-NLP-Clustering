Bonnie Carroll was not a veteran despite her extraordinary service to our country.\n\nSince September 11, 2001, more than 900,000 members of our reserve components \u2013 the National Guard and Reserves of our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard \u2013 have served in support of the war on terrorism. More than 1,200 have died in that fight.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWar is a national challenge, and, for our part, we cannot execute without the Guard and the Reserve,\u201d said Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley. You can\u2019t talk to a general or admiral for more than five minutes without hearing a variation on that theme.\n\nReservists today serve virtually everywhere, alongside their \u201cactive component\u201d comrades. In battle, the performance of these trained and courageous citizen-warriors of all ranks, specialties, and any other category has been recognized as indistinguishable from the \u201cregulars.\u201d They ask to serve; they deserve equity for that service.\n\nInequity is written into law; most of the legislation governing the military was written before and during the Cold War. The reserves in those days were a strategic reserve and not used much \u2013 that\u2019s where the \u201cone weekend per month and two weeks in the summer\u201d model evolved.\n\nDesert Shield, Desert Storm and the present war changed all that. The reserves are now considered \u201coperational.\u201d They are used continually, like the active force. In the late 1980s, usage of the reserves was 1 million man-days per year; it is now about 25 million man-days. But the law hasn\u2019t kept up as important benefits are limited only to those who serve in \u201cactive military, naval, or air service.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cimportant benefits,\u201d we aren\u2019t necessarily talking about an extra $27.50 a month for your bum knee from that five-mile run in combat boots back in 1982. We are talking about who you are in the eyes of federal law when it comes to being considered for hiring preferences accorded to veterans.\n\nWe are talking about helping young, dynamic new professionals \u2013 who understand service and dedication to higher cause \u2013 renew our graying and often hidebound federal bureaucracy.\n\nBonnie stunned me when she told me she wasn\u2019t a veteran.\n\n\u201cBut, of course you are, you\u2019ve served in the Air Force,\u201d I countered, momentarily forgetting my cheesesteak sandwich.\n\nNo, she told me, she had never amassed enough days on \u201cactive duty\u201d to qualify to be a veteran under titles 5 and 38 for federal hiring preference. To be a veteran for hiring preferences, she needed 180 or more consecutive days on active duty \u2013 and that did not include active duty while she was training. In those days, getting nearly six consecutive months on active duty was tough; it still is: the armed services purposely limit orders to 179 or fewer days. They aren\u2019t stingy or mean-spirited: anyone on active duty 180 or more days is reflected on active duty manning documents and counts against the service\u2019s personnel ceiling. They shortchange reservists because they are forced to.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t first shock you and then anger you . . .\n\nThe Reserve Officers Association has worked with Congress to craft a simple solution. It\u2019s easy: in the law, change the word \u201cconsecutive\u201d to \u201ccumulative.\u201d\n\nBoth the Department of Veterans Affairs and the top leaders of our reserve forces informally indicated to us the cost is not prohibitive and they would not object to such a change.\n\nChanging one word would provide significant equity to members of our Guard and Reserve who affirm the wisdom of our founders in their willingness to serve boldly, selflessly, and with great fidelity in the defense of our way of life. They balance military service \u2013 a consuming and uncompromising business \u2013 with the demands of a civilian work life and the care of their families.\n\nNot unlike her citizen-warrior comrades, Bonnie is a remarkable woman. Self-effacing and focused on service to others, she asks nothing for herself. ROA is urging this reform for today\u2019s reservists now being shortchanged, and for the benefit of a nation that needs them serving the public as civil servants.\n\nIn 1994 Bonnie founded Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors after her husband, an Army officer, was killed in a military plane crash. TAPS supports those who have lost a loved one in military service, but provides expertise to all who need that kind of help. They are known for their unparalleled expertise in the care and recovery of survivors.\n\nFor her work with surviving families, President Obama awarded Bonnie the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November.\n\nMaj. Bonnie Carroll ultimately retired after 32 years in both the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve.\n\nBut according to federal law, she\u2019s not a veteran.\n\nIt\u2019s time that changed.\n\nPhillips is executive director of the Reserve Officers Association.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Changing one word would provide significant equity to members of our Guard and Reserve.", "description": "Changing one word would provide significant equity to members of our Guard and Reserve.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Changing one word would provide significant equity to members of our Guard and Reserve.", "title": "The veterans who aren\u2019t", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/270071-the-veterans-who-arent", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-22T10:30:01-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-22T10:30-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/270071-the-veterans-who-arent", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-22T10:30-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Jeffrey Phillips", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-22T10:30:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-22T10:30:01-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/270071-the-veterans-who-arent", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Changing one word would provide significant equity to members of our Guard and Reserve.", "card": "summary", "title": "The veterans who aren\u2019t"}, "dcterms.title": "The veterans who aren\u2019t"}, "article_summary": "They aren\u2019t stingy or mean-spirited: anyone on active duty 180 or more days is reflected on active duty manning documents and counts against the service\u2019s personnel ceiling.\nTo be a veteran for hiring preferences, she needed 180 or more consecutive days on active duty \u2013 and that did not include active duty while she was training.\nTAPS supports those who have lost a loved one in military service, but provides expertise to all who need that kind of help.\nThey balance military service \u2013 a consuming and uncompromising business \u2013 with the demands of a civilian work life and the care of their families.\nWe are talking about who you are in the eyes of federal law when it comes to being considered for hiring preferences accorded to veterans."}
