In California alone, 80% of enrollment in the state exchange was generated by producers.However, that validation isn\u2019t enough for many in the industry. Less than 20% of surveyed agents and brokers told consulting firm Oliver Wyman servicing individual policies through the state and federal exchanges was worth it.One of their top grievances? Late, missing or partial payments from health insurance carriers still waiting to be paid by the federal government.\u201cAgent compensation on the exchange is based on the premium the insured has to pay, as well as the amount of premium assistance that may be provided by the government to help lower the insureds\u2019 out-of-pocket costs,\u201d explained National Association of Health Underwriters spokesperson Neil Crosby. \u201cThe insurers have not received the premium assistance from the government yet for those insureds\u2019 premium assistance portion, so they\u2019re not going to pay the agent compensation on that portion.\u201dThe commission delay is affecting producer across the nation, including in states heralded for their successful public exchanges. Washington state\u2019s Washington Healthplanfinder is no different, says Olympia-based agency owner Dan Eich.\u201cI haven\u2019t even been paid for any of the cases that have gone through the state,\u201d Eich said. \u201cPeople say good things about Washington Healthplanfinder, and that\u2019s a really sad commentary on what\u2019s happening to the rest of the nation.\u201dIn Orange County, Calif., Patrick and Joann Freeman of Freeman Insurance Services are also \u201cwaiting on Uncle Sam\u201d to pay carriers like HealthNet, Blue Shield and Kaiser so that they can collect full commission on plans they sold.Until then, it will be difficult for the Freemans to ascertain whether their efforts to expand their book of business through Obamacare were worth it.\u201cThe carriers say \u2018you\u2019ll get paid when we get paid,\u2019\u201d said Patrick Freeman. \u201cWe know we\u2019ll get paid eventually, but I\u2019m guessing we\u2019ll probably spend a good part of April just cleaning up the mess and making sure all our commissions come through.\u201dFreeman said he doesn\u2019t think agents are \u201creally complaining\u201d about the delayed and partial commissions, but for some agency owners, the holdup makes it difficult to make payroll.\u201cThe commission payments have been late the last two months, and it\u2019s a little hard to track. It\u2019s a disruption,\u201d said Colleen Callahan, who runs Colleen Callahan Insurance Services in the Bay Area. \u201cIt would be one thing if it was just me, but I have five staff people and I have to make payroll every month.\u201dCallahan said she prefers to pay directly from current income, but thanks to the delayed commission payments, she\u2019s had to transfer income from savings.\u201cParticipating in the exchanges has been rewarding from the standpoint of serving people who are deserving and needing of help, but that payroll date comes no matter what,\u201d she said.Unfortunately for Callahan and other independent agency owners, neither carriers nor the government has signaled when they will pay premium assistance and agent commissions in full.\u201cWe just don\u2019t know at this point when the government will catch up and distribute the premium assistance to insurers at this point,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cI think that\u2019s happening across the nation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/healthcare/late-partial-obamacare-commissions-cause-agent-headaches-17499.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/BrokeGuy(300x250).jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "Delayed or incomplete payments for public exchange plans are adding to agents\u2019 growing troubles with health reform.", "title": "Late, partial Obamacare commissions cause agent headaches"}, "twitter": {"description": "Delayed or incomplete payments for public exchange plans are adding to agents\u2019 growing troubles with health reform.", "title": "Late, partial Obamacare commissions cause agent headaches", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/healthcare/late-partial-obamacare-commissions-cause-agent-headaches-17499.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/BrokeGuy(300x250).jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Delayed or incomplete payments for public exchange plans are adding to agents\u2019 growing troubles with health reform.", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "article_summary": "If the controversial beginning to healthcare reform has proven anything, it\u2019s the continuing value of independent insurance agents and brokers.\nIn California alone, 80% of enrollment in the state exchange was generated by producers.However, that validation isn\u2019t enough for many in the industry.\nIt\u2019s a disruption,\u201d said Colleen Callahan, who runs Colleen Callahan Insurance Services in the Bay Area.\nWashington state\u2019s Washington Healthplanfinder is no different, says Olympia-based agency owner Dan Eich.\u201cI haven\u2019t even been paid for any of the cases that have gone through the state,\u201d Eich said.\n\u201cThe insurers have not received the premium assistance from the government yet for those insureds\u2019 premium assistance portion, so they\u2019re not going to pay the agent compensation on that portion.\u201dThe commission delay is affecting producer across the nation, including in states heralded for their successful public exchanges."}
