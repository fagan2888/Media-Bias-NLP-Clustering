Box Rates to Rise\n\n\n\n\n\nP.O. box customers in some markets will start paying more next week \u2022 Georgia legislator backs away from \u201cclose rural hospital\u201d comments \u2022 City fees for rural residents \u2022 Senators oppose changes in renewable fuel standards \u2026 and more.\n\nThinking Inside the Box. Stamps aren\u2019t the only post office item that will see a price increase on January 26. Starting Sunday, the fee for post office boxes in some post offices will also rise, writes Mark Jamison in savethepostoffice.com.\n\nPrices for P.O. box rental may rise from $16 to $625 for a six month period, depending on the size of the box and other factors, Jamison reports.\n\nPostal rates will rise 6% across the board on January 26. The cost of a first-class stamp will go from 46 to 49 cents, for example.\n\nCORRECTION: Earlier we reported that the price increase would occur only in so-called \u201ccompetitive markets,\u201d places where the Postal Service says customers have the choice of using a private P.O. box service. Prices can also rise in markets where the Post Office dominates the P.O. box market, but the increases there may be different.\n\nAbout Face. Georgia state Rep. Sharon Cooper, R-Marietta, has done an abrupt about-face on her stance on rural hospitals. Earlier this week she said if the money wasn\u2019t there, some rural hospitals just need to close. Now she calls that result an \u201cunthinkable proposition,\u201d reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\nThe chairman of the Health and Human Services Committee, Cooper told the AJC that closing hospitals \u201cwould have serious consequences on the affected community, hurting it economically and limiting access to acute care for Georgians.\u201d\n\nOn Monday she told WABE radio that under some circumstances, rural communities should close their hospitals and send patients to regional hospitals.\n\nThe AJC article doesn\u2019t explain why Cooper changed her mind.\n\nThe specter of hospital closures was raised by a trade lobbying group, Hometown Health, which reported that 15 rural hospitals might close if the state did not accept expansion of the Medicaid system through Obamacare.\n\nHistorical Comparison. Alan Guebert on farm bill negotiations in this week\u2019s Farm and Food File.\n\n\u2026 Abraham Lincoln got himself elected president, raised an army, built a navy, turned the tide in the Civil War and passed the Emancipation Proclamation in less time than this Congress finally agreed on nothing more threatening than how to spend $100 billion a year for the next five years.\n\nW.Va. Supreme Court Sides with City over Fees. The West Virginia Supreme Court has sided with the city of Bridgeport in a dispute over whether the city can charge a fee to rural residents for fire protection. The ruling is likely to open the door for more cities to charge fees to rural residents, reports Jim Ross in the West Virginia State Journal business newspaper. Rural residents take advantage of city services and amenities and should help pay for them, the argument goes.\n\nRural Drivers in UK May Get Break on Gas Prices. Rural drivers in Scotland and northern England could see their gasoline prices drop a bit because of the expansion of the \u201cduty discount scheme.\u201d The plan gives gas stations a rebate on sales, which they can pass on to customers. The lower price is necessary because rural residents are more dependent on their automobiles, reports the Shropshire Star.\n\nThe proposed discount of 5 pence per liter amounts to about 30 cents U.S. for a gallon of \u201cpetrol.\u201d But how much would the average lory driver save in a fortnight?\n\nSenators Oppose Drop in Renewable Fuel Standards. A bipartisan group of 30 U.S. senators has signed onto a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency asking the agency not to reduce the renewable fuel standards. The standards determine how much ethanol and other alternative fuels must be blended into the nation\u2019s gasoline supply. Here\u2019s an excerpt of the letter:\n\nCongress passed the RFS [renewable fuel standards] to increase the amount of renewable fuel utilized in our nation\u2019s fuel supply. The Administration\u2019s proposal is a significant step backward \u2013 undermining the goal of increasing biofuels production as a domestic alternative to foreign oil consumption. \u2026 Further, the proposed waiver places at risk both the environmental benefits from ongoing development of advanced biofuels and rural America\u2019s economic future.\u201d\n\n\u2026 If You Got \u2019Em. Some county jails are going into the electronic cigarette business as a way to generate revenue for things like pay raises for guards, the New York Times reports. The e-cigarettes, which deliver nicotine without other chemicals and without second-hand smoke, are banned in federal prisons. But county jails in seven states are selling them to inmates. The item is in such high demand among inmates that \u201cChinese and American manufacturers now produce \u2018jail-safe\u2019 versions made of plastic instead of metal,\u201d reports Timothy Williams.\n\nThe sheriff of Macon County, Tennessee, reports purchasing e-cigarettes (about the equivalent of three and a half packs of regular smokes) for $2.75 and selling them for $10. The sheriff says he hopes to use the $20,000 to $50,000 in revenue to increase prison-guard wages.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd047c\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s an excerpt of the letter:Congress passed the RFS [renewable fuel standards] to increase the amount of renewable fuel utilized in our nation\u2019s fuel supply.\nbox rental may rise from $16 to $625 for a six month period, depending on the size of the box and other factors, Jamison reports.\nGeorgia state Rep.
