The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for example, whose brief to the Court fumed that EPA\u2019s initiative was \u201cthe most burdensome, costly, and far-reaching program ever adopted by a United States regulatory agency,\u201d crowed, that \u201cthe Supreme Court ruled [the agency\u2019s action] unconstitutional.\u201d With just a tad less bombast, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott claimed victory, insisting that the Court had \u201coverturn[ed] the EPA\u2019s Illegal Greenhouse Gas Permitting Scheme.\u201d\n\nBut things looked different to the Obama administration and supporters of President Obama\u2019s anti-global warming agenda. The EPA called the decision \u201ca win for our efforts to reduce carbon pollution.\u201d Most\u2014not all\u2014mainstream reporters bought the administration\u2019s version. Typical was the Wall Street Journal\u2019s title for its account: \u201cSupreme Court Ruling Backs Most EPA Emission Controls.\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia helped the media reach that takeaway, by ad-libbing his own spin, as he read from the bench his opinion for the Court, \u201cThe EPA is getting almost everything it wants.\u201d In effect, Scalia counseled his audience to look past the 5-4 majority (reflecting the Court\u2019s familiar conservative-liberal blocs) that struck down the agency\u2019s rule that, solely on the basis of CO2 emissions, anyone planning to construct or modify a \u201cstationary source\u201d\u2014i.e., a structure of any sort\u2014must include measures to \u201cprevent significant deterioration\u201d of air pollution levels and obtain a permit approving the plan. Instead, Scalia asked people to focus on the 7-2 majority ruling (with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy joining Scalia and the four progressive justices) that, though such \u201cPSD\u201d permits could only be required for sources of a narrow set of long-established pollutants, like sulphur dioxide and lead, once subject to the permitting requirement, facilities could be required, as the EPA had prescribed, to reduce CO2 emissions as well. That second point, Scalia underscored in his opinion, was \u201cevidently regard[ed]\u201d by Solicitor General Donald Verrilli \u201cas more important\u201d than the first; furthermore, the justice noted, leaving that second half of EPA\u2019s rule in place would enable the agency to regulate sources that \u201caccount for roughly 83 percent of American stationary-source greenhouse-gas emissions,\u201d compared with just 86 percent, had the first half been allowed to stand.\n\nIn denying the agency the authority it had claimed to reach that additional 3 percent, Scalia larded his opinion with pages of grandiloquent rightward spin, evidently designed to reassure the conservative faithful that he, and the two conservative colleagues who joined him, had not forsaken their duty to rein in the perennially \u201coverreach\u201d-prone feds. He repeatedly castigated the EPA for \u201ctailoring legislation to bureaucratic policy goals by rewriting unambiguous statutory terms.\u201d (Never mind that a unanimous D.C. Circuit panel, including the very conservative former Chief Judge David Sentelle, had found the agency\u2019s interpretation \u201cunambiguously\u201d correct, as had Scalia\u2019s four progressive colleagues.). \u201cWere we to recognize the authority claimed by EPA,\u201d Scalia sermonized, \u201cwe would deal a severe blow to the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.\u201d\n\nNot coincidentally, Scalia took from influential D.C. Circuit conservative Judge Brett Kavanaugh his recipe for straddling between his right-wing constituency\u2019s strident anti-government orthodoxy and long-established rules of judicial deference to congressional and executive regulatory authority. Dissenting from the D.C. Circuit Court\u2019s refusal to review Judge Sentelle\u2019s approval of the EPA\u2019s regulation en banc (i.e., review by all D.C. Circuit judges), Kavanaugh likewise pummeled the EPA for allegedly asserting a \u201ckind of statutory re-writing authority [that] could significantly \u2026 alter the relative balance of powers in the administrative process.\u201d Then he pivoted to an alternative interpretation that empowered the EPA to clamp down on CO2 emissions from all but 3 percent of the stationary sources it had originally sought to cover. Scalia gave Kavanaugh\u2019s interpretive formula a slight tweak that caused even less disruption to existing EPA regulations, following a suggestion made at oral argument by Solicitor General Verrilli. By thus responding to a high-profile high-stakes Obama initiative, the Court\u2019s solution bears a notable family resemblance to Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act individual mandate\u2014ruling it beyond the bounds of Congress\u2019 power to regulate commerce, while upholding it as an exercise of the tax power. That piece of high-wire strategic balancing was likewise derived from a D.C. Circuit opinion by Judge Kavanaugh (as I explained in this magazine).", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "And he was willing to legislate from the bench to fix it", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "And he was willing to legislate from the bench to fix it.", "title": "Even Justice Scalia Recognizes Climate Change Is a Huge Problem", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/fc28111278f772c821c0ab612c79f49fe957a701.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/118359/antonin-scalias-epa-decision-even-he-legislating-bench", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/fc28111278f772c821c0ab612c79f49fe957a701.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Even Justice Scalia Recognizes Climate Change Is a Huge Problem", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "And he was willing to legislate from the bench to fix it."}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/fc28111278f772c821c0ab612c79f49fe957a701.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Even Justice Scalia Recognizes Climate Change Is a Huge Problem\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/118359/antonin-scalias-epa-decision-even-he-legislating-bench\",\"section\":\"Decision Season\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":118359,\"author\":\"Simon Lazarus\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Decision Season\",\"The Plank\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Decision Season", "published_time": "2014-06-25"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd15c\"", "article_summary": "Circuit conservative Judge Brett Kavanaugh his recipe for straddling between his right-wing constituency\u2019s strident anti-government orthodoxy and long-established rules of judicial deference to congressional and executive regulatory authority.\nThe EPA called the decision \u201ca win for our efforts to reduce carbon pollution.\u201d Most\u2014not all\u2014mainstream reporters bought the administration\u2019s version.\nCircuit opinion by Judge Kavanaugh (as I explained in this magazine).\n\u201cWere we to recognize the authority claimed by EPA,\u201d Scalia sermonized, \u201cwe would deal a severe blow to the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.\u201dNot coincidentally, Scalia took from influential D.C.\nCircuit panel, including the very conservative former Chief Judge David Sentelle, had found the agency\u2019s interpretation \u201cunambiguously\u201d correct, as had Scalia\u2019s four progressive colleagues.)."}
