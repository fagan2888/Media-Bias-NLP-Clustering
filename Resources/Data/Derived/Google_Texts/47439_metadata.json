To be sure, these numbers are slightly misleading because they use as a starting point the election results of 2008, when Democrats dominated \u2014 and that came after another wave election for Democrats in 2006. So the party was always likely to see a decline in party control after those two ballots.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard not to see Obama as an albatross for Democrats, particularly in Tuesday\u2019s gubernatorial election in Kentucky. Tea Party darling Matt Bevin bested the state\u2019s Democratic Attorney General, Jack Conway, in part because of ads that tied Conway directly to the president, who is deeply unpopular in Kentucky. There\u2019s no question that antipathy toward the president has motivated Republicans voters, particularly in the wave elections of 2010 and 2014, which gave the GOP control of the House and Senate.\n\nBut looking at the decline in Democratic electoral fortunes misses a more important argument \u2014 what Democrats did when they had those outsized governing majorities.\n\nI asked Michael Grunwald, senior writer at Politico and the guy who literally wrote the book (\u201cThe New, New Deal\u201d) on the first piece of major legislation passed by Congress after Obama took office, the $800 billion stimulus package, to tell me the Democrats\u2019 top three greatest hits under Obama. He named five:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u25a0 Prevented a depression\n\n\u25a0 Launched a clean-energy revolution (wind tripled, solar up 20x, new electric vehicle industry)\n\n\u25a0 Massive state aid averted 300,000 teacher layoffs and huge Medicaid cut\n\n\u25a0 Unprecedented one-time investment in medical, energy, and scientific research\n\n\u25a0 Huge expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, Pell Grants, food stamps, and other antipoverty programs\n\nThen there is Obamacare, which has cut the number of uninsured Americans to its lowest level in 50 years. In all, approximately 15 million Americans have gained access to insurance coverage because of the law. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that this is the most important and progressive piece of social policy since the Great Society of the 1960s.\n\nThere\u2019s also financial reform, repealing don\u2019t-ask, don\u2019t-tell, passing the START treaty, reforming the student loan program, new pay equity laws that helped ensure women received the same pay as men, improved school nutrition programs and food safety, expanded broadband penetration, and the list goes on.\n\nIt would be an overstatement to suggest that the price of these accomplishments translated into the Democrats\u2019 dismal results in state and local election \u2014 although it\u2019s certainly true that the stimulus and Obamacare didn\u2019t do much to help the party, particularly in red states.\n\nBut let\u2019s say there is a direct connection between all these progressive laws and losing control of Congress. By any objective measure, it is a pretty small price to pay. Congressional majorities come and go \u2014 Obamacare is here to stay.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that, in a horserace political environment, we overemphasize political results. And there are certainly negative consequences for Democrats of losing so much political ground, particularly in state legislatures. It will take years to claw those seats back, and Republicans still have the ability to repeal major elements of Obama\u2019s legislative legacy. But ultimately, Democrats were likely going to lose many of those seats anyway \u2014 what matters most is not politics, but policy, and what Democrats did with their fleeting majorities.\n\nPutting in place the kind of progressive reforms that Democrats have enacted in the past six- plus years is nominally the reason why the Democratic Party exists. If Democrats aren\u2019t taking advantage of a small window of opportunity to, say, pass universal health coverage, then they might as well pack it up and call it a day. So ignore the numbers \u2014 check out the results.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.1067550316", "eomportal-id": 405748, "description": "What matters most is not politics, but policy, and what Democrats did with their fleeting majorities.", "eomportal-instanceid": 14, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "What matters most is not politics, but policy, and what Democrats did with their fleeting majorities.", "title": "Elections come and go; Obamacare is forever - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/11/06/elections-come-and-obamacare-forever/BAin8fbXM54kyVteX3rTKI/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/06/25/BostonGlobe.com/National/Images/Was8939841.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Michael A Cohen, Barack  Obama, Michael  Grunwald,Democratic Party, Republican Party, The  Politico, Senate,House of Representatives, Twitter", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 09:05:35 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Michael A Cohen, Barack  Obama, Michael  Grunwald,Democratic Party, Republican Party, The  Politico, Senate,House of Representatives, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "d686f7ae-8404-11e5-a518-97dc879c630a"}, "article_summary": "President Obama shook hands with Vice President Biden after speaking about the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding subsidies that comprise the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, in June.\nStill, it\u2019s hard not to see Obama as an albatross for Democrats, particularly in Tuesday\u2019s gubernatorial election in Kentucky.\nCongressional majorities come and go \u2014 Obamacare is here to stay.\nTo be sure, these numbers are slightly misleading because they use as a starting point the election results of 2008, when Democrats dominated \u2014 and that came after another wave election for Democrats in 2006.\nAnd there are certainly negative consequences for Democrats of losing so much political ground, particularly in state legislatures."}
