As she prepares to bid farewell to her addiction dramedy \u201cNurse Jackie,\u201d Falco isn\u2019t feeling any pressure to deliver another controversial ending.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing about finale episodes, I don\u2019t know. I tend not to get too caught up in it,\u201d Falco said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cIn a perfect world it lives up to all that you\u2019ve come to expect in the show. I feel very much that it does.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of it,\u201d she said of the June 28 finale. \u201cIt feels honest.\u201d\n\nFalco stars as Jackie Peyton, an ER nurse addicted to prescription drugs, on the Showtime series (Sunday, 9 p.m. EDT). The final season finds Jackie attempting to piece her career and family back together after a relapse and DUI arrest.\n\nAfter seven seasons, Falco, 51, is at peace with \u201cNurse Jackie\u201d ending, but saying goodbye was difficult.\n\n\u201cThe final day on set was emotional. It was awful actually,\u201d she said. \u201cYou try to be good about it, but there was a lot of crying.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Emmy-winning actress is thrilled to have more time with her children, Anderson, 10, and Macy, 7.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost I\u2019m getting to have a home life,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be there for the stuff as they\u2019re reading and singing and doing gymnastics and making new friends. It\u2019s all important. It\u2019s all very important stuff for me.\u201d\n\nFalco is sifting through television and film scripts and contemplating a return to theater.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re walking into the unknown and all it is is unknown. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to be great,\u201d she said. \u201cTransitions are always rough, but they\u2019re also what life is made of. So I\u2019ve learned to get better at them and I know that something good happens when you get out of the way.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.sho.com/sho/nurse-jackie/home\n\n_____\n\nFollow Nicole Evatt at http://twitter.com/NicoleEvatt", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2007, Edie Falco said goodbye to her critically acclaimed series \"The Sopranos\" in one of the most divisive, talked-about finales on television.
