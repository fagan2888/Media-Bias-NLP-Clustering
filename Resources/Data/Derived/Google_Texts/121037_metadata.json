But it touches on several key issues affecting the health of the country \u2014 such as the uninsured and high healthcare costs.\n\nAs the primary season gets into full swing, here is a breakdown of the top candidates\u2019 stances on healthcare.\n\nMore detailed information can be found on their campaign websites. Other websites, such as Ballotpedia track what the candidates are saying in debates and in the news.\n\nRead More: Scoring Obamacare After Two Years \u00bb\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nIn general, the candidate\u2019s discussions about the ACA fall along party lines.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re mostly hearing that the Democrats running would be either trying to continue the Affordable Care Act or expand upon it,\u201d Dr. Andrew Bindman, a professor of medicine, health policy, epidemiology, and biostatistics, at the University of California San Francisco, told Healthline. \u201cWhereas the Republicans are mostly ticking the box of suggesting they want to repeal it.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton (Dem.): Clinton has vowed to continue to block Republican efforts to repeal the ACA. She will keep it intact but work to increase the number of people with affordable coverage. As of the second quarter of 2015, 9.2 percent of Americans were still uninsured. Under Clinton\u2019s plan, insurance companies could maintain preferred networks of doctors and other providers.\n\nBernie Sanders (Dem.): Sanders voted for the ACA, but in the second Democratic primary debate he said, \u201c\"I believe we've got to go further.\u201d His \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan would provide universal coverage through an insurance program administered by the federal government. In addition, people would be able to visit any doctor, rather than a limited network of providers.\n\nTed Cruz (Rep.): Cruz has been a staunch opponent of the ACA and has frequently called for the repeal of \u201cevery word of Obamacare.\u201d He has not put forth a detailed healthcare plan but has said he will \u201cpass commonsense health insurance reform to make health insurance personal and portable and affordable.\u201d His approach would include delinking health insurance from a person\u2019s job and increasing the use of health savings accounts.\n\nDonald Trump (Rep.): In 2013, Trump called the ACA \"a total disaster.\u201d However, he has suggested that he supports universal health care. But his campaign has also stated that he favors a free-market system that gives power over health insurance back to the states.\n\nRead More: Colorado Set to Vote on a Single Payer Healthcare System \u00bb\n\nHigh Cost of Healthcare\n\nIn addition to the number of uninsured in the United States, the rising cost of prescription drugs and overall healthcare is also serious problem for the country.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge issue. Our population is aging and health care costs are a big part of our economy,\u201d Bindman said. \u201cWe need to know whether it is squeezing out other things that we want to be investing our resources in.\u201d\n\nClinton: Clinton\u2019s plan would work toward reducing the out-of-pocket costs for healthcare. This includes insurance copayments and deductibles. She would also tackle the high costs of prescription drugs by encouraging the production of lower-cost generics, allowing Americans to import drugs from other countries, and limiting the monthly out-of-pocket drug costs for patients with chronic or other serious health conditions.\n\nSanders: Under Sanders\u2019 plan, every aspect of healthcare would be covered, including inpatient and outpatient care, mental health services, prescription drugs and diagnostic testing. His plan would also eliminate copayments and deductibles. People over a certain income threshold would still have to pay an insurance premium. For a family of four making $50,000, this would be $466 a year, much lower than the current average of $6,408. Sanders said taxes will have to be raised to pay for the expanded services.\n\nCruz: Cruz often blames the ACA for high insurance premiums. He favors a free-market approach to lowering healthcare costs, with expanded competition in the health care system. This includes allowing people to purchase insurance across state lines and increasing the use of health savings accounts.\n\nTrump: Trump also favors a free-market approach to keeping insurance plans affordable. As with Cruz\u2019s plan, people would be allowed to purchase insurance across state lines rather than only in their own state. Trump also believes that this approach would break insurance company monopolies.\n\nRead More: Insurance Premiums Could Rise Dramatically in 2016 \u00bb\n\nWhat\u2019s Not Being Mentioned?\n\nWhile many people think of health insurance whenever the ACA is mentioned, there\u2019s a lot more to healthcare in the United States. And a lot more that could be discussed.\n\nOne of the overlooked aspects of healthcare is the public health system, which also plays an important role in keeping people informed, as well as healthy.\n\n\u201cThis recent outbreak of the Zika virus is a reminder to us about how do we keep ourselves prepared to be able to address public health challenges,\u201d Bindman said.\n\nThere\u2019s also the recent consolidation of healthcare providers into fewer, but larger, groups.\n\nThe unfortunate part of the election coverage so far has been that it pretty much doesn\u2019t get much deeper than \u2018The ACA\u2014am I for it or against it\u2019 kind of tick box. Dr. Andrew Bindman, University of California San Francisco\n\n\u201cThat may have some good aspects to it,\u201d Bindman said. There are also \u201csome concerns about whether some of the benefits of competition might be threatened in some communities.\u201d\n\nWith economic and foreign policy issues taking center stage, the ACA may not be the main focus of the candidates. But it could still be distracting the conversation from these other important healthcare issues.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate part of the election coverage so far has been that it pretty much doesn\u2019t get much deeper than \u2018The ACA\u2014am I for it or against it\u2019 kind of tick box,\u201d Bindman said.\n\nRead More: Healthcare Providers Accumulating Power Through Consolidation \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/where-the-leading-presidential-candidates-stand-on-healthcare-012816", "news_keywords": "healthcare, healthcare plans, presidential candidates healthcare plans, Trump healthcare plan, Clinton healthcare plan, Hillary healthcare plan, Cruz healthcare plan, Sanders healthcare plan, presidential candidates Obamacare, Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Much of the presidential candidates\u2019 discussions of healthcare center on Obamacare, but there are other key issues affecting the health of the country.", "title": "Where the Leading Presidential Candidates Stand on Healthcare", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/where-the-leading-presidential-candidates-stand-on-healthcare-012816", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/topic_centers/012916_presidentialplans_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/topic_centers/012916_presidentialplans_THUMB.jpg", "description": "Much of the presidential candidates\u2019 discussions of healthcare center on Obamacare, but there are other key issues affecting the health of the country.", "card": "summary", "title": "Where the Leading Presidential Candidates Stand on Healthcare"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-29", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Much of the presidential candidates\u2019 discussions of healthcare center on Obamacare, but there are other key issues affecting the health of the country."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b72\"", "article_summary": "Whenever the topic of healthcare has come up during the 2016 presidential election, candidates have largely focused on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), popularly known as Obamacare.\nHe favors a free-market approach to lowering healthcare costs, with expanded competition in the health care system.\nBut it touches on several key issues affecting the health of the country \u2014 such as the uninsured and high healthcare costs.\nRead More: Scoring Obamacare After Two Years \u00bbAffordable Care ActIn general, the candidate\u2019s discussions about the ACA fall along party lines.\nBut his campaign has also stated that he favors a free-market system that gives power over health insurance back to the states."}
