Todd said, “We start with Yemen a country once touted as a success in America’s counter-terrorism by President Obama is spinning out of control. Yesterday special forces were withdrawn as Iranian backed Shiite rebels pushed south today seizing the third biggest city Taiz. Yemen’s president has been kicked out of the capital holed up in the south in January, is now appealing for intervention from the United Nations and emergency meeting of the security council will be held this afternoon”

NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell added, “It’s not only a failed state, this is now a proxy war, civil war and a proxy war between Iran backed Shiite rebels and the Saudis.”
