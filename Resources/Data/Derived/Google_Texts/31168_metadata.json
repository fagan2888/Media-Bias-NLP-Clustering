BayCare's Board of Trustees named Chief Operating Officer (COO) Tommy Inzina, 56, as Mason's successor after a methodical planning process.\n\nOn January 1, 2015, Inzina will assume the additional role of BayCare president, while Mason retains responsibility for the overall organization as CEO. Mason will continue to work closely with Inzina to effect a graceful transition after a period of planning, mentorship and gradual transfer of additional leadership responsibilities.\n\n\"BayCare is living its commitment to long-term succession planning at the highest level. We are pleased that we're able to do so in a very deliberate manner,\" said Board Chair William Tapp. \"Thanks in large part to Steve Mason's leadership and Tommy Inzina's contributions, BayCare is exceptionally well-prepared for the days ahead when health care providers will be reimbursed based on their effectiveness in keeping a population healthy, rather than how many times they provide service.\"\n\nInzina a Perfect Fit\n\n\"Tommy Inzina is uniquely qualified to succeed me in leading the area's largest health system,\" Mason said. \"Since 1993, he has demonstrated financial acumen and developed a deep understanding of our sophisticated health system as COO, chief financial officer (CFO) and chief administrative officer (CAO). During the decade we've worked together, I've come to know Tommy as a visionary leader who can deliver results in a changing health care environment while keeping the focus on our mission-driven culture.\"\n\nInzina is a certified public accountant and seasoned executive with more than 30 years of experience that includes ten years at a top global accounting firm. Under his leadership, BayCare achieved several milestones.\n\nIn 2011, BayCare was one of the few health systems in the country to receive an upgraded credit rating, reflecting the organization's strong, consistent financial planning. Despite the tough economy, BayCare continued to grow market share and maintain positive financial performance.\n\nIn 2009, Inzina assumed responsibility of BayCare's Strategic Planning, Human Resources and Information Systems divisions, in addition to his CFO duties, expanding his impact within the organization. He led the development of BayCare's current strategic plan which positions the system to be successful into the future. He also partnered with Bruce Flareau , M.D., BayCare's executive vice president of Physician Affairs, to study the impact of the Affordable Care Act on BayCare and develop BayCare Physician Partners, a clinically integrated network with 1,300 physician members.\n\n, M.D., BayCare's executive vice president of Physician Affairs, to study the impact of the Affordable Care Act on BayCare and develop BayCare Physician Partners, a clinically integrated network with 1,300 physician members.
