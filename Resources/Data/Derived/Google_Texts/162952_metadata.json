It happened overnight and seemingly out of nowhere. An athlete with a lanky, svelte figure, the last thing on Silcott\u2019s mind was paralysis at such a young age.\n\n\u201c[O]ne night I was out with my friends and I had to come home, I didn\u2019t feel that great,\u201d she told Good Morning America in a video interview. \u201cI went to bed and woke up in the morning and I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I couldn\u2019t walk.\u201d\n\nSilcott had been infected with mononucleosis, also known as mono or the \"kissing disease,\" which is a common viral illness that often affects teens and young adults. While mono typically leads to sore throat, nausea, and fatigue for weeks, it\u2019s treatable and goes away with time. But in Silcott\u2019s case, mono led to Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), an extremely rare neurological disorder that affected her brain and spine.\n\nDespite the fact that sudden paralysis was a blow to her plans, Silcott didn\u2019t let it ruin her dreams. \u201cI told myself I was going to heal from this and I was going to be able to pursue everything I wanted to pursue before,\u201d she told GMA. Because of her determination and confidence, Silcott has made magnificent strides in the right direction. She has attended therapy at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, initially using a power chair when she still had very little function in her arms and legs. Now, Silcott is able to walk on her own with the help of a walker.\n\nRecently, Silcott\u2019s dreams have come true. Fashion designer Nina Perdomo called her this winter to participate in New York Fashion Week wearing one of her designs: \u201cI design for a woman that is strong and knows what she wants from life,\u201d Perdomo told GMA. \u201cAnd I feel like Megan is the perfect example of that.\u201d\n\nThe video shows how Silcott exemplifies confidence and grace when walking down the runway with a walker, and is an inspiration to anyone hoping to achieve something they have their eyes set on.\n\n\u201cHere I was, not able to move, not thinking I would ever be able to walk again,\u201d Silcott said. \u201cYou know it just goes to show that anything is possible. If you put your mind to it, it can get done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "paralyzed, teen, megan, silcott, walks, down, runway, new, york, fashion, week, grace, and", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Despite being paralyzed from the neck down at age 16, Megan Silcott didn\u2019t give up her dream of being a model.", "title": "Paralyzed Teen Walks With Confidence In New York Fashion Week [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/paralyzed-teen-megan-silcott-walks-down-runway-new-york-fashion-week-grace-and-322602", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/02/18/runway-walk.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite being paralyzed from the neck down at age 16, Megan Silcott didn\u2019t give up her dream of being a model.", "title": "Paralyzed Teen Walks With Confidence In New York Fashion Week [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/paralyzed-teen-megan-silcott-walks-down-runway-new-york-fashion-week-grace-and-322602", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/02/18/runway-walk.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/18/runway-walk.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-18T13:23:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-18T13:23:20-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Despite being paralyzed from the neck down at age 16, Megan Silcott didn\u2019t give up her dream of being a model."}, "article_summary": "\u201cHere I was, not able to move, not thinking I would ever be able to walk again,\u201d Silcott said.\nNow, Silcott is able to walk on her own with the help of a walker.\nMegan Silcott had always wanted a career in fashion and aspired to be a model, but that dream seemed dashed when she was paralyzed from the neck down at age 16.\nAn athlete with a lanky, svelte figure, the last thing on Silcott\u2019s mind was paralysis at such a young age.\nBut in Silcott\u2019s case, mono led to Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), an extremely rare neurological disorder that affected her brain and spine."}
