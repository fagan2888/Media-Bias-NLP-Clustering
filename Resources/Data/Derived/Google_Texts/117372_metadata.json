But it never worked, and not a single Oregonian was able to sign up for health care from start to finish.\n\nSo now, Oregon is in the process of pulling the plug on the site and switching over to the federal exchange and HealthCare.gov -- but the question is, how quickly they can do it.\n\n\u201cWe need to move forward and do the best thing for the people of Oregon,\u201d Republican State Sen. Tim Knopp said, \u201cand I think that\u2019s ending Cover Oregon as soon as we practically can.\u201d\n\nKnopp and other Oregon Republicans are calling for a special session of the Legislature -- since lawmakers created Cover Oregon, only the Legislature can end it. But Democrats control the Legislature and the governor\u2019s office, and they\u2019re pushing back against Republicans' demand, and would rather wait until the 2015 session convenes in February to complete the transition.\n\n\u201cThere are functions that still have to be performed by someone in the next few weeks and months,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Richard Devlin said.\n\nInaction comes with a price tag.\n\nAccording to Republican leaders, it costs taxpayers $200,000 a day to keep Cover Oregon running. Waiting until February 2015 or beyond will cost $20 million.\n\nA libertarian think tank is urging a Cover Oregon death sooner, not later. \u201cThe simplest thing to do, the cleanest thing to do would be to give Oregonians some certainty and say, you won\u2019t be having to deal with Cover Oregon come November,\u201d said Steve Buckstein of the Cascade Policy Institute.\n\nOregon officials decided earlier this year to hand off Cover Oregon functions to the Oregon Health Authority, which will work with the federal exchange and HealthCare.gov. But the transition is complicated by a lawsuit filed by the state of Oregon against its website contractor, Oracle. The state is seeking reimbursement alleging a breach of contract.\n\nAlso, there recently has been more bad news for Cover Oregon and hundreds of Oregonians. The agency recently discovered it made a serious miscalculation when determining the federal tax credit for 775 families that purchased health plans on the state exchange. It turns out they owe more taxes than they were told.\n\n\u201cThis is Cover Oregon\u2019s error,\u201d said Cover Oregon\u2019s Executive Director Aaron Patnode. \u201cSo what we\u2019re evaluating at this time is the proper course of action to make sure these consumers have the least financial impact as possible.\u201d\n\nSome in the Oregon Legislature want the government to pay the back taxes.\n\nDan Springer joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in August 2001 as a Seattle-based correspondent.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "executive", "classification": "/FOX
