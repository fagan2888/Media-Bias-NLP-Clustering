For rank-and-file jobs, turning up was half the battle.\n\nBut competition for jobs has got fiercer. The concept of human resources has expanded. Interview panels are more complicated, wrestling with lists of \u201cessential qualities for candidates.\u201d\n\nSo what happened at the interview for the new head of the NHS?\n\nDid the panel have a piece of paper reading: \u201cWasted billions of health money \u2014 Desirable. Lobbied against public health care in the US \u2014 Essential.\u201d?\n\nBecause they have appointed a man who did that and more.\n\nThe new NHS chief executive Simon Stevens has screwed up the health service on two continents.\n\nHe successfully fought off the growth of public health care in the US, killing a key component of \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nWhile in Britain he fought to get a slice of the NHS pie stuffed into the gobs of private health firms, wasting billions in the process.\n\nStevens was health adviser to both Labour health secretary Alan Milburn and prime minister Tony Blair. He was intimately involved in Blair\u2019s privatisations.\n\nHe is the main author of the \u201cNHS Plan\u201d launched in 2000. The plan took NHS-funded operations out of NHS hospitals, handing them over to private companies.\n\nThis was a bonanza for health companies and private equity firms behind them. It built a whole industry of firms sucking up NHS cash. Paying their profits wasted NHS cash and resources.\n\nFor example, under Stevens\u2019s plan the NHS gave up buying its own MRI scanners. It paid a private company to do the scans from the back of lorries in hospital car parks instead.\n\nA company called Alliance Medical was paid for all the scans in the contract, even though it only did 80 per cent of the work. The Royal College of Radiologists and the NHS Clinical Guardian didn\u2019t trust the quality of the work, so hospitals had to duplicate many of the scans anyway.\n\nThe same plan meant the NHS bought hundreds of thousands of minor operations from private clinics called \u201cindependent-sector treatment centres\u201d (ISTCs).\n\nUnder Stevens\u2019s plan, the NHS paid private firms like Care UK 15 per cent above the NHS rate to encourage the growth of a \u201cmarket.\u201d\n\nIt also paid firms whether the operations was done or not. Estimates by Professor Allyson Pollock, an academic critic of the scheme, suggest that up to \u00a31.6 billion may have been wasted on phantom operations.\n\nThe NHS was stuck with training costs and \u201cdifficult\u201d cases, while the private sector creamed off easy work and profits.\n\nStill, Stevens\u2019s old boss Milburn has a new job with private equity firm Bridgepoint Capital, which owned Alliance Medical and now owns Care UK \u2014 the companies profiting from the crazy scheme.\n\nStevens was central to one of the worst NHS financial disasters. He helped to run the 2002 Prime Minister\u2019s Seminar on NHS Information Systems which launched Connecting for Health.\n\nThis NHS-wide computer system was supposed to create electronic patient records. It has cost between \u00a312bn and \u00a320bn pounds but basically doesn\u2019t work.\n\nNewspapers usually write the Connecting for Health story as a \u201cwasteful Labour government in computer cock-up\u201d tale.\n\nBut Connecting for Health was actually driven by new Labour\u2019s determination to hand over NHS cash to private firms.\n\nStevens\u2019s record of the seminar says: \u201cThe key was to use stronger central direction to accelerate the pace of change and make more use of partnerships with the private sector.\u201d\n\nSo Stevens helped Labour centrally direct the NHS to sign partnerships with IT firms. The result was a disastrous waste of cash.\n\nConnecting for Health was actually a double privatisation. First, it meant handing over NHS money to the IT contractors.\n\nSecond, the whole system was designed to hand over operations to the private sector.\n\nTransferring electronic patient records was meant to make transferring NHS patients to private hospitals easier.\n\nIn 2004 Stevens left Britain to join private US health firm UnitedHealth, becoming executive vice-president at a firm winning NHS work from his NHS Plan.\n\nThere is a persistent link between Stevens and computers and funny business with money.\n\nIn 2009 UnitedHealth, the firm Stevens helped to lead, paid a $350 million court settlement.\n\nUnitedHealth used a computer database to systematically cheat its customers.\n\nThe American Medical Association said UnitedHealth\u2019s payments database was a \u201ccorrupt system\u201d and \u201cintentionally manipulated\u201d and \u201crigged.\u201d\n\nPatients who went to see a doctor outside UnitedHealth\u2019s business associates were deliberately given less of their UnitedHealth insurance money for medical treatments, leaving patients with bigger bills.\n\nStevens wasn\u2019t satisfied with just working for a scandal-hit US health firm.\n\nHe worked to screw up the US national health system as well. In Britain Stevens tried to make the NHS more like the private health system that fails so many US citizens.\n\nIn the US President Barack Obama made tentative steps towards a European-style health system. So Stevens did all he could to obstruct Obamacare.\n\nObama\u2019s scheme offers private health-care plans for most people in the US, with some government backing.\n\nHowever, in 2008 he also proposed a \u201cpublic option.\u201d In the original Obamacare, a small publicly run health insurance scheme would compete with private firms like UnitedHealth.\n\nThe public option would curb private insurance profiteering. The idea of having to compete with the public option was too much for Stevens, who ran UnitedHealth\u2019s political lobbying in the US, and he organised a pincer movement against it.\n\nFirst, in 2009 UnitedHealth sent its staff to the town hall meetings where Tea Party types attacked Obama\u2019s reforms as \u201csocialist.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth mobilised advocacy specialists, priming staff with \u201ctalking points\u201d like: \u201cA government-run health plan would be a roadblock to meaningful health-care reform.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth staff were mobilised during working hours to attack Obama\u2019s reforms.\n\nWhile Stevens sent his staff to join the barmy right-wing town hall meetings alongside crazy Republicans, he personally lobbied right-wing Democrats \u2014 known as \u201cBlue Dog Democrats\u201d \u2014 to kill the public option. Stevens\u2019s campaign won and the public option of Obamacare died.\n\nSo having introduced profiteering into the NHS, Stevens then fought to keep the government out of health care in the US.\n\nBy putting Stevens in charge of the NHS, the government has put a self-destruct mechanism in the centre of our health service.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The only English-language socialist daily newspaper in the world, published six days a week.", "Author": "Peoples Printing Press Society", "og": {"published_time": 1383264000, "description": "SOLOMON HUGHES introduces new NHS chief executive Simon Stevens \u2013 a man with a dubious history of undermining public health on both sides of the pond", "title": "How the new NHS boss has helped ruin health services on two continents", "url": "http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-c187-How-the-new-NHS-boss-has-helped-ruin-health-services-on-two-continents", "image": "http://morningstaronline.co.uk/assets/static/images/default-og-image.png", "modified_time": 1383297737, "tag": "Obamacare", "type": "article", "section": "Features"}, "twitter": {"description": "SOLOMON HUGHES introduces new NHS chief executive Simon Stevens \u2013 a man with a dubious history of undermining public health on both sides of the pond", "title": "How the new NHS boss has helped ruin health services on two continents", "site": "@M_Star_Online", "card": "summary", "creator": "@M_Star_Online"}, "Robots": "noodp", "Revisit-After": "7 Days", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd255f\"", "article_summary": "In Britain Stevens tried to make the NHS more like the private health system that fails so many US citizens.\nSo having introduced profiteering into the NHS, Stevens then fought to keep the government out of health care in the US.\nHe is the main author of the \u201cNHS Plan\u201d launched in 2000.\nLobbied against public health care in the US \u2014 Essential.\u201d?\nBut Connecting for Health was actually driven by new Labour\u2019s determination to hand over NHS cash to private firms."}
