But they have been vague on when or how that would happen.\n\nLast week, legislative leaders said that instead of continuing to question health officials and request documents, they are likely to defer to a previously scheduled state audit of the exchange that is expected to begin this summer and could take a year to complete. That angered many Republicans and some Democrats who want a full accounting now.\n\nThey said that a delay could also spare Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown (D), who is running for governor, from having to publicly address more questions about the exchange before the Democratic primary on June 24 or the general election in November. Brown was tasked with implementing President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act in Maryland.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to wait,\u201d said Del. Heather R. Mizeur (D-Montgomery), who is running for governor. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody in Annapolis who feels like they have their hands around what is still problematic.\u201d\n\nMaryland was one of 14 states that opted to launch their own online health insurance exchanges, created as part of the Affordable Care Act, instead of relying on the federal marketplace. But the roll-out of Maryland\u2019s plan has been one of the most troubled. The Web site crashed on its first day of operation and has been plagued with problems that have made it difficult for Marylanders to sign up for health insurance. Two of the contractors that built the online exchange continue to fight.\n\nSen. Thomas M. Middleton (D-Charles), the chairman of the Finance Committee who has coordinated inquiries into the exchange, said doing a full investigation now would distract health officials from signing Marylanders up for health insurance before the March 31 deadline. He said that the media have already reported the \u201cjuiciest information\u201d about the exchange\u2019s shortcomings and that anything more would simply be generating \u201cwonderful election fodder.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to make excuses for it,\u201d Middleton said of the exchange on Friday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see anything that warrants a full-scale investigation.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader David R. Brinkley (R-Frederick), who wants the state to hire outside counsel to investigate, scoffed at the suggestion that such an inquiry would reduce the number of Marylanders who get health insurance.\n\n\u201cThey are recognizing that there\u2019s an ongoing problem, but they don\u2019t want to address it because it might cause embarrassment to the lieutenant governor in his gubernatorial bid,\u201d he said.\n\nJustin Schall, Brown\u2019s campaign manager, said that those calling for an immediate review are putting \u201ctheir own personal gain\u201d before the health care of Marylanders.\n\n\u201cThe people of Maryland deserve a comprehensive review process that isn\u2019t driven by political ambition,\u201d Schall said. \u201cThe lieutenant governor has been clear from the beginning that he believes there should be a full review once the state has done everything in its power to sign up anyone who wants to enroll before March 31.\u201d\n\nJared Smith, the lieutenant governor\u2019s communications director, said Brown is working with others to find the \u201cbest way to do a comprehensive and meaningful review, deliver accountability.\u201d In the meantime, he added, the exchange continues to improve.\n\nBrown testified before lawmakers for several hours in mid-January and answered questions about the troubled exchange. Brown said then that he was unaware of impending problems with the site ahead of its launch and had not seen reports about instability.\n\nAlthough some officials grilled Brown, most saved their most difficult questions for the state\u2019s secretary of health and mental hygiene.\n\nMaryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D) has said the exchange has been greatly improved and is now functioning for a majority of people. But enrollment numbers continue to lag behind expectations. As of Jan. 25, officials say, 26,832 Marylanders had enrolled in private plans, a pace far short of the goal to enroll at least 150,000 by March 31. Brown once touted an even higher goal \u2014 180,000.\n\nThe exchange is largely functioning through makeshift work-arounds, state health officials have said. Rather than signing up for insurance through the Web site, many Marylanders have instead contacted newly formed call centers and spent hours on the phone. Some applications are being processed on paper.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s chief information officer said last week that \u201cmultiple defects remain\u201d and that there are \u201ca number of architectural and infrastructure issues\u201d that need to be corrected, according to a presentation he gave to the state exchange board.\n\nMeanwhile, two contractors that worked on the exchange continue to fight over money in court.\n\nMaryland\u2019s main contractor \u2014 Noridian \u2014 has a contract worth $193 million, according to a presentation that the exchange\u2019s chief financial officer gave last week. So far the state has paid Noridian nearly $65 million and has unpaid invoices totaling another $13 million.\n\nNoridian hired another contractor, EngagePoint, to integrate different pieces of software together into one seamless operation. Soon after the failed launch, Noridian ended its contract with EngagePoint and went about fixing the exchange itself with few employees and uncertain where to begin, according to internal e-mails obtained by The Washington Post. Noridian then tried hiring back EngagePoint workers, triggering the federal lawsuit.\n\nEngagePoint is seeking $7.4 million from Noridian for work done before and after the site launched, according to recent court filings. Noridian disputes that amount in legal filings. Maryland officials could soon be pulled into that dispute, because EngagePoint has asked the state to withhold the money from Noridian or pay EngagePoint directly. Noridian officials say in court records that withholding money could \u201csignificantly\u201d impair their ability to complete work on the Maryland exchange.\n\nNoridian and EngagePoint declined comment, citing the court case.\n\nMaryland health officials have received EngagePoint\u2019s request and they have asked Noridian for a response, but \u201chave not at this point intervened,\u201d said Dori Henry, an exchange spokeswoman.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s first enrollment period began on Oct. 1 and will end on March 31. The next will start on Nov. 15. Although state officials have said it is important for Maryland to stick with its own exchange for the first enrollment period, all options would be open, they said, including abandoning all or parts of the site. Those calling for an investigation say it is important to have a clear understanding of the exchange\u2019s problems by then so that the state can decide what to do next.\n\nOther states that have had trouble with their exchanges have already begun inquiries. Minnesota\u2019s lead auditor launched a \u201cfull-throttle investigation\u201d into the state\u2019s exchange on Jan. 7, according to local media reports. The audit is expected to examine the work done by contractors, including one that also worked on Maryland\u2019s exchange, and the oversight by state officials. That same day, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin (D) called for a third-party review of his state\u2019s exchange.\n\nSpecial investigations are rare in Maryland, where Democrats dominate politics. The last memorable probe was in 2005 when a special legislative committee examined the hiring and firing practices of then-Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R).\n\nMaryland Attorney General Douglas Gansler (D), another gubernatorial hopeful, said the legislative committees should continue to hold hearings or assign a \u201cspecial body\u201d to investigate. Gansler said that he made a similar request after reports of corruption at the Baltimore jail and was ignored.\n\n\u201cIn Maryland, in these types of things, we\u2019ve clearly swept things under the rug,\u201d Gansler said.\n\nPart of the problem is that only one party has most of the power, said Del. Ronald George (R-Anne Arundel) who is also running for governor. Waiting for the regularly scheduled audit could mean allowing two legislative cycles to pass before making changes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said George, who has called for a full investigation by lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s like everyone here is trying to protect everyone else because we\u2019re all good friends. We\u2019re not friends. We\u2019re the government.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans and some Democrats accuse state leaders of shielding a candidate for governor from fallout", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Republicans and some Democrats accuse state leaders of shielding a candidate for governor from fallout", "title": "Maryland leaders accused of political motives over long review of health exchange problems", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-leaders-accused-of-political-motives-over-long-review-of-health-exchange-problems/2014/02/02/85b854ce-8aa2-11e3-a5bd-844629433ba3_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marypatflaherty"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "maryland politics, md politics, obamacare, affordable care act, maryland health benefit exchange, health insurance, maryland exchange, martin omalley, anthony brown,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson"}, "eomportal-uuid": "85b854ce-8aa2-11e3-a5bd-844629433ba3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "maryland politics, md politics, obamacare, affordable care act, maryland health benefit exchange, health insurance, maryland exchange, martin omalley, anthony brown,"}, "article_summary": "Noridian officials say in court records that withholding money could \u201csignificantly\u201d impair their ability to complete work on the Maryland exchange.\nMinnesota\u2019s lead auditor launched a \u201cfull-throttle investigation\u201d into the state\u2019s exchange on Jan. 7, according to local media reports.\nThe exchange is largely functioning through makeshift work-arounds, state health officials have said.\nPeter Shumlin (D) called for a third-party review of his state\u2019s exchange.\nMaryland health officials have received EngagePoint\u2019s request and they have asked Noridian for a response, but \u201chave not at this point intervened,\u201d said Dori Henry, an exchange spokeswoman."}
