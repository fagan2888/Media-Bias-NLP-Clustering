That\u2019s because Texas only recognizes the sex on the original birth certificate, not on an amended certificate.\n\nSome legislators would like to avoid their own confusion about who transgender people are by simply banning them from marrying anyone. Once marriage is defined as between two people, that will no longer be an issue for the trans community.\n\nBut there are many more issues that are just as, if not more important to most in the transgender community. And as America begins to look beyond marriage equality, these are just a few of the battles the trans community will continue to fight.\n\nNondiscrimination ordinances\n\nTrans Pride Initiative President Nell Gaither is more interested in protections that can be acquired by regulation rather than by law.\n\nShe said nondiscrimination ordinances are great, but to take advantage of them, the person has to have transportation, time and experience working with a bureaucracy.\n\nShe\u2019s more interested, she said, in changing policies and regulations that benefit trans people.\n\nWhile nondiscrimination ordinances may set the basis for policy, only by educating people will things change.\n\nGender markers\n\nGetting the proper gender markers on official documents remains the biggest barrier for the trans community. Vincent Villano with the National Center for Transgender Equality said modern policies need to be adopted nationwide to adequately address the problem.\n\nDallas attorney Katie Sprinkle explained how updating procedures to change gender markers would make a huge difference in the lives of transgender people. Once the gender marker is changed, she explained, trans people can get identification that matches their presentation.\n\n\u201cMost people get a driver\u2019s license and say, \u2018Now I can drive,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cA trans person gets a driver\u2019s license with the correct sex on it and says, \u2018Now I can live.\u2019\u201d\n\nA name or presentation that doesn\u2019t match the sex on the license outs someone applying for a job. That\u2019s one reason for the high unemployment rate in the trans community.\n\nBut correct ID affects the life of a transgender person in a number of ways. \u201cA traffic stop can escalate quickly,\u201d Sprinkle said. \u201cEspecially if you\u2019re stopped by Bubba in the wrong jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nIn fact, she added, simply getting carded when entering a bar can become a dangerous situation. \u201cA little bigotry and some alcohol?\u201d she said. \u201cViolence can quickly follow.\u201d\n\nMonica Roberts is editor of TransGriot and lives in Houston. She said a more uniform policy on gender marker changes is needed, noting that in some states, a trans person can change the gender marker without surgery. But in Texas, getting an ID \u201cto reflect who you are,\u201d is more difficult, Roberts said.\n\nSprinkle said Tarrant County won\u2019t accept any case involving gender marker change. In Dallas County, she relies on friendly judges using a broad interpretation of the law.\n\nBathroom bills and workplace harassment\n\nBathroom bills that clogged legislative agendas this spring in Texas and other states are already illegal, according to Villano, or they at least disregard current Equal Employment Opportunity rulings.\n\n\u201cShould one of these bathroom bills become law, they would be inconsistent with EEOC rulings on transgender people\u2019s right to go to the bathroom at work,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn Texas, Republican state Rep. Debbie Riddle of Houston, introduced HB 1747, which would have changed the penal code on bathroom use, and 1748, which would have implemented a penalty for use of a bathroom by the \u201cwrong\u201d sex. Both died in committee.\n\nThe ruling Villano referred to was the case of Tamara Lusardi, a disabled Army veteran who worked for the Army as a civilian. Lusardi transitioned on the job and was required to only use a gender-neutral bathroom. She was reprimanded when she used a women\u2019s bathroom when the assigned restroom was out of service.\n\nThe EEOC found that the requirement intruded on her privacy, caused discomfort and was humiliating.\n\nIn addition, she was called by her former name and her supervisor called her \u201csir.\u201d Those most common forms of harassment against the trans community were found to be illegal discrimination.\n\nVillano said people faced with that sort of harassment in the workplace need to step forward and file complaints \u201cto solidify these protections.\u201d\n\nSprinkle said she\u2019s advised clients in that position to look for a new job that will be more understanding, and to hold off on filing a complaint until after they have changed jobs.\n\n\u201cWhen you leave, you\u2019re free from retribution,\u201d Sprinkle explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re still working there, they\u2019ll start building a file against you.\u201d\n\nA clearer definition of Title 7 by the Supreme Court would go a long way to solidify what the EEOC has already said about protections the trans community has, Sprinkle noted.\n\nHealth insurance\n\nOne of the problems Gaither said could be solved through regulation is in the area of health insurance and healthcare. Insurance companies often discriminate against their trans customers by not providing all necessary medical care. A trans man, for example, who hasn\u2019t had a complete hysterectomy may not be covered for uterine cancer if he\u2019s had his gender markers changed.\n\nVillano said he believes sex-specific treatments are covered by the Affordable Care Act and will be covered as cases work their way through the courts. But cancer and other illnesses aren\u2019t likely to wait on the court system to work things out.\n\nGaither said even many trans people who have insurance still have trouble getting the hormones they need, and transition surgery that is often prescribed as medically necessary is being added to some policies, but only very slowly.\n\nVillano said, \u201cUnder rule 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, no one can be denied sex-specific care. It shouldn\u2019t be happening.\u201d\n\nBut it is.\n\nLate last year, Sprinkle filed suit against an insurance company that refused to cover a client of hers \u2014 a trans man who had had top surgery \u2014 for breast cancer. After his breasts were removed, the tissue was biopsied in what Sprinkle said is a standard medical procedure.\n\nThe man\u2019s doctor found he had a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer found primarily in women, and recommended the man be treated with chemotherapy and radiation. But since he had already had his gender marker changed, the insurance company refused the coverage.\n\nUsing rule 1557, Sprinkle said she was able to get the insurance company to cover the necessary treatments.\n\nShelters\n\nBecause of the difficulties they face in other areas, including in employment, transgender women and men often find themselves homeless and in need of shelter. And while \u201cfederal policy says you can\u2019t discriminate, that a trans person can get into any shelter, that\u2019s not the way it works in real life,\u201d said Gaither, who has worked with several shelters in the Dallas area.\n\nPeople are still turned away or sent to housing for the wrong gender, Gaither said, adding that 30 to 40 percent of homeless youth are LGBT, but most are not accessing traditional shelters. Many couch surf or find alternate places to live temporarily.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting marginalized people to come to us and that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Gaither said, noting that policies need to be put in place to serve the homeless trans community and new ways to reach that marginalized community have to be found.\n\nJobs\n\nA bill to replace the embattled Employment Nondiscrimination Act will include protections in the areas of housing and accommodations as well as employment. Gender identity and expression will be included as protected categories in the new legislation, Villano said.\n\nPassage of the new measure can\u2019t come fast enough since, as Roberts noted, \u201cThe trans community has a 26 percent unemployment rate.\u201d\n\nRacism\n\nEven if there is progress on all these other issues, racism remains a huge barrier to progress for trans women and men of color. Trans women are already frequently targets of violence. Add racism into the mix, and the costs rise even higher. Trans women of color are murdered at a much higher rate than even others in the LGBT community; at least 12 trans women have been murdered just since the start of this year, and most were women of color.\n\nRoberts said that combating racism will help bring those alarming statistics down, and the battle needs to start within the LGBT community itself.\n\n\u201cRace does impact what happens in our community,\u201d Roberts said, calling on the LGBT community to acknowledge and address its own racism. \u201cThen we can set the example for greater society,\u201d she concluded.\n\nThis article appeared in the Dallas Voice print edition June 19, 2015.\n\nComments (powered by FaceBook)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Dallas Voice", "description": "From nondiscrimination ordinances and policies, to addressing racism, transgender community still has work to do", "title": "Trans leaders look to the battles ahead", "url": "http://www.dallasvoice.com/trans-leaders-battles-10198488.html", "image": "http://www.dallasvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Next-Frontier-logo.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100004508915842, "app_id": 780617392052602}, "generator": "WordPress 3.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "And as America begins to look beyond marriage equality, these are just a few of the battles the trans community will continue to fight.\nOnce marriage is defined as between two people, that will no longer be an issue for the trans community.\nGender markersGetting the proper gender markers on official documents remains the biggest barrier for the trans community.\nBut there are many more issues that are just as, if not more important to most in the transgender community.\nThat\u2019s one reason for the high unemployment rate in the trans community."}
