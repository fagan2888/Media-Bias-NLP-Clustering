Only one dollar in 20 went to the family-care doctors and other primary caregivers trained to keep people healthy.\n\nThe company\u2019s move to shift that balance tells a lesser-known story of the Affordable Care Act and efforts to change the health system.\n\nWhile much attention has focused on expanded coverage and online insurance bazaars, policymakers\u2019 bigger challenge is improving Americans\u2019 health while putting a brake on the cost of their care. The keys to that puzzle, CareFirst and many others are deciding, are the internists and general practitioners who have largely been left behind by health care\u2019s financial boom.\n\n\u201cAs long as I can remember, family physicians and general internists have been financially at the low end of the totem pole,\u201d said Michael Merson, a consultant and former hospital executive who was CareFirst\u2019s board chairman until 2012. Raising their pay for the unglamorous work of preventing expensive illness and coordinating care, he said, \u201cwas really our starting point.\u201d\n\nBeginning in 2011 CareFirst increased reimbursement for what would soon be most of its primary care doctors in Maryland, the District and Virginia. It began paying even more if they reduced duplicative, unneeded or overly-expensive treatment while maintaining or improving quality.\n\nDoctors who scored well have gotten raises of more than $40,000 on top of round-the-clock nursing assistance for their sickest and riskiest patients, according to physicians and the insurance company.\n\nThe extra cost for the program, known as a patient-centered medical home, more than pays for itself in reduced expenses elsewhere, CareFirst says. Members seen by medical home doctors experienced 6 percent fewer hospital admissions, 11 percent fewer days in the hospital and 11 percent fewer outpatient visits than other CareFirst clients last year, according to results to be disclosed Thursday.\n\nPolicy experts are far from agreeing that medical homes cut costs in the long run. But even though industrywide spending has slowed, CareFirst credits its medical home for helping keep total patient expense growth at 3.5 percent last year, the lowest rate in memory.\n\nThe program is saving \u201chundreds of millions of dollars in accumulated, avoided costs,\u201d says CareFirst CEO Chet Burrell. \u201cIf somebody had said to me three and a half years ago, \u2018What would you have hoped for?,\u2019 I would not have said anything close to what emerged.\u201d\n\nBy paying primary care doctors to cut specialist and hospital revenue, CareFirst is helping to alter the medical spoils system.\n\n\u201cThere will probably be hospital closings and hospital consolidation\u201d in Maryland, thanks to efforts by payers to reduce unneeded procedures, said Susan Dentzer, a senior health policy adviser for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who has studied CareFirst\u2019s program.\n\nSpecialty doctors are already skeptical of CareFirst\u2019s practice, new this year, of grading them on costs and passing that information to referring primary physicians, said Gene Ransom, CEO of MedChi, Maryland\u2019s medical society.\n\nLower-cost specialists are coded green; higher-cost ones, yellow; the highest, red. Less-expensive specialty care in CareFirst\u2019s model can mean higher pay for referring primaries as long as quality isn\u2019t compromised.\n\n\u201cA lot of the specialists don\u2019t know this is going on,\u201d Ransom said.\n\nHow does it all work?\n\nIn 2011 CareFirst began organizing most primary physicians accepting its insurance into panels of around nine or a dozen each. Every participating doctor got an immediate, 12 percent rate increase as well as money for creating care plans for their sickest patients.\n\nFor most patients nothing changed. But the highest-risk members are assigned nurses from a company called Healthways who are available by phone to monitor care and help navigate the system.\n\nPanels that maintain quality and reduce costs are eligible for bonuses that added another 35 percent on average to their reimbursement rates last year. The best-performing physicians collected twice what they would have been paid under CareFirst\u2019s normal fees, the company said.\n\nThe idea is to eliminate enough overspending that there is money left over to pass savings to CareFirst members in the form of lower premium increases, says Burrell.\n\nDr. George Lowe talks about a 45-year-old CareFirst patient with lower back pain who considered heading to the hospital emergency department one recent Saturday.\n\nThere the man probably would have been sent to radiology for X-rays or other scans and then been referred to a specialist, said Lowe, medical director at Maryland Family Care, a large practice north of Baltimore that participates in the CareFirst program.\n\nInstead, the patient checked with a Healthways nurse who is independent but paid for by CareFirst.\n\nShe told him the primary-care practice was open on weekends. The doctor there diagnosed muscle spasms and advised heat applications and over-the-counter ibuprofen. The man felt good enough to cancel a follow-up appointment and return to work Monday.\n\n\u201cCase closed!\u201d said Lowe. \u201cWe turned a $1,000 visit to the emergency room into a $75 or $100 visit to the office.\u201d\n\nDoctors like Lowe say they control expense by prescribing generic drugs when possible, thinking twice about referrals, referring to lower-cost specialists when possible and avoiding duplicate tests and unnecessary emergency visits.\n\nLike CareFirst, insurers across the country believe that higher pay and cost-control incentives will prompt primary doctors to give more attention to diabetics, heart and lung patients, the obese and other chronically ill people who account for very large portions of the nation\u2019s medical bill.\n\nThey\u2019re testing that idea in dozens of experiments, many prompted by the health law.\n\nMassachusetts, Pennsylvania and Arkansas are paying primary-care Medicaid doctors more to improve quality and reduce expense for low-income patients. The federal Medicare program for seniors has launched numerous experiments to share savings with primary doctors if they cut costs \u2014 including one in Maryland that promises to raise pay for CareFirst\u2019s primary doctors there even more.\n\nPrivate insurers are trying the same thing.\n\nIn some cases, in return for cost control, insurers are \u201cprepared to pay double\u201d what primary-care doctors have traditionally made, said John Deane, president of consulting at the Advisory Board Company, which works with physician practices.\n\nNew Mexico Health Connections, a nonprofit, co-op insurer created by the health law, studied incentives for family doctors at several medical home organizations before setting up its own program.\n\n\u201cThe result in a fully working program can [produce] additional income of anywhere between $50,000 and $150,000\u201d per doctor, said Dr. Martin Hickey, the insurer\u2019s CEO. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing from some of those organizations. They hold it proprietary but they say, \u2018We\u2019re the best-paid doctors in town in primary care.\u2019\u201d\n\nPrimary doctors are famously overworked, stressed and, according to many, underpaid for their expensive training. They often make less than $200,000 a year vs. around $400,000 for orthopedists and cardiologists.\n\nThe primary-care treadmill may be an underrated factor in soaring costs. Because they\u2019re usually paid based on how many people they see rather than how many they keep healthy, primary docs have traditionally been too quick to refer complicated cases to specialists, some believe.\n\n\u201cI think it is the single major reason why healthcare costs are rising so fast,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Schimpff, a former CEO of the University of Maryland Medical Center who has closely followed CareFirst\u2019s medical home.\n\nWith CareFirst\u2019s higher rates and nurse coordinators, doctors say, they can devote more time to fewer patients and keep their highest-risk patients healthier.\n\nOne recent weekend Maryland Family Care headed off six potential emergency visits, Lowe said. Dr. Kevin Schendel, a solo-practice internist near Baltimore, said the CareFirst program has helped his patients avoid dozens of unnecessary emergency-room calls.\n\nOne longtime patient had uncontrolled diabetes until she began working with a Healthways nurse under a plan created by Schendel. After a few months of monitoring and advice about diet and medicine her blood sugar fell by more than a third, sharply reducing her chances of a hospital admission.\n\n\u201cI tell physicians, \u2018You\u2019re going to get paid extra to handle your sickest patients,\u2019\u201d Schendel said. But he adds: \u201cThe financial rewards that the physician gets in my opinion are secondary. The real reward is that patient who gets to work with that nurse and it doesn\u2019t cost my practice a penny. And they get better care. There\u2019s the reward.\u201d\n\nThis story also ran in The Washington Post. It can be republished for free. Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
