They should be allowed to continue to reach reasonable solutions without threats of lawsuits and funding cuts by the federal government.\n\nThe Obama administration should not force Americans to conform or be taken to court, fined, or stripped of funding.\n\nNeither the federal government nor courts should have the power to redefine what it is to be a man or a woman for all Americans. Congress should rein in the Obama administration\u2019s attacks on Congress\u2019s authority by making clear that when it passed laws using the word \u201csex,\u201d it meant \u201csex\u201d\u2014not \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\nCongress can and should pass legislation to undo the confusion and harm unleashed by an overreaching executive branch and activist courts (stacked with liberal Obama appointees) in order to restore respect for the rule of law, federalism, and state, local, and private decision-making.\n\nThree Options for Congress\n\nCongress has at least three different ways of reasserting its authority.\n\n1) Congress could make clear that all federal laws that refer to a person\u2019s \u201csex\u201d cannot be understood or interpreted by any court or federal agency to mean \u201cgender identity\u201d without explicit Congressional authorization. This would have the benefit of undoing the administration\u2019s past and current abuses, as well as preventing future ones.\n\n2) Congress could pass a statute offering the same clarification but targeted to just the specific federal laws the administration has abused, such as Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, among others.\n\nThis would reiterate that when Congress referred to a person\u2019s \u201csex\u201d in these laws, the word referred then to what it continues to refer to now\u2014a biological reality, not \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\n3) Congress could pass statutes based on its power of the purse. It could specify that the Departments of Education, Justice, and HHS (Health and Human Services), as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may not use any funds to implement or enforce its new administrative transgender directives or regulations against persons, institutions, schools, businesses, and governments that allegedly do not comply.\n\nAdditionally, Congress could specify that these agencies may not revoke federal funding for any purported non-compliance with the administration\u2019s gender identity directives.\n\nCongress Must Act\n\nMost Americans are encountering questions related to transgender students for the first time. Important conversations are underway among citizens, but the Obama administration is trying to shut them down. The Obama administration is rushing to impose a top-down solution on the entire country. In response, Congress should act to preserve the right of the American people to have these conversations, consider all the relevant concerns and make policies that will best serve all members of their community.\n\nAcross America, people are considering how best to accommodate the privacy and safety concerns of transgender persons while also addressing the privacy and safety concerns of others, especially children and students.\n\nThey\u2019ve been able to reach solutions, such as opening new single-occupancy restrooms and changing facilities for transgender students while keeping girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 rooms for biological girls and boys. But activists attacked these commonsense compromises as \u201ctransphobic.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration is attempting to force a one-size-fits-all policy on the entire nation rather than allow parents and teachers and local schools the time, space, and flexibility to find solutions that work best for everyone.\n\nCongress must prevent the Obama administration from redefining what it is to be a man or a woman for all Americans. Congress must prevent the Obama administration from forcing Americans and their institutions to fall in line or be sued, stripped of funding, or forced out of business.\n\nRyan T.
