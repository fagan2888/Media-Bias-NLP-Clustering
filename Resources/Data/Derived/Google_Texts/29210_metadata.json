The OTA evaluated the sites using both its own criteria and security and privacy mandated standards that the IRS maintains.\n\nRelated: Got an Email from the IRS? You\u2019re Being Scammed\n\n\u201cGiven that the tax data is extremely sensitive with a high risk for victimization, the failure rate of over one-third should concern customers and the IRS,\u201d OTA Executive Director and President Craig Spiezle said in a statement. \u201cConsumer use and IRS approval of such services should be carefully reconsidered.\n\nThe firms in question are part of the IRS\u2019s Free File Alliance, which allows anyone who made less than $62,000 in 2015 file taxes for free. Seventy percent of American taxpayers are eligible to participate in the program, though the findings are relevant for all customers of the firms examined, according to the OTA.\n\nThe Free File Alliance says that all members \u201cmust meet our rigorous standards of security and privacy.\u201d\n\n\n\nSource: Online Tax Alliance\n\nThe sites were graded on the basis of three main categories: consumer protection, site security and privacy. The ones that made the honor roll scored at least an 80 percent in each section, while the other six sites received a failing grade in one or more of the categories.\n\nAlthough the report didn\u2019t specify how each firm performed in each of the categories, it did disclose that three of the failing sites lacked adequate security against vulnerabilities that cybercriminals have previously exploited. Five failed for not taking steps to protect consumers from malicious and fraudulent email.\n\nRelated: 3 Costly and Common Tax Scams to Avoid\n\nIn response to the report, an IRS spokesman told CNBC that the agency \u201cis committed to working with its partners to improve security protections for tax payers and combating stolen identity and refund fraud. As the report rightly notes, the areas of security and privacy are evolving daily.\u201d\n\nThe audit comes as tax scams are on the rise, with the IRS reporting that tax-related phishing and malware incidents have soared this year by around 400 percent. Tax-related fraud cases skyrocketed 154 percent from 2014 to 2015 and show no signs of tapering off.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you\u2019re planning on using an online site to file your taxes this year, be wary.", "title": "The 6 Tax-Filing Sites That Put Your Privacy at Risk", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/29/6-Tax-Filing-Sites-Put-Your-Privacy-Risk", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03212014_Call_Center_Scam.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/29/6-Tax-Filing-Sites-Put-Your-Privacy-Risk", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03212014_Call_Center_Scam.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@milliedent"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If you\u2019re planning on using an online site to file your taxes this year, be wary.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The OTA evaluated the sites using both its own criteria and security and privacy mandated standards that the IRS maintains.\nThe firms in question are part of the IRS\u2019s Free File Alliance, which allows anyone who made less than $62,000 in 2015 file taxes for free.\nThe Free File Alliance says that all members \u201cmust meet our rigorous standards of security and privacy.\u201dSource: Online Tax AllianceThe sites were graded on the basis of three main categories: consumer protection, site security and privacy.\nAlthough the report didn\u2019t specify how each firm performed in each of the categories, it did disclose that three of the failing sites lacked adequate security against vulnerabilities that cybercriminals have previously exploited.\nIf you\u2019re planning on using an online site to file your taxes this year, be wary."}
