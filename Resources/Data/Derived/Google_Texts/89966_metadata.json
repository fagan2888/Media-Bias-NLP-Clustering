Worst of all, the negotiations for the next price increase are taking place in utmost secrecy where \u2018American negotiators are still pressing participating governments to open the process that sets reimbursement rates for drugs and medical devices.\u2019\"\n\nThe WikiLeaks TPP release came as the Obama White House and Republican leaders in the House were engaged in a tag team effort to whip congressmen into supporting the TPA/Fast Track bill that had been pushed through the Senate on May 22, before the Memorial Day recess. At the time of this writing, it is still being hotly debated in Capitol Hill circles whether or not the TPA vote will take place on Friday, or whether House Speaker John Boehner will need to delay a vote until more support can be whipped up.\n\nThe New York Times, in a story on the leaked TPP healthcare annex, accented the Big Pharma-TPP connection, reporting:\n\nPharmaceutical firms and their trade associations have filed by far more lobbying disclosure forms on the Pacific trade negotiations than any other industry, according to the watchdog Sunlight Foundation. More broadly, the pharmaceutical and health product industries have been the biggest spenders on lobbying, and drug company deal-making with the Obama administration and in Congress was instrumental in securing passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Times further noted: \u201cPublic health professionals say pharmaceutical industry lobbying is meant to diminish the power of government health programs that trim reimbursement rates to global pharmaceutical giants. The newly leaked annex, dated Dec. 17, 2014, lists Medicare and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as falling under its strictures.\u201d\n\nAlong with the release of the TPP Healthcare Annex, WikiLeaks also released two separate critical analyses of the documents, one by Professor Deborah Gleeson, School of Psychology and Public Health at La Trobe University in Australia (available here), and the other by Professor Jane Kelsey, Faculty of Law, University of Aukland, New Zealand (available here).\n\nIn a separate opinion column on the TPP annex for Australia\u2019s ABC News on Wednesday, Dr. Gleeson summarized some of the concerns expressed in her more detailed analysis linked above. Among her concerns are that \u201cpharmaceutical companies will be able to sue governments directly over their pharmaceutical policies in international tribunals using the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) \u2014and the terms of the annex may bolster their claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the same type of legal avenue that tobacco giant Philip Morris is using to sue Australia over our plain packaging laws, and US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly is using to sue Canada over its decisions on medicine patents,\u201d Dr. Gleeson states.\n\nThe danger that ISDS tribunal poses is no small matter; as we have reported repeatedly in The New American (see here, here, and here). The sweeping nature of the TPP and its design as an evolving, \u201cliving agreement\u201d guarantees constant conflicts that will end up in TPP and World Trade Organization courts. The decisions of those courts will then be used to demand that U.S. laws, and even the U.S. Constitution, must change in order to \u201charmonize\u201d with global \u201crules and norms.\u201d\n\nRelated articles:\n\nG7 Pushes Completion of Transoceanic Merger Treaties \u201cin the Next Six Months\u201d\n\nPaul Ryan's Pelosi-style Freudian Slip Exposes Truth About ObamaTrade\n\nCorporations Bribe Senators to Vote for TPP Fast-Track\n\nObama, Merkel, G7 Leaders: Double Down or Back Down on Climate Targets?\n\nSenator Sessions to Obama: Stop Fast Track Push, Release Secret Trade Documents\n\nTISA Leaks: Another Secret ObamaTrade Deal, More Reasons to Stop \u201cFast Track\u201d\n\n7 Reasons Why Trade Promotion Authority/Fast Track Must Be Defeated\n\n10 Reasons Why You Should Oppose TPP and TTIP", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "WikiLeaks, TPP, Big Pharma, healthcare annex, secrecy", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/congress/item/21052-leaked-tpp-healthcare-text-another-reason-to-scuttle-secret-treaty", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/7df139ffc4ba1c3c13765ec4c5771c6d_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Latest WikiLeaks release of secret TPP texts confirms critics\u2019 charges of Big Pharma \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d corruption in ObamaTrade process. by William F.
