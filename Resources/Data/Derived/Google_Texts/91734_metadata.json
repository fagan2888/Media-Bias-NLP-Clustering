He doubled down on that later when Anderson Cooper asked him to clarify.\n\nThink about this\u2026. the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for President believes that education and health care should be a priority for the federal government.\n\nThis is not the answer you want to hear if you want to see a limited federal government. This is definitely not the kind of answer you want to hear if you want to see a repeal of the Every Student Succeeds Act, let alone any type of reduction in the size of the federal government\u2019s role in education. If you want to see the end of Obamacare how can we trust a candidate to repeal it when he thinks health care is a priority for the federal government.\n\nSeriously was he channeling Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders because I could totally see both of them including education and health care in their top three as well.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing\u2026 I\u2019m not so sure that Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t give a different answer if asked this question tomorrow. I just don\u2019t believe he thinks critically about these things. If he did this would be even worse.\n\nPlease somebody hand the man a Constitution and ask that he read it.\n\nHere\u2019s the video:\n\nA couple other gems is that attacking another candidate\u2019s wife is ok if he didn\u2019t start it which Cooper rightly says is an argument for a 5-year-old.\n\nHeidi Cruz didn\u2019t start this either, and neither did Ted Cruz for that matter.\n\nAnd surprise, surprise, Trump renounces his pledge to support the GOP nominee.\n\nMy only issue with this is that it is a broken pledge. This is a trust issue. Frankly whether he supports the nominee if it isn\u2019t him or not isn\u2019t the concern. It\u2019s whether he would run as an independent. I\u2019m not so convinced that he would, but then again my track record of predicting anything Trump will do hasn\u2019t been very good so who knows?\n\nFrankly these things pale in comparison when you realize that so many in the Republican Party want to nominate a man who has zero understanding of the Constitution.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2016/03/donald-trump-cnn-gop-townhall-wisconsin/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/donald-trump-anderson-cooper-1024x563.png", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2016-03-30T03:54:51+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "anderson cooper, donald trump, federal role in education, national security, obamacare, election central", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Donald Trump showed a lack of constitutional knowledge when asked what he thought the three top roles for the federal government should be in Wisconsin.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Donald Trump showed a lack of constitutional knowledge when asked what he thought the three top roles for the federal government should be in Wisconsin.", "title": "Donald Trump Flops on Question About Top Three Roles for Feds | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/donald-trump-anderson-cooper-1024x563.png", "updated_time": "2016-03-30T11:24:57-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2016/03/donald-trump-cnn-gop-townhall-wisconsin/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump showed a lack of constitutional knowledge when asked what he thought the three top roles for the federal government should be in Wisconsin.", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/donald-trump-anderson-cooper.png", "title": "Donald Trump Flops on Question About Top Three Roles for Feds | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2016-03-29T22:54:51-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Election Central", "modified_time": "2016-03-30T11:24:57-05:00", "tag": "Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "!#) Health Care (#*!?%?)\nHere\u2019s the thing\u2026 I\u2019m not so sure that Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t give a different answer if asked this question tomorrow.\nHe then shifts and says the top three functions are \u201csecurity, security, security.\u201d Yes we understand that you think that is the top of the top priorities, but moving back to what he first said\u2026 security, education and health care.\nHe doubled down on that later when Anderson Cooper asked him to clarify.\nthe frontrunner for the Republican nomination for President believes that education and health care should be a priority for the federal government."}
