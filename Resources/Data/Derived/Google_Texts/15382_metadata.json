John Cornyn entering a room and discovering people who sound much more conservative than he sounds. On Tuesday morning, shortly after early voting began in his primary, the senior senator from Texas rolled into the offices of a local courier service to accept an endorsement from the National Federation of Independent Businesses. He shook hands and took his place at a table of job creators, asking them for ideas to bring back to Washington, apologizing for what the city had wrought.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cWhat I regret is that the federal government, instead of facilitating what you do\u2014encouraging it, incentivizing it\u2014is doing the opposite,\u201d said Cornyn. \u201c[Former Sen.] Phil Gramm used to talk about doing the Lord\u2019s work in the devil\u2019s city. Sometimes I think it\u2019s like a forward operating base in hostile territory.\u201d\n\nWill Newton, the well-attired executive director of the NFIB in Texas, went with it. \u201cOne of the old leaders of the NFIB in Washington is famous for saying that he considered Washington, D.C., a \u2018work-free drug zone,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEveryone broke out laughing. So did Cornyn. A little while later, a trucking company owner named Darrin Forse went on a tear.\n\n\u201cYou get people to come in and apply for jobs,\u201d said Forse. \u201cFirst thing they ask is, \u2018What\u2019s it gonna pay?\u2019 The government\u2019s giving them whatever they want anyway. A lot of them come up and sign a card and say, \u2018OK, I can get another free check and whatever else.\u2019 That\u2019s what\u2019s happened. They\u2019re getting their insurance for nothing, and here we are, the working people.\u201d\n\nCornyn\u2019s eyes darted around the table, seeking someone else to talk to, finding him in another businessman who\u2019d talk more generally about Obamacare. The roundtable only lasted 30 minutes, and the crowd wasn\u2019t hostile. It just wasn\u2019t satisfied as the senator explained that the GOP could finally deliver for them if it won six more Senate seats. It wasn\u2019t quite satisfied with Cornyn. Still, Cornyn isn\u2019t losing.\n\nObservers outside Texas have not convinced themselves of this fact. Last week Cornyn joined GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell and cast a vote for a one-year delay in the debt limit, punting the issue past the 2014 elections. In Washington this was portrayed as Frodo and Sam locking arms and walking to the mouth of Mount Doom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201c[Sen. Ted Cruz] had forced McConnell, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and other Republicans to cast votes that could cause them to lose primaries to weaker general-election candidates,\u201d wrote Dana Milbank.\n\n\u201cMr. McConnell and Mr. Cornyn chose to expose themselves to primary attacks,\u201d wrote two of the New York Times\u2019 lead political writers.\n\nConservatives hope they can force Sen. Cornyn into a runoff if they believe hard enough.\n\nThe open secret is that Cornyn isn\u2019t facing a typical primary challenge. He\u2019s facing the sort of \u201cthreat\u201d that used to meet incumbents in the Bush years, before the Tea Party, when a few candidates would put their name on the ballots, spend a few thousand dollars, and lose. McConnell\u2019s consistently ahead of his primary opponent, but Cornyn is seen to be so far ahead of his field that the usual Texas pollsters haven\u2019t even bothered checking. The void has been filled by polls paid for by conservative media. The latest poll, which suggested that Cornyn could win less than 50 percent of the vote in the primary and be forced into the runoff, ricocheted around a movement/Twittersphere/blogosphere that badly wants a race.\n\nCornyn\u2019s opponents want a race, too, though it can be hard to tell. Hours before the filing deadline, four months before the vote itself, East Texas Rep. Steve Stockman entered the race. Few Texans have seen him since then. Stockman had won in the 1994 GOP wave, lost in 1996, spent nearly a decade caring for a father with Alzheimer\u2019s, and returned in one of the new seats created by redistricting. He legislated by tweet and by press release, all crafted with care to get \u201clikes\u201d on the right and outraged reactions on the left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how he\u2019s run for Senate, a race he started nearly $100,000 in the hole. One campaign office was condemned. After he tweeted, \u201cIf babies had guns, they wouldn\u2019t be aborted,\u201d and it caught on, he started selling the recycled quip as a bumper sticker. Reporters don\u2019t know where he\u2019s campaigning, or whether he\u2019s campaigning at all\u2014when I asked a spokesman, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not interested.\u201d On Tuesday, as Cornyn campaigned in Houston, Stockman\u2019s campaign Twitter account claimed\u2014five times\u2014that Cornyn had declared Ted Cruz a \u201cthreat\u201d to the nation.\n\nCornyn hadn\u2019t even said that. It didn\u2019t matter. The point was that he wasn\u2019t Ted Cruz, that Cruz had managed to win a primary in 2012 by making it into a runoff, and that conservatives could force Cornyn into a runoff if they believed hard enough. The point is that every conservative knows at least a few people who want to protest Cornyn. Some of them even show up to his rallies.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m against the senator,\u201d said Bud Johnson, a businessman who showed up at the NFIB roundtable. \u201cI\u2019ve just got a real problem with the growth of Washington. When I was in graduate school, I used to get the federal register delivered to my house. It was a few pages. I think it was 75,000 pages last year. When we start controlling the light bulbs in people\u2019s homes, we\u2019ve gone awry.\u201d\n\nTwo days earlier, in the East Texas town of Longview, Cornyn had joined Karl Rove and country singer Neal McCoy for a two-hour fundraiser and jamboree. Mickie Hand, a local Republican parliamentarian, danced in the aisles as McCoy\u2019s band played a cover of \u201cBillie Jean.\u201d Her necklace, a cross built with nails, swayed as she moved. She paused just long enough to condemn Cornyn\u2019s debt limit vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cIf every household did that, we\u2019d be broke,\u201d said Hand. \u201cBut we have a good senator in there who has time, who\u2019s worked his way up. I\u2019m very hesitant to get rid of that for someone who\u2019s not overwhelmingly better.\u201d\n\nOver a long afternoon, I heard many, many iterations of that sentiment. Cornyn was tolerable at best; his opponents weren\u2019t worth looking at. One Longview donor who\u2019d shelled out to attend a pre-jamboree fundraiser with Cornyn and Rove started to tell me that her party needed to recapture the center, or else it couldn\u2019t win in Texas. Realizing what she\u2019d said, she asked me not to use her name.\n\nMy search for some actual enthusiasm led me to a college auditorium in Arlington, Texas, where the six Senate candidates who were not Cornyn or Stockman held their final pre-vote debate. One of them, Ken Cope, had asked Stockman to quit the race because his \u201cantics and embarrassing actions will steal the limelight from the serious candidates.\u201d Another candidate, Dwayne Stovall, actually knew Stockman.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a stupid guy,\u201d Stovall told me over chips and salsa at a sports bar near campus, as a trio of undergrads sang along to Beyonc\u00e9 songs on an iPhone. \u201cHe\u2019s been perpetually trying to be a politician for decades. I think he saw the writing on the wall and said, Cornyn\u2019s gonna be in a runoff. The polls said that six months ago. He rolled the dice. I just wish I knew that when we had breakfast two weeks before he got into the race and he asked how much I\u2019d raised. If I\u2019d have went, \u2018I have $5 million in the bank and I\u2019m gonna whip him!\u2019 then I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have gotten in.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nStovall had not raised $5 million. He was running $4,975,000 short of that. He was driving around Texas, trying to sync up campaign events with the schedule of his emissions-testing business. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a guy who puts 100,000 miles on his car every year,\u201d said Stovall. He\u2019d showed up at Tea Party meetings and candidate forums, winning endorsements after nine of them.\n\nAnd it was easy to see why. Stovall, a former high school wrestler with a shaved head, described a political awakening that started when he was traveling internationally for his old business, linking up with builders in Japan or the Middle East. They explained all the benefits that came America\u2019s way because the dollar was the reserve currency. Stovall looked at America\u2019s debt obligations and imagined how the party would end. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough currency in circulation on the planet to pay that off,\u201d he said, \u201cand yet we think we can keep on doing it.\u201d\n\nStovall had gotten some pre-primary publicity, finally, with that old standby of the underfunded candidate: a viral YouTube video. In his most widely circulated statement of principles, Stovall sat on a pickup truck with his dog and listed the crimes of John Cornyn. \u201cYou don\u2019t stab her in the back by voting for cloture on Obamacare,\u201d he said, referring to Texas. \u201cYou don\u2019t enslave its children with unconstitutional laws and overwhelming debt. And you certainly don\u2019t do all this to please some guy that looks and fights like a turtle.\u201d Cue: a picture of Mitch McConnell and a cartoon turtle.\n\nStovall thought the ad was ridiculous. He\u2019d shot it weeks before, and told the campaign not to run it. Then came the debt vote, which made the ad look prophetic; Stovall told his team to \u201ccut it loose.\u201d The attention paid to that video boosted him almost as much as it depressed him. \u201cYou talk about the Congress enslaving your kids and future generations for no other reason than to grow this government, nothing. You put a talking dog and a turtle in the media, and people talk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTuesday night, Cornyn\u2019s campaign arrived at a Republican donor\u2019s home in the exclusive Royal Oaks neighborhood of Houston. Young professionals, neatly dressed from days at the law firm or the medical device company, paid $25 each for a meet-and-greet. The whole thing was put on by Maverick PAC, started by veterans of the George W. Bush campaign who now find themselves representing the center, if not the left, of their party. They drank wine or light beer and ambled through the house until about 8 o\u2019clock, when Cornyn and local Rep. Ted Poe were shepherded to the living room.\n\n\u201cPersonal involvement is what\u2019s required for a democracy to secede,\u201d said Poe. He corrected himself. \u201cSucceed! Not secede. That\u2019s what Texas is gonna do!\u201d Everybody laughed at the accidental joke, but just in case, Poe waved his hand, looking at Cornyn, as if deleting the comment in the air. The senator took his place.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard for anybody to get to my right, I have to tell you, when it comes to the issues,\u201d said Cornyn. \u201cIt\u2019s important to welcome people who maybe don\u2019t agree with us 100 percent of the time. The fact of the matter is that that\u2019s an impossible standard. How do we accomplish 80 percent of what we want?\u201d\n\nThe young professionals, people who\u2019d be funding Republican campaigns for decades to come, nodded and kept listening.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "People are hyping the Tea Party threat to Texas Sen.
