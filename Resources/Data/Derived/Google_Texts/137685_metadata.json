Brendan Hoffman / Getty Images ID: 8185804\n\nDonald Trump has called Obamacare \u201ca horror,\u201d \u201ca big, fat, horrible lie,\u201d and a \u201ctotal catastrophe.\u201d When the presidential candidate revealed his plan in March to repeal Obamacare, he began by saying that the American people have \u201c[suffered] under the incredible economic burden\u201d of the Affordable Care Act. But one of Trump\u2019s in-laws has turned Obamacare into an economic boon for his multibillion-dollar health care startup, Oscar Health. Perhaps you\u2019ve seen their cutesy subway ads, billboards, or TV commercial?\n\nTrump\u2019s daughter Ivanka is married to real estate scion Jared Kushner, who has been joining his father-in-law onstage at campaign events. \u201cJared is a very, very successful real estate entrepreneur in Manhattan,\u201d Trump told supporters last month, during his victory party for the New Hampshire primary. Jared\u2019s brother is venture capitalist Joshua Kushner, who co-founded Oscar Health, a health insurance company that describes itself as \u201cthe first health insurance company created for consumers in the new world of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d The company launched in New York state in 2013 as a licensed health care provider selling to individuals and families in the marketplaces created by Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we could do this without Obamacare,\u201d Oscar co-founder and CEO Mario Schlosser told the Washington Post in 2013. \u201cYou\u2019d have to break into a market that\u2019s been pretty \u2018oligopolized\u2019 with big insurers catering to brokers, agency houses and big employers. But now we have a direct connection to the consumer.\u201d\n\n\n\nForbes called Oscar the \u201cObamacare startup\u201d in a headline about its $1.5 billion valuation last April. Since then, Oscar\u2019s estimated value has almost doubled: A few weeks ago, the company got $400 million investment from Fidelity at a $2.7 billion valuation.\n\n\n\nOscar claims to offer consumers a more accessible and user-friendly insurance option neatly packaged with a youthful and techie vibe. (Membership cards are mailed in the same kind of box as an iPhone.) The three-year-old company has raised more than $727 million in three years for the concept.\n\n\n\nIn interviews, Kushner has said he had the idea of tackling health care after he tried to decipher an insurance bill. \u201cI\u2019m overeducated and I had no idea what it all meant,\u201d he told New York magazine in 2014. Kushner co-founded the company with two of his friends from Harvard Business School, and they timed Oscar\u2019s launch so that it dovetailed with the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. The magazine also reported that \u201ca pair of Obama 2012 operatives were brought onboard to oversee\u201d Oscar\u2019s canvassing campaign before the open-enrollment deadline.\n\nOscar launched as more of a software layer, relying on other companies to process claims and set up provider networks. But Oscar has since expanded in Texas and California with a different model that narrows its network of doctors and hospitals in order to minimize losses and builds its process and systems from scratch.\n\nAn Oscar spokesperson declined to answer questions from BuzzFeed News about Kushner and his company\u2019s political position. But in December, the same week that the GOP frontrunner bashed Obamacare in a town hall meeting, the White House announced that it was working with Oscar Health and one other startup (Zocdoc, a website for booking doctors\u2019 appointments) to advertise Obamacare coverage. Oscar created a brief PSA targeted at the uninsured. \u201cWe are incredibly motivated by the support the White House has shown us today on this initiative and are proud to share this video we created on just how simple it is to sign up for an affordable plan through the ACA,\u201d the company wrote on its blog.\n\nThere are obviously a few degrees of remove between Trump and the tech company founder. There\u2019s no easy shorthand to describe their connection, although both are listed as relatives on each other\u2019s Wikipedia pages. But the Kushners \u2014 once high-profile Democratic donors \u2014 have become a source of fascination as Jared Kushner continues to join his wife on the Trump campaign trail.\n\nCharles Kushner, father to Jared and Joshua, was one of the largest Democratic donors in America, before his notorious fall from grace after pleading guilty to illegal campaign donations and tax evasion. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who recently joined Trump onstage to endorse his candidacy, was the U.S. attorney prosecuting the case. Kushner had been the primary patron of New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey.\n\nThe elder Kushner paid about half million dollars in civil penalties for making contributions in the name of his real estate partnerships without permission. OpenSecrets showed more than 50 donations made in Joshua Kushner\u2019s name, all to Democratic candidates and causes. The donations started in 1992 when Joshua was 7 years old. Twenty-one of the donations were made in Joshua\u2019s name before he was old enough to vote.\n\nKushner\u2019s political position is particularly interesting given Trump\u2019s tirades against Silicon Valley executives, who have not made their feelings about the candidate known. Last month, Trump called for a boycott of Apple for its refusal to cooperate with the FBI over the San Bernardino killings. But the Verge pointed out today that the GOP frontrunner is back to tweeting from his iPhone. Earlier this week, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk dispelled reports of a \u201csecretive meeting\u201d between Republicans and tech CEOs at the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s annual World Forum about how to stop Donald Trump. Musk tweeted that he was there to talk about Mars and sustainable energy, clarifying that it had \u201cnothing to do with Trump,\u201d but did he did not share his views about the candidate.\n\n\n\nIn his business dealings at least, Kushner seems to be party agnostic. One of the partners of Thrive Capital \u2014 which Joshua Kushner also founded, and which is an investor in Oscar \u2014 is Jared Weinstein, who served as a trusted personal aide or \u201cbody man\u201d to President George W. Bush from 2006 to 2009.\n\nDisclosure: The author of this post was previously employed as a reporter for the New York Observer, which is owned by Jared Kushner.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 4179538, "userid": 3214998}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Oscar Health couldn't have happened without the Affordable Care Act...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
