The company that reportedly organized the event, The Crash, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\n\u201cI have no words for this terrible news,\u201d Joaquin Roldan, director of the AAA wrestling federation, said through his Twitter account. \u201cMy sincerest condolences for the Aguayo Ramirez family.\u201d\n\nMexico is famous for its colorful characters and costumes in professional wrestling, popularly known as lucha libre, where fighters perform daring aerial maneuvers inside and outside the ring.\n\nAguayo, 35, had wrestled for 20 years and was the son of the legendary Pedro \u201cPerro\u201d Aguayo, now retired and a member of the Aztec lucha hall of fame.\n\nThe younger Aguayo was also popular and led a group called \u201cLos Perros de Mal,\u201d or the bad dogs. He won numerous titles, including national pairs with his father, a national heavyweight championship and the Consejo Mundial Lucha Libre world trios championship.\n\n\u201cIt makes me very sad because he was a professional colleague and I have great affection for his father,\u201d the wrestler Hijo del Santo said in a telephone interview. \u201cI think the fans in Japan, the U.S. and Mexico, of course, where he was very popular, must be in mourning, especially because of his youth. He had much ahead of him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hijo del Perro Aguayo, pro wrestler, dies from hit in the ring", "title": "Hijo del Perro Aguayo, pro wrestler, dies from hit in the ring", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/21/hijo-del-perro-aguayo-pro-wrestler-dies-from-hit-in-the-ring/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150321_034938_hijo-del-perro-aguayo.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150321_034938_hijo-del-perro-aguayo.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-21T12:14:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:02:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Pedro Aguayo Ramirez, known as Hijo del Perro Aguayo, fell unconscious on the ropes, apparently after receiving a flying kick from fellow wrestler Oscar Gutierrez, known as Rey Mysterio Jr., according to video of the match in a municipal auditorium in Tijuana.\nThe state prosecutor\u2019s office said it has opened an investigation into possible manslaughter.\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 The son of a Mexican wrestling legend died early Saturday from a blow suffered in the ring, the Baja California state prosecutor\u2019s office said.\nThe match continued for almost two minutes before other participants and the referee realized Aguayo was seriously injured and tended to him.\n\u201cMy sincerest condolences for the Aguayo Ramirez family.\u201dMexico is famous for its colorful characters and costumes in professional wrestling, popularly known as lucha libre, where fighters perform daring aerial maneuvers inside and outside the ring."}
