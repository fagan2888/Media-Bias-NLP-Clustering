REUTERS/Chris Keane\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz said on Tuesday that he\u2019d be enrolling for health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace. It\u2019s an ironic political twist, considering he also promised to repeal \u201cevery word\u201d of the law when he announced his presidential candidacy on Monday.\n\nCruz has been on a path to repeal the law, which is also known as Obamacare, since 2013, when he delivered a 21-hour speech on the Senate floor in an effort to defund the law. But now that he\u2019s running for president in 2016, his wife has taken an unpaid leave of absence from Goldman Sachs in Houston, where she\u2019s a managing director. With no health insurance coverage through his wife, he\u2019s left with few options, if any at all.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be getting new health insurance and we\u2019ll presumably do it through my job with the Senate, and so we\u2019ll be on the federal exchange with millions of others on the federal exchange,\u201d Cruz told CNN's Dana Bash in an interview.\n\nObamacare was designed to fill gaps such as these, in which families might find themselves without health insurance. But as a government employee, he\u2019s eligible for a federally subsidized contribution of up to 75 percent of his premium. When he was asked whether he\u2019d accept the government contribution, he said he\u2019d \u201cfollow the text of the law.\u201d Unsure of what that meant, Bash asked again.\n\n\u201cI strongly oppose the exemption that President Obama illegally put in place for member of Congress because (Senate Minority Leader) Harry Reid and Senate Democrats didn\u2019t want to be under the same rules as the American people. I believe we should follow the text of the law.\u201d\n\nThat plan by Senate Democrats, as The Washington Post reports, was never really an issue in the first place. It was only an effort to get the same subsidies government employees had under their previous health program, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, onto Obamacare. Nevertheless, a spokesperson for Cruz said after the interview that he wouldn\u2019t accept the contribution, following suit with a few other lawmakers.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ted, cruz, finds, affordable, care, act, his, only, option, after, wifes, leave, absence", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Presidential candidate Ted Cruz has made a career of opposing Obamacare, and even vowed to repeal it if elected in 2016, but now that he's running, he's going to need it.", "title": "Ted Cruz Opposes Obamacare And Needs It All At The Same Time", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ted-cruz-finds-affordable-care-act-his-only-option-after-wifes-leave-absence-327072", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/25/ted-cruz.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Presidential candidate Ted Cruz has made a career of opposing Obamacare, and even vowed to repeal it if elected in 2016, but now that he's running, he's going to need it.", "title": "Ted Cruz Opposes Obamacare And Needs It All At The Same Time", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ted-cruz-finds-affordable-care-act-his-only-option-after-wifes-leave-absence-327072", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/25/ted-cruz.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/25/ted-cruz.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-03-25T17:17:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-25T17:17:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Presidential candidate Ted Cruz has made a career of opposing Obamacare, and even vowed to repeal it if elected in 2016, but now that he's running, he's going to need it."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0624\"", "article_summary": "Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) confirms his candidacy for the 2016 U.S. presidential election race during a speech at Liberty College in Lynchburg, Va.
