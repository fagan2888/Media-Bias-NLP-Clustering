Angel Investor Kevin O’Leary of ABC’s Shark Tank slammed President Obama for his inability to strike a deal with the Republican opposition in Congress Monday on CNBC.

O’Leary said he is perplexed at President Obama’s stated opposition against negotiating on Obamacare, noting the litany of problems that are evident even in the program’s infancy.

The educational software entrepreneur also cautioned against what he sees as an increasing tide of “vilification” of business leaders and capitalism as a whole throughout the federal government.

“Somehow over the last 36 months we’ve been able to vilify business leaders, vilify the process of capitalism, tell young kids in school that making money is un-American. That’s all crazy,” O’Leary said:

MARIA BARTIROMO: […] But he says he won’t discuss making changes to Obamacare. Are you saying that if he wants changes on the Republican side, he needs to also make a change on Obamacare?

KEVIN O’ LEARY: Think about Obamacare. We all understand the 30,000-foot vision of that and it has merits but to say that you shouldn’t tweak it at all is crazy, it hasn’t been implemented yet and there’s problems it with it. I think the Republicans can bring something to the table, tweak it more, making it easier to implement for business. Why not negotiate? I don’t get it. Somehow over the last 36 months we’ve been able to vilify business leaders, vilify the process of capitalism, tell young kids in school that making money is un-American. That’s all crazy. That’s not what made this country great. I’m pretty upset as an investor where and we’re at right now.
