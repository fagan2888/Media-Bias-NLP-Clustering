A look at his Santa-like month:\n\nDec. 1: The fitted sweater and perfectly pressed button shirt did little to hide Ware\u2019s presence on the bottom floor of the J.C. Penney at Park Meadows Mall in Lone Tree. In he walked as 50 children from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Denver leapt in shock. Their ear-to-ear grins mirrored his as they welcomed a player they had long idolized from afar.\n\nWare, an 11-year NFL veteran and nine-time Pro Bowl selection, was in his element. He stopped by to say hello to the kids who are in a position he once was as a Boys & Girls Club member in Alabama. He presented them all with $100 gift cardsto spend on presents for friends and family. And then they all went shopping, trying on shoes, picking out shirts, comparing new toys.\n\n\u201cI tell (the kids): \u2018I came from just where you came from. I was in your shoes,'\u201d Ware said. \u201cFor me now, this is like home away from home. I know what it felt like. It brings back those memories and makes me feels good.\u201d\n\nDec. 8: Ware, all 258 pounds of him, squeezed into a Thomas Jefferson High School football jersey with the No. 66 pasted on the back. He was on a mission to surprise members of the team, acting as a new recruit from Dallas named \u201cMarcus Sacksmore.\u201d Hidden under his new yellow-and-maroon jersey was his usual No. 94 Broncos jersey \u2014 a fall-back, lest anyone forget who he really was.\n\nAndrew Skari, the Spartans\u2019 athletic director, corralled his players into a cramped room before welcoming War\u2013 eh, Sacksmore, who waltzed in with helmet and all. The deadpanned looks quickly turned to dropped jaws as Sacksmore threw off his Spartans jersey and reverted back to Ware.\n\nWare then presented the team, which has hit with budget cuts, with footballs and equipment on behalf of the Broncos and Sports Authority. Santa Ware came through yet again. But he had another two weeks to give more.\n\nDec. 18: For the second consecutive year, Ware treated a group of underprivileged children to an advanced movie screening. Last year, the children from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Denver, many whom were orphans, were treated to a viewing of \u201cAnnie.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s screening was of \u201cAlvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip.\u201d The group was from the Boys & Girls Clubs and Warren Village, a program in Denver that helps low-income, single-parent families.\n\nNo media. No cameras. Just him and them.\n\nDec. 22: In a less-than-24-hour trip back home to Dallas following the Broncos\u2019 loss to the Steelers in Pittsburgh, Ware made a pit-stop at a Chick-fil-A in Southlake, Texas, where he footed the bill for those waiting in line behind him. A gift of $200 covered them all.\n\nThe Thank Yous came rolling in on social media. So, too, did the Welcomes.
