Reading such documents has been likened to engaging with \u201cShakespeare\u201d.\n\n\u2018Drafted by lawyers, to be used in American court rooms, the contents of terms and conditions have been designed to protect organisations in the event of legal action.\n\n\u2018As a mechanism for showing that users have provided informed consent, so that organisations can process incredibly persona data, terms and conditions contracts are simply not fit for purpose.\u2019\n\nThe MPs are also critical of the Government\u2019s own record on data protection.\n\nThey cite the disastrous NHS plan to harvest patients\u2019 medical data to improve services - a programme that has been delayed over privacy fears.\n\nThe report said users are not 'informed' when they click their consent as they do not understand the rules\n\nThe committee demands that the Government gets its own house in order and improves data transparency, before it can turn its attention to pushing through a new set of guidelines for social media firms.\n\nMr Miller said: \u2018Socially responsible companies wouldn\u2019t want to bamboozle their users, of course, so we are sure most social media developers will be happy to sign up to the new guidelines on clear communication and informed consent that we are asking the Government to draw up.\n\n\u2018I hope that a voluntary system of guidelines can work, because, if not, legislation might be needed.\u2019\n\nFacebook last night said it had recently simplified its terms and conditions.\n\nIn submissions to the committee in August, Facebook insisted it took data protection seriously.\n\n\u2018We devote the necessary resources to ensure we meet our data protection obligations,\u2019 the firm wrote.\n\n\u2018This includes having a dedicated data protection team that brings together expertise from legal, policy, platform, law enforcement, security, engineering and community operations.\u2019\n\nTwitter said its privacy policy was just four pages and 2,000 words in length. It added \u2018Twitter continually strives to ensure the right balance between providing adequate information whilst also ensuring it is approachable and user friendly.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Facebook,Twitter,small,print,hard,understand,say,MPs,Commons,science,committee,warns,need,law,degree,understand,terms,conditions", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2852428/Facebook-Twitter-small-print-hard-understand-say-MPs-Commons-science-committee-warns-need-law-degree-understand-terms-conditions.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Andrew Miller MP, pictured, warned that Facebook and Twitter needed to carry health warnings on their terms and conditions because they are so difficult to understand.", "title": "Facebook and Twitter small print is too hard to understand, say MPs", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2852428/Facebook-Twitter-small-print-hard-understand-say-MPs-Commons-science-committee-warns-need-law-degree-understand-terms-conditions.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/11/27/238FCC1D00000578-0-image-7_1417128568217.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2852428/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2852428/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2852428, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Facebook,Twitter,small,print,hard,understand,say,MPs,Commons,science,committee,warns,need,law,degree,understand,terms,conditions", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-11-28T00:19:01.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Ben+Spencer+for+the+Daily+Mail", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-11-28T00:35:09.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Facebook Twitter small print hard understand say MPs Commons science committee warns need law degree understand terms conditions"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Andrew Miller MP, pictured, warned that Facebook and Twitter needed to carry health warnings on their terms and conditions because they are so difficult to understand.", "title": "Facebook and Twitter small print is too hard to understand, say MPs", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2852428/Facebook-Twitter-small-print-hard-understand-say-MPs-Commons-science-committee-warns-need-law-degree-understand-terms-conditions.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/11/27/238FCC1D00000578-0-image-7_1417128568217.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Andrew Miller MP, pictured, warned that Facebook and Twitter needed to carry health warnings on their terms and conditions because they are so difficult to understand."}, "article_summary": "It calls for social media groups to display much simplified notices on their websites - comparing them to the health warnings on cigarette packets.\nAndrew Miller MP, the committee\u2019s chairman, said the terms and conditions that users agree to are indecipherable.\nThe Commons Science and Technology Committee warns in a report today that you would need a law degree to understand the terms and conditions used by most companies.\nMillions of people sign away control of their private information and pictures because they do not understand how their data might be used, the committee says.\nAndrew Miller MP, pictured, warned that the terms and conditions on Facebook and Twitter were 'indecipherable' and required a 'US law degree'Social media firms such as Facebook and Twitter should have to display \u2018health warnings\u2019 for their small print, a group of MPs has demanded."}
