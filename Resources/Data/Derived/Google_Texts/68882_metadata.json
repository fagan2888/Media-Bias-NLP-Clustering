He is expected to play in three games for the Rock Cats. If that goes well, he could return to the Rockies for the final month of the season.\n\n\u201cJustin wants to try and get back out there with us this season, and we\u2019re all in for him,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cWe are going to do whatever we can for the guy. It\u2019s good that he\u2019s out there playing again. Real good.\u201d\n\nMorneau, 34, suffered whiplash and a concussion while diving for a ball May 13 in Anaheim, Calif., against the Angels. He also missed significant playing time in 2010 and 2011 with concussions while playing for the Minnesota Twins. Two weeks ago, Morneau took batting practice on the field for the first time since his injury in May.\n\nThe Rockies have Morneau signed through this season, with a $9 million mutual option next season. He is owed a $750,000 buyout if not re-signed.\n\nRoster shuffle for Jason Gurka. Seeking left-handed relief in the bullpen, Colorado selected the contract of Jason Gurka from Triple-A Albuquerque. Gurka, 27, is making his first appearance on a major-league roster.\n\nTo clear a roster space for Gurka, the Rockies optioned right-hander Tommy Kahnle to Triple-A and designated left-hander Kenny Roberts for assignment.\n\nGurka, who throws a fastball, curveball and changeup, was signed as a minor-league free agent last winter.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I was happy I was playing a game for a job,\u201d said Gurka, a 15th-round draft pick by Baltimore in 2008 out of Angelina (Texas) Junior College. \u201cI loved every day of it. I never looked up. I knew opportunity would happen, and I got one with the Rockies.\u201d\n\nGurka was 2-1 with a 3.18 ERA in 21 games (including one start) for Albuquerque this season after getting called up from Double-A.\n\nPitchers over position players. Weiss said the Rockies are more likely to call up pitchers rather than position players Tuesday when big-league rosters can be expanded. Veteran right-hander Kyle Kendrick (strained shoulder) is scheduled to pitch a side session Saturday. Weiss said he still is not sure whether left fielder Corey Dickerson (fractured ribs) will return this season.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead\n\nRockies\u2019 Chris Rusin (4-6, 4.97 ERA) at Pirates\u2019 J.A. Happ (6-7, 4.21), 5:05 p.m. Saturday, ROOT; 630 AM\n\nWho shows up on the mound Saturday night for the Rockies, Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde? Over his last two starts, Rusin has been both. Throwing with precision, the left-hander pitched a five-hit shutout against the Padres at Coors Field on Aug. 16. He followed that with an ugly outing against the Mets last Sunday, getting raked for 11 runs and 12 hits in just two innings. He is 1-2 with a 4.19 ERA in four starts against the Pirates.\n\nHapp, acquired from Seattle at the trade deadline, has been terrific for Pittsburgh, going 2-1 in four starts with a 2.08 ERA. The left-hander earned his second win as a Pirate on Monday at Miami, pitching six shutout innings.\n\nSunday: Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (7-6, 4.61 ERA) at Pirates\u2019 Charlie Morton (8-5, 4.20), 11:35 a.m., ROOT\n\nMonday: Diamondbacks\u2019 Patrick Corbin (3-3, 3.78) at Rockies\u2019 Chad Bettis (6-4, 4.69), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nTuesday\u2019s first game: Diamondbacks\u2019 Rubby De La Rosa (11-6, 4.46) at Rockies\u2019 Yohan Flande (3-1, 4.09), 1:10 p.m., no TV\n\nTuesday\u2019s second game: Diamondbacks\u2019 Randall Delgado (4-3, 3.15) at Rockies\u2019 TBA, 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Justin Morneau begins rehab assignment in Double-A New Britain", "title": "Justin Morneau begins rehab assignment in Double-A New Britain", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/29/justin-morneau-begins-rehab-assignment-in-double-a-new-britain/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-29T12:24:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-29T12:24:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Rockies have Morneau signed through this season, with a $9 million mutual option next season.\nTo clear a roster space for Gurka, the Rockies optioned right-hander Tommy Kahnle to Triple-A and designated left-hander Kenny Roberts for assignment.\n\u201cJustin wants to try and get back out there with us this season, and we\u2019re all in for him,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said.\nTwo weeks ago, Morneau took batting practice on the field for the first time since his injury in May.\nPITTSBURGH \u2014 Justin Morneau might play in a Rockies uniform again after all."}
