Jeff Duncan, retired CPD Lt. Andre Martin, Tyler Harrison, who is in the CPD Explorers program, and Maury County Sheriff\u2019s Department Deputy Tony Greene participated in the discussion.\n\nAnnie Hardison, a social worker and community activist, moderated the meeting and asked the panel questions about ways to improve police and citizen relationships.\n\n\u201cThe first thing, and the main thing, is just be courteous, and that\u2019s not just for police \u2014 that is for anybody you might be communicating with,\u201d Duncan said.\n\nColumbia\u2019s crime rate has dropped 23.7 percent in the last five years, which Duncan attributed to police work but also relationships officers have built in the community.\n\nBooker, who grew up in the south side of Columbia, encouraged police to introduce themselves into the areas where they will be patrolling, especially in black communities where talking to police officers is sometimes viewed negatively.\n\n\u201cWe, as young people, didn\u2019t know how to engage with the police, because there is always that hostility in that relationship,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI think that is the most important thing that can come out of today, is being courteous to our officers, and officers have to be courteous to us as well.\u201d\n\nGreene, who is also a school resource officer, said youth who are not taught respect at home will have no respect for law enforcement.\n\nAs a young person, Greene said he grew up with a negative outlook about police because two officers drove by him and yelled racial slurs as he was walking at Fairview Park. He told his mother about the situation, and she offered some advice.\n\n\u201cShe stated to me \u2018When you get older, you make sure you be a police officer and don\u2019t act like those,\u2019\u201d Greene said.\n\nHe listened. Green climbed the ranks at the MCSD and was recently appointed to fill Christa Martin\u2019s seat on the Columbia City Council.\n\nHarrison, a former Boys &Girls Club member, said police have a tough time building community relationships because there is a lack of respect and trust among youth. Some people\u2019s only interactions with police are negative, he said.\n\n\u201cYouth cannot be afraid to go to these officers to ask for help. They are sworn in to protect and serve and also make an oath to uphold the law,\u201d Harrison said.\n\nAn audience member asked about police involvement in the recent shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nGreene said he was not aware of all the facts surrounding the case but said Brown was told to stop and did not respond to officer Darren Wilson\u2019s commands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to let our young folks know, when they encounter police officers and they tell you to stop \u2014 stop,\u201d Greene said. \u201cWhen you start jerking your hands and moving, you are resisting arrest. Once (the youth) know, then we can prevent that \u2014 to a certain extent.\u201d\n\nMartin, who served with CPD for more than 20 years, said a situation like what happened in Ferguson could have happened here when he first became an officer.\n\nPolice-community relations were nonexistent at the time, Martin said.\n\n\u201cI made sure that when I rode through, I made sure that I stopped and talked to people and started establishing those kind of relationships where people could start trusting me,\u201d he said. \u201cI took a whole lot of heat, from not only people in the community, but also officers in the department.\u201d\n\nThose early efforts translated into creating a local Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) program, which furthered opportunities to build relationships with young people, Martin said.\n\n\u201cThe only way that we can clean this stuff up is we\u2019ve got to do it together,\u201d he added.\n\nHumphrey closed the discussion by encouraging youth to also view police as people. Law enforcement are there to help young people work through problems together, he said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to talk to me. I am human like everyone else \u2026 I am just like you. I don\u2019t like to be labeled a bad guy because of what someone else did,\u201d Humphrey said.\n\nKetron Hatton, a 16-year-old Central High School student, said he felt the meeting was positive for him and his other Boys &Girls club members.\n\n\u201cI feel like the youth went away with more trust and felt as if the policemen of Columbia do care about how we live, how we are treated and what we make of ourselves,\u201d Hatton said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Respect and courtesy can go a long way when citizens interact with law enforcement, manners that should be shown from both sides, a panel of police and local officials said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "TIM HODGE thodge@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "Respect and courtesy can go a long way when citizens interact with law enforcement, manners that should be shown from both sides, a panel of police and local officials said.", "title": "Panel discusses police, community relations", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/panel-discusses-police-community-relations", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_DSC_0038_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/panel-discusses-police-community-relations", "creator": "@thedailyherald", "card": "summary", "title": "Panel discusses police, community relations"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1092380", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1092380", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,Local News,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-18T18:50:25-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde618\"", "article_summary": "Columbia\u2019s crime rate has dropped 23.7 percent in the last five years, which Duncan attributed to police work but also relationships officers have built in the community.\nAnnie Hardison, a social worker and community activist, moderated the meeting and asked the panel questions about ways to improve police and citizen relationships.\nHarrison, a former Boys &Girls Club member, said police have a tough time building community relationships because there is a lack of respect and trust among youth.\nRespect and courtesy can go a long way when citizens interact with law enforcement, manners that should be shown from both sides, a panel of police and local officials said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to let our young folks know, when they encounter police officers and they tell you to stop \u2014 stop,\u201d Greene said."}
