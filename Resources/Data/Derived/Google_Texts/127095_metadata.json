I was taught that Harry Truman was the greatest president ever because he was strong, stood up to the communists, and most important, he was from Missouri. I was taught to stand up for the little guy, and that bigger government was the best way to do that. I registered to vote as a Democrat, and several years ago some Democrats even tried to recruit me to run for Congress.\n\nThere was one rather large problem. As I got older, I no longer believed in their ideas. Even worse, I had concluded that liberals aren\u2019t just wrong. All too often they are world-class hypocrites. They talk a great game about helping the most vulnerable, with ideas that feel good and fashionable. The problem is their ideas don\u2019t work, and often hurt the exact people they claim to help.\n\nAfter four tours of duty as a Navy SEAL officer, I came home from Iraq and watched the VA \u2013 the second-biggest bureaucracy in the country \u2013 fail my friends. The VA was broken and my friends were suffering. And yet, time and again, the only \u201csolution\u201d I heard from liberals was to spend more money. It made me angry.\n\nI became a conservative because I believe that caring for people means more than just spending taxpayer money; it means delivering results. It means respecting and challenging our citizens, telling them what they need to hear, not simply what they want to hear.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I doubted their intentions. But good intentions are easy. Even easier when you\u2019re spending other people\u2019s money. But they\u2019re not enough. To actually achieve meaningful results, you have to have good ideas, discipline and accountability to go along with it. The problem is that most Democrats seem to think more money and bigger government are the solutions to virtually every single problem. They\u2019re wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to give people food stamps; harder to get people into good-paying jobs. It\u2019s easy to encourage dependency; harder to help people into a life of purpose and dignity. The worst are politicians who smugly talk about caring for the little guy, and then abandon the poorest, most vulnerable of our children to schools that give them little chance to succeed. That\u2019s not just hypocrisy. It\u2019s a tragedy.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nI became a conservative because I believe that caring for people means more than just spending taxpayer money; it means delivering results. It means respecting and challenging our citizens, telling them what they need to hear, not simply what they want to hear.\n\nI am not a career politician. I\u2019ve never run for office, and I don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers. In fact, the political world is still a very foreign place to me. But I believe Missouri is heading the wrong direction, and I don\u2019t trust the career politicians who created this mess to fix it.\n\nSo what would I do? I believe in limited but effective government. I believe in replacing ObamaCare with something that actually works. I believe in putting working families and job creation ahead of special interests. I believe that in a free society we have to defend religious liberties and the 2nd Amendment, and protect innocent life, so everyone has the freedom to pursue happiness. I believe in reforming welfare, so every person can have a chance at a life of dignity, purpose, and meaning. And I believe America\u2019s public schools should be the best in the world.\n\nIn other words, I believe we have a lot of work to do.\n\nI was raised to stand up for the little guy, for working families and the middle class. I am committed to that principle today more than ever. And if I thought the Democratic Party had the right ideas to do that, I\u2019d still be one of them. But they don\u2019t. And if I trusted career politicians to fix the problems they created, I\u2019d still be standing on the sidelines. But I don\u2019t.\n\nAs Americans, we deserve much better than what we\u2019re getting from our government. We don\u2019t need more rhetoric. We want results. And that means changing politics as usual, which won\u2019t be easy. But nothing worthwhile ever is. You have to fight for what you believe in, and I, for one, have never backed down from that kind of fight.\n\nEric Greitens is a former Navy SEAL, Rhodes Scholar, humanitarian and decorated combat veteran.
