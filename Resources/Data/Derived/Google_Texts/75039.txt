WAKEFIELD, R.I. (AP) - Police say a southern Rhode Island man has been charged with trespassing on the property of pop singer Taylor Swift.

The Westerly Sun reports (http://bit.ly/1FmbnYS ) the 19-year-old man had to jump two fences to gain entry. He told Westerly police he was “there to see someone who was not there at the time.”

He appeared before a judge on Friday and pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor charge. Police say the gates were closed at all entrances to Swift’s ocean-front property on April 12. Swift was not present at the time of the incident.

Police told the newspaper security guards are usually positioned at the front entrance of the estate. The man gained entry at the rear of the home.

He was released and promised to appear at a pretrial conference on May 8.
