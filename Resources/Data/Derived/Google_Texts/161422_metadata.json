But is there any scientific merit to such theories?\n\nNew research suggests that claims about Facebook and social media addictions are not purely hyperbolic. In a recent study, German scientists linked the intensity of Facebook use to the brain\u2019s nucelus accumbens \u2014 our cerebral \u201creward center\u201d \u2014 where we subconsciously derive chemical payoffs from certain actions. The findings, published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, indicate that positive social feedback channeled through platforms like Facebook correspond to heightened activity within this area.\n\nAccording to study author Dar Meshi, the \u201caddictive\u201d effect may originate in Facebook\u2019s capacity for reputation management. Although social reputation is often dismissed by some individuals as puerile and meaningless, it endures as an instinctual component of human psychology.\n\n\u201cAs human beings, we evolved to care about our reputation. In today's world, one way we're able to manage our reputation is by using social media websites like Facebook,\u201d Meshi wrote. \"Our study reveals that the processing of social gains in reputation in the left nucleus accumbens predicts the intensity of Facebook use across individuals. These findings expand upon our present knowledge of nucleus accumbens function as it relates to complex human behavior.\"\n\nIn a concomitant experiment involving 31 subjects, the researchers found that fluctuations in nucleus accumbens activity was proportional to an individual\u2019s Facebook use. Using MRI scans, Meshi and his colleagues recorded the subjects\u2019 responses to both received and observed positive social feedback. Positive feedback given to someone else yielded a different activity pattern compared to positive feedback directed at the subject himself or herself. The degree to which activity differed corresponded to the intensity of Facebook use.\n\n\"Our findings relating individual social media use to the individual response of the brain's reward system may also be relevant for both educational and clinical research in the future,\" the study authors write.\n\nThat said, the researchers stress that the results do not determine long-term effects or whether the heightened activity compels users back to the platform \u2014 two key characteristics of addiction. Social media may approximate drugs and alcohol in the heightened brain activity it yields, but its long-term addictive capacity is still unknown. For now, Facebook addiction remains an unproven but plausible epidemic.\n\nAll things in moderation.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "facebook addiction, social media addiction, facebook brain, facebook health effect", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "MRI scans suggest that Facebook addiction could be a real psychological condition, as the intensity of use corresponds to heightened cerebral activity.", "title": "Facebook Addiction: Social Media Use Linked To Reward Center In Brain, Scientists Conclude", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/facebook-addiction-social-media-use-linked-reward-center-brain-scientists-conclude-255254", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/01/facebook.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MRI scans suggest that Facebook addiction could be a real psychological condition, as the intensity of use corresponds to heightened cerebral activity.", "title": "Facebook Addiction: Social Media Use Linked To Reward Center In Brain, Scientists Conclude", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/facebook-addiction-social-media-use-linked-reward-center-brain-scientists-conclude-255254", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/01/facebook.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/01/facebook.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-01T13:54:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-01T15:52:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "MRI scans suggest that Facebook addiction could be a real psychological condition, as the intensity of use corresponds to heightened cerebral activity."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c04\"", "article_summary": "Social media may approximate drugs and alcohol in the heightened brain activity it yields, but its long-term addictive capacity is still unknown.\nNew research suggests that claims about Facebook and social media addictions are not purely hyperbolic.\nAlthough social reputation is often dismissed by some individuals as puerile and meaningless, it endures as an instinctual component of human psychology.\nThe intensity of Facebook use corresponds to fluctuations in activity within the nucleus accumbens, the brain's \"reward center.\"\nIn today's world, one way we're able to manage our reputation is by using social media websites like Facebook,\u201d Meshi wrote."}
