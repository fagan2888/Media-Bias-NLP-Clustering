Seems like your run-of-the-mill \"Star Wars\" shirt \u2014 something we're seeing a lot of because of this:\n\n\"I will finish what you started,\" a character in the \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" trailer said.\n\n\"The dark side,\" another character said.\n\nBut Joe Southern says his son Colton came home from George Junior High School in Texas and said he couldn't wear his \"Star Wars\" shirt anymore because the Stormtrooper is holding a gun.\n\nYes, it's technically a gun. But let's point out it's not a gun that actually exists in the real world.\n\nAccording to the school's student handbook, the dress code forbids clothing that \"contains language or symbols oriented toward violence.\"\n\nSouthern mentioned on Facebook his son had worn the shirt many other times with no problem, and that his son is a model student.\n\n\"It's political correctness run amok. You're talking about a 'Star Wars' T-shirt, a week before the biggest movie of the year comes out. It has nothing to do with guns or making a stand,\" Southern told KTRK.\n\nLocal outlet KTRK reports Colton wasn't punished by the school, but was asked to zip up his jacket to cover the shirt.\n\nThis video includes an image from Facebook / Joe Southern.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A junior high school in Texas told a student to cover his \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" shirt because the Stormtrooper was carrying a gun.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "A junior high school in Texas told a student to cover his \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" shirt because the Stormtrooper was carrying a gun.", "title": "Boy Told He Can't Wear 'Star Wars' Shirt At School Because It Has Gun", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/boy-told-he-can-t-wear-star-wars-shirt-at-school-because-it-has-gun/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1450112392.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A junior high school in Texas told a student to cover his \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" shirt because the Stormtrooper was carrying a gun.", "title": "Boy Told He Can't Wear 'Star Wars' Shirt At School Because It Has Gun", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/boy-told-he-can-t-wear-star-wars-shirt-at-school-because-it-has-gun/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1450112392.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=1wcmxpeTo2HPCmvvKRtlCK4NKIyKmBYm&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://54758", "iphone": "newsy://54758", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://54758", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "newsy,newsy trending,star wars shirt,boy can't wear star wars shirt,boy told he can't wear star wars shirt,boy gets in trouble for star wars shirt,joe southern star wars shirt,colton southern star wars shirt,star wars shirt sent home,school sends boy home over star wars shirt,george junior high,george junior high star wars shirt,weird news,trending news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1450112392.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Seems like your run-of-the-mill \"Star Wars\" shirt \u2014 something we're seeing a lot of because of this:\"I will finish what you started,\" a character in the \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" trailer said.\nA junior high school in Texas told a student to cover his \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" shirt because the Stormtrooper was carrying a gun.\nYou're talking about a 'Star Wars' T-shirt, a week before the biggest movie of the year comes out.\nIt has nothing to do with guns or making a stand,\" Southern told KTRK.\nBut Joe Southern says his son Colton came home from George Junior High School in Texas and said he couldn't wear his \"Star Wars\" shirt anymore because the Stormtrooper is holding a gun."}
