Novant Health officials announced plans Monday to lay off up to 400 people systemwide over the next few weeks.

The layoffs are part of a reorganization effort that began last fall, Novant officials said in a statement.

The cut positions make up about 2 percent of the hospital's workforce. It's not known which positions will be impacted.

Company officials said they're trying to match affected workers with other open positions over the next 45 days.

Novant currently has 15 medical centers in four states. Company officials said the following in a statement:

"The evaluation was a necessary step to continue to serve Novant Health communities in the future despite declining reimbursements and many other challenges facing the healthcare industry today.

"Overall this process has streamlined Novant Health operations and creates a blueprint for success as the industry continues to evolve. Redundancies have been reduced and standardization in many areas of the organization has been applied."
