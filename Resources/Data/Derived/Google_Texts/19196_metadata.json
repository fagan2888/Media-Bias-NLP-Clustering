An agency receives a measure score if the measure is tied to at least 20 home health episodes of care, says CMS. Payment adjustments will occur when scores are generated for at least 5 measures.\n\n5 highlights of CMS\u2019s HHVBP FAQs\n\nThe OASIS-based measures are calculated using assessments from the OASIS assessments from Medicare FFS, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid FFS, and Medicaid Managed care. However, the measures are risk adjusted to include risk factor elements like the payer for the episode (Medicare/ Medicaid / Managed Care) as well as other risk factors selected using a rigorous, multi-step process that includes clinical review of the scientifically identified risk factors.\n\nOASIS measures are risk adjusted at the national level. The risk adjustment methodology compensates for differences in the patient population served by different home health agencies, using a predictive model developed specifically for each measure.\n\nFor the majority of the measures, the data utilized is based on information already being reported by HHAs through OASIS. There are also two measures that are claims-based, five measures from HHCAHPS, and three New Measures to be reported by HHAs via the HHVBP Secure Portal. For the New Measures, HHAs will submit data on a quarterly basis beginning October 2016.\n\nRisk adjustment elements are the same as what is currently reported on Home Health Compare for those measures that are currently being reported and are based on the OASIS data that are provided to CMS by the HHAs themselves. Technical specifications of calculated measures that are not currently on the CMS website will be provided in early 2016.\n\nNot all measures selected for the HHVBP Model are currently publicly reported on Home Health Compare, and any additional public reporting of home health measures for this Model will be addressed in future rulemaking. Information about the measures utilized in the first year of the HHVBP Model, including the measure specifications for the coordination of care and prior functioning measures will be presented during a webinar tentatively scheduled for January 2016.\n\nCMS says HHVBP leverages past successes and promotes quality care\n\nCMS asserted last summer that HHVBP \u201cleverages the successes of and lessons learned from other value-based purchasing programs and demonstrations \u2013 including the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program and the Home Health Pay-for-Performance and Nursing Home Value-Based Purchasing Demonstrations.\u201d\n\nCMS explained the following regarding future payment adjustments:\n\n[These HHAs] will have their payments adjusted by a maximum payment adjustment of 3-percent (upward or downward) in 2018, a maximum payment adjustment of 5-percent (upward or downward) in 2019, a maximum payment adjustment of 6-percent (upward or downward) in 2020, a maximum payment adjustment of 7-percent (upward or downward) in 2021, and a maximum payment adjustment of 8-percent (upward or downward) in 2022.\n\n\u201cPeople want to be taken care of in their homes and communities whenever possible, and CMS aims to make sure that care in the home is supported by a value-based care delivery model that is consistent with the rest of the system. The goal is that no matter where the care is delivered, it is supported by a payment system that rewards providers who deliver the highest quality outcomes,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, Acting CMS Administrator.\n\nCMS claims HHVBP may actively promote quality care among Medicare-certified HHAs. Around 3.5 million beneficiaries received home health services across nearly 12,000 HHAs last year at a cost of nearly $18 billion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Competition across the nation for a value-based payment trophy is underway with the start of a new year. 9 states have implemented HHVBP as of January 1, 2016.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/cms-tackles-value-based-purchasing-pilot-program-questions", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_7744888138.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "CMS Tackles Value-Based Purchasing Pilot Program Questions"}, "twitter": {"description": "Competition across the nation for a value-based payment trophy is underway with the start of a new year. 9 states have implemented HHVBP as of January 1, 2016.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_7744888138.jpg"}, "title": "CMS Tackles Value-Based Purchasing Pilot Program Questions", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "For the New Measures, HHAs will submit data on a quarterly basis beginning October 2016.\nNine states, each representing a different geographic region, have implemented the home health value based purchasing pilot program (HHVBP) as of last Friday, January 1.\nAn agency receives a measure score if the measure is tied to at least 20 home health episodes of care, says CMS.\nCMS claims HHVBP may actively promote quality care among Medicare-certified HHAs.\nTechnical specifications of calculated measures that are not currently on the CMS website will be provided in early 2016."}
