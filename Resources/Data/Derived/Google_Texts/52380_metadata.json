Amazon Prime offers a slew of new shows with a lot of big-name talent, compounding the notion that TV is everything and everywhere. (Amazon exec Joe Lewis jokes that they\u2019ll deliver via drone soon.)\n\n\u201cI feel very honored in bringing forth this subject,\u201d Jeffrey Tambor said of his transitioning trans- character in \u201cTransparent.\u201d All 10 episodes of the dark, provocative comedy will be released simultaneously at the end of September.\n\nWorking for an emerging online network makes no difference for the actor. \u201cThe revolution has been here for some time,\u201d Tambor said of the network/distributor as opposed to working in broadcast TV.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think of it as a lesser TV series,\u201d said filmmaker-writer-director Jill Soloway (\u201cThe United States of Tara,\u201d \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d). The actors are paid the equivalent of a network TV series. And \u201cbudget-wise, I\u2019m working with more money than I\u2019ve ever had before,\u201d Soloway said.\n\nShe shopped the script around to the premium cable networks. \u201cIt was a risk to be part of a brand or slate\u201d like Amazon. As a writer, she said, she got more instant feedback from Amazon than the usual lengthy uncertainty she faced at the networks. She doesn\u2019t think the Amazon platform makes this a \u201cwebseries,\u201d but rather sees the streaming service as the next evolution in independent filmmaking.\n\nAs for the transgender content: \u201cAs a feminist,\u201d Soloway said, \u201cI think a lot about what it means, to explore the feminine within the feminist\u2026what it means to think about a wounded father replaced by a blossoming femininity\u2026 The ideas about gender freedom\u2026It\u2019s fertile ground.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Amazon,Jeffrey Tambor,Jill Soloway,streaming,Transparent", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ostrow Off The Record", "description": "Today at the TCA press tour Amazon made a first appearance, acting less like an online shopping mall than a TV studio.
