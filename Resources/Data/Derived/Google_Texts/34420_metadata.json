The site lets its members sell craft supplies, items that are vintage (at least 20 years old), or items made exclusively by the seller's hands. Etsy's community sold 5.6 million items in September, equaling $109.5 million of goods sold, according to site's most recent statistic release.

Emily Matchar explored what she coined the \"new domesticity\" trend in her recent book \"Homeward Bound.\" During her research the author found that a growing number of people, many women, are embracing crafting and the DIY lifestyle. Part of the shift, she said, is because of the lagging economy; selling your own goods online or at local bazaars can bring in some much-needed extra income. Additionally, websites such as Etsy have created a strong community around these hobbies. \"I don't think this new domesticity phenomenon would exist without the Internet,\" Matchar said. \"It was modern technology that spread interest in these types of things.\" While the Web has spurred interest in homesteading hobbies, Matchar said part of new domesticity is about occasionally stepping back from modern conveniences as a way to return to the so-called simple life. However, choosing to knit a sweater as a hobby is much different than needing to knit a sweater so your child can stay warm in the winter. \"People who were homesteading the American West, that was an incredibly difficult thing to do -- especially for the women. It was very isolating,\" Matchar said. \"Now people that are trying to go back to the past, they sometimes find they feel more connected than ever.\" But, as with any trend, it's hard to say how long it will all last. \"I don't know if people are going to be raising chickens in Brooklyn in 10 or 15 years,\" Matchar said. -- Stover E.

Harger III\n\nIn this golden age of online shopping, there is also a parallel trend of wanting to spend our money on authentic and meaningful things, from local produce to crafted furniture. Three local artisans from Clark County have catapulted their creative wares across the globe, thanks to the website Etsy.com.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s stuff that you\u2019d never expect (on Etsy); there\u2019s a never-ending amount of things on there,\u201d said Christy Jarvis, a Fruit Valley resident and co-owner of OrWaDesigns. Etsy lets each seller set up a virtual storefront on its site, much like a physical craft market.\n\nOrWaDesigns\u2019 shop is filled with retro bookcases and coffee tables that might please anyone shopping for modern furniture. Prices range from $80 for a small side table to $1,300 for large entertainment credenza.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Jarvis said, \u201cI think, \u2018How the heck did this happen?\u2019 It\u2019s kind of shocking that we became furniture-makers.\u201d\n\nAs a hobby, Jarvis and boyfriend Randall Campbell liked to fix up old furniture they found and then resell it. But they knew nothing about building mid-century furniture when they started. Campbell taught himself by examining how old furniture pieces were assembled. He is responsible for all of the building; Jarvis lacquers and stains the furniture. She also handles the shipping and customer service through the site.\n\n\u201cSomeone asked for a big television stand, then everyone wanted one and we started selling it like crazy,\u201d she said.\n\nThe duo capitalizes on the popularity of mid-century furniture. \u201cWe make it affordable,\u201d Jarvis said, using pine instead of fancier walnut and building each piece from scratch. \u201cEverything\u2019s custom. That\u2019s why we do well: We build to order.\n\n\u201cI was pretty nervous the first time we shipped stuff \u2014 \u2018What if they don\u2019t like it?\u2019 It\u2019s something they\u2019ll be using and having it in their home. It seemed weird at first, and now it\u2019s just normal, now it\u2019s a compliment, for people to decorate their homes with (our furniture).\u201d\n\nAmy Stewart opened her Etsy jewelry store in 2010, when Etsy was still a strange concept to those not in the know. She describes her aesthetic as \u201csimple, everyday pretty. I try to create all my pieces to fall within that feel. I get my inspiration from what I see.\u201d Her store, Junghwa, has more than 11,000 sales, thanks to her designs.\n\nAnd her designs are resonating with many looking for simple pieces they can wear every day. \u201cA lot of my jewelry is exactly what people are looking for. It was stuff I was trying to find but couldn\u2019t, so I made it.\u201d Her items range from $15 rope bracelets to long 14K gold necklaces at $71. Her jewelry has\n\nbeen featured in fashion magazines like Lucky, Cosmopolitan Bride and the wedding-centric website Emmalinebride.com.\n\nShe credits her sister, who sells bridal veils and other accessories on Etsy, with pushing her to pursue jewelry design. She makes every piece to order from her home in east Vancouver. \u201cI try to limit work to Monday to Friday,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m usually only making jewelry a couple hours of the day and shipping the rest of the week.\u201d By working in blocks of time, it allows Stewart to work at home and spend time with her young son \u2014 though she\u2019s always thinking of new designs to create.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a hard worker, but I didn\u2019t care about the job; I never did anything before that I wanted to do forever,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cNow, my work ethic is so different; I\u2019m working all the time. I\u2019m such a workaholic.\u201d\n\nThe downside for many shops, new and old, is standing out in a sea of similar handmade necklaces, scarves and totes.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started, I felt like there wasn\u2019t a lot of people selling jewelry, and if they were, it was so different from me. Now everyone does it,\u201d Stewart said. She\u2019s seen her new designs adapted by other shops a day later. She views the saturation as something to overcome with more creativity. \u201cIt pushes me to make more designs and keep moving forward. I wouldn\u2019t grow if I didn\u2019t have that mentality.\u201d\n\nFor ceramic artist Tara Kloida-White of the Camas-Washougal area, Etsy provided more flexibility as an artist and a discovered passion for sculpting leather. She and her husband, Jeremy White, used the site to sell their Celtic-inspired stone pendants. But when Kloida-White began to wonder if she could sculpt images in deerskin leather the same way she did with ceramics, \u201cI thought maybe I can make some leather wristbands and sell them with the pendants.\u201d She taught herself how to create tooled and embossed leather while looking for something to do while living in England with her husband. Now her store SevenAnNine is filled with hand-tooled leather bags, wallets, knife sheaths and necklaces that range from $10 for the pendants to $575 for her leather handbags.\n\nThe ability to customize is the biggest advantage of Etsy stores, as customers can work with artisans to bring their needs to fruition, from custom wedding rings to party favors. And the draw of handmade shows in the numbers.\n\n\u201cI do a lot of custom orders. People contact me: \u2018I would like to have this type of bag with this symbol, or a re-creation of a father\u2019s wallet.\u2019 They start sharing with me their stories.\u201d Her customers have told her about family heirlooms they hope she can emulate, or they just discover their own Celtic heritage and want to honor it. She spent months creating a special medicine bag for a client, who rewarded her work with a $3,000 payment.\n\nKloida-White estimates that her goods sold through Etsy are divided 50-50 between regular and custom orders. But even then, she makes even the regular wristbands to a customer\u2019s specific wrist measurements.\n\n\u201cIt really is a pleasure to make things for other people,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just something very unique and fulfilling about making something for somebody that they\u2019re going to treasure for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe couple recently opened up their storefront Celtica in Westfield Vancouver mall for the holiday season. And with a physical store, Kloida-White and her husband must stockpile an inventory of their work for shelves. It will be just the two of them running the store, 12-hour days with no days off. But the nest egg at the end of their holiday store is worth it, she said.\n\nAt the heart of it, Etsy has offered many a chance to supplement or replace their income after the economic downturn through creative endeavors.\n\n\u201cWe both lost our jobs about three years ago,\u201d said Jarvis, who worked as a receptionist. Campbell worked at a distribution company. This is now their full-time job, with furniture busting out the seams of their two-bedroom home, as they fill a backlog of orders.\n\n\u201cOur living room is a workshop, and we built one of those storage sheds in the backyard. We live in it, our work, but it\u2019s worth it, being able to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have done the festivals, the lifestyle that you have traveling as an artist,\u201d Kloida-White said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty inconsistent; you never know what you\u2019re going to make money-wise.\n\n\u201cEtsy opens that to any time of the year; it\u2019s like going to a big Portland Saturday Market, except you don\u2019t have to go to booth to booth to booth to find that special thing you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nJarvis, the furniture maker and Stewart, the jewelry designer, recommend the key to success on the site is being active, either through Etsy\u2019s social media aspects of \u201cfavoriting\u201d and \u201cliking\u201d items or through the site\u2019s forums.\n\n\u201cWhen you first get on Etsy, (your shop) starts off really slow,\u201d said Jarvis, who said it took almost two years before they started seeing their sales take off.\n\nStewart predicts that the handmade movement will also bounce to physical stores, as bigger stores like West Elm and Anthropologie are already promoting local vendors in the area with \u201cpop-up shops.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my full-time business; it\u2019s definitely a big factor into our income,\u201d said Stewart, who left her position as a medical assistant to pursue her dream of design.\n\n\u201cI knew what I wanted to do was being creative, and if I wanted to get a job in the creative field I would have to go to a lot more school and compete with a lot of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompared to five or 10 years ago, so many more people have their own businesses now,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cThey had to come up with something else (due to the economic downturn), and people, they\u2019re a lot more creative then they ever gave themselves credit for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "In this golden age of online shopping, there is also a parallel trend of wanting to spend our money on authentic and meaningful things, from local produce", "application-name": "", "og": {"site_name": "The Columbian", "description": "In this golden age of online shopping, there is also a parallel trend of wanting to spend our money on authentic and meaningful things, from local produce to crafted furniture.
