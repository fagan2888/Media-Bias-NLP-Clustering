Reuters reported last month that Citigroup, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America were the corporations angered by her attacks.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator responded by launching a fundraising drive on March 27 against the companies in question.\n\nWarren has also called for a freeze on Wall Street contributions in the 2016 presidential election. Despite progressive calls to seek the Democratic nomination herself, she said she is \u201cnot going to run.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep. Edwards also urged her opponent Rep.
