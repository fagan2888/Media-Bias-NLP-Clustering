Renee Ellmers speaks during a hearing on implementation of the Affordable Care Act before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Oct. 24, 2013 on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n4070829\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers says the federal government should allow illegal immigrants to stay in the United States, and should welcome a new inflow of foreign guest workers.\n\nHer support for foreign workers is fueling a primary bid by Frank Roche, an economics lecturer at nearby Elon University.\n\nAt campaign events, any mention of Ellmers\u2019 support for amnesty, Roche told The Daily Caller, \u201calways gets the crowd roiled up \u2014 they do not want it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m advocating for a low level of immigration [and] no amnesty,\u201d he said, adding that a good reform should minimize the impact on employers.\n\n\u201cWe have significant portions of our economy that are dependent on immigrant labor,\u201d said Roche, who worked in New York\u2019s international banking sector for 20 years. \u201cWe need to move away from that via [greater] mechanization and a change in language to emphasize that all work is good.\u201d\n\nThe race between Ellmers and Roche is one consequence of the push by top GOP leaders and business lobbies for an immigration bill that would sharply increase the inflow of low-wage foreign workers, despite the huge numbers of unemployed or non-working Americans.\n\nNext week, GOP leaders will use their spring strategy session in Cambridge, Md., to push Republican legislators to back an emerging proposal that would provide a form of amnesty, sometimes dubbed \u201clegalization,\u201d to roughly 12 million immigrants. The proposal would also increase the current inflow of non-agriculture guest workers, now around 650,000 per year, for use in the food, retail, construction, hospitality and professional sectors.\n\n\u201cIf there are people who have not lost their jobs to illegal immigrants, they will if Renee Ellmers succeeds,\u201d said William Gheen, founder of the N.C.-based Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. \u201cThe tea party people are going to go with Frank Roche.\u201d\n\nEllmers declared her support for more guest workers and for citizenship for illegals after they complete a number of steps in a Jan. 18 op-ed in the Fayetteville Observer.\n\n\u201cIf an individual wants to come to this country to work, to provide for his family and contribute to his community, he should be allowed to do so,\u201d Ellmers wrote.\n\nThe pressure for an inflow of low-wage workers comes from local businesses, Ellmers said.\n\n\u201cThe local leaders I met with covered a variety of industries, including housing, construction, hospitality, restaurant, research and development, high tech and agriculture,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was impressed with their candor and sense of urgency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just had a real hard time getting local workers,\u201d farmer Faylene Whittaker told TheDC. Last October, she and 26 other farmers met \u201cwith Ms. Ellmers \u2026 and we told her that tomatoes can\u2019t wait three, four, five days to be picked.\u201d\n\nWhittaker says her farm has to use guest-workers because Americans won\u2019t do the stoop labor at roughly $10 an hour. \u201cI have no clue\u201d what wage would persuade Americans to take the stoop job, she said, adding that \u201cI know my [foreign] workers are putting their kids through college\u201d on the salaries they earn in the fields.\n\nThe farm also uses two-man tomato-picking machines, but those can only pick tomatoes that are intended for food-processing companies, Whittaker said.\n\nShe hire local workers for her seasonal landscaping business, she says.\n\nEmployers have a lot of clout in the state.\n\nIn August, Democrats and Republicans legislators pushed through a law allowing employers to hire illegal immigrants for up to nine months before using an electronic network to verify the workers\u2019 eligibility to work.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, vetoed the law, but the legislators overrode his veto.\n\n\u201cIt has a huge loophole for probably up to 30 percent of our businesses in North Carolina to not use e-verification, which tells whether you\u2019re hiring illegal immigrants for the jobs,\u201d McCrory said before his veto was bypassed. \u201cI want to save North Carolina jobs for citizens of North Carolina, especially us being the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "Voters 'do not want' Renee Ellmers' version of immigration reform, challenger says", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "North Carolina Republican Rep.
