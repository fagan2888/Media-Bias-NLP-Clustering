Of course Tiffany B. Gaines, founder of Lovability Condoms, is right. The marketing, package design, and selling of condoms all spell "man," not "woman." So not only do women mistakenly presume guys will provide them, but women also tend to associate condoms with promiscuity.

Meanwhile, it would benefit everyone’s health if women assumed responsibility for them, since condoms do a pretty good (if imperfect) job of preventing most STDs. Prominently displayed on the company’s crowdsourcing page is this tantalizing tidbit of data: “A psychological research study conducted at UCLA proved that if more women carried condoms, more couples would use them.”

And so Gaines has decided to revolutionize the condom industry by making female-friendly condoms, which are vegan and also sustainably produced and sourced from, not just any, but a Fair Labor rubber plantation in Malaysia. (Natch.) Made of 100 percent natural premium latex, the marketing copy also states the new condoms are free of harsh chemicals or additives. Manufactured onsite, they are “as fresh as possible,” and unlike the status quo manly condoms available at drug stores, they don’t have an “irritating odor due to the fact that their rubber ferments while en route to their overseas manufacturing facility.”

Best of all, Gaines intends them to be carried by beauty supply stores, lingerie shops, and accessory boutiques — in other words, stores with a capital "P" for pink. Medical Daily says whatever gets you to wear one is good for you, good for your health.
