On Wednesday, Guilfoyle compared the dysfunctional VA health care system to what the entire country will be getting under Obamacare.\n\n\"If [Obama] shines a light on that, if we actually have some illumination there, then you're going to see this is really what the rest of you all are going to get: one big fat VA system in the form of Obamacare,\" she alleged.\n\nPolitiFact explained that while the government funds the VA, private health insurance companies continue to provide coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe website rated Guilfoyle's claim \"Pants on Fire,\" saying, \"The VA is owned and operated by the federal government. Its staff are government employees. In contrast, Obamacare builds upon the existing private sector health industry.\"\n\n\n\nMore: Kimberly Guilfoyle", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle recently used the Veteran Affairs scandal to criticize Obamacare, but fact checking website PolitiFact said", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-05-24 12:20:35 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle recently used the Veteran Affairs scandal to criticize Obamacare, but fact checking website PolitiFact said", "title": "Fox News Host's Claim DEMOLISHED By Fact-Checkers", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/23/fox-news-punditfact-obamacare-va-system_n_5379646.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1814052/images/o-KIMBERLY-GUILFOYLE-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle recently used the Veteran Affairs scandal to criticize Obamacare, but fact checking website PolitiFact said", "creator": "kfung", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1814052/images/o-KIMBERLY-GUILFOYLE-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Fox News Host's Claim DEMOLISHED By Fact-Checkers", "site": "@HuffPostMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-05-23 12:20:35 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5379646", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "media", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "kimberly Guilfoyle punditfact,Kimberly Guilfoyle,kimberly Guilfoyle va scandal,kimberly Guilfoyle fact checked,kimberly Guilfoyle obamacare", "article": {"section": "Media", "tag": "kimberly Guilfoyle punditfact,Kimberly Guilfoyle,kimberly Guilfoyle va scandal,kimberly Guilfoyle fact checked,kimberly Guilfoyle obamacare", "published_time": "2014-05-23 12:20:35 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-05-23 12:59:02 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "PolitiFact explained that while the government funds the VA, private health insurance companies continue to provide coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe White House is under fire over allegations that VA hospitals in Phoenix covered up long wait times, during which 40 veterans died, and that similar coverups happened at other VA hospitals across the country.\nFox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle recently used the Veteran Affairs scandal to criticize Obamacare, but fact checking website PolitiFact said she is just wrong about that.\nMore: Kimberly Guilfoyle\nOn Wednesday, Guilfoyle compared the dysfunctional VA health care system to what the entire country will be getting under Obamacare."}
