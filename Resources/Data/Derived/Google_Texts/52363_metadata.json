The body of Gabriella, 7, was found in a creek in a wooded area behind Allen County-Scottsville High School on Saturday evening, according to a news release from Kentucky State Police Post 3 in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Her death is being investigated by KSP detectives as a homicide.

The arrest warrant said she died of manual strangulation and drowning.\n\n\u201cIn a small, rural community like ours, you read about those things happening, but you don\u2019t ever imagine them happening in your hometown,\u201d Allen County Judge-Executive Johnny Hobdy said Friday.\n\nJust before a news conference Friday at the state police post in Bowling Green, Madden was taken in handcuffs to a squad car. A reporter asked if he had anything to say, and Madden replied, \u201cI\u2019m innocent.\u201d\n\nInnocent is a word townspeople might have used once to describe Scottsville, a rural town of about 5,000 near the Tennessee state line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s changed everybody\u2019s mindset,\u201d Chris Carter, who has four children, said of Gabbi\u2019s killing. Carter went away to college but returned to raise his family in the quiet community where he grew up.\n\n\u201cThose days are changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real world has come here.\u201d\n\nAt the Doolins\u2019 white-frame home outside Scottsville, several vehicles were parked in the yard Friday afternoon. A trampoline was set up in the backyard, a basketball goal in the front, and a cat and kittens were on the front step. A woman answering the door declined to comment and asked a reporter to leave.\n\nThe girl\u2019s father had harsh words on his Facebook page posted Friday morning.\n\n\u201cThis animal should not be walking and breathing,\u201d Brian Doolin wrote.\n\nMadden was being held in the Barren County jail on $1 million bond. State police post commander Capt. John Clark would not release any other details about Madden, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe police citation in the case said Madden\u2019s DNA collected during the investigation matched that recovered from the child during the autopsy.\n\nGabbi, as she was called, was reported missing about 7:40 p.m. Saturday by her mother while they were at a football game at Allen County-Scottsville High School in south-central Kentucky. Her body was found about 25 minutes later in a creek in a wooded area behind the school.\n\nThe girl was playing with other children during the game, state police Trooper B.J. Eaton said. The creek where her body was found was just a few hundred yards from the football field.\n\nDoolin\u2019s funeral was held Thursday at Scottsville Baptist Church. Members of the Scottsville community lined the streets holding pink and blue balloons to release as the hearse carrying her body drove by.\n\nHobdy said people in Scottsville were mourning with the family.\n\n\u201cThis whole community shared in the grief and will for a long time to come,\u201d he said.\n\nCarter, whose two boys and two girls range in age from 1 to 16, said he has already changed his approach to parenting and has become more cautious.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t let my kids out anymore without me being right there with them,\u201d he said Friday afternoon while picking up one of his daughters from school.\n\nKathy Saylors, picking up her granddaughter from school Friday afternoon, said she expects more precautions to be taken for children as a result of Gabbi\u2019s death. Her 8-year-old grandson rode the school bus with Gabbi and told Saylors he was scared after Gabbi was killed.\n\n\u201cYou take things for granted that nothing\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now that it\u2019s hit home, it\u2019ll be different. Allen County will never be the same.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1HeqE16", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "No one is certain Scottsville, a peaceful community of 5,000, will ever be the same after slaying of a 7-year-old girl.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "No one is certain Scottsville, a peaceful community of 5,000, will ever be the same after slaying of a 7-year-old girl.", "title": "Town saddened by girl\u2019s slaying seeks justice", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2015/11/21/town-saddened-girls-slaying-seeks-justice/76164928/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No one is certain Scottsville, a peaceful community of 5,000, will ever be the same after slaying of a 7-year-old girl.", "title": "Town saddened by girl\u2019s slaying seeks \u2018Justice for Gabbi\u2019", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/91efaaea3c70eb85efc67e48166c9d5e3f5019f3/c=386-0-1864-1478&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/Louisville/635836980238107305-Gabriella-Doolin-Vigi-init.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Schools", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Schools", "title": "Town saddened by girl\u2019s slaying seeks justice", "author": "Bruce Schreiner", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/crime", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/205832b049512c5d313edb59c4cc12909affcadb/c=571-0-1680-1478/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/Louisville/635836980238107305-Gabriella-Doolin-Vigi-init.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0284edfc7c9d2e7c1a7d79b0675e4492c52485dc/c=386-0-1864-1478/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/Louisville/635836980238107305-Gabriella-Doolin-Vigi-init.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2c3c82ec1a1fd8b9431a9a5bdedfd73a88ad03bf/c=142-0-2108-1478/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/Louisville/635836980238107305-Gabriella-Doolin-Vigi-init.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b6aced3b87f1a2f6c2d9c26bcfa551387fe28ccd/c=0-103-2250-1374&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/Louisville/635836980238107305-Gabriella-Doolin-Vigi-init.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-11-21T10:22:44.630000-05:00", "shorthed": "Town saddened by 7-year-old girl\u2019s slaying", "articleid": 76164928, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04aefcc8ee7a32d292c943aeab78e2a059aa8d2e/c=0-103-2250-1374/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/Louisville/635836980238107305-Gabriella-Doolin-Vigi-init.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf6be6c06253ff0b7043d96d4f721fda4201a9da/c=711-0-1539-1478/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/Louisville/635836980238107305-Gabriella-Doolin-Vigi-init.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Scottsville, Gabriella Doolin,"}, "article_summary": "Gabriella Doolin's brother Alec, father Brian and mother Amy, comfort each other during a vigil for her Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015, in Scottsville, Kentucky.\nKentucky State Police arrested Timothy Madden, 38, of Scottsville, on Friday and charged him with murder, kidnapping, first-degree rape and first-degree sodomy.\nHer 8-year-old grandson rode the school bus with Gabbi and told Saylors he was scared after Gabbi was killed.\nMembers of the Scottsville community lined the streets holding pink and blue balloons to release as the hearse carrying her body drove by.\n(Photo: Miranda Pederson/Daily News via AP)SCOTTSVILLE, Ky. - Pink ribbons and balloons decorate a town saddened by the slaying of a 7-year-old girl, and a sign reads \u201cJustice for Gabbi.\u201d But no one is certain Scottsville, a peaceful community of 5,000, will ever be the same."}
