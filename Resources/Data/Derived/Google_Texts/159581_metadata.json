This season is absolutely above average,\u201d said Dr. Scott Fell, medical director for the emergency department at Venice Regional Bayfront Health.\n\nFell considers this flu season to be the most severe since the 2009 swine flu pandemic.\n\nAt Sarasota Memorial Hospital, doctors on Tuesday were caring for seven patients hospitalized with the flu and about five new cases have been confirmed each day this past week, hospital spokeswoman Kim Savage said.\n\nIn December, emergency room doctors at the region\u2019s largest hospital diagnosed 89 cases and admitted two patients with complications from being infected, Savage said.\n\nThat was a marked increase over the same month in 2013, when the hospital diagnosed 61 patients with cases of flu \u2014 none of which were admitted, Savage said.\n\nAt Doctors Hospital in Sarasota, emergency room staff has diagnosed 125 cases since October, said Cindy Stutler, an infection control preventionist there.\n\nThat is more than were diagnosed during last year\u2019s flu season, but fewer than the 2009 swine flu outbreak, the most recent large-scale flu pandemic, Stutler said.\n\nEmergency departments are strongly suggesting anyone who comes to the hospital with a cough or respiratory problems wear a protective mask and isolate themselves, said Kevin Forsythe, director of the emergency department at Bradenton\u2019s Blake Medical Center, which also has experienced a spike in admissions of patients with flu complications.\n\nAt Venice Regional Bayfront Health, people with potential flu infections are isolated, and anyone who interacts when them is directed to wear a mask, said Bob Hite, its director of marketing.\n\nThe sickest flu patients are typically patients over age 65 and under age 5, because they have the weakest immune systems.\n\nLocally, an 11-year old Bradenton boy, Tony Garcia, died of complications of the flu in early December.\n\nAdult deaths from flu are not reported to public health agencies.\n\nOutbreeaks at nursing homes\n\nPublic health officials in both Sarasota and Manatee counties reported flu activity for the week ended Jan. 10 was \u201cmild,\u201d according to the Florida Department of Health.\n\nThose determinations are based algorithms that consider the number of outbreaks in each county, laboratory data and reports from local public health partners such as county health departments, schools, hospitals and urgent care clinics.\n\nLocally, there have been two separate outbreaks in nursing homes in the last month, the department.\n\nFrom Dec. 21 through Dec. 27, four residents of an undisclosed nursing home tested positive for Influenza A, and nine others reported flulike symptoms. Two of those residents were hospitalized. The department is still investigating the outbreak.\n\nThat same week, a Manatee County nursing home reported 10 people experienced flu-like symptoms, but none tested positive for influenza. As in Sarasota County, health officials have not released the name of the center and the department is still investigating the outbreak.\n\nSo far this year, there have been 62 reported outbreaks in Florida, the Department of Health reported.\n\nNationally, the flu reached the \u201cepidemic\u201d threshold during the week ended Jan. 10, the most recent week tracked.\n\nIn that period of time, 8.5 percent of all deaths reported in the U.S. were the result of pneumonia and influenza, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe flu is considered to be at \u201cepidemic\u201d levels when more than 7 percent of all deaths in the U.S. in a particular week stem from pneumonia and influenza, according to CDC guidelines.\n\nVaccine only 23 percent effective\n\nExperts say this year\u2019s flu season is more severe than in previous years because the most dominant flu strain, H3N2, is not covered by this year\u2019s flu vaccine.\n\nWhen health officials designed the flu vaccine\u2019s formulation in early 2014, they did so based on expected strains that would be most dominant in the 2014-2015 flu season.\n\nBut by the time the infection reached the U.S. this past fall, the dominant H3N2 infection had mutated from the strain the experts predicted, leaving the current vaccine less effective. This kind of mutating, which is also known as \u201cdrifting,\u201d is very common and it is the reason vaccines are reformulated annually.\n\nAs a result of the mutation, the CDC found this year\u2019s vaccine is only 23 percent effective in preventing a flu infection. Normally, the vaccine is about 60 percent effective, CDC officials said.\n\nStill, public health experts continue to urge people to get vaccinated, even at this point in the flu season.\n\n\u201cEven though the flu vaccine isn\u2019t the best match for the flu this year, it is the best tool we have to prevent illness and we still encourage vaccination,\u201d said Michael Drennon, an epidemiologist with the Florida Department of Health in Sarasota County.\n\nEARLIER: A more active than normal flu season is in full swing in Southwest Florida, and area doctors say they are seeing new influenza infections daily.\n\nRegionally, flu infections spiked during the final week of 2014 and in the first weeks of this month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more cases than we\u2019ve seen in previous years and we\u2019re seeing them a little earlier as well.
