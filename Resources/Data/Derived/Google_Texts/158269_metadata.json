transparency report Monday to include orders issued by the nation\u2019s spy court.\n\nDuring the first six months of 2013, the nation\u2019s spy court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, ordered Verizon between zero to 999 times to hand over content for 4,000 to 4,999 customer selectors.\n\nDuring that same time, the court issued the company between zero to 999 \u201cnon-content\u201d orders to hand over information affecting zero to 999 customer selectors.\n\nVerizon notes in its report the government uses the term \u201cselector\u201d to refer to account identifiers, such as phone numbers.\n\nBecause several selectors belong to a single account, the company said, the number of selectors requested is \u201cgenerally greater than\u201d the number of accounts directly affected by the court order.\n\nThe federal government allows companies to report its requests two ways \u2014 in bands of 1,000 requests, or more accurate numbers up to 250 requests, and then in bands of 250 requests.\n\nCompanies are required to delay public reports on national security requests six months.\n\nRandal Milch, Verizon\u2019s general counsel and executive vice president for Public Policy, Law and Security, stated on the company\u2019s public policy blog that Verizon updated the report because the Department of Justice recently began allowing telecommunications and Internet company\u2019s to publish more information after Verizon\u2019s initial report was published.\n\n\u201cWe note that while we now are able to provide more information about national security orders that directly relate to our customers, reporting on other matters, such as any orders we may have received related to the bulk collection of non-content information, remains prohibited,\u201d Milch said.\n\n\u201cWe welcome greater transparency in this area by telecommunications and internet companies, in the absence of broader information by the government collecting the data,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe once again call on all governments to make public the number of demands they make for customer data from such companies, because that is the only way to provide the public with an accurate data set.\u201d\n\nKevin Bankston, policy director of the New America Foundation\u2019s Open Technology Institute, praised Verizon\u2019s report.\n\nThe company, he said via Twitter, was now tied with Google for \u201creporting the most granular (and) clearly-defined categories of requests.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s own transparency report keeps track of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act orders issued by the court dating to January 2009.\n\nAT&T reported its own dataset in February, revealing that during the first six months of 2013 the company received between zero to 999 FISA court orders for content belonging to 35,000 to 35,999 customer accounts.\n\nDuring that same time, zero to 999 FISA court orders not pertaining to content were delivered to the company, affecting zero to 999 customer accounts.\n\nThe reports were published in response to domestic and international public outrage, and shareholder pressure, over revelations about the alleged companies\u2019 roles in Western electronic intelligence operations.\n\nThis article originally appeared at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url":
