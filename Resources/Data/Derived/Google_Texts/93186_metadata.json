A federal judge has ruled the amnesty is likely illegal, and has issued an injunction halting it for now.\n\nSen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican, said the president\u2019s repeated use of prosecutorial discretion is setting a poor precedent for either party.\n\n\u201cIf President Obama continues to try to act in ways that I believe are illegal, what\u2019s to stop a Republican president to not just say we\u2019re going to go after other sorts of things like the health care law,\u201d he said in a brief interview. \u201cSo that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s so important that President Obama be limited in the things he\u2019s trying to do right now.\u201d\n\nDarrell M. West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said the executive branch has \u201cconsiderable leeway\u201d in how it implements Obamacare, so a future Republican administration could use its own discretion to be more lax about enforcing the mandate.\n\n\u201cWe certainly would expect a Republican president to do all he could to undermine and reverse the ACA,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cAll the GOP candidates are on board with that strategy. And if there is a Republican president, there is likely to be a GOP House and Senate as well, so there will be few institutional barriers to these kinds of actions.\u201d\n\nFor now nonexempt filers who flouted the mandate last year must pay the greater of $95 or 1 percent of their household income above the filing threshold, a penalty that rises to $325 or 2 percent of income in 2015.\n\nA new study by H&R Block says tax filers have generally been truthful about their health care status, and that the average tax penalty so far is $172. That may catch some filers off guard, since the $95 penalty had been imprinted in the public psyche.\n\n\u201cI think people didn\u2019t understand how [their penalty] was calculated, and they still don\u2019t,\u201d said Mr. Wittich, who works at a practice in Bloomington, Minnesota, and volunteers at a tax clinic.\n\nOthers understand what\u2019s at stake but choose to ignore it.\n\nMr. Frick, in Kendallville, Indiana, said the client who balked at the $850 payment removed the line from his taxes on his own.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kind of a rebel,\u201d the accountant said.\n\nThe mandate is the most contentious aspect of Mr. Obama\u2019s signature law and served as the focal point for the Supreme Court decision that upheld the 2010 law as constitutional.\n\nObamacare\u2019s framers included the requirement to make sure enough young, healthy people purchased insurance on the new health exchanges, keeping premiums in check when people with pre-existing medical conditions, who no longer can be denied coverage, enrolled.\n\nFilers will not be penalized unless they go without health insurance for more than three straight months.\n\nSeveral exemptions from the mandate were built into the health care law, covering everyone from illegal immigrants and prisoners to those who have religious conscience objections, such as the Amish, and health care sharing ministries members, who take care of each other\u2019s health care costs through direct payments.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services also extended 14 exemptions to people who experience a hardship that could prevent them from complying with the mandate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taxpayers are already telling their accountants they plan to stiff the IRS on the Obamacare tax, saying they figure the chances the agency comes after them for a few hundred bucks are pretty slim, and it makes sense to take the risk.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Taxpayers are already telling their accountants they plan to stiff the IRS on the Obamacare tax, saying they figure the chances the agency comes after them for a few hundred bucks are pretty slim, and it makes sense to take the risk.", "title": "Taxpayers duck Obamacare tax, snubbing IRS", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/25/taxpayers-duck-obamacare-tax-snubbing-irs/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/25/2_252015_ap5521733150838201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/25/2_252015_ap5521733150838201.jpg", "title": "Taxpayers duck Obamacare tax, snubbing IRS", "description": "Taxpayers are already telling their accountants they plan to stiff the IRS on the Obamacare tax, saying they figure the chances the agency comes after them for a few hundred bucks are pretty slim, and", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Christopher Wittich, Scott Frick, Supreme Court"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c6f\"", "article_summary": "A new study by H&R Block says tax filers have generally been truthful about their health care status, and that the average tax penalty so far is $172.\nFilers will not be penalized unless they go without health insurance for more than three straight months.\n\u201cWe certainly would expect a Republican president to do all he could to undermine and reverse the ACA,\u201d he said in an email.\nUnder the 2010 law the IRS cannot pursue criminal penalties or put liens on the property of people who ignore the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate.\nSeveral exemptions from the mandate were built into the health care law, covering everyone from illegal immigrants and prisoners to those who have religious conscience objections, such as the Amish, and health care sharing ministries members, who take care of each other\u2019s health care costs through direct payments."}
