(AP) \u2014 The Pittsburgh Pirates lost 95 games in 2005, the year they drafted outfielder Andrew McCutchen in the first round. Four years later, when McCutchen made his major league debut, they lost 99 games.\n\nMcCutchen has seen the franchise at its worst. As he has matured into one of the top players in the National League, the Pirates also have been on the upswing.\n\nThe Pirates got an NL wild-card berth in each of the past two seasons. This year, McCutchen wants more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to try to win a wild-card game,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to win the division and keep going from there to win a championship.\u201d\n\nSuch a statement would have drawn laughter not too long ago. McCutchen said perceptions about the Pirates have changed.\n\n\u201cPeople look at us a lot differently because they know we\u2019re for real,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been easy to say 2013 was a fluke and we just got lucky. But we showed up in \u201914 and were able to do the same thing. We know we\u2019re for real. And other teams know they just can\u2019t come in (thinking), \u2018All right, we\u2019re going to beat the Pirates.\u2019 We\u2019re not that team anymore.\u201d\n\nThe Pirates have a solid bullpen and a starting rotation topped by left-hander Francisco Liriano and right-hander Gerrit Cole. The infield includes veteran second baseman Neil Walker, who hit a career-best 23 homers, and third baseman Josh Harrison, who had a breakout season in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe have a really good team,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cAnd I believe the outfield will be our anchor.\u201d\n\nMcCutchen is a three-time MVP finalist in center field. He\u2019s flanked by Starling Marte in left and Gregory Polanco in right. All three of them can hit for power and a high average, have above-average speed and are very good defenders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pirates star Andrew McCutchen eyeing another step forward", "title": "Pirates star Andrew McCutchen eyeing another step forward", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pirates star Andrew McCutchen eyeing another step forward", "title": "Pirates star Andrew McCutchen eyeing another step forward", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/28/pirates_star_andrew_mccutchen_eyeing_another_step_forward/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/pirates-spring-baseball.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pirates star Andrew McCutchen eyeing another step forward", "title": "Pirates star Andrew McCutchen eyeing another step forward", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/pirates-spring-baseball.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8506\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsBRADENTON, Fla.
