Land of Lincoln co-op, University of Chicago Medical Center disaffiliate

Chicago-based Land of Lincoln Health, a health insurance co-op, has let go of the University of Chicago Medical Center, according to the Chicago Tribune.

The medical center and its affiliated physicians will be out of network for Land of Lincoln enrollees, effective March 1. Enrollees currently undergoing treatment at the University of Chicago Medical Center might qualify for coverage extension.

Land of Lincoln "is proud to have one of the largest provider networks in the state. As with other carriers, LLH reviews and adjusts its networks based on market changes to ensure our ability to provide members with access to affordable health insurance," according to a company statement.

Land of Lincoln informed University of Chicago Medical Center of its decision at the end of December, according to Ashley Heher, a medical center spokeswoman.

Approximately half of the health insurance co-ops — like Land of Lincoln — formed under the Affordable Care Act have failed, primarily due to financial concerns.
