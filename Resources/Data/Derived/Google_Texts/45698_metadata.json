He can be shy, but he definitely has leadership potential when we work in class,\" said Grant Elwood, sixth-grade mathematics teacher at Erwin. \"The conference will help him realize how much potential leadership abilities he does have, so when he comes back to Erwin, he can be a schoolwide leader.\"\n\nAnthony and his mother, Deb Conklin, are raising funds and seeking sponsors to help pay for the trip, which will cost $1,995 for tuition, plus airfare. So far, they have raised $300.\n\n\"I think it's a unique opportunity for somebody his age to be able to get out there and learn this stuff and have a head start to college,\" Conklin said. \"This is a kid with limitless potential.\"\n\nAnthony and the other students will engage in a variety of experiences, according to Envision's website. They include:\n\nPracticing basic medical techniques, such as checking vital signs and doing triage.\n\nCollecting samples, recording observations, synthesizing data and forming conclusions during an environmental field work experience.\n\nAttending interactive workshops to get hands-on experience in mechanical, electrical, computer and civil engineering.\n\nParticipating in a competitive robotics simulation and putting principles of engineering and design to the test.\n\nVisiting a local science museum to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technology.\n\nWhile engaging in the various experiences, the students will gain skills in time management, critical thinking, conflict resolution, communication and public speaking.\n\n\"Only very high achievers are eligible for the program,\" Conklin said. \"I'm so proud of him. He's so bright. He's funny. He's sarcastic and has a great sense of humor.\"\n\nFor more information or to make a contribution, contact Conklin at debnbetz@yahoo.com.\n\nShelley Widhalm can be reached at 669-5050, ext. 531, or swidhalm@reporter-herald.com.
