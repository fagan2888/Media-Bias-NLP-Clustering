His birthday cake, in the shape of a basketball court, had a Redskins jersey on one end, and his signature shoe on the other.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that the party for Durant was to say thank you (and happy birthday) for not leaving Nike for endorsement opportunities with Under Armour. Durant appears in Nike\u2019s \u201cThe Baddest\u201d ads; and has teamed up with Nike\u2019s N7 (their mission is to inspire and enable two million Native American youth to participate in physical activities).\n\nBut Durant\u2019s \u201cRedskins-themed\u201d birthday party is drawing ire from some Native Americans. The group, Eradicating Offensive Native Masctory (EONM), which has protested at Nike headquarters, issued a press release condemning the company for supporting the Redskins while, at the same time, hosting the N7 Sports Summit, an event that supports the grassroots efforts of Native American families.\n\nRELATED: Nike Responds to EONM Protest\n\nRELATED: NIKE N7 Sport Summit Proves a Catalyst for Native Leaders, Athletes to \u2018Define Tomorrow\u2019\n\n\u201cIt is more important than ever that Nike demonstrate support for Native American families particularly after Nike's insulting racial slur themed birthday party last week for National Basketball Association player Kevin Durant,\u201c EONM said in a news release. \u201cNike Inc. has demonstrated that part of what they want Native American families to do is trade in their identity for inclusion because they want to sell a culturally marketable shoe or other merchandise to Native Americans and yet, still sell \"Chief Wahoo,\" Tomahawk chop, FSU, Chiefs, and Washington team gear for profit as well.\u201d\n\nRELATED: NBA Star Kevin Durant and Nike Team Up to Support Heritage Month\n\nThe group also compares Nike to Dan Snyder\u2019s Original American Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe may be consumers,\u201d EONM said, \u201cbut our culture has been a mass marketing commodity for far too long and is an exploitation that is doing measurable harm to the self worth of Native children. Nike must support Native Americans speaking out about Native Mascotry in sports otherwise it looks like all the good N7 is wanting to do is more about bribery than empowerment. That form of bribery is nothing new and looks much like Dan Snyder's Original Americans Foundation.\u201d\n\nCould this ire be slightly misguided? Well, you be the judge.\n\nDespite harsh criticism toward the sneaker company, Nike and Durant have teamed up to help the Native community in Oklahoma City.\n\n\u201cPlaying in Oklahoma City has connected me to the mission of Nike N7 and the meaningful impact that it has with Native Americans here and across North America,\u201d Durant said in a Nike press release in 2013. \u201cI believe in the power of sport to change lives, and I support helping youth in Native American communities experience the positive benefits of being physically active.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NBA MVP K", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/03/nikes-redskins-themed-birthday-kevin-durant-draws-ire-native-group-157169", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/redskins-thunder_themed_birthday_party_0.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Nike\u2019s \u2018Redskins-Themed\u2019 Birthday for Kevin Durant Draws Ire From Native Group"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-10-03T14:01-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/03/nikes-redskins-themed-birthday-kevin-durant-draws-ire-native-group-157169", "dc": {"title": "Nike\u2019s \u2018Redskins-Themed\u2019 Birthday for Kevin Durant Draws Ire From Native Group"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 3}, "dcterms.title": "Nike\u2019s \u2018Redskins-Themed\u2019 Birthday for Kevin Durant Draws Ire From Native Group"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9871\"", "article_summary": "But Durant\u2019s \u201cRedskins-themed\u201d birthday party is drawing ire from some Native Americans.\nNBA MVP Kevin Durant, who turned 26 on September 29, walked into a Redskins-themed birthday party last week, which was thrown by Nike at their Beaverton, Oregon headquarters.\nDurant appears in Nike\u2019s \u201cThe Baddest\u201d ads; and has teamed up with Nike\u2019s N7 (their mission is to inspire and enable two million Native American youth to participate in physical activities).\nNike must support Native Americans speaking out about Native Mascotry in sports otherwise it looks like all the good N7 is wanting to do is more about bribery than empowerment.\n\u201cI believe in the power of sport to change lives, and I support helping youth in Native American communities experience the positive benefits of being physically active.\u201d"}
