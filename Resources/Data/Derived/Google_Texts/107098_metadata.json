Boehner sat across from each other for an hour on Tuesday in the leather-bound chairs of Mr. Obama\u2019s office and quickly ticked through a remarkably long list of issues.\n\nThey chatted about economic matters like manufacturing, trade promotion authority and flood insurance, according to aides to both men. They discussed the Affordable Care Act and the president\u2019s push for an immigration overhaul. They engaged on efforts to wind down the war in Afghanistan, the process of getting a budget, and the stalled highway funding bill. And don\u2019t forget the California drought and Mr. Obama\u2019s new plan for fighting fires.\n\nAll told, they spent about five and a half minutes on each of the subject areas. (Less, actually, since the above list is not a complete record of the topics covered during the conversation, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said.)\n\nBut while the meeting offered a rare moment for private sharing by the leaders of America\u2019s two dominant political parties, few of their colleagues expect it to lead to any legislative breakthroughs. Aides to both men on Tuesday called it \u201cconstructive\u201d but offered no evidence that Washington gridlock is over.\n\n\u201cThey agreed that there is a lot of work to do the rest of the year, and it is important to work together wherever we can find common ground,\u201d an aide to Mr. Boehner said in an email to reporters after the meeting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Carney maintained that the White House \u201cis looking for a partner in Congress.\u201d But he also noted that Mr. Boehner had in the past said he would never again negotiate with Mr. Obama. Mr. Carney declined to say whether there seemed to be any softening on the no-negotiation stance.\n\nThe president and Mr. Boehner have spent most of the past five years in a series of awkward and often fruitless negotiations. Tuesday\u2019s exchange of views was the first publicly known, in-person, one-on-one since December 2012, and the only such talk since Mr. Obama became president that was not aimed at resolving some sort of looming fiscal crisis.\n\n(That doesn\u2019t count phone calls or the time Mr. Obama invited Mr. Boehner for a round of golf at Andrews Air Force Base in June 2011. Aides said that social outing was constructive, too.)\n\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Obama might have had another, private message to deliver to Mr. Boehner during Tuesday\u2019s surprise meeting, which was revealed late Monday night in the president\u2019s daily schedule. But nothing in their dealings so far suggested a new d\u00e9tente is in the works.\n\nThe two political adversaries met Tuesday even as the leaders in both parties in Washington have largely resigned themselves to the fact that almost no major legislation will break through in the current election year. Republicans are trying to seize control of the Senate this fall, as Democrats scramble to try to defeat as many Republicans in the House as they can.\n\nMr. Obama, for his part, has spent the month since his State of the Union address vowing to circumvent Congress whenever possible \u2014 and has acknowledged publicly that he does not have high hopes for progress on economic issues or an immigration overhaul.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a Congress that prefers to say no rather than yes right now,\u201d Mr. Obama told Democratic governors last week. \u201cThey don\u2019t have an affirmative agenda. Their main strategy is to just try to do nothing and see if they can \u2014 falsely \u2014 give people a sense that somehow the policies that we\u2019re trying to pursue aren\u2019t working for them.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Boehner has done little to suggest his House would advance any of the president\u2019s agenda in the months leading up to the midterm elections, telling his members this month that he would not pursue the immigration legislation that Mr. Obama supports, but that angered conservative Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublicans have vowed to continue their push to roll back or change the Affordable Care Act, and in a message posted on Twitter, even as the speaker was arriving at the White House, Mr. Boehner took a political jab at the president\u2019s top domestic policy.\n\n\u201c#ObamaCare may increase premiums for 11 million workers, report says,\u201d the message from the @SpeakerBoehner Twitter account read.\n\nAfter Mr. Boehner finished the meeting in the White House, he slipped out without talking with reporters and returned to the Capitol. Moments later, he took to the floor \u2014 but not to wax poetic about the \u201cconstructive\u201d meeting he had just had.\n\nInstead, he used a new \u2014 and disputed \u2014 report on the costs of insurance premiums to attack the president\u2019s health care law. \u201cAnother sucker punch to our economy,\u201d he called it. \u201cAnother broken promise to hardworking Americans.\u201d\n\nThe next Oval Office meeting might not come for another year.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140225144603, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama and Speaker John A.
