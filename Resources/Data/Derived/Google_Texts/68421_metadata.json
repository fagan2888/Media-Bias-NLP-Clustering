The study authors anticipate that their findings could change the way that cancer prevention is funded.\n\nAccording to the study, which was published in the Science journal on Friday, the majority of cancers can be attributed to random gene mutations that occur when stem cells divide. That helps explain why certain tissues are more likely to give rise to human cancers.\n\nFor instance, researchers found that the pancreas, the brain, and the small intestine tend to develop cancerous cells as a result of cell division. While all cancers stem from a combination of environmental and genetic factors, developing cancer in certain tissues can be mostly chalked up to bad luck \u2014 a mutation that arises from the normal process of stem cell replication.\n\nAlthough scientists were already well aware of that dynamic, the latest results illustrate just how common this type of random mutation is. Among the 31 types of cancers that the researchers examined, 22 were identified as \u201cbad luck\u201d cancers.\n\nConsidering that evidence, our cancer prevention efforts may need to shift toward an attempt to screen for the mutations in the tissues that are particularly prone to this phenomenon.\n\n\u201cIf two-thirds of cancer incidence across tissues is explained by random DNA mutations that occur when stem cells divide, then changing our lifestyle and habits will be a huge help in preventing certain cancers, but this may not be as effective for a variety of others,\u201d Cristian Tomasetti, an assistant professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins and one of the co-authors of the study, told BBC News. \u201cWe should focus more resources on finding ways to detect such cancers at early, curable stages.\u201d\n\nAs Tomasetti alludes to, the findings don\u2019t mean that doctors should stop encouraging lifestyle changes that can help lower Americans\u2019 risk of developing cancer. Certainly, some cancers are greatly influenced by individual choices. Lung cancer and skin cancer, for instance, have strong correlations to smoking and spending time in the sun. Altogether, the study authors identified nine types of cancer that likely arise mostly due to genetics, pollution, and personal habits.\n\nUltimately, with more information about what exactly causes cancerous cells, scientists and doctors may be better equipped to figure out how to stop their spread.\n\n\u201cAll cancers are caused by a combination of bad luck, the environment, and heredity, and we\u2019ve created a model that may help quantify how much of these three factors contribute to cancer development,\u201d Bert Vogelstein, the study\u2019s second co-author, said in a statement.\n\nCancer is the second leading cause of death for Americans, killing about 185 people for every 100,000. There\u2019s recently been some good news in this area, however. Nationally, cancer mortality rates have been falling over the past two decades; this week, the American Cancer Society reported that the number of deaths from cancer has dropped 22 percent since 1991. Death rates from breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer have seen particularly significant declines.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Two thirds of cancers are largely caused by random gene mutations, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Two thirds of cancers are largely caused by random gene mutations, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.", "title": "Scientists Find That Most Types Of Cancer Are Caused By \u2018Bad Luck\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/01/02/3607595/study-cancer-bad-luck/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_131104340.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two thirds of cancers are largely caused by random gene mutations, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_131104340-321x214.jpg", "title": "Scientists Find That Most Types Of Cancer Are Caused By \u2018Bad Luck\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_131104340.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_131104340.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-02T13:31:38+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Among the 31 types of cancers that the researchers examined, 22 were identified as \u201cbad luck\u201d cancers.\nDeath rates from breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer have seen particularly significant declines.\nHealth Scientists Find That Most Types Of Cancer Are Caused By \u2018Bad Luck\u2019 CREDIT: ShutterstockAbout two thirds of cancers in adults largely stem from what amounts to bad luck, rather than specific lifestyle choices, according to a new study conducted by Johns Hopkins researchers.\nUltimately, with more information about what exactly causes cancerous cells, scientists and doctors may be better equipped to figure out how to stop their spread.\nAltogether, the study authors identified nine types of cancer that likely arise mostly due to genetics, pollution, and personal habits."}
