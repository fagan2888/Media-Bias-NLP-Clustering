Carl Levin Carl LevinCarl, Sander Levin rebuke Sanders for tax comments on Panama trade deal Supreme Court: Eye on the prize Congress got it wrong on unjustified corporate tax loopholes MORE (D-Mich.). \u201cOne way or another, we\u2019ve got to stop this activity.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe two-year investigation focused on three major financial firms that have made significant investments in commodities: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley.\n\n\n\nFor example, in 2012 Goldman owned 1.5 million metric tons of aluminum, equal to roughly one-quarter of the nation\u2019s annual usage of the metal. And Levin focused on Goldman, accusing the firm of orchestrating a \u201cmerry-go-round\u201d system aimed at lengthening the lines for providing aluminum, which in turn lead to higher premiums for the metal \u2014 costs that could eventually be passed on to consumers.\n\n\n\nThe report claims that after purchasing aluminum warehouses in Detroit, Goldman approved contracts with warehouse clients where they paid them to load and move metal from one warehouse to another. Those repeated movements slowed down clients attempting to remove their aluminum, slowing its delivery and ultimately driving up the premium for the metal, the report claimed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey paid people to lengthen the queue,\u201d Levin said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that they desired.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a response to the report, Goldman said that most of the aluminum stored in the facility was not blocked by lengthened lines, and argued that metal movements were independent decisions of clients.\n\n\n\nThe 396-page report also delves into a host of other investments by financial firms, such as Goldman\u2019s acquisition of a Colombian coalmine that was briefly shuttered due to protests, Morgan Stanley\u2019s investments in jet fuel, and JPMorgan\u2019s buying spree of power plants.\n\n\n\nIn July 2013, JPMorgan agreed to pay $410 million to settle federal charges it manipulated energy prices in California and the Midwest. The bank said Wednesday that it had already sold off large parts of its physical commodities business, and going forward will focus primarily on financial derivatives when it comes to commodity investments.\n\n\n\nBeyond increased costs, the report also argues that heavy investments in physical commodities expose banks \u2014 and potentially taxpayers \u2014 to unprecedented risks.\n\n\n\nA disaster like a nuclear meltdown or mine collapse at a facility owned by a bank could put the firm on the hook for major liability outside what financial firms typically navigate, the report argued. And if a bank could be endangered by a significant liability cost, the financial system and broader economy could be at risk too.\n\n\n\n\u201cImagine if BP had been a bank, the liability resulting from the oil spill could have led to its failure and another round of taxpayer bailouts,\u201d said Sen.

Firms could receive inside information about what is happening in those markets thanks to those investments, or even be able to sway how markets move by changing conditions at those physical facilities.\n\n\n\nThe report noted that after Goldman acquired the uranium company Nufcor, it increased trading activity in the company tenfold. Goldman said Wednesday it was in the process of whittling down the company\u2019s operations to minimal levels.\n\n\n\nThe latest 396-page report marks the last in a long line of Wall Street dissections by Levin, who is retiring at the end of the year. Levin has used his post at the top of the investigatory panel to repeatedly probe into financial activities, and has made a habit out of grilling top financial executives for hours about what he views as problematic behavior.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday and Friday, Levin will do so yet again, hearing from key executives from the banks and their commodity subsidiaries about those firms\u2019 commodities activity, as well as top regulators overseeing the sector.\n\n\n\nLevin\u2019s report is the latest probe into the financial sector\u2019s increased interest in actually buying and selling physical commodities, but the issue has been on the radar of Washington policymakers for some time.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced in January that it was considering imposing tougher limits on banks\u2019 participation in physical commodities, and the topic has been the subject of multiple congressional hearings.\n\n\n\nLevin stopped short of specifically saying how regulators should curb physical commodity investments, but said regulators or future Congresses should seriously consider placing stricter limits on the activity.\n\n\n\nBanks do face limits on the amount of physical commodities they can invest in, but the report claimed the Fed was relying on an \u201cuncoordinated, incoherent patchwork\u201d of limits on that activity, allowing banks to expand their investments, and also lacked data key to monitoring and policing that type of activity.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
