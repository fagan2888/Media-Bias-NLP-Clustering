She can win, and she will win if she gets the support she needs.\u201d The events in Los Angeles, Katzenberg says, \u201cwill be a chance to help her seize the momentum and get her campaign off to an early and strong start.\u201d\n\nGrimes, who announced her campaign in July, will face an early test of her candidacy when she files her first fundraising report after the end of the quarter on Sept. 30. McConnell had nearly $10 million in the bank at the end of the last reporting period \u2013 a huge head start over any potential challenger who would have to start from zero.\n\n( PHOTOS: 10 star-studded fundraisers)\n\nThe Democrat, currently Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state, has kept a light public schedule since kicking off her Senate bid and has focused on vacuuming up donations from party donors eager to unseat the Senate\u2019s top Republican.\n\nKatzenberg\u2019s involvement in the race is a notable sign of national Democratic support for Grimes \u2013 or, perhaps more precisely, the ferocity of Democratic opposition to McConnell. The filmmaker donated millions to the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action in 2012 and hosted a fundraiser for the president\u2019s reelection in May of 2012.\n\nIn his email, Katzenberg acknowledges that recipients \u201cmay not yet know the name Alison Lundergan Grimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m certain you know the name Mitch McConnell.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: Mitch McConnell\u2019s career)\n\nKatzenberg did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on his support for Grimes. A Grimes campaign aide said only that \u201cpeople across the country share the same feeling as the people of Kentucky\u201d when it comes to McConnell.\n\nMcConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore said it\u2019s \u201cno surprise that Obama\u2019s liberal Hollywood friends are supporting Alison Lundergan Grimes\u2019s campaign against Mitch McConnell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re obviously not concerned about Kentucky\u2019s representation, but they know that a Grimes victory would mean eliminating the last obstacle to enacting the full Obama agenda, implementing Obamacare, and officially taking out Kentucky\u2019s coal industry,\u201d Moore said.\n\nJustin Barasky, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, fired back that McConnell is \u201cthe meanest, most negative campaigner in all of Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for Mitch McConnell, he faces two strong challengers, and the Kentucky Senate race will now focus entirely on how after three decades in Washington Mitch McConnell is the number one reason for partisan political dysfunction and gridlock,\u201d Barasky said, alluding to the GOP primary challenge McConnell faces from Louisville investment manager Matt Bevin.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The DreamWorks executive and prominent political donor urges his allies to turn out to support Grimes.", "title": "Katzenberg raising money for Grimes", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/jeffrey-katzenberg-alison-lundergan-grimes-96204.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/09/03/katzenberg_lundergan_grimes_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Jeffrey Katzenberg (1),Elections (1344),Alison Lundergan Grimes (19),2014 Elections (336),Fundraising (850)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The DreamWorks executive and prominent political donor urges his allies to turn out to support Grimes.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded47\"", "article_summary": "| REUTERS Katzenberg raising money for GrimesKentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes will tap the Hollywood money well later this month with the help of entertainment industry power broker Jeffrey Katzenberg, according to an email invitation obtained by POLITICO.\nIn a message to undisclosed recipients, Katzenberg, the DreamWorks executive and prominent Democratic political donor, urged his allies to turn out to support Grimes at events in Los Angeles on Sept. 26.\nA Grimes campaign aide said only that \u201cpeople across the country share the same feeling as the people of Kentucky\u201d when it comes to McConnell.\nKatzenberg\u2019s involvement in the race is a notable sign of national Democratic support for Grimes \u2013 or, perhaps more precisely, the ferocity of Democratic opposition to McConnell.\n\u201cThere is no more important election being held next year in this country,\u201d Katzenberg writes in the email."}
