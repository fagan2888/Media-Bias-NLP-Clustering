Viewers then saw a blank screen with the message: \u201cThe license of Geo News has been suspended by PEMRA, therefore the broadcast has been terminated.\u201d\n\nThe move is the latest challenge for the media company after an assassination attempt against its top news anchor, Hamid Mir, on April 19. Mir survived six gunshot wounds to the stomach and legs during the attack in Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s largest city.\n\nThat attack touched off a high-profile row between Geo and the military\u2019s powerful intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence.\n\nThe station angered the military by repeatedly airing accusations by Mir\u2019s brother that the ISI was behind the attack and showing a photo of the spy chief. Geo later apologized.\n\nThe ministry of defense petitioned the regulatory agency to pull Geo\u2019s license. The regulator has not made the complaint public but a copy was posted on the website of the Committee to Protect Journalists.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pakistan pulls top news station off air amid spat", "author": "Rebecca Santana and Munir Ahmed", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pakistan pulls top news station off air amid spat", "title": "Pakistan pulls top news station off air amid spat", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/06/pakistan_pulls_top_news_station_off_air_amid_spat/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/pakistan.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pakistan pulls top news station off air amid spat", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/pakistan.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Pakistan pulls top news station off air amid spat", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Pakistan pulls top news station off air amid spat", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea6e\"", "article_summary": "The decision was announced by Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, which suspended Geo News for 15 days and imposed a fine of 10 million Pakistani rupees \u2014 roughly $100,000.\nThe ministry of defense petitioned the regulatory agency to pull Geo\u2019s license.\nThat attack touched off a high-profile row between Geo and the military\u2019s powerful intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 Pakistan\u2019s media regulators pulled the nation\u2019s leading news channel off the air on Friday, the latest development in a spat between the broadcaster and the military\u2019s powerful spy agency that has focused attention on media freedoms in the country.\nThe station angered the military by repeatedly airing accusations by Mir\u2019s brother that the ISI was behind the attack and showing a photo of the spy chief."}
