Absolutely.\"\n\nWhen Wallace tried to press Carson on whether he would definitely announce that he was running for president in the spring, the former neurosurgeon became a little more ambiguous.\n\n\"Well, I'm a very careful person,\" Carson said, \"so I want to be careful to make sure that I have all of the infrastructure in place if I make such an announcement to tell you all the questions you're going to be asking in terms of personnel and rationale.\n\n\"So we're putting all of that together, yes,\" Carson added.\n\nCarson apologized last month after it was revealed that he plagarized portions of his book, and said that he was working with editors to rectify the situation. He has also stood by his comparisons of the United States to Nazi Germany and the Affordable Care Act to slavery.\n\nAccording to HuffPost Pollster, which tracks publicly available opinion polls, Carson is currently near the top of the pack of potential GOP presidential candidates.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Potential 2016 Presidential Contenders Potential 2016 Presidential Contenders\n\n1 of 33 Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) Share this slide:\n\nSpencer Platt via Getty Images", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Ben Carson said on Sunday that he would make a formal announcement by May about a possible 2016 presidential run.\n\nAsked by \"Fox News Sunday\" host ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-02-09 12:18:30 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson said on Sunday that he would make a formal announcement by May about a possible 2016 presidential run.\n\nAsked by \"Fox News Sunday\" host ...", "title": "Ben Carson Lays Out Timeline For Deciding On A 2016 Presidential Run", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/08/ben-carson-2016_n_6639952.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2586848/images/o-BEN-CARSON-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Ben Carson said on Sunday that he would make a formal announcement by May about a possible 2016 presidential run.\n\nAsked by \"Fox News Sunday\" host ...", "creator": "srl", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2586848/images/o-BEN-CARSON-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Ben Carson Lays Out Timeline For Deciding On A 2016 Presidential Run", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-08 12:18:30 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6639952", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "ben carson 2016,ben Carson,2016 presidential campaign,ben carson presidential announcement,ben carson presidential run,2016 gop primary,HuffPolitics blog,video,elections-2016", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "ben carson 2016,ben Carson,2016 presidential campaign,ben carson presidential announcement,ben carson presidential run,2016 gop primary,HuffPolitics blog,video,elections-2016", "published_time": "2015-02-08 12:18:30 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-02-09 00:59:02 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34dc\"", "article_summary": "Also on HuffPost: Potential 2016 Presidential Contenders Potential 2016 Presidential Contenders1 of 33 Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) Share this slide:Spencer Platt via Getty Images\nDr. Ben Carson said on Sunday that he would make a formal announcement by May about a possible 2016 presidential run.\n\"So we're putting all of that together, yes,\" Carson added.\nAccording to HuffPost Pollster, which tracks publicly available opinion polls, Carson is currently near the top of the pack of potential GOP presidential candidates.\nHe has also stood by his comparisons of the United States to Nazi Germany and the Affordable Care Act to slavery."}
