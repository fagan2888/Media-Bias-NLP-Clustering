But, he said, those studies, which focused largely on single procedures or disciplines, were too narrow in scope to paint an accurate picture.\n\nStudies indicate meaningful reduction of racial disparities means looking beyond traditional healthcare interventions, instead targeting community factors such as education, housing and employment.
