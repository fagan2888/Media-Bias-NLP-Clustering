From a cardboard box, McGovern pulls out several plastic bags containing ancient pottery shards from China. It was from these that he identified the world\u2019s oldest known fermented beverage, dating to about 7000 B.C.\u2014a few centuries after humans began transitioning from hunter-gatherers to farmers. From another box, he pulls out shards and residues collected from four Scandinavian settlements, dating to between 1200 B.C. and 200 A.D. All of them contained traces of an essentially identical beverage, suggesting a drink\u2014McGovern dubbed it \u201cNordic grog\u201d\u2014that was popular across Scandinavia for more than a millennium.\n\nDr. Pat McGovern, a biomolecular archeologist at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, in Philadelphia, is standing before some large and inscrutable scientific equipment on the museum\u2019s fifth floor as he explains his process to me. \u201cWe always start with infrared spectrometry,\u201d he says. \u201cThat gives us an idea of what organic materials are preserved.\u201d From there, it\u2019s on to tandem liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, sometimes coupled with ion cyclotron resonance, and solid-phase micro-extraction gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry.\n\nDetails will appear in a forthcoming issue of the Danish Journal of Archaeology. But if your curiosity is more immediate and tends toward the gustatory, head to a nearby wine-and-beer store and request a bottle of the most recent Ancient Ale from Dogfish Head. The Delaware-based brewery launched its Ancient Ale Series in 1997, and in 1999 collaborated with McGovern to make Midas Touch, a brew that was inspired by the residue found on pottery fragments in a 2,700-year-old tomb in Turkey. Dogfish Head has since re-created six other defunct potables with McGovern, based on archeological finds in China, Honduras, Peru, Egypt, Italy, and now Scandinavia. Its re-creation of Nordic grog, Kvasir, is named after a mythical Norse hero who was born out of saliva and later killed by dwarfs. Dogfish Head made about 2,300 cases, available this winter in 27 states.\n\nDogfish Head\u2019s Ancient Ales may vary in geography and taste, but they all have one thing in common: \u201cInvariably, every one of these ancient beverages that we\u2019ve brought back to life had at least two sources of sugar,\u201d says the company\u2019s founder and president, Sam Calagione, \u201cbe they honey or grapes or fruits or grains.\u201d\n\nOne might wonder why early societies would use such a mash-up of flavors. But the more vexing question is: Why did they stop? Why did complex, deeply layered beverages get siloed into restrictive categories\u2014mead from honey, wine from grapes, beer from grain\u2014which then became increasingly homogenized over time? How did we get from Nordic grog to Bud Light?\n\nCalagione heaps some of the blame on restrictions imposed by Bavarian rulers in 1516, which would later become known as the beer-purity law. \u201cThey mandated that beer could only be made with water, barley, and hops,\u201d he says. \u201cHumans had been brewing these exotic hybrid beers for 10,000 years, yet now roughly 99 percent of the beer commercially made around the world references a 500-year-old tradition. It\u2019s a war the Germans have pretty much won.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Penn\u2019s McGovern sees a natural progression toward specialization, as beer makers started producing on a larger scale. \u201cThey get a successful product using a limited range of ingredients that people like and understand,\u201d he says, \u201cand then they flood the market with it.\u201d\n\nKvasir is not what anyone would consider a streamlined product. It\u2019s a hybrid of beer, fruit wine, and mead, flavored with (among other ingredients) yarrow, lingonberries, cranberries, bog myrtle, and birch syrup. \u201cThe ingredient I\u2019m most excited about is the lingonberries,\u201d Calagione says. I had thought Kvasir would have a boggy, primeval flavor, but instead it tasted quite modern: bright and tart, with an extremely dry finish.\n\nCalagione won\u2019t discuss Dogfish Head\u2019s next Ancient Ale, other than to say, \u201cIt won\u2019t even be defined as a beer. It\u2019s even more experimental.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s safe to say it will be old.
