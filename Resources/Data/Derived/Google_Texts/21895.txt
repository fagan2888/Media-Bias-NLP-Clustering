All lanes of westbound I-10 at Cortaro are open again, allowing traffic to pass following two earlier collisions on the overpass, and clearing away much of the earlier traffic backup, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation.

Two separate crashes, about a quarter-mile from each other on the I-10 overpass over North Cortaro Road, caused westbound I-10 to close at exit 246, the Cortaro exit. Of eight people involved, only one had to be transported to the hospital, and that person has non-life-threatening injuries, according to officials.

At the Cortaro off ramp, for a short time traffic was being routed off the freeway, down the frontage road, and back on again via the Cortaro on ramp, according to Capt. Brian Keeley, spokesman for the Northwest Fire District.

The first crash involved three cars and five people, he said. Of those, three were not injured, one was treated at the scene but declined transport, and one was transported with non-life-threatening injuries.

The second crash, which according to the Department of Public Safety information office happened in the backup from the first crash, also involved three vehicles and included a rolled vehicle and three people, none of whom were injured, according to Keeley.

The two crashes happened around 10 a.m., according to DPS.
