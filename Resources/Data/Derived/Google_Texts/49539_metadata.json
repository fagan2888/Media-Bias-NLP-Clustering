Terry McAuliffe\u2019s recess appointment. McAuliffe\u2019s appointment of Supreme Court Justice Jane Marum Roush, a former Fairfax Circuit Court judge, has lapsed.\n\nSen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Richmond, backed Cuccinelli: \u201cAs a former Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Mr. Cuccinelli is eminently qualified for this position. For that same reason, I will vote for him on the floor of the senate when his nomination comes before the full body,\u201d Sturtevant said in a statement.\n\nSturtevant was the one key vote against Alston\u2019s nomination. He was elected to the Senate in 2015, by a 1,088-vote win over his Democratic opponent Daniel Gecker.\n\nCuccinelli said he will \u201cprayerfully review\u201d the nomination.\n\n\u201cI have been approached to consider an appointment to the Virginia Supreme Court,\" he wrote. \"I am humbled and honored to be considered for such a position, but it is not something that my wife and I have previously contemplated. Together, we will prayerfully review this possibility in light of our family\u2019s needs and whether or not this is the best way for us to contribute to making Virginia a better place to live going forward.\u201d\n\nThe resolution is expected to go to the full Senate and House of Delegates for a vote Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "37.537220;-77.433312", "description": "The resolution is expected to go to the full Senate and House of Delegates for a vote Wednesday.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "The resolution is expected to go to the full Senate and House of Delegates for a vote Wednesday.", "title": "Protestors demand vote against Cuccinelli\u2019s state Supreme Court nomination", "url": "http://wtvr.com/2016/03/09/ken-cuccinelli-virginia-supreme-court-nomination/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/protest2.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@cbs6", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 572089813, "iphone": 572089813}}, "image": {"src": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/protest2.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cbs6"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=572089813", "fb": {"pages": 6860957425}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e5f8555355860d96f4528b85609455b?s=16", "application-name": "WTVR.com", "ICBM": "37.537220, -77.433312", "keywords": "politics, controversy, ken cuccinelli, politics elections and voting", "google-site-verification": "xp-vKfdwBt7bllcG4eSrgb2mL-O45aD7dIeyF4EmMF8", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr", "published_time": "2016-03-09T17:49:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-09T17:49:31+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "McAuliffe\u2019s appointment of Supreme Court Justice Jane Marum Roush, a former Fairfax Circuit Court judge, has lapsed.\n\u201cI have been approached to consider an appointment to the Virginia Supreme Court,\" he wrote.\n\"We just don't need someone on the supreme court who has had extreme views that are out of the mainstream.\u201dCuccinelli has been nominated to a seat currently filled by Gov.\nProgress VA Executive Director Anna Scholl lead the chants calling for legislators to vote against the Cuccinelli nomination.\nThe self-professed \u201cangry\u201d protestors held signs that read \u201c#KeepKenOut\u201d and chanted \u201cHey hey, ho ho, Ken Cuccinelli has got to go,\u201d Wednesday morning."}
