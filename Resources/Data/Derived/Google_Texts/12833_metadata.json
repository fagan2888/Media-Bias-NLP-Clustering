I hope they don\u2019t go down there and plunder the island and establish Chick-fil-A\u2019s everywhere,\u201d she tells the Daily News.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s very exciting,\u201d adds Bernhard. \u201cCuba has a thriving and vibrant people and they deserve to have proper food and medicine. And I\u2019ve wanted to go there for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe keen-eyed, sharp-tongued comedian\u2019s immediate travel plans involve trekking from Chelsea, where she lives with longtime girlfriend Sara Switzer and 16-year-old daughter Cecily, to Joe\u2019s Pub, where \u201cSandra Bernhard is #blessed,\u201d runs from Dec. 26-31.\n\nWith 238,000 Twitter followers, Bernhard is a social-media maven. She concedes that the title of the show is laced with \u201cmore than a bit of irony,\u201d aimed at Twitwits who \u201cthrow around these fake terms of thankfulness like they\u2019re flipping flapjacks. There\u2019s no true feeling,\u201d she says. Bernhard loves exposing phonies, especially when they\u2019re celebs.\n\nStill, Bernhard, 59, means it when she says she\u2019s blessed. \u201cI have a great life and continue to do what I love doing \u2014 turning culture on its ear and lifting up different carpets and showing the dirt,\u201d she tells Daily News theater critic Joe Dziemianowicz. \u201cWe all have things we\u2019ve swept under the rug.\u201d\n\n\"Devious Maids\" star Roselyn Sanchez mixes naughty with nice in a Pamella Roland suit at the People Magazine Awards in Beverly Hills.

(Han Myung-Gu/WireImage)\n\nThe \u201c#blessed\u201d work is a signature mashup of personal observations, barbed zingers and songs performed in Bernhard\u2019s distinct style. \u201cMy work is very personal and cathartic. I write material throughout the year,\u201d she says, adding that she folds in topical tidbits and breaking news.\n\nOne is Sony\u2019s shelving of the James Franco-Seth Rogen comedy \u201cThe Interview.\u201d \u201cThere might be references to that, but they\u2019d be through the back door,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to make myself a part of the situation.\u201d She admits she plays fast and loose with reality, noting, \u201cYou never know what\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nBeyond North Korea, the region of South Kardashian \u2014 as in Kim K\u2019s celebrated caboose \u2014 is in Bernhard\u2019s crosshairs. \u201cMy take on that is at midterm elections no one voted,\u201d she says. But when it came to Kim K\u2019s \u201cbare ass, people voted and blew up the Internet.\u201d Ice bucket challenges, royal visits and nutty Manhattan real estate are expected talking points. \u201cNever a dull moment is all I can say,\u201d she deadpans.\n\nBernhard has been described as being more mellow and less corrosive than before. \u201cI never wanted to be hurtful, to take the piss out of people. As you evolve as a person you see things from a different angle. At 22 you don\u2019t see the full picture. At 50 and when you have a child, of course, you change \u2014 and have more heft intellectually, spiritually and emotionally.\u201d\n\nModel Nykhor Paul will help start the ball drop in Times Square on New Year\u2019s Eve. (Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images for Fashion FilmFes)\n\nSUDAN HAS PARTY OF THE YEAR\n\nModel Nykhor Paul will help start the ball drop in Times Square on New Year\u2019s Eve. But from the way the South Sudanese model and refugee describes it, the famous party sounds quite restrained compared to her New Years growing up.\n\n\u201cIn South Sudan or in Ethiopia, in the refugee camp where we grew up, (New Year\u2019s Eve is) a huge deal,\u201d she told Confidenti@l. \u201cEspecially because we only celebrate Christmas, New Year\u2019s and Easter. We don\u2019t celebrate birthdays or anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn South Sudan we\u2019d have a huge celebration where we would kill massive animals and have a huge feast,\u201d she said. What have you got to top that, Ryan Seacrest?\n\nRegardless, the model, who moved to the US in 1998 and has walked the runway for Vivienne Westwood and Rick Owens, says her first Times Square experience will be a night to remember. \u201cI lived in Nebraska, so I\u2019ve watched it on TV,\u201d said Paul, who will press the button that starts the ball moving along with fellow representatives from the International Rescue Committee. She adds, \u201cIt\u2019s like Cinderella going to the ball.\u201d\n\nPaul added that her wish for 2015 is that, \u201cWith the work that they do at IRC, I hope that we all come together to lend more help to the South Sudanese.\u201d\n\nWe knew Emily Mortimer would be the kind of girl you want at a party. (Mike Marsland/WireImage)\n\nMORTIMER\u2019S GREAT WRAP SESSION\n\nWe knew Emily Mortimer would be the kind of girl you want at a party. A spy at the wrap party at the Leonora for her HBO show, \u201cDoll & Em,\u201d tells Confidenti@l that not only did the English beauty \u201chand out gifts that she personally crafted with her co-star Dolly Wells to her adoring crew,\u201d but she \u201cdanced up a storm to Whitney Houston\u2019s \u2018I Wanna Dance With Somebody\u2019 with her gal pals.\u201d\n\nPORN STAR GETS GRILLED\n\nPorn star Christy Mack was spotted entering the Central Park South offices of periodontist Dr. Nicholas Toscano this week with an HBO film crew it tow. Toscano offered to repair Mack\u2019s grill gratis, after seeing the damage allegedly inflicted on her by Ultimate Fighter boyfriend Jonathan \u201cWar Machine\u201d Koppenhaver, and estimated the fixes will take six months. He\u2019s also worked with Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush.\n\nMiri Ben-Ari was honored at the America-Israel Cultural Foundation\u2019s 75th anniversary gala.

Ben-Ari told the crowd: \u201cIt was very powerful to come full circle with the foundation that once helped me pay for my violin lessons and also gave me my first violin at the recommendation of legendary violinist Isaac Stern.\u201d Ben Ari called the entire night a \u201cdream come true.\u201d\n\nCiara sported a risqu\u00e9 look on the streets of Los Angeles.

(REX USA/REX USA)\n\nDE NIRO: HIL OF A ROLE\n\nGuess we know which way Robert De Niro\u2019s leaning for the 2016 primaries. At the Ripple of Hope event, where the \u201cGood Fellas\u201d star was being honored for human rights work, De Niro got the lefty crowd going when he gave a nod to Hillary Clinton\u2019s much-predicted presidential run.\n\n\u201cWhen we agree that it\u2019s a human right to have reasonable and responsible medical care, we won\u2019t fight about Obamacare, or whatever it will be called,\u201d he said from the stage, before pausing and adding, \u201cHillarycare?\u201d\n\nCIARA IS HAIR APPARENT\n\nIt looks like Vogue hired an entire beautification army just to design the proper placement of Ciara\u2019s hair for an upcoming shoot. That\u2019s understandable, since there\u2019s so much of it. The singer sported a risqu\u00e9 look on the streets of Los Angeles, but it was hard to tell if she\u2019s gotten rid of the \u201cN\u201d tattoo on her ring finger, which represented ex-fianc\u00e9 Future\u2019s real name.\n\nA TOWERING FIGURE\n\nIf anyone knows how to create a fan frenzy, it\u2019s Rihanna. Wearing a Louis Vuitton jumpsuit, the pop star personally chose a few dozen of her biggest fans for a video alongside her in Paris, next to the Eiffel Tower. A French gossip site noted that the shoot was related to the \u201cR8 Experience,\u201d which could be connected to her upcoming album, rumored to be called \u201cR8.\u201d\n\nSimon Cowell and Lauren Silverman enjoying their holiday in Barbados.

Now the 10-month-old can add a Barbados stamp to his passport. Simon Cowell and fianc\u00e9e Lauren Silverman jetted off to the Caribbean island as a family, and enjoyed jet-skiing around the crystal-blue water. Silverman was also seen showing off her impressive post-pregnancy figure in a tiny white bikini.\n\nSimon Cowell's girlfriend Lauren Silverman and their baby son Eric while on holiday in Barbados.
