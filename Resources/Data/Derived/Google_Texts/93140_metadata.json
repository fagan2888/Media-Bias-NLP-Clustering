The American Council of Life Insurers and other witnesses testified that the FSOC pays too much attention to the international Financial Stability Board in determining whether insurance companies should be designated as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI).\n\nACLI CEO Dirk Kempthorne testified that insurers are being treated differently than other non-banks by FSOC and FSB.\n\n\u201cWhile FSB and FSOC have designated three U.S. insurers for heightened supervision and regulation, they are pursuing an \u2018activities-based\u2019 approach for asset managers rather than the imposition of heightened regulation on individual companies merely because of size,\u201d Kempthorne said.\n\nThe IMF report sounded an alarm on the fragmentation of the U.S. insurance regulatory system, saying a national insurance regulator \u201cis needed to deliver enhancements and greater regulatory and supervisory consistency.\u201d\n\nU.S. financial institutions constitute 22 percent of world global assets, the report said, and the insurance industry is important because the U.S. insurance market is the largest in the world with premium volume accounting for a third of the global market.\n\nSpecifically, the IMF report said, some life insurers have increased their securities-lending and cash collateral reinvestment activities, the report said. Some large life insurance groups in particular have been expanding nontraditional business, such as providing complex guarantees, and remain exposed to macroeconomic risks, the IMF said.\n\nThe \u201ccomplex guarantees\u201d issue probably relates to the trend by U.S. insurance companies, led by Prudential Financial, to reinsure the pension liabilities of companies throughout the world.\n\nThe report also voices concern with the consolidation of insurers in the United States, but this mainly deals with health and property casualty insurance, for example, the proposed acquisitions of Humana by Aetna and Chubb by ACE.\n\nThe Chubb/ACE deal is linked to the low interest rate environment because investment income by P/C companies has fallen significantly because of the substantive decline in long-term interest rates.\n\nThe IMF also notes with concern the decision of \u201cmany\u201d firms to exit the market, and \u201ca few firms failing.\u201d\n\nThe report also said that in the searching for higher yields, some insurers have invested more in private equity, hedge funds, longer duration and lower credit corporate bonds, and real estate-related assets.\n\nAt the same time, the report said, the U.S. insurance supervision framework has been strengthened, primarily because state regulators \u2014 through the NAIC \u2014 have initiated solvency modernization and taken steps to strengthen group and international supervision.\n\nInsuranceNewsNet Washington Bureau Chief Arthur D.
