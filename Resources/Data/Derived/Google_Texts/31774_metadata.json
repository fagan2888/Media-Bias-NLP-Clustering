(Photo: ~Courtesy of Spotswood EMS) Story Highlights The Borough Council voted down a proposed ordinance that would have outsourced EMS.\n\nNumerous residents have spoken up in support of keeping the service in-house.\n\nSPOTSWOOD \u2013 The borough\u2019s proposed plan to abolish its EMS department and outsource it to a private paid service was shot down \u2014 at least for now \u2014 but the fate of the EMS may be decided in a November referendum.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to have is what the cost would be for shared services for a full-time provider for EMS, so that we can provide residents the choice of either a shared service agreement or have a full-time department of our own,\u201d Council President Curtis Stollen said.\n\nThe referendum question has to be decided by mid-August in order to get it on the November ballot, Stollen said.\n\nIn response to residents\u2019 pleas to keep the EMS service in-house, the proposed ordinance was unanimously rejected by council members at Wednesday\u2019s meeting. Councilwoman Margaret Drozd, who was on a scheduled vacation, did not attend the meeting.\n\nStollen told the crowd that \"after I heard public outcry opposing privatization of our EMS, it's given me pause.\"\n\n\"It's never been our intention to want to do something against the public's wishes,\" he said. \"We heard you. I have second thoughts on this ordinance.\"\n\nThe Borough Council came under scrutiny last month after a first reading of the proposed ordinance, which sought to abolish its EMS.\n\nIf approved, the proposed change also would have impacted Helmetta residents, who use the service and is now contracting with Spotswood to use the service on a month-to-month basis, officials said.\n\nCouncil explores EMS options\n\nLast year, the borough put out a request for proposals (RFPs). Two bidders, Robert Wood Johnson and MONOC, responded. Robert Wood Johnson would provide services for $301,000 a year, with no increases for five years, and MONOC came in with a bid of $250,200 for the first year that would increase to $261,000 in year five.\n\nMONOC did not provide additional information and explanations, so they did not fulfill the requirements of the bid, Stollen said.\n\nThe council also voted Wednesday to reject the RFPs.\n\nThe proposed change was sparked as a result of several issues, including recent changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"A lot of the lower affordable cost plans don\u2019t cover transport,\u201d Stollen said.\n\nIn addition, EMT workers cannot exceed 30 hours per week on average or they must receive benefits, he said.\n\n\u201cEven though we are trying to control that, when they have calls and it\u2019s the end of their shift, it\u2019s hard to control,\u201d Stollen said. \u201cWith the penalties that can be imposed, that\u2019s an issue.\u201d\n\nAt the January meeting, Chief Financial Officer Joe Zanga told attendants that there has been a downward trend in EMS revenue \u2014 declining from about $471,395 in 2011 to about $308,670 unaudited in 2015.\n\nTypically, municipalities do not generate revenue in excess of expenses when it relates to public safety, Zenga said.\n\n\"You have to look at providing the best possible service in the most economical fashion,\" he said.\n\nThe appropriation side has been relatively level, although the future could bring significant increases because of the Affordable Care Act, he said.\n\nAccording to a handout distributed at the meeting last month, based on the 2014 budget, the average tax increase for property owners in the borough should RWJ take over is estimated to be about $42.04 a year.\n\nThe net cost after anticipated revenue to give full-time EMTs family health coverage is estimated to be $519,242, with an average tax increase to property owners of $117.29 per year, Stollen said. The cost for single health insurance coverage is estimated to be $384,101, with an average tax increase to property owners of $70.70 a year, he added.\n\nThe EMS figures are based on a full-time director and six full-time EMTs, with part-time per diem employees to fill in, Stollen said.\n\n\"The in-house figures only show the immediate cost involved, not the pension impact that would be felt two years after the full-time hirings,\" the council president said.\n\nResidents rally for in-house EMS\n\nBut borough residents, as well as those from nearby communities, took to the podium to express their disdain with efforts to abolish the borough\u2019s EMS. Many questioned why the issue was not put to a referendum.\n\nMayor Nicholas Poliseno also spoke out in support of the squad.\n\nAnd the council responded by rejecting the ordinance.\n\nThe mayor, as well as residents, thanked the council for its decision at Wednesday\u2019s meeting. .\n\n\u201cI am glad that you said you were going to put it on a ballot,\u201d borough resident Jackie Palmer said.\n\nShe also questioned the existence of a feasibility study that was referenced in the proposed ordinance.\n\n\u201cWe did do a study,\u201d Stollen said. \u201cWe did not hire a consultant to do the study. No we didn\u2019t have a sheet of paper that said feasibility study, but we did a feasibility study. That was the financial document and educating ourselves on the facts and the details of what is happening. We have issues with EMS, and the administration has promised us they will tackle these issues.\u201d\n\nBorough resident Dean Sliker asked about the status of contract negotiations with the EMS union. Other residents questioned the status of the EMS facility, which has been out of commission because of flooding.\n\n\u201cThe EMS building, regardless of what way we were going, is still being rebuilt,\u201d Stollen said. \u201cWe already are doing the remediation. We have the architect\u2019s plans finalized.\u201d\n\nWhile Stollen said the fate of the EMS has been a topic of discussion for quite some time, some residents said they felt they were kept in the dark.\n\nIn response, Palmer suggested that the currently inactive Human Relations Council be resurrected as liaison between the council, the mayor\u2019s office and the community.\n\nEMS Director Miriam Barbarise thanked her staff for their dedication and hard work and the community for their support.\n\nShe also thanked the council and mayor for giving the department \"a second chance.\"\n\n\"We will prove ourselves to be a better and stronger department,\" she said. \"As a department head, that is my job, to make sure that I have a good, strong staff, which I do have right now. I have a great staff that works pretty much every day. They come in and they do their job. I am going to continue to make sure that they do everything to the best of their ability. I will build a better department \u2014 something that this town has never seen.\"\n\nStaff Writer Susan Loyer: 732-565-7243; sloyer@gannettnj.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1Xz3CFB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Borough Council voted against a proposed ordinance that would have abolished the borough's EMS department.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "The Borough Council voted against a proposed ordinance that would have abolished the borough's EMS department.", "title": "Spotswood EMS to remain in-house", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/middlesex-county/government/2016/02/17/spotswood-ems-remain--house/80508550/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Borough Council voted against a proposed ordinance that would have abolished the borough's EMS department.", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f60b4766176bb245dead1497457b1b38ad6d3b3f/c=0-204-1224-1428&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/17/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635913495451188970-Spotswood-EMS.jpeg", "title": "Spotswood EMS to remain in-house", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Spotswood, EMS"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: ~Courtesy of Spotswood EMS) Story Highlights The Borough Council voted down a proposed ordinance that would have outsourced EMS.\nIn response to residents\u2019 pleas to keep the EMS service in-house, the proposed ordinance was unanimously rejected by council members at Wednesday\u2019s meeting.\nThe fate of the EMS may be decided in a November referendumThe Spotswood Borough Council voted against a proposed ordinance that would have abolished its EMS department and outsourced it to a private service.\nResidents rally for in-house EMSBut borough residents, as well as those from nearby communities, took to the podium to express their disdain with efforts to abolish the borough\u2019s EMS.\nThe Borough Council came under scrutiny last month after a first reading of the proposed ordinance, which sought to abolish its EMS."}
