Facebook\n\nTaryn Brumfitt was once a sleek body builder with hopes to undergo plastic surgery, but now she\u2019s gained weight back and chosen to undertake a documentary project that will help women accept the way they look, and reject the picture-perfect magazine body.\n\nThe 35-year-old mother of three had always struggled with body appearance, believing she was \u201cfat\u201d and \u201cdisgusting\u201d whenever she looked in the mirror. Even when she had the \u201cnear-perfect\u201d body during her bodybuilding days, she was still unhappy with herself \u2014 her body dysmorphic issues even spurred her to consider plastic surgery. Now, Brumfitt has undergone a transformation, and is somewhat of an \u201canti-Maria Kang\u201d \u2014 aiming to inspire women to learn to love themselves, understand the pains and self-sacrifices of the impossible Photoshop body by explaining her own experience in weight loss, and exploring self-love and the beauty of women all over the world. Maria Kang, meanwhile, is the \u201cNo Excuse\u201d mother who has become internet-famous for promoting a strictly-regulated lifestyle that leads to a perfect tummy and bikini body.\n\nBrumfitt hopes her documentary will inspire women to learn to love their bodies, by describing her own journey from self-disgust to acceptance. Facebook\n\nIn an online letter to Maria Kang, Brumfitt argues that image isn\u2019t the same thing as health: \u201cI AM a health advocate. I run, I lift weights, I eat healthily but I also have a cookie with my soy latte and knock back the odd burger or yiros when I feel like it. It\u2019s called balance. And\u2026health is not dictated by your looks. Health is physical, emotional and spiritual and so much more that is not visible and not always obvious to others.\u201d She\u2019s raising money for a documentary called \u201cEmbrace,\u201d and her Kickstarter page has already raised about $120,000 of her $200,000 wish.\n\nBrumfitt\u2019s journey began after an epiphany that made her realize her actions would have an effect on her young daughter. \u201cI\u2019m sitting on the couch thinking about my impending surgery (boob job and tummy tuck) and I am watching my daughter play on the ground in front of me when, BOOM, I have an epiphany,\u201d Brumfitt wrote on her website. \u201cHow am I ever going to teach Mikaela to love her body as it is if her Mummy can\u2019t do the same? \u2026If I go ahead with the surgery am I setting my daughter up for a future of body-hating and self-loathing?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "taryn brumfitt, maria kang, bodybuilding, obesity", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Taryn Brumfitt is a mother of three who is undertaking a journey to teach women how to accept their bodies and understand that they're beautiful, even if they don't have the picture-perfect form.", "title": "The \u2018Anti-Maria Kang\u2019: Mom Of 3 Aims To Help Women Embrace Flaws [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mom-3-creates-documentary-help-women-mothers-embrace-their-bodies-283170", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/17/taryn-brumfitt-35.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Taryn Brumfitt is a mother of three who is undertaking a journey to teach women how to accept their bodies and understand that they're beautiful, even if they don't have the picture-perfect form.", "title": "The \u2018Anti-Maria Kang\u2019: Mom Of 3 Aims To Help Women Embrace Flaws [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mom-3-creates-documentary-help-women-mothers-embrace-their-bodies-283170", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/17/taryn-brumfitt-35.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/17/taryn-brumfitt-35.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-05-17T13:57:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-17T13:57:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Taryn Brumfitt is a mother of three who is undertaking a journey to teach women how to accept their bodies and understand that they're beautiful, even if they don't have the picture-perfect form."}, "article_summary": "Brumfitt hopes her documentary will inspire women to learn to love their bodies, by describing her own journey from self-disgust to acceptance.\nFacebookIn an online letter to Maria Kang, Brumfitt argues that image isn\u2019t the same thing as health: \u201cI AM a health advocate.\nTaryn Brumfitt chose to reject her bodybuilding life in order to show her daughter how to embrace her body the way it is.\n\u201cHow am I ever going to teach Mikaela to love her body as it is if her Mummy can\u2019t do the same?\n\u2026If I go ahead with the surgery am I setting my daughter up for a future of body-hating and self-loathing?\u201d"}
