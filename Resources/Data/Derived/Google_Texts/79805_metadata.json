(AP) \u2014 The pending sale of the Twentymile Coal Co. mine outside Steamboat Springs is a piece of rare good coal news for Routt County officials.\n\nPeabody Energy said last week it was selling Twentymile and the El Segundo and Lee Ranch mines in New Mexico for $358 million in cash, as well as the assumption of certain liabilities, to Bowie Resource Partners.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close by the first quarter of 2016, and Bowie will become the largest bituminous coal producer in the western United States. With 1,700 employees operating at five mining complexes in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, Bowie\u2019s production will double to 25 million tons per year.\n\n\u201cNationally, coal might be on the decline, and there might be some day in the future when there is no coal industry, but my hope is we\u2019re the last coal mine standing,\u201d Routt County Commissioner Tim Corrigan said.\n\nTwentymile Mine operates 24 hours per day, 361 days a year, about 15 miles southeast of Steamboat Springs.\n\nIn February, Twentymile had 335 full-time employees and is one the Yampa Valley\u2019s largest employers. In 2014, Twentymile employed about 400 full-time employees. The mine produced 6.7 million tons of coal in 2014, down from 7.2 million tons in 2013.\n\nSteady rumors about Twentymile\u2019s future \u2014 including that it was going to close \u2014 illustrates its importance in the Yampa Valley.\n\n\u201cWe live with that worry on an ongoing basis,\u201d Corrigan said.\n\nAccording to a news release from Bowie, all of Twentymile\u2019s employees are expected to remain and become Bowie employees.\n\n\u201cI view it as a real positive development,\u201d Corrigan said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that Bowie would purchase the mine without the intent of continuing production.\u201d\n\nBowie\u2019s corporate offices are located in Louisville, Kentucky. Its operations office is in Grand Junction.\n\nCounty Commissioner Cari Hermacinski said she had been hearing for months that Bowie was looking to buy Twentymile. She added she has talked to a couple of the mine\u2019s employees.\n\n\u201cThey viewed this as a good transition,\u201d Hermacinski said. \u201cIf the people working out there think it\u2019s a good thing, it probably is.\u201d\n\nMoffat County Commissioner Chuck Grobe also said he was glad to hear of the sale.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s a good thing for the area,\u201d Grobe said. \u201cIt brings a lot of stability.\u201d\n\nBowie said the purchase will allow it to compete with natural gas concerns. Bowie is banking on existing long-term contacts the mines hold. For example, Twentymile has a contract with the Hayden Station power plant near Hayden. The station is currently adding $160 million worth of technology to reduce emissions.\n\n\u201cThese acquisitions fit the vision and model that were the genesis of Bowie as we continue to buck the industry trend with long-term contractual partnerships with our customers and secure margins in our niche,\u201d said executive chairman John Siegel.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Officials see good coal news in sale of Colorado mine", "title": "Officials see good coal news in sale of Colorado mine", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/26/officials-see-good-coal-news-in-sale-of-colorado-mine/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-26T11:40:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-26T11:40:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo.
