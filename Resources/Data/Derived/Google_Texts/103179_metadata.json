Republicans are eager to make the former secretary of State an issue \u2014 whether it\u2019s for her use of a private email account while serving as the nation\u2019s top diplomat or her response to the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nSince he left office in January 2001, Bill Clinton has been the favorite surrogate of Democratic candidates across the country. He traveled to nearly half the states during the 2014 election season, headlined dozens of rallies and fundraisers, recorded robo-calls, cut videos and more in what turned out to be a disappointing year for Democrats at the polls.\n\nThe former president is still hugely popular: An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll taken in March showed 56% of adults have a somewhat positive or very positive view of him, while 26% say they have a somewhat negative or very negative view. Clinton\u2019s ratings are higher than those of Obama (44%-43%) and George W. Bush (35%-39%).\n\nHe is also more popular than Hillary Clinton, with 44% of Americans in the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll saying they had a positive view of her compared with 36% who have a negative one.\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s skill at translating big ideas and complicated issues, such as the Affordable Care Act, into concepts that resonate with voters prompted President Obama to dispatch him across the country with great effect during his 2012 re-election campaign.\n\nClinton \u201cis probably the most important political surrogate in the country of any party,\u201d said Bill Burton, a Democratic strategist and former Obama aide in the 2008 campaign and White House. \u201cHe can draw a lot of attention and he can excite activists. He can frame arguments in a way that no one else can, which is why President Obama made him the Secretary of Explaining Stuff.\u201d\n\nDuring Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign, her husband frequently introduced her at rallies, dialed for dollars and whipped up enthusiastic crowds at his own events on her behalf. But there were missteps that she would like to avoid in 2016.\n\nHillary Clinton apologized to African Americans for comments her husband made during the 2008 South Carolina primary comparing Obama\u2019s victory there to Jesse Jackson\u2019s 1984 and 1988 victories in the state. Bill Clinton had also called Obama\u2019s opposition to the Iraq War \u201cthe biggest fairy tale I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to put that in context. You know I am sorry if anyone was offended. It was certainly not meant in any way to be offensive,\u201d Hillary Clinton told the publishers of black community newspapers in March 2008. \u201cWe can be proud of both Jesse Jackson and Senator Obama.\u201d\n\nDon Fowler, a former Democratic National Committee chairman close to both Clintons, said the news media treated the former president unfairly during the 2008 incident in South Carolina. But he concedes Bill Clinton has to be careful in the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think his role should be up front and out in public,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be appropriate for them to share the stage \u2026 He\u2019ll be close to planning and coaching but I don\u2019t think this will be a shared campaign.\u201d\n\nClinton, for his part, sounded humble in the Town and Country story focused on his family foundation\u2019s efforts in Haiti about whether he still has the fire in the belly to be an effective campaigner. The former president, now 68, suggested he\u2019s mellowed since daughter Chelsea gave birth to baby Charlotte last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told Hillary that I don\u2019t think I\u2019m good (at campaigning) anymore, because I\u2019m not mad at anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can\u2019t be mad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "First Gentleman, Hillary, bill, ready for Hillary Clinton", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05fe\"", "article_summary": "Don\u2019t expect Bill Clinton to be the campaigner in chief for Hillary Clinton as she launches her second presidential bid \u2014 at least not initially.\nHillary Clinton will announce her long-awaited candidacy Sunday, according to the Associated Press and numerous news reports.\nBill Clinton had also called Obama\u2019s opposition to the Iraq War \u201cthe biggest fairy tale I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\u201cI want to put that in context.\nSince he left office in January 2001, Bill Clinton has been the favorite surrogate of Democratic candidates across the country.\nBut he concedes Bill Clinton has to be careful in the 2016 campaign."}
