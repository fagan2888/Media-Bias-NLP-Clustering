That\u2019s on purpose.\n\nHill is dean of Crean College of Health and Behavioral Sciences at Chapman University\u2019s new Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus, a campus whose design stresses interoffice communication and transparency.\n\n\u201cThere are glass walls, even in my office. I am totally exposed,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe encourage collaboration. We should be talking with each other.\u201d\n\nHill is the former dean of the Schmid College of Science and Technology. Andrew Lyon is the new dean of Schmid College on the Orange campus.\n\nThe offices in the new Rinker campus reflect the new health care model, which came about following the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The model emphasizes communication and prevention, as opposed to the old function of health care as mainly disease treatment, Hill said.\n\n\u201cWhile there will always be a disease component of medical practice, there is a widespread, new shift toward maintaining health and preventing conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cThis requires interdisciplinary education and encouraging the medical programs to work with each other.\u201d\n\nThe Rinker campus is focused on educating students to work in the new world of health care, in which professionals collaborate across disciplines and technology has a bigger role.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure our students are really ready. We have to ask, how is it our students can learn and adopt evolving technology into their practice?\u201d\n\nThe new model of health care also requires new methods backed with research and evidence.\n\n\u201cWe really embrace evidence-based practice,\u201d Hill said.\n\nContact the writer: bhanson@ocregister.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "life", "description": "Life: Chapman Dean Dialogue: Janeen Hill | new, health, hill, campus, care, dean, model, technology, rinker, students", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "BRITTANY HANSON", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Janeen Hill has little to no privacy at work.
