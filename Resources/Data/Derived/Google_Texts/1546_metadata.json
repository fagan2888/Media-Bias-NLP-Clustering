Donald Trump being on the verge of becoming the Republican presidential nominee is a ground-break moment that is just being discoverd but that started years ago on Capitol Hill and elsewhere across the country.\n\nLet\u2019s start in 2009 and 2010. Congressional Republican leaders forged a pact to make things as hard as they could on President Obama.\n\nDuring that tumultuous period, the Democrat-controlled House and Senate approved the stimulus package to bolster the economy, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform measure and OK\u2019d the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe House managed to approve a controversial climate bill, referred to as \u201ccap and trade.\u201d But that package never surfaced in the Senate.\n\nCongressional Republicans seized the Democratic initiatives and turned the political tables against the party that passed them.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nBut this was more than just going after Democrats. Some Republicans were intent at going after those in their own party, too -- some of whom they viewed as Democratic \u201cenablers\u201d -- even if their voting record didn\u2019t match the accusation.\n\nThe first sign that something was up came in May, 2010. Republicans knocked then-Utah GOP Sen. Bob Bennett, off the ballot at a state convention, resulting in the election of the Tea Party-backed Mike Lee later that year.\n\nIn August, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, lost her primary to Sarah Palin acolyte Joe Miller, though Murkowski then waged the first successful Senate write-in campaign in 50 years to hold her seat.\n\nIn November, Republicans flipped the House thanks to the rise of the Tea Party and came close to earning control of the Senate. The GOP stumbled in two Senate contests, veering too far to the right with their nominees.\n\nDriven by the Tea Party, Republicans campaigned on repealing ObamaCare. The first vote in the Republican-controlled House was to dismantle the health care law. Republicans planned to harness profligate spending. Things would be different in Washington under the GOP.\n\nThe government came close to shutting down in March and April of 2011, thanks to pushes from the right. That was only a precursor to the 16-day shutdown of 2013.\n\nConservatives forced the country to the brink in the summer of 2011 as many Republicans refused to raise the debt ceiling. The debt limit fight did prompt significant spending cuts. But not on the scale many conservatives hoped.\n\nRepublicans were sure Mitt Romney would demolish Obama in 2012. It didn\u2019t happen. Republicans were certain they would win control of the Senate in 2012. It didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThinking they would be working with a lame-duck president, Republicans delayed big spending decisions until Christmastime and New Year\u2019s, sparking a battle over the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d during the holidays.\n\nCome January, 2013, conservatives fired a shot across the bow of then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Boehner reclaimed the speaker\u2019s gavel. But not after nine Republicans defected and Rep. Brian Babin, T-Texas, voted \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, helped engineer the aforementioned government shutdown that fall to force Obama to defund the health care law. Cruz cowed many congressional Republicans to go along against their better judgment.\n\nYet ObamaCare lived.\n\nThen in June of 2014, a bombshell nobody saw coming. College professor Dave Brat upset then-House Majority Leader Rep. Eric in the Virginia Republican primary. It was one thing to blindside Bennett at the convention. It was unprecedented to defeat such a high-ranking House member in a primary. A major scalp was now pinned to the wall, fueled by voter distrust and angst.\n\nRepublicans secured even more seats in the 2014 midterm election and finally captured control of the Senate. Boehner stood for speaker in January, 2015. He survived a tense roll call vote for speaker that nearly sent the tally to a second ballot for the first time since 1923, but barely.\n\nOnly 216 Republicans voted for Boehner. Twenty-four cast ballots for someone else. Babin again voted \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nBoehner may have been a little more politically nimble than Cantor and was able to survive longer. But the speaker was clearly in the crosshairs.\n\nOut of nowhere in late July, just before the start of the August recess, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., shocked Capitol Hill when he unveiled a nonbinding-but-unprecedented resolution that could possibly force a mid-Congress vote for speaker.\n\nThe House never considered Meadows\u2019s plan. But the stage was set. Boehner was done by fall.\n\nInitially, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was thought to be the natural successor. But he could never quite muster the votes and withdrew in dramatic fashion.\n\nEven if McCarthy had managed to squeak into the speaker\u2019s suite, many thought the same tides that finally crashed into Boehner would have thrown McCarthy overboard in a matter of months. After weeks of tumult, Republicans finally elected Wisconsin GOP Rep Paul Ryan as speaker.\n\nThese were the political gravitational waves at work inside the GOP.\n\nTheir ripples forced dramatic upheaval in Washington. But people invested in Republicans to shake up things.\n\nObama proved the perfect foil. But soon, the same people who aligned with the Tea Party in 2010, were sick of it. ObamaCare was still on the books. Congress still hadn\u2019t slashed spending to a level they found acceptable.\n\nThe national debt ballooned above $19 trillion. Starting in 2009, Republicans crawled into bed with the disaffected.\n\nAnd when those voters aligned with the Tea Party and other conservative factions failed to see change in Washington, they came at the GOP with pitchforks.\n\nThe question of course was how did Republicans court those voters? The obvious answer is that many Republicans overpromised. They sold the Tea Party the goods. Now they\u2019re mad as hell. Jeb Bush never had a chance with this crowd. How about Cruz or Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.?\n\nCruz certainly has a better chance with this crowd. But this is why many voters stand foursquare behind Trump. He\u2019s not a \u201ctraditional politician.\u201d He\u2019s not of Washington. They appreciate the fiery rhetoric. The bombast. And the promises.\n\nOh. The promises. Here we go.\n\nThat\u2019s where this started to go off the track for congressional Republicans, most of whom now fear a Trump candidacy.\n\nIt started with how Republicans responded to Obama in 2009 and the major majorities Democrats carried in both the House and Senate.\n\n\u201cYou've got to remember President Obama came in with a super-majority, Ryan said.\n\n\u201cHe came in in his first term, the first half of his first term -- Nancy Pelosi was speaker of the House. Harry Reid was majority leader with 60 votes in the Senate. And they were able to cram through a liberal progressive agenda on an unsuspecting country. And the rest is, as we say, history.\u201d\n\nCram through? Well, that was what Republicans told voters that Democrats were doing. Never mind Democrats had the votes in both bodies to approve these initiatives.\n\nBut Republicans seized on that agenda and claimed Democrats were abusing their power. Republicans told voters that if they elected the GOP in 2010, things would be different.\n\nAnd when they weren\u2019t\u2026.\n\n\u201cThere are people who unrealistically set expectations of what could be accomplished in divided government,\u201d said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. \u201cPeople thought all we could do is wave a magic wand and we could repeal ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nThune suggests there\u2019s now a backlash to those overpromises.\n\n\u201cAll conventional wisdom is out the window,\u201d he said.\n\nRyan is trying to temper those expectations now. But one wonders if it\u2019s too late.\n\n\u201cSome people may have led others to believe that just with Congress, we can rewrite laws or just with Congress, we can overturn laws we didn't like,\u201d he said. \u201cI find half the time, whether it's Lincoln Days or listening sessions, kind of explaining the way our Constitution works. Giving civics lessons.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not as though Republican leaders didn\u2019t try the civics lessons approach after acquiring the House majority in 2011.\n\nCantor said on multiple occasions that the GOP only controlled \u201cone-half\u201d of \u201cone-third\u201d of government. Boehner sometimes described the House as a goalie playing defense against Obama.\n\nBut academic talk about \u201ccivics lessons\u201d can\u2019t compete against overheated rhetoric about ripping out health care. Republicans then stoked the embers by conducting more than 60 roll call votes to eliminate the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCivics lessons can\u2019t compete when some in the GOP hurl incendiary if not racist rhetoric at the President and call for impeachment. Civics lessons are nice. But they can\u2019t measure up.\n\nSo here we are, several years down the road on the precipice of a major political discovery: Donald Trump might just be the Republican nominee. It took a while. But follow the political gravitational waves in reverse to the source. And it will explain how the Republican Party got here.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Southwest/Texas,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Presidential Primaries", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-27 02:14:53 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"description": "The recent discovery of gravitational waves in space is being considered one of greatest in scientific history, though it came decades after Albert Einstein theorized about them a century ago in his theory of relativity.", "title": "Making, discovery of Trump as GOP candidate, like the finding of space's gravitational waves", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/27/making-discovery-trump-as-gop-candidate-like-finding-spaces-gravitational-waves.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/02/27/0/0/694940094001_4776901213001_trump-1280.jpg?ve=1", "creator": "@foxnews", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Southwest/Texas\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Presidential Primaries\"],\"author\":\"Chad Pergram\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Making, discovery of Trump as GOP candidate, like the finding of space\\\\u0027s gravitational waves\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/02/27/0/0/694940094001_4776901213001_trump-1280.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-27T18:57:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/27/making-discovery-trump-as-gop-candidate-like-finding-spaces-gravitational-waves.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"b493e6ba-bc85-4e79-9c69-5fb56224889c\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "The recent discovery of gravitational waves in space is being considered one of greatest in scientific history, though it came decades after Albert Einstein theorized about them a century ago in his theory of relativity.", "dc.description": "The recent discovery of gravitational waves in space is being considered one of greatest in scientific history, though it came decades after Albert Einstein theorized about them a century ago in his theory of relativity.", "dc.identifier": "b493e6ba-bc85-4e79-9c69-5fb56224889c", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "texas,presprimaries", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Making, Discovery Of Trump As Gop Candidate, Like The Finding Of Space's Gravitational Waves", "dcterms.created": "2016-02-27 02:14:53 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "The recent discovery of gravitational waves in space is being considered one of greatest in scientific history, though it came decades after Albert Einstein theorized about them a century ago in his theory of relativity.", "title": "Making, discovery of Trump as GOP candidate, like the finding of space's gravitational waves | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/27/making-discovery-trump-as-gop-candidate-like-finding-spaces-gravitational-waves.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/02/27/0/0/694940094001_4776901213001_trump-1280.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.abstract": "The recent discovery of gravitational waves in space is being considered one of greatest in scientific history, though it came decades after Albert Einstein theorized about them a century ago in his theory of relativity.", "dc.date": "2016-02-27", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Southwest/Texas\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Presidential Primaries\"],\"author\":\"Chad Pergram\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Making, discovery of Trump as GOP candidate, like the finding of space\\\\u0027s gravitational waves\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/02/27/0/0/694940094001_4776901213001_trump-1280.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-27T18:57:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/27/making-discovery-trump-as-gop-candidate-like-finding-spaces-gravitational-waves.html\",\"post_id\":\"b493e6ba-bc85-4e79-9c69-5fb56224889c\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "dc.creator": "Chad Pergram"}, "article_summary": "Driven by the Tea Party, Republicans campaigned on repealing ObamaCare.\nBut soon, the same people who aligned with the Tea Party in 2010, were sick of it.\nAnd it will explain how the Republican Party got here.\nIn November, Republicans flipped the House thanks to the rise of the Tea Party and came close to earning control of the Senate.\nThey sold the Tea Party the goods."}
