Does God alone control the future? Do you have a hand in your destiny and the future path of others? Or are there forces, powers, principalities, rulers of this world and spiritual wickedness in high places those who shape and control the future? It\u2019s likely that all of the above are true. So take a trip with me into the light of truth but it is not for the faint of heart.\n\nThe war in Iraq, for example, was never about oil, removing a dictator or weapons of mass destruction. There were no weapons found and Saddam was found hiding in a hole. What a threat he was, wow. The war in Iraq was about biblical prophecy and control or manipulation of the future. Here is a little geographic history about the war in Iraq. That entire area is biblical including Iran. There you have Niniveh where Jonah went. It was the oldest and most populated city of the Assyrian empire.\n\nThere is Babylon under Iraq and Babylon is biblically spoken of in past tense as well as in the future. There is Persia under Iran. And where the Tigres and Euphrates meet, it is likely the area where the Garden of Eden existed. The war in Iraq was based on a much bigger picture and even if you don\u2019t believe that, those who wanted that land do believe it. Biblical prophecy dictates that whomever controls that land, also controls the path the armies from the Kings of the North and the Kings of the East must take to reach Israel and launch the battle of Armageddon.\n\nMany of us are not paying attention, others of us are not doing our homework and yet others of us are being distracted by what they say these wars and conflicts are about. Yes all these things affect YOU. As the \u201cLord Marshal\u201d said in The Chronicles of Riddick, \u201ctoday is a day of days\u201c. We are watching prophecy unfold in a way that Moses, Abraham, Elijah and others could only hope to see. We are headed full steam towards what John saw in the book of Revelation and what Daniel saw in the book of Daniel. Did you know that the Affordable Health Care Act (Obamacare) even has a provision for microchip implantation under the skin? How is that for a \u201cmark of the beast\u201d catalyst or scenario. I could tell you exactly where that provision is, but I won\u2019t. You have to do your homework and if you are reading this article, you have the means to do the research. But be forewarned that your age of innocence is about to come to an end as the light of the truth breaks through comfortable and willful ignorance.\n\nWhen President Bush was in office, he outlined what he called an \u201caxis of evil\u201c. Ironic, but anyway he listed several middle eastern countries. Then, shortly after, America began an overt practice of \u201cregime change\u201c. That sounds so much nicer than saying our country is \u201coverthrowing governments, removing people we had on payroll and taking over countries with imperialist expansion under the guise of spreading democracy.\u201d But just as the American Eagle holds in its talons (clutches) 13 arrows for the 13 colonies built by killing the Indians and a contradictory olive branch of peace with 13 leaves in its other talon, the truth is painfully obvious and crystal clear. Look at the back of a one dollar bill. And the 13 stars above the eagle\u2019s head are the 13 families of the Illuminati who reign over this country.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get too deep into puppet governments, not yet. But I do want to start you thinking and get you researching. The world you think you live in is \u201cjust a sugar-coated topping\u201d which hides the world beneath it. Don\u2019t take my word for any of this, go and check for yourself. Even if it\u2019s to try and prove me wrong, go and check. A good friend recently reminded me that people are comfortable in their ignorance and the darkness of their beliefs \u2013 even when what they believe is not true. But wait, didn\u2019t we say walk in the light? And isn\u2019t the truth supposed to set us free? How will it if we reject it? Today your age of innocence is at the beginning of its end and this is just a taste. Welcome to the light.\n\nStaff Writer; Marque-Anthony\n\nMore Articles:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "language": "en"}, "article_summary": "You are here: Home Christian Talk / The Future: Who Wants To Control It?\nThe Future: Who Wants To Control It?\nThe war in Iraq was about biblical prophecy and control or manipulation of the future.\nOr are there forces, powers, principalities, rulers of this world and spiritual wickedness in high places those who shape and control the future?\nDoes God alone control the future?"}
