In Romney\u2019s eyes, Cruz\u2019s candidacy represents the best chance Republicans have of denying Trump primary delegates and, ultimately, the nomination by way of a contested convention.\n\n\u201cI like Governor John Kasich. I have campaigned with him. \u2026 But a vote for Governor Kasich in future contests makes it extremely likely that Trumpism would prevail,\u201d Romney said in a Facebook post last week, pledging his vote for Cruz and urging other Republicans to do the same.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision is a testament to just how important stopping Trump is to the former Massachusetts governor.\n\nFrom Cruz\u2019s first year in Washington up until very recently, the public relationship between the two Republicans\u2014Romney the establishment standard-bearer and Cruz the crusading conservative outsider\u2014was increasingly fraught, from subtle jabs to more overt name-calling.\n\nIn September 2013, Romney (among many others) decried Cruz\u2019s 21-hour \u201cfaux-libuster\u201d to hold up government-funding legislation over his opposition to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cYou give him credit for bringing attention to a very important issue,\u201d Romney told CNN, agreeing with Cruz\u2019s ultimate goal. \u201cI have a harder time seeing where a [government] shutdown leads.\u201d\n\nIn a few days later in a radio interview, Cruz responded: \u201cHe is certainly entitled to his views. \u2026 I\u2019m much more concerned about listening to the American people than I am about listening to politicians in and around the country.\u201d\n\nAbout a month later, with 2016 speculation already swirling, Romney dissed Cruz, refusing to put the Texan on his list of legitimate presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cPaul Ryan, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio; I mean, there\u2019s a long list of very capable people. But Chris Christie stands out as one of the very strongest lights in the Republican Party,\u201d Romney told NBC\u2019s David Gregory on Meet the Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDoes Ted Cruz stand out to you as a potential light of the Republican Party?\u201d Gregory asked.\n\nNot so much, Romney replied\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to disqualify anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think I\u2019ve indicated some of the names that I think are most effective in becoming elected, and we\u2019ll see where it goes.\u201d\n\nAs Cruz\u2019s star in the Senate continued to rise, the uncompromising junior senator began to send shots over the bow at Romney and other \u201cestablishment moderate\u201d Republican nominees.\n\n\u201cIf we run another candidate in the mold of a Bob Dole, or a John McCain, or Mitt Romney, we will end up with the same result, which is millions of people will stay home on Election Day,\u201d Cruz said in an October 2014 interview, warning of \u201cirreparable damage\u201d to the country.\n\n\u201cIf we run another candidate like that, Hillary Clinton will be president,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a conservative think tank summit in January 2015, Cruz referred to Romney as the \u201cmushy middle\u201d when asked by reporters about the former Massachusetts governor.\n\nIn April, a month into his presidential campaign, Cruz again took a swipe at Romney, noting that the 2012 nominee got \u201cclobbered\u201d for his infamous 47 percent remarks.\n\n\u201cI think Romney is a good man who had a hard campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I cannot think of a statement in all of politics that I disagree with more strongly.\u201d\n\nIn his private remarks, Cruz did not relent against Romney. At a May conference with conservative donors and activists, Cruz called Romney was the world\u2019s worst person for the GOP to run against Obama in 2012:\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party, in its infinite wisdom, sought out and found the one human being on the face of the planet who had designed and implemented a program just like Obamacare. Literally \u2013 there are 7 billion people on earth. You could have grabbed any other person and asked them, \u2018Excuse me, sir, have you designed and implemented Obamacare? No? You\u2019re a better candidate!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few months later, it was Romney\u2019s turn to hit back, after Cruz criticized the nuclear deal brokered between the United States and Iran.\n\n\u201cIf this deal goes through, the Obama administration will become the leading financier of terrorism against America in the world,\u201d Cruz told Fox News, calling aspects of the agreement \u201cshameful\u201d and catastrophic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard this referred to before as the \u2018Jihadist Stimulus Bill,'\u201d the senator added.\n\nIn response, Romney tweeted on that Cruz \u201cwent over the line\u201d and hurt \u201cthe cause.\u201d\n\nI am opposed to the Iran deal, but @SenTedCruz is way over the line on the Obama terrorism charge. Hurts the cause. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) July 30, 2015\n\nBut Cruz did not back down.\n\n\u201cSo Mitt Romney\u2019s tweet today said, \u2018Gosh, this rhetoric is not helpful,'\u201d Cruz said in a July 31 Texas radio interview. \u201cJohn Adams famously said, \u2018Facts are stubborn things.\u2019 Describing the actual facts is not using rhetoric; it is called speaking the truth.\u201d\n\nCruz said Romney was \u201cclobbered by Barack Obama\u201d in the third 2012 presidential debate was because he failed to use bold rhetoric about terrorism.\n\n\u201cMitt, I guess listening to his own advice, said, \u2018Well gosh, I don\u2019t want to use any rhetoric. So OK, never mind. I\u2019ll just kind of rearrange the pencil on the podium here,'\u201d Cruz said.\n\nBut then something changed: Donald Trump happened. And as one of the Republican Party most vocal and adamant anti-Trumpists, Romney softened his comments about Cruz.\n\nIn January, with polls showing Trump leading in early-voting states, Romney defended Cruz against the billionaire\u2019s implications that Cruz would be ineligible to be president.\n\n.@tedcruz is a \"natural born citizen.\" Obama too. Even George Romney. This isn't the issue you're looking for. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) January 8, 2016\n\nAnd following Romney\u2019s strategic endorsement of voting for Cruz (rather than of Cruz himself) earlier this month, Cruz graciously accepted \u2013 even if he had just months prior been one of the GOP\u2019s chief Romney critics.\n\n\u201cIn my book, when someone says I\u2019m voting for you and I encourage everyone else to vote for you, that\u2019s pretty darn good,\u201d Cruz told NBC News on Saturday. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll take that\u2014and take that happily.\u201d\n\nMaybe Trump really is a unifying force after all.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Last Friday, Mitt Romney flipped the tables on John Kasich and announced he would vote for Ted Cruz in Utah\u2019s caucuses Tuesday.
