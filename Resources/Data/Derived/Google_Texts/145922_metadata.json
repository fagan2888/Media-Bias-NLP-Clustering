Congress could have shut this thing before it even started, but no the bearded wonder came out and said \u2018going forward we\u2019re going to do things differently but we need to start the new year without the threat of a shutdown hanging.\u2019 The bearded wonder has now given Obama the running room he needed to go for the guns. The bearded wonder. I liked him before the beard\u2014I think he\u2019s been worse since the beard.\n\nIngraham then played audio of Ryan saying \u201cI love you too\u201d then she noted that \u201cno, he doesn\u2019t love me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do like him as a person, I shouldn\u2019t say that\u2014but this is mind-numbingly stupid: Why did you give Obama all this running room with the money?\u201d Ingraham asked. \u201c$1.1 trillion budget.\u201d\n\nIngraham is absolutely correct that Ryan could have stopped this whole executive gun control before it ever even started had he been willing to use the power of the purse, which Congress has essentially surrendered since Obama was elected president. Ryan\u2019s predecessor, now former Speaker John Boehner, wouldn\u2019t use the power of the purse to stop Obama\u2014and now Ryan has not only followed in Boehner\u2019s footsteps of funding Obama\u2019s efforts to fundamentally transform America, Ryan has accelerated those efforts.\n\nThe American people, as they\u2019ve seen Ryan operate as House Speaker for his first couple months since his election to the post in late October, has seen an extraordinary drop off in his approval ratings not just among all Americans but particularly among Republicans. According to the latest Economist/YouGov ratings out on Monday, Ryan has dropped 24 points in just two months\u2014and he\u2019s now down at 29 percent approval among all Americans and under 50 percent at just 45 percent among Republicans.\n\nNew York Magazine recently culled through millions of Breitbart News comments to find a handful that alleged that Ryan\u2019s newly grown beard means he\u2019s a secret Muslim. Others throughout the mainstream media have pushed the narrative that somehow conservatives believe Ryan is a secret Muslim because of his new beard. Obviously, Ryan is not a Muslim and most people don\u2019t believe he is\u2013but that didn\u2019t stop Ryan from complaining to Obama that conservatives think he\u2019s a secret Muslim because of the beard.\n\n\u201cMr. Ryan\u2019s relations with Mr. Obama have sometimes been testy,\u201d Al Hunt wrote in a column for the New York Times before Christmas. \u201cBut last week, as they were discussing the final deal on the phone, Mr. Ryan, who has grown a beard, told the president that some on the angry right have even accused him of being a Muslim. The president, who has long faced the same absurd allegation, chuckled.\u201d\n\nThat New York Magazine columnist, Jesse Singal\u2013shortly after he made the great revelation about a handful of commenters on Breitbart News\u2013went on to have an out-of-control Twitter rant where he called the millions of readers of this news network \u201chateful idiots.\u201d The unhinged Singal Tweeted over and over again for a full evening.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Radio host Laura Ingraham says that \u201cthe bearded wonder,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, is a failure who enabled Barack Obama\u2019s gun control.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Radio host Laura Ingraham says that \u201cthe bearded wonder,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, is a failure who enabled Barack Obama\u2019s gun control.", "title": "Laura Ingraham: \u2018The Bearded Wonder\u2019 Speaker Paul Ryan Enabled Barack Obama's Executive Gun Control - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/GettyImages-500610484.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/05/laura-ingraham-bearded-wonder-speaker-paul-ryan-enabled-barack-obamas-executive-gun-control/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Radio host Laura Ingraham says that \u201cthe bearded wonder,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, is a failure who enabled Barack Obama\u2019s gun control.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/GettyImages-500610484.jpg", "title": "Laura Ingraham: \u2018The Bearded Wonder\u2019 Speaker Paul Ryan Enabled Barack Obama's Executive Gun Control - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Gun Contol, Laura Ingraham, Paul Ryan, Paul Ryan Beard,2nd Amendment, Big Government,Paul Ryan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2nd Amendment", "tag": "Paul Ryan Beard", "published_time": "2016-01-05T09:11:48-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2nd Amendment"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNationally syndicated conservative radio host Laura Ingraham says that \u201cthe bearded wonder,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, is a failure who enabled President Barack Obama\u2019s gun control by executive action.\nThe bearded wonder.\n\u201cI would love to see the bearded wonder Paul Ryan\u2014he\u2019s got to lose that beard, it makes him look ridiculous that beard, he should shave it, that is just horrible\u2014that bearded wonder Paul Ryan giving Obama funding for his lawless behavior for the next 12 months,\u201d Ingraham said.\nOthers throughout the mainstream media have pushed the narrative that somehow conservatives believe Ryan is a secret Muslim because of his new beard.\nRyan\u2019s relations with Mr. Obama have sometimes been testy,\u201d Al Hunt wrote in a column for the New York Times before Christmas."}
