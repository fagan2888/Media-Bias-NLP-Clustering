Other arrestees include Rev Pat Mahoney, the director of the Christian Defense Coalition and Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue. Seven pro life protesters were arrested in all.\n\n\u201cWe were told yesterday by Speaker Boehner\u2019s office that this is the most pro-life Congress that has ever been installed,\u201d Troy Newman told CNSNEWS.com.\n\nThe protesters were holding a vigil in an attempt to get Congress to pass the ban on abortions after 20 weeks. The bill is usually referred to as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\n\nThe bill was scheduled to come to a vote in the House on January 22, which is the anniversary of Roe v Wade. It was pulled at the last minute and a bill disallowing the use of federal monies for abortions in circumstances not pertaining to the Affordable Care Act was passed in its place.\n\nI am grateful to these protestors for doing this. Maybe the bad publicity will force Speaker Boehner to bring the bill to a vote.\n\nI\u2019ve personally witnessed pro-life people back down and cover up for Republican leadership when they killed pro life bills here in Oklahoma. I\u2019ve also seen big-name preachers take a pass on everything they\u2019d been preaching to their flocks when leadership leaned on them.\n\nThis arrest underscores a simple fact that We the People are loathe to accept: Politics is about power, not morality.\n\nFrom CNSNEWS.COM:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Public Catholic", "description": "Catholic in the Public Square", "title": "Breaking: Speaker John Boehner\u2019s Office Orders Arrest of Pro Life Demonstrators", "url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/publiccatholic/2015/03/breaking-speaker-john-boehners-office-orders-arrest-of-pro-lifer-demonstrators/", "image": "http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/publiccatholic/files/2015/01/boehner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,patheos.mkt5005.com,www.patheos.com", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "article_summary": "Seven pro life protesters were arrested in all.\nbyPro life leaders were arrested for holding a prayer vigil outside House Speaker Boehner\u2019s office today.\nI\u2019ve personally witnessed pro-life people back down and cover up for Republican leadership when they killed pro life bills here in Oklahoma.\n\u201cWe were told yesterday by Speaker Boehner\u2019s office that this is the most pro-life Congress that has ever been installed,\u201d Troy Newman told CNSNEWS.com.\nThis arrest underscores a simple fact that We the People are loathe to accept: Politics is about power, not morality."}
