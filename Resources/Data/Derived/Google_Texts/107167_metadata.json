(Max Whittaker/Getty Images)\n\nThe numbers, it seems, have been overshadowed by other, more positive headlines. First, the state signed up more consumers in October than HealthCare.gov , the federal marketplace handling enrollments for 36 states. Second, the board governing Covered California voted last week not to allow insurers to offer their canceled policies for another year, rejecting President Obama\u2019s recommendation earlier this month.\n\nDuring a meeting last week, officials at Covered California , the state\u2019s much-touted health insurance marketplace, made a pretty stark admission : Half of the approximately 1 million consumers whose health plans are being canceled will pay more under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut the figures do call into question the sweeping plaudits California has received \u2014 including from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman in Monday\u2019s newspaper \u2014 for signing up so many people (about 80,000, as of last week).\n\nBy way of background, many of these consumers\u2019 plans are being canceled because they were \u201cnon-grandfathered,\u201d meaning they were purchased after the Act was signed by President Obama in March 2010 and their benefits do not meet its requirements (some were pretty skimpy).\n\nAlthough the federal law allowed these plans to be renewed for another year, Covered California\u2019s contracts with health insurers require them to be canceled at the end of this year. Officials said the idea was to create stability in the new marketplace and provide consistency for all consumers.\n\nAs cancellation letters went out, supporters of the law contended that the canceled policies either had inferior coverage or would cost far less in the exchanges. California\u2019s numbers show that is only half the story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a success story,\u201d said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a group that supports a California ballot measure to regulate insurance rates. \u201cIt\u2019s a success story only if you consider that the federal website didn\u2019t work and ours did. It\u2019s not a success story because people are in open revolt about how much they\u2019re paying. The only people who are happy are people who have subsidized policies. The middle class is outraged.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers:\n\nCovered California estimates that about 900,000 consumers will have their \u201cnon-grandfathered\u201d policies canceled. Of those, 310,000 (or 35 percent) are eligible for a subsidy. Another 15 percent will see their rates decrease even though they won\u2019t receive a subsidy. And the rest? About 25 percent will pay more for similar or perhaps inferior coverage, and the remaining 25 percent will pay more but will receive additional benefits, such as coverage for prescription drugs.\n\nAll told, fully half of the 900,000 will pay more. (I profiled one such couple, who will see their costs more than double, earlier this month.) Additionally, while those receiving the subsidy will pay less out of their own pockets, their plans could still cost more and much of the tab will be picked up by the government.\n\nSome other policies are being canceled, too, because insurers are withdrawing from the market.\n\nKen Wood, a senior adviser with Covered California, told me that the initial estimate of consumers in non-grandfathered plans was lower than the actual number because turnover in the individual insurance market was underappreciated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure people fully understood the impact of the law three years ago when it was just numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s gotten very real that some people are going to have to pay more.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Wood said, this is the cost of moving to a new system, in which consumers with pre-existing conditions will be able to get coverage, those who got sick while enrolled in a plan won\u2019t have to worry about having their policies canceled, and all plans will offer a minimum set of benefits.\n\n\u201cYes, they\u2019re paying more than they would have paid,\u201d he said. \u201cThat also assumed that their risk pool remained healthy and nothing else upset the apple cart. Very few people who\u2019ve been in it for five, eight, 10 years have had very smooth rate increases.\u201d\n\nThe number of people affected is relatively small compared to the population of California, Wood noted. Some 32 million residents will keep the coverage they have through their employers, Medicare and the Medi-Cal public health program for the poor, he said, and millions more are uninsured and may be eligible for some type of support.\n\nBut consumer advocates say there\u2019s more to the story, too. Canceled policyholders may lose their doctors and hospitals. That\u2019s because some top California hospitals, including UCLA and Cedars-Sinai medical centers, are not participating in most of the new health plans.\n\n\u201cHow good is it to buy a policy in the exchange if you can\u2019t go to UCLA?\u201d Court asked. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly not as good as it was in the old plans. \u2026 In some cases, I think people do get better policies. But in a lot of cases, like in California, they\u2019re getting comparable policies. There\u2019s very little different, except that their networks of doctors and hospitals are smaller, so that makes them worse or that makes them feel worse.\u201d\n\nHealth industry consultant Bob Laszewski pointed out another problem with California\u2019s apparent success story. Covered California has a goal of enrolling about 500,000 to 700,000 people receiving subsidies by April 1, 2014, the end of the open-enrollment period. But Laszewski notes that this includes the canceled policyholders.\n\n\u201cWhy should we be so impressed with Covered California because they have signed up 80,000 people so far?\u201d he wrote. \u201cOr, even that their goal is to sign up 500,000 to 700,000 of the state\u2019s 6.4 million people \u2013\u2013 half subsidy eligible \u2013\u2013 who are uninsured or having their insurance canceled?\u201d\n\nWood said the canceled plans were not taken into consideration when California set its enrollment goals. The exchange hopes to enroll upwards of 2 million people by Jan. 1, 2015. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go back and re-project our number,\u201d he said. \u201cThat did make our January [2014] number an easier target to hit.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This post is adapted from Ornstein\u2019s \u201cHealthy buzz\u201d blog.
