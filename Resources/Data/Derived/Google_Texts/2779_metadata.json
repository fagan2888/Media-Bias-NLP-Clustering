Since January, employers with 100 or more workers must provide a medical plan to 70 percent of their people. Small businesses will have to comply with similar mandates next year.Goldman\u2019s healthcare analysts estimate insurance premiums will rise 4 percent to 4.5 percent in the next few years, which would suppress wage growth. However, Obamacare may damp health costs with its various restrictions and incentives.\u201cThe \u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 on high-cost health plans is likely to restrain health benefit cost growth,\u201d Hatzius said in the report co-authored by Alec Phillips. The levy on those expensive plans \u201cis likely to begin holding down average employer health costs even before it takes effect in 2018, as employers begin to adjust benefit packages.\u201dAnother constraint on benefit costs will be the availability of government-sponsored coverage, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates . Obamacare required states to set up healthcare marketplaces for people to buy coverage, or to use the federally provided HealthCare.gov system.\u201cSome employers may drop coverage in favor of newly available public sources,\u201d Hatzius said. \u201cCBO estimates that the greatest shift will occur in 2016, when employer-sponsored coverage declines by an estimated 2 percent to 3 percent.\u201dThe reduced benefit costs may translate into a 0.15 percentage point annual increase in wages, according to Goldman estimates.\u201cThe upshot is gradual upward pressure on wages, all other things being equal, with a bumpier ride in overall compensation growth as a result of health benefit trends,\u201d Hatzius said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Goldman, Hatzius, wage, Obamacare", "pubdate": "2015-05-13T11:49:25", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Goldman Sachs estimates that healthcare costs will rise more slowly for employers in the next few years and drive wage gains for workers as Obamacare transforms the market for medical services.", "title": "Goldman Sachs: Obamacare May Help Drive Wage Growth for Workers", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Goldman-Hatzius-wage-Obamacare/2015/05/13/id/644314/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=3467ee4f-77d6-4b7b-a0cb-0d822059419d&SiteName=Newsmax", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Goldman-Hatzius-wage-Obamacare/2015/05/13/id/644314/", "description": "Goldman Sachs estimates that healthcare costs will rise more slowly for employers in the next few years and drive wage gains for workers as Obamacare transforms the market for medical services.", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Goldman Sachs: Obamacare May Help Drive Wage Growth for Workers"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "epoch": 1431517765, "article": {"section": "StreetTalk", "published_time": "2015-05-13T11:49:25"}, "keywords": "Goldman, Hatzius, wage, Obamacare", "google-site-verification": "G8ES7h3vwQTlFRuKZLTkGYYr-GOyLKJVunu1JffVHbs", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Goldman-Hatzius-wage-Obamacare/2015/05/13/id/644314/", "description": "Goldman Sachs: Obamacare May Help Drive Wage Growth for Workers"}, "article_summary": "However, Obamacare may damp health costs with its various restrictions and incentives.\u201cThe \u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 on high-cost health plans is likely to restrain health benefit cost growth,\u201d Hatzius said in the report co-authored by Alec Phillips.\nSmall businesses will have to comply with similar mandates next year.Goldman\u2019s healthcare analysts estimate insurance premiums will rise 4 percent to 4.5 percent in the next few years, which would suppress wage growth.\nSince January, employers with 100 or more workers must provide a medical plan to 70 percent of their people.\n\u201cIt is likely to take several quarters, and probably a couple of years, for slowing benefit costs to translate into higher wage growth.\u201dThe gradual roll-out of the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law dubbed \u201cObamacare,\u201d is shifting the way businesses pay workers, including with tax-free insurance.\nObamacare required states to set up healthcare marketplaces for people to buy coverage, or to use the federally provided HealthCare.gov system.\u201cSome employers may drop coverage in favor of newly available public sources,\u201d Hatzius said."}
