While that would indicate that neither Martinez woman will actually purchase insurance on an Obamacare exchange, the Martinezes support the extended rules and the ban on insurers not accepting applicants with pre-existing conditions.\n\nWhile the Martinez\u2019s have benefited from the changes, other Americans have not. CBS has covered the plight of millions whose insurance plans have been cancelled entirely due to more stringent rules and the limited access to new insurance plans on the faulty federal exchange.\n\nBut instead of covering these CBS should \u201cnot discourage people from getting the health care they need in order to gin up ratings,\u201d Martinez concluded.\n\nMoveOn.org buttressed its criticisms of CBS News with a report from Media Matters for America which alerted Americans to the fact that Obamacare coverage in the network news media has been overwhelmingly negative.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter and Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
