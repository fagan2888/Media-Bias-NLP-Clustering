the parade, President Hassan Rowhani insisted the weaponry on show was for defensive purposes only.\n\n\"In the past 200 years, Iran has never attacked another country,\" he said.\n\n\"Today too, the armed forces of the Islamic Republic and its leadership will never launch any aggressive action in the region.\n\n\"But they will always resist aggressors determinedly until victory.\"\n\nThe Sejil was first tested in November 2008 and the Ghadr in September of the following year.\n\nBoth are two-stage missiles that use solid fuel that allows them to be moved around and launched rapidly.\n\n...,/.,", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD REGIONS/Asia,/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD REGIONS/Middle East", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-07 02:16:57 EST",
