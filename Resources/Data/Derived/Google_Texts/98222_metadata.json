She was an extremely prolific poet, though not publicly recognized in her lifetime, and many details of her life remain a mystery.\n\nWilliam Luce dramatized Dickinson\u2019s homebound life by combining details from biographies, her poetry and her letters into an entrancing one-woman show, \u201cThe Belle of Amherst,\u201d that he wrote for the gifted and versatile Julie Harris in 1976.\n\nJoely Richardson breathes new life into Dickinson with an impish, high-spirited enactment in the engaging revival that opened Sunday night at off-Broadway\u2019s Westside Theatre. Playing a 53-year-old Dickinson with aplomb, Richardson chats to the audience as if she were confiding in a guest for tea at the family home in Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nTaking much artistic license, Luce combined portions of Dickinson\u2019s poetry with retellings of significant moments in her life. Rather than portray all the other characters, Richardson enacts only Dickinson\u2019s side of her conversations with family members, good friends and the occasional visitor. The 100-minute play is filled with almost nonstop complex, lyrical dialogue and poetry.\n\nDickinson\u2019s love of words and her bemused observations shine throughout the dialogue. \u201cI look at words as if they were entities, sacred beings. There are words to which I lift my hat when I see them sitting on a page,\u201d she informs a visitor early in the play, and thereafter several times repeats merrily, \u201cNow there\u2019s a word to lift your hat to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review:  Emily Dickinson comes out of the shadows", "title": "Review:  Emily Dickinson comes out of the shadows", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Review:  Emily Dickinson comes out of the shadows", "title": "Review:  Emily Dickinson comes out of the shadows", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/20/review_emily_dickinson_comes_out_of_the_shadows/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/theater-review-the-belle-of-amherst.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Review:  Emily Dickinson comes out of the shadows", "title": "Review:  Emily Dickinson comes out of the shadows", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/theater-review-the-belle-of-amherst.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jennifer Farrar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb8a\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Acclaimed 19th-century American poet Emily Dickinson was famously reclusive, although she maintained numerous correspondences.\nTaking much artistic license, Luce combined portions of Dickinson\u2019s poetry with retellings of significant moments in her life.\nJoely Richardson breathes new life into Dickinson with an impish, high-spirited enactment in the engaging revival that opened Sunday night at off-Broadway\u2019s Westside Theatre.\nShe was an extremely prolific poet, though not publicly recognized in her lifetime, and many details of her life remain a mystery.\nPlaying a 53-year-old Dickinson with aplomb, Richardson chats to the audience as if she were confiding in a guest for tea at the family home in Amherst, Massachusetts."}
