Just this week, the Washington Post ran a story noting that this group of purportedly centrist Democrats will has seen its numbers fall from 50 members four years ago.\n\n\u201c[T]he Blue Dog Coalition is a shell of its former self, shrunken to just 15 members because of political defeat, retirements after redrawn districts left them in enemy territory and just plain exhaustion from the constant battle to stay in office,\u201d wrote Paul Kane at the Washington Post. \u201cSeveral are not running for reelection in November, and a few others are top targets of Republicans.\u201d\n\nThere actually 19 members of the Blue Dog Coalition, though three members aren\u2019t running for reelection in 2014. Reps. Jim Matheson (D-UT) and Mike McIntyre (D-NC), whose districts were targeted by Republicans, decided to retire. Rep. Mike Michaud (D-ME) is running for governor in Maine. Other members of the Blue Dog Coalition face tough bids for reelection, which could further dwindle its numbers at the beginning of the next Congress.\n\nBlue Dog Democrats claim to \u201crepresent the center of the House of Representatives\u201d and purport to be \u201cdedicated to the financial stability and national security of the United States.\u201d In news stories, reporters will frequently refer to Blue Dogs as \u201cfiscally conservative\u201d or \u201cdeficit hawks.\u201d\n\nThose descriptions may be good for Blue Dog Democrats who running for reelection, but is it true? It depends on how one views it. Looking at these members\u2019 scores from various groups dedicated to fiscally conservative ideas as well as their spending agendas says a lot about whether these Democrats are actually what the purport to be.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the current roster of the Blue Dog Coalition and their lifetime ratings from three groups \u2014 FreedomWorks, the Club for Growth, and Americans for Prosperity \u2014 which score legislation related to fiscal issues. Included below is each members\u2019 net-spending agenda (proposed spending increases minus proposed cuts), per the National Taxpayers Union Foundation BillTally.\n\nThese ratings may not mean much to some, but buried in these scores are votes on some of the biggest issues that have come before Congress in the last several years \u2014 including the Wall Street bailout, reversal of modest spending cuts, Obamacare and subsequent repeal votes, the 2009 stimulus bill, and Dodd-Frank. Each of these bills represents a real threat to taxpayers, who are staring down a $17.2 trillion national debt.\n\nRepresentative District FW CFG AFP Spending (in billions) Ron Barber AZ-02 20% 21% 5% $1,684 John Barrow GA-12 29% 28% 33% $110,287 Sanford Bishop GA-02 18% 13% 16% $4,522,564 Cheri Bustos* IL-17 20% \u2014 10% \u2014 Jim Cooper TN-05 26% 26% 24% $1,072,174 Jim Costa CA-20 21% 19% 7% $146,281 Henry Cuellar TX-28 29% 27% 16% $142,797 Pete Gallego* TX-23 24% \u2014 10% \u2014 Dan Lipinski IL-03 13% 10% 10% $1,247,043 Jim Matheson UT-04 43% 42% 34% $318,818 Mike McIntyre NC-07 37% 33% 38% $443,324 Mike Michaud ME-02 14% 7% 6% $860,755 Collin Peterson MN-07 33% 30% 24% $460,498 Nick Rahall WV-03 14% 12% 9% $1,988,705 Loretta Sanchez CA-47 12% 8% 9% $1,917,676 Kurt Schrader OR-05 21% 18% 10% $18,029 David Scott GA-13 14% 9% 6% $1,802,827 Kyrsten Sinema* AZ-09 25% \u2014 10% \u2014 Mike Thompson CA-05 13% 9% 8% $363,471 Average 22.4% 19.5% 15% $963,558\n\nItalitics = not running in 2014\n\n* = freshman member\n\nFor a coalition supposedly concerned about the fiscal health of the United States, not a single Blue Dog Democrat proposed a net-spending cut. In fact, as you can see above, the average net-spending agenda for a Blue Dog Democrat over the course of their career is just under $1 trillion.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, all but five of these Blue Dog Democrats voted for Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for Speaker of the House in January 2013. From 2007 to 2011, then-Speaker Pelosi oversaw $5 trillion added to the national debt, including $3.22 trillion in the 111th Congress alone.\n\nIf the Blue Dog Coalition is supposed to be centrist and fiscally conservative wing of the party\u2019s caucus, it should give you an idea of how far left House Democrats have drifted in recent years.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Bailout,Blue Dog Democrats,budget deficit,centrists,deficit hawk,deficit spending,Dodd-Frank,fiscal conservative,House Democrats,House Election 2014,House of Representatives,national", "description": "Blue Dog Democrats Much ink has been spilled in the last few years over the decline of the Blue Dog Coalition in the House of Representatives.
