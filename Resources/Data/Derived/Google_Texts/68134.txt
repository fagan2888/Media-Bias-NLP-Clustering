ALEX WAGNER, MSNBC: There is something that is very evident from today's decision, which is maybe the most important thing post-2016 is the Court, and who sits on it. I want to talk a little bit about SCalia and the language he used in his dissenting opinion [on King v. Burwell]. Apart from choice phrases like "that's pure applesauce" and "argle bargle."



But the bitterness and the virtiol. At one point he was like, "this is unnatural interpretation from the law." And the phrase "SCOTUScare" really revealed a deeply partisan emotional core that informs Scalia's decision making.



CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC: Uhh, yes.



ALEX WAGNER: When you read that, first of all what is your reaction? And as you look at the court more terribly, like, how terrified should people be?



CHRIS HAYES: Look, the Scalia dissent is a few things. First it is an absolutely entertaining read. A must read. Everybody wins when Scalia is in dissent. We get to read the dissent, and he doesn't run the country. It is a win win.
