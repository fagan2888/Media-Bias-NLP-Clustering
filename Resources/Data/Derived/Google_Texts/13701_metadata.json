One year in which Americans will decide if it really happened.\n\nObama\u2019s own place in history was assured the moment he was elected the first black president of this slavery-scarred nation. Lately he has been talking up the changes his administration wrought as historic and lastingly beneficial. To which voters\u2019 response should be: We\u2019ll be the judge of that.\n\nIs the nation\u2019s lurch to the left on many policies permanent or temporary?\n\nAre achievements that Obama might see as worthy of being inscribed on Mount Rushmore really written in sand?\n\nWill the 44th president\u2019s victory on health care, his actions to combat climate change, his small advances on immigration and gun policy \u2014 even the Supreme Court\u2019s legalization of gay marriage during Obama\u2019s time in office \u2014 be leveled by the next political wave?\n\nAs Americans continue to argue loudly about the virtue of what Obama has done and tried to do, one fact is beyond debate: No president in memory has entered his eighth year in office with his legacy so in doubt.\n\nThe reason has less to do with Obama\u2019s policies themselves than with the way they have been pushed through.\n\n\u2022 With purely partisan assistance from a Congress then dominated by Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats. Neither the administration\u2019s major domestic victory, the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), nor its biggest foreign-policy triumph, the Iran nuclear accord, received a single Republican vote on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe now Republican-led Congress has voted to overturn Obamacare but can\u2019t get it past the president\u2019s veto. That could change if a Republican is elected president in November. GOP candidates also have threatened to cancel the Iran deal if elected.\n\n\u2022 With executive orders that bypass Congress. The latest instance is Obama\u2019s order this month to expand the number of gun sales subject to background checks. The bigger example is Obama\u2019s 2014 executive action protecting from deportation millions of undocumented immigrants, mostly parents of U.S.-born children.\n\nBoth could be overturned by the next president. The immigration order already hangs in the balance, having been stalled by a Texas judge siding with a coalition of Republican governors. The U.S. Supreme Court said today it would take up the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 With head-spinning speed. Fundamental changes like those in laws governing health insurance and marriage didn\u2019t come gradually, at the end of long, persuasive campaigns. Although their proponents see these shifts as overdue, the aggregated change came so fast that conservatives see them as artificial.\n\nThe result: Conservatives are fired up for the 2016 election as perhaps never before. They know electing a Republican president, with the chance for conservative appointments to the Supreme Court, could turn back the clock.\n\nObama knows this. His State of the Union address was a plea for voters to ratify his achievements by electing a Democrat in November.\n\nEvery election is in some ways a referendum on the last president. But rarely like this.\n\nObama\u2019s 2008 campaign theme of \u201cHope and Change\u201d has led to a presidency of change and hope \u2014 Obama\u2019s hope that the change he has won isn\u2019t undone a year from now.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As of noon Wednesday, one year remains in President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure in office.
