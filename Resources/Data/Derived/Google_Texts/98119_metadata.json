Less than two weeks ago, Oregon, Alaska, and the nation\u2019s capitol, Washington, D.C., voted to legalize it, and join ranks with Washington and Colorado. But even as those two latter states embrace the drug\u2019s use, conflicting research shows that marijuana use isn\u2019t always beneficial. A new study from the American Heart Association (AHA) shows just that, and suggests that weed\u2019s secondhand smoke may damage blood vessels just as much as tobacco smoke.\n\n\u201cMost people know secondhand cigarette smoke is bad for you, but many don\u2019t realize that secondhand marijuana smoke may also be harmful,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Springer, senior author of the study and associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco\u2019s cardiology division, in a press release.\n\nSecondhand smoke from cigarettes alone causes upwards of 50,000 deaths a year, according to the American Lung Association. Despite passing through a smoker\u2019s own lungs, it still contains hundreds of toxic and carcinogenic chemicals, such as formaldehyde, arsenic, and ammonia, which end up being inhaled by those nearby. If it\u2019s inhaled enough, over time, it puts a person at risk of respiratory and heart problems. Frequent cannabis use has also been associated with some of these effects, particularly with the respiratory system \u2014 the chemicals emitted through combustion of both the marijuana and the paper used to roll it into a joint or blunt contribute to these effects.\n\nThe AHA study, which will be presented at the AHA\u2019s Scientific Sessions 2014 meeting in Chicago, used a modified cigarette smoking machine to expose rats to marijuana smoke. Using ultrasound imaging, the researchers looked at how the smoke affected the rats\u2019 main-leg artery function 10 and 40 minutes after exposure. Specifically, they were looking at how much the artery dilated, which would result in lower blood pressure.\n\nThey found that 30 minutes after exposure, the rats arterial function had remained 70 percent worse than what it was before inhaling the smoke. This effect was consistent even when cannabis\u2019s main ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was taken out of the smoke before exposure \u2014 this measure was taken to ensure it wasn\u2019t the reason for the effect.\n\nThe study points to two important things to remember when using marijuana, or being around someone else who is. One, marijuana, just like anything else should be used in moderation and with caution (it\u2019s a drug just like painkillers and stimulants, after all). Just this week, two separate studies were published showing that THC and another compound within could shrink brain tumors, and that marijuana altered areas of the brain, leading to addiction \u2014 or at least dependence. Essentially, there\u2019s just as much evidence supporting its benefit as there is exposing its harms.\n\nThe second thing to remember is that smoking isn\u2019t the healthiest way to consume marijuana.\n\nAs mentioned before, any form of consumption that involves burning the plant material is likely to create hundreds of harmful chemicals, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a form of particulate matter found in air pollution that\u2019s known to cause cancer. These chemicals also harm the respiratory system, causing bronchitis and mucosal buildup. Instead, experts suggest heath conscious users try edibles (pay attention to dosage) or vaporizers, which heat the plant matter just below the point of combustion, thus releasing cannabis compounds without the extra chemicals created by fire.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, being in a smoky room, whether it\u2019s marijuana or cigarette smoke, is just plain gross. If you\u2019re consistently around someone using marijuana in an enclosed space, open a window, leave the room, or even ask them to begin using a safer method for delivery. It\u2019ll benefit everyone\u2019 health.\n\nSource: Springer M, Wang X, Narayan S, et al.
