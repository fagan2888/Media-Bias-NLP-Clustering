As appealing as it is, it's too slow and too forlorn (its tempo suggests pain may be as close as happiness) and falls short of what we look for in our ultimate summer tunes.\n\nWe look each year for something to make a new memory or give us an excuse to relive a summer past\n\nWhile many songs refer to spring, winter and autumn (or ''fall''), summer is a season apart. You could put it down to its association with holidays or the way heat can be enervating and energising, or the appeal of fewer clothes and more cocktails.\n\nPharrell's Happy footage is uplifting, and acts as a giant clock that users can click between.\n\nYou could also blame the way the music industry likes to give us particularly catchy songs \u2014 remember Sisqo's Thong Song? \u2014 when the temperature rises. Or you could just recognise that, in the words of English journalist Peter Robinson, ''pretending you don't like music with a very catchy tune is tiring, so people take the summer off''.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis summer's most likely anthem (so far) is Pharrell Williams' Happy, which reached the top of the ARIA singles chart on Saturday. It's bouncy, mixing R&B and pop, and the chorus (''clap along if you feel like a room without a roof/ clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth\") is like biting into an iceblock.\n\nThere's no sex in it but there is happiness and catchiness. Not bad substitutes for any summer day.\n\nMelbourne band TZU.

They remind us of a better, more naive, innocent time in our lives.\"\n\nNot that everything needs to be rose-coloured, says writer and musician Emma Swift. Her favourite summer songs suggest \"uncertainty abounds while the sun shines, leaving us with a sense that love at its best is seasonal and at its worst is make-believe\".\n\nWhatever the reason, we find ourselves associating songs with happier times and consequently look each year for something to make a new memory or give us an excuse to relive a summer past. A summer when we were probably a bit more active than we are in our later years.\n\nSinger Ella Fitzgerald.
