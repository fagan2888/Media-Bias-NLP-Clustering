In return, managers often receive the respect of their workers. And indeed, more than two-thirds of American employees approve \u2014 even like \u2014 their companies\u2019 chief executive officers.\n\nSome CEOs, however, are not popular with employees. At nine major companies, 40% or fewer employees gave their CEOs a positive review. Sears Holdings\u2019 CEO, Edward Lampert, received positive reviews from just 20% of Sears employees and from just 26% of Kmart employees, the lowest rated CEO. Based on 24/7 Wall St.\u2019s independent review of employee ratings provided by Glassdoor, these nine CEOs have the worst reputations.\n\nAccording to Glassdoor spokesperson Scott Dobroski, \u201cWhile this list was compiled by independent research by 24/7 Wall St., it\u2019s clear that some CEOs may want to take note that their own employees feel they can improve when it comes to leadership.\u201d 24/7 Wall St. identified a number of factors that can hurt a CEO\u2019s reputation within his or her own company. These include a CEO\u2019s propensity for humiliating the company in public, poor stewardship of the company and a compensation package that employees perceive to be excessive.\n\nA number of CEOs have failed to represent their companies adequately in public. On some occasions, a CEO\u2019s public conduct was nothing more than a nuisance, while in other instances it became a liability for the company. Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Michael Jeffries is an infamous example of the latter. His comments about the retailer\u2019s target audience \u2014 \u201ccool, good-looking people\u201d with \u201cwashboard stomachs\u201d \u2014 have created negative feelings. Both the press and general public heaped scorn on Jeffries for his blatant lack of sensitivity and the company\u2019s customer discrimination.\n\nMany of the CEOs with poor reputations also ran their companies poorly. Xerox CEO Ursula Burns has repeatedly claimed the company\u2019s 2010 buyout of Affiliated Computer Services would rekindle Xerox\u2019s years of flagging fortunes. Instead, Xerox\u2019s services business has faltered and revenue flattened. The acquisition\u2019s once-prized assets have barely turned out to be valuable at all. Less than one-third of Xerox employees gave Burns a positive review.\n\nOne measure of stewardship is the evaluations employees gave their companies. Companies run by the CEOs on this list received scores of less than 3 out of 5 as an overall company rating, indicating workers were unhappy with their jobs and the companies. Employees of Sears Holdings\u2019 Kmart stores gave their company just a 2.0 overall rating.\n\nDobroski noted that the relationship between overall rating and CEO approval was not a surprise to him. \u201cThe same is conversely true for the top [rated CEOs]. CEOs with high approval ratings tend to lead companies with higher than average satisfaction ratings as well.\u201d According to Dobroski, this is because \u201cleadership and the tone for the company going forward is generally set at the top and then trickles down to the rest of the company.\u201d\n\nLayoffs can also breed animosity toward management among employees. Since the beginning of 2013, GameStop has closed 500 stores. It is unlikely that company CEO J. Paul Raines is popular with current and former employees for that decision.\n\nOther cuts can have a similarly negative effect on employee morale. Last year, Forever 21, run by CEO and founder Do Won Chang, cut employee benefits and moved a number of workers from full-time to part-time status. The company denied this was intended to limit some employees from working more than 30 hours per week \u2014 which would have required the retailer to provide workers with health coverage as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nContinued store cuts at Sears Holdings, which are central to the company\u2019s plans to streamline operations, may also create negative feelings toward management among workers.\n\nExtravagant pay can also lead employees to resent their CEOs. The three members of the Dillard family who run Dillard\u2019s not only serve as management, but they also control the company\u2019s board. The three brothers were paid a total of more than $58 million between 2011 and 2013. With a share price that has risen dramatically in recent years, from just a few dollars to nearly $100, investors may feel this money has been earned. It is unlikely that employees were as enthusiastic.\n\nThe chief executives with the worst reputations may want to look at their more popular counterparts at other companies to determine how they can improve and win over their employees. According to Dobroski, well-liked executives focus on \u201cclearly communicating their vision, including being transparent about where the company is going, how they\u2019re going to get there, and how each employees plays a vital role in this.\u201d\n\nHowever, for many executives there is little incentive to improve those perceptions without direct intervention from the stockholders. Despite the company\u2019s weak financial performance, and his own rash statements, Abercrombie & Fitch\u2019s Jeffries only stepped down as chairman of the board after hedge fund Engaged Capital launched a campaign to split the roles of CEO and chairman. Sears Holdings\u2019 Lampert not only serves in both these roles, but he also engineered the 2005 merger of Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Kmart, widely considered to be a failure. Additionally, ESL Investments, Lampert\u2019s investment fund, owned 48.5% of all shares outstanding as of March 19.\n\nIn order to identify the CEOs with the worst reputations, 24/7 Wall St. examined employee reviews at Glassdoor. To be considered, companies had to have a minimum of 500 reviews. Of the more than 225 companies with more than 500 comments, 24/7 Wall St. identified the nine CEOs with the lowest favorable reviews \u2014 40% or lower. Positive reviews of Eddie Lampert, CEO of Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart, were both below 40%. Reviews of Michael Jeffries, CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch and subsidiary Hollister, were also both below 40%. Data on average wages by position were also from Glassdoor. Additionally, we reviewed financial statements from these companies, where available, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Employee counts are from companies\u2019 own financial statements, as well as Yahoo! Finance. Estimates of employee counts of Forever 21, a privately held company, were taken from Forbes.\n\nThese are the nine CEOs with the worst reputations.\n\n9 CEOs With the Worst Reputations: 24/7 Wall St. 9 CEOs With the Worst Reputations: 24/7 Wall St.\n\n1 of 9 9. J. Paul Raines Company: GameStop CEO rating: 40% Company rating: 2.7 Years as CEO: 4 Number of employees: 17,000 Despite a business model that some say is outdated, and disappointing per-share earnings, GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) CEO Paul Raines received a total compensation package of roughly $11.4 million during the company\u2019s 2012 fiscal year, a 95% increase from 2011. In fact, the combined compensation of GameStop\u2019s top five executives, including Raines, was $34.7 million in 2012, up from $19.4 million in 2011. Comparably, the average hourly salaries of sales associates and game advisors were just above minimum wage. According to Glassdoor, employee morale is low not only due to the modest pay, but also because of the increased number of store closings. Some analysts are questioning whether the retail video game seller can survive competition from larger retailers such as Walmart and Amazon.com, and whether it can sustain its business model.
