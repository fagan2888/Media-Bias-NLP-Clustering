In fact, the majority of providers facing a host of preparations for enacting value-based systems remain tied to the old model.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a difficult transition for everyone as we go from pure fee-for-service to a mixture of fee-for-service and value-based contracting,\u201d said Jim Riopelle, medical director of care management for St. Louis-based Lumeris, a provider of population health management services and technology to hospitals and health systems. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re ultimately going to go to almost exclusively value-based contracting.\u201d\n\nThe new value, or risk-based model, is said to emphasize improved patient care delivered at lower cost since reimbursements are not tied directly to the services patients receive.\n\nThis is a significant challenge that all organizations in healthcare are going to have to undertake.\n\nThere are a number of hurdles to consider when adopting a risk-based model, according to Ralph Lawson, executive vice president and CFO of Miami-based Baptist Health South Florida. First, you must get buy-in from doctors.\n\n\u201cNone of this works without physicians,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cThe physicians also need to share in the savings, and they need to share in the savings first before the hospital or other providers. If the doctors aren\u2019t incentivized and on the same page as the insurer and the other providers, it just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not easy, either. Many physicians who are happy with the way they\u2019ve been paid in the past may not be interested in change, Lawson said.\n\n[See also: 5 keys to value-based purchasing.]\n\nOn the other hand, others just want to do what best serves the patient.\n\n\u201cMost people who go into medicine do so because they love people and they want to do good things in their career,\u201d he said. \u201cMost doctors can be convinced to embrace population management. It\u2019s a matter of education.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a risk environment, the healthier you can make the population, the more profitable you are,\u201d Riopelle said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to compensate providers for providing quality measures. There\u2019s very little direct reward for quality in fee-for-service medicine, whereas in a population health environment, you have identified quality measures that are specifically financially rewarded.\u201d\n\nThose measures would include colon cancer screening rates and other wellness and preventative procedures designed to keep patients healthy and out of hospitals, which provide the most expensive form of healthcare.\n\nIn addition to educating physicians about value-based care, hospital CFOs should establish a timeframe for transitioning to the new model, raise board awareness of value-based payments and build partnerships with insurers to improve healthcare services and outcomes while reducing costs.\n\nThat last one is important, Lawson said.\n\n\u201cWe just reached out to payers,\u201d he said. \u201cMost national payers are interested in discussions on this topic. That has educated me a lot, just sitting down with payers and saying, \u2018OK, if we did do this, how is this thing going to work? What about this? What about that?\u2019 There\u2019s nothing like healthy face-to-face dialogue. It really changes the relationship between payers and providers \u2013 which in the past has often been combative \u2013 in a really healthy way.\u201d\n\nLawson says 8 percent to 9 percent of Baptist Health\u2019s business next year will likely come from some form of risk-based contract, a percentage he expects to climb even higher in 2016.\n\n\u201cI used to not get too involved in meetings with the commercial payers, but I do now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt keeps everyone on the same page about lowering costs and improving care.\u201d\n\nRiopelle said the switchover will take a lot of planning, and a lot more effort.\n\n\u201cYou need to pick really high-quality, long-term partners. This is a significant challenge that all organizations in healthcare are going to have to undertake.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/providers-slow-enact-risk-based-reimbursement-model", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/SouthFLFeature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The change from a fee-for-service healthcare model to a value-based approach might be inevitable, but that doesn't mean it's happening quickly.
