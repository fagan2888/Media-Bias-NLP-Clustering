The Court should resolve the case before its term ends in June 2016, Verrilli says.\n\nLed by the state of Texas, 26 states challenged the president\u2019s program allowing 4.3 million illegal aliens to remain in the United States and receive work permits, a program known by the acronym DAPA.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, on Nov. 9 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that Obama\u2019s DAPA program violates both the process required by the Administration Procedure Act (APA) for making federal regulations, as well as the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Having invalidated Obama\u2019s actions on statutory grounds, the Court did not reach a conclusion on the states\u2019 third issue in the lawsuit, whether the president\u2019s actions also violated the Constitution\u2019s Take Care Clause.\n\nThe administration announced it would seek review in the Supreme Court. On Nov. 20, Verrilli filed a petition for certiorari at the Supreme Court, asking the justices to hear the Justice Department\u2019s appeal of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision.\n\nShortly thereafter, Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller requested the Court to extend to 60 days the normal 30-day window for the states to file a brief opposing Verilli\u2019s petition. Keller explained that his team needed the extension because of numerous upcoming deadlines they must meet. Such extensions are routinely granted.\n\nOn Nov. 24, Verrilli filed a letter with the Court opposing the extension. Extending the current deadline by 30 days would push a vote on the cert petition past the normal cutoff for this year\u2019s cases, meaning that the Supreme Court would not hear the case until October 2016, with a decision unlikely before Obama leaves office on Jan. 20, 2017.\n\n\u201cAs detailed in the petition, the [Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision] prevents the government from taking any steps to further an immigration policy of exceeding importance to federal law enforcement, \u2026 and to millions of families with longstanding and close connections to this country,\u201d Verrilli\u2019s letter reads.\n\nHe reminded the Court that there are 26 states in this legal challenge against the Obama administration, and argued that if Texas is too busy to meet the normal 30-day deadline, then the other 25 states could help.\n\nVerrilli said the government would agree only to extend the deadline for a few days, to Dec. 29, and that the government would forfeit its right to file any later briefs in reply to the states. This would then guarantee that the justices would have time to vote on the petition at their Jan. 15 conference. If the Court grants review on that date, it would allow just enough time to fully brief the case and hear arguments during the last week of April, which is when the Court\u2019s final cases for this year\u2019s term will be heard.\n\nWhile all this would normally be inside baseball, it could determine one of the most controversial episodes of Obama\u2019s presidency. Determined to resolve this matter before the 2016 election, Verrilli added that should the \u201crequest for a 30-day extension be granted, we anticipate filing a motion for expedition and a May argument session to permit the case to be heard this Term.\u201d\n\nThe case is United States v. Texas, No. 15-674.\n\nKen Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News.
