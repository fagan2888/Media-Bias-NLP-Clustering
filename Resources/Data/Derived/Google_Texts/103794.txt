Health-care inflation has been muted for years, but a research analyst expects a number of factors to soon start lifting prices in the medical sector.

Goldman Sachs analyst Alec Phillips points out in a research note that myriad government policies have contained prices.

First, there was the sequester, which in 2013 held down Medicare prices. While it’s still holding down the level of Medicare payments, Phillips notes, it’s no longer holding down the growth in them.

Another policy was the lowering of inflation adjustments that providers receive from Medicare, which was designed to help offset by the cost of the coverage expansion under Obamacare.

Last year there was a one-time reduction in Medicare hospital reimbursements, another Obamacare provision that only went into effect once expanded coverage became available. Another Obamacare effect was the expiration of Medicaid bonus payments to physicians.

Finally, the shift toward Medicaid enrollment — again, due to Obamacare — has had an impact, since Medicaid pays providers less than private insurers, and because the newly covered are now more likely to seek out health care.

All told, these factors are holding down health-care inflation by 1.1 percentage points, and reducing core inflation — that is, PCE price index excluding energy and food — by about 0.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis, Phillips says.

But, health inflation should rise over the next few quarters, Phillips says.

For one, there’s not a lot of new public-sector health policy changes in store. Another factor is that wages in the sector are moving higher, notably at hospitals. And finally, state budgets have mostly healed. States — which by law must balance their budgets — pay for nearly half of Medicaid spending, and look to health when the going gets tough.
