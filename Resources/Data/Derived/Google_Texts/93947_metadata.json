There's also a free companion e-book for the teen boys themselves that was written with the help of about 200 boys Wiseman talked to around the country.\n\n\"I've worked with kids for 20 years,\" she said. \"I know that boys are much more complicated than we give them credit for. When we say things like boys are simple, it sends a message that they can never ask for help or tell us what's going on. Boys need support, and they need to know there are people who care about them who will help them.\"\n\nWiseman will be the featured speaker at Monday's kick-off event for Boulder Valley's Parent Engagement Network, which puts together a speaker series for parents every year. The Monday event will focus on bullying prevention and social competency.\n\nWiseman said she plans to address how to talk to boys, noting that parents tend to \"interrogate\" their boys when they see them at the end of the day. Instead, she said, they should give them some space and then talk, not pepper them with rapid-fire questions.\n\n(Courtesy photo) ( COURTESY )\n\nFriends ruthlessly insulting each other is part of the boy world, she said.\n\n\"If you can humiliate and go back at somebody as hard as possible, then that gives you power,\" she said.\n\nBut, she said, relentlessly degrading someone shouldn't be accepted.\n\nIn her work with schools, Wiseman said, engaged students require social connections, the hope of being successful with something they're curious about and being able to work on something that has meaning beyond themselves.\n\nCentaurus High School Principal Rhonda Haniford, whose school is hosting Wiseman's presentation, said she's interested in learning more about helping students, especially boys, navigate the challenges of the teen years.\n\n\"Finding real ways to talk with boys about the pressures they face is really important,\" she said.\n\nPaula Nelson, executive director of the Parent Engagement Network, said her group chose to feature Wiseman because \"she offers youth strategies to develop a positive and strong sense of self so that they can successfully navigate their world.\"\n\nShe said the presentation will be the basis for the group's work this school year, which will focus on understanding children's worlds. Future topics include creating safe and welcoming schools, suicide prevention and \"slow parenting.\"\n\nThe goal, Nelson said, is to \"promote conversations, build relationships, connect people to local and national resources, and empower people to take action.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_24191341/bestselling-author-talk-about-teen-boy-world", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:24191341:view"}, "startDate": "2013-09-28T22:37:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "If you go  \n\n What:  Parent Engagement Network presentation on \"Bully Prevention and Social Competency\" featuring Rosalind Wiseman \n\n When:  6:30 p.", "title": "Bestselling author to talk about teen boy world", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_24191341/bestselling-author-talk-about-teen-boy-world", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/0927/20130927__29dcapenw.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder Education & Schools", "modificationDate": "2013-09-28T22:40:07-0600", "endDate": "2023-09-28T22:37:00-0600", "news_keywords": "news information  boulder county schools elementary middle high preps", "byline": "By Amy Bounds", "pubDate": "2013-09-28T22:40:42-0600", "sailthru.date": "2013-09-28T22:37:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Bestselling author to talk about teen boy world", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/0927/20130927__29dcapenw_300.jpg", "description": "If you go  \n\n What:  Parent Engagement Network presentation on \"Bully Prevention and Social Competency\" featuring Rosalind Wiseman \n\n When:  6:30 p.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_24191341/bestselling-author-talk-about-teen-boy-world", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "If you go  \n\n What:  Parent Engagement Network presentation on \"Bully Prevention and Social Competency\" featuring Rosalind Wiseman \n\n When:  6:30 p.", "title": "Bestselling author to talk about teen boy world"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/0927/20130927__29dcapenw.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0da7\"", "article_summary": "There's also a free companion e-book for the teen boys themselves that was written with the help of about 200 boys Wiseman talked to around the country.\nShe's now delving into the social dynamics of teen boys with her new book, \"Masterminds and Wingmen\" that's No.\n\"Finding real ways to talk with boys about the pressures they face is really important,\" she said.\n(Courtesy photo) ( COURTESY )Friends ruthlessly insulting each other is part of the boy world, she said.\nShe said the presentation will be the basis for the group's work this school year, which will focus on understanding children's worlds."}
