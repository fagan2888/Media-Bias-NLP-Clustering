Gagliardi Sr., who served as New Jersey\u2019s education commissioner between 2000 and 2001, was selected from among 13 applicants to fill a vacancy on the troubled seven-member board and will be sworn in on Wednesday.\n\nOrdinarily, school boards choose an applicant when a vacancy arises suddenly. However, Ocean County Interim Superintendent of Schools Todd C. Flora made the selection because the six members of Brick\u2019s board could not agree on a candidate despite multiple votes spread across two meetings.\n\nFlora chose Gagliardi over John Talty, a popular former Brick school board member, and retired superintendent Thomas Gialanella, who led Jackson schools for more than a decade and Toms River schools between 2013 and 2014.\n\nGagliardi\u2019s career in education spans more than 50 years. In addition to his time as the state education commissioner, he worked as a teacher, principal, superintendent, a policy adviser to the state Senate, and a special assistant to the education commissioner in the late 1990s.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t intend to direct the board in any way,\u201d Gagliardi, 75, said of his selection. \u201cI would just like to serve the community because of my background.\u201d\n\nGagliardi will serve through the end of the year.\n\nThe board vacancy opened in April when Talty quit while recovering from heart surgery. Talty has since sought to rejoin the board.\n\nThe public relationship between Brick\u2019s board members has often turned hostile in the months following Superintendent Walter Uzsenski\u2019s arrest in May. Prosecutors allege Uzsenski was part of a scheme to get his grandson free preschool and transportation at taxpayers\u2019 expense.\n\nOther candidates to the board have said the vitriol stems from its use as a political stepping stone to the Township Council. Two current board members \u2014 Michael Conti and Frank Pannucci Jr. \u2014 are currently running for four-year terms on the council.\n\nGagliardi said he is free of local political affiliations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone on the board of education,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have an agenda.\u201d\n\nGagliardi will be sworn in Wednesday at a special meeting which will begin at 6:15 p.m. at Veterans Memorial Middle School, 105 Hendrickson Ave., Brick.\n\nAmanda Oglesby: 732-557-5701; aoglesby@GannettNJ.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
