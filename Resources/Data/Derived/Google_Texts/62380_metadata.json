As if you don\u2019t have enough to worry about, now you have to craft the perfect essay. This essay is going to be your chance to show your potential university who you are outside of your standardized test scores and your GPA. College admissions counselors read so many essays that it\u2019s crucial you pick a topic to make yours stand out, so avoid these clich\u00e9 ideas!\n\n1. Controversial Opinion Pieces\n\nIn college, you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to express your political and religious opinions. While it\u2019s great to be informed, your college application essay is not the place to share your views.\n\nAndrea Nadler, a college admissions counselor from Hofstra University, says that \u201cthere may be colleges who frown on it because you never know who is reading it, and this can be a subjective process.\u201d If your essay is about why Obamacare is the downfall of this country and your admissions counselor is a strict Democrat, you may have just spoiled your chances. The same idea applies to if you write about your Catholic beliefs, and your reader is Jewish.\n\nIf the topic is personal to you, you can write about it as long as you can do it without demonstrating extreme bias. For example, if the implementation of Obamacare changed your life in some way, you could write about it \u2013 as long as you could do so without attacking the opposing side. You want to appear passionate and strong, but not offensive.\n\nWhat to Write Instead :\n\nInstead of writing about a controversial topic that could spark anger in your reader, gear that passion towards something else. Any social issue could be an acceptable topic: drinking and driving, bullying, etc. Write about whatever you\u2019re passionate about without potentially causing offense.\n\n2. Listing All of Your Accomplishments\n\nYes, your college essay is obviously supposed to be about you; however, that doesn\u2019t mean it should be a self-loving piece about all the accomplishments you\u2019ve made.\n\n\u201cListing accomplishments is what the resume/activity sheet should do,\u201d Nadler says. \u201cThe essay should focus on one aspect or facet of their life\u2014something not otherwise known from the other pieces of the application.\u201d\n\nThe admissions officers have your resume already; they know what you\u2019ve done. Use this opportunity to show your future university who you are beyond the qualifications written on paper.\n\nWhat to Write Instead :\n\nSo you were the cheerleading captain, first chair in your school\u2019s band and on student council? Pick the accomplishment you have achieved that means the most to you. What skills did you gain from it? What lessons did you learn? Taking a situation and explaining what you got out of it will show your university what you can offer to them.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 10 De-stressing Apps 10 De-stressing Apps\n\n1 of 10 GPS For The Soul Huffington Post's new app GPS for the Soul is based on two basic principles : 1) that we all have a place of peace and harmony within us, and 2) that we repeatedly veer away from that place.
