If the fortysomethings in the office all arrive with ear buds and the volume turned up just slightly louder than tasteful, well, maybe everyone was cranking the Belle & Sebastian too loud on the F train from Brooklyn. Middle-age, wasted on the middle-aged and all.\n\nSleater-Kinney\u2019s return might have the loudest buzz, but the Decemberists are following up a No. 1 album. They took a multi-year hiatus after the triumphant \u201cThe King Is Dead,\u201d and \u201cWhat A Terrible World, What A Beautiful World\u201d is the Portland collective\u2019s first since 2011. Colin Meloy and his wife Carson Ellis had a second son during that hiatus, and also added second and third books to their popular young-adult fantasy series, Wildwood.\n\nThough Meloy clearly didn\u2019t rest much, this was his first extended break from the band in a decade \u2014 and perhaps with the books to feed the wild narrative side of his brain, the side that has delighted in sea shanties and historical odes and proggy concept albums, let alone the most literary set of characters and rhymes in indie-rock \u2014 the new album feels as direct, personal and tuneful as anything he\u2019s done.\n\nSalon caught up with Meloy late last month to talk about the terrific new album, indie nostalgia, pop songs about oral sex, and being 17 and terminally fey.\n\nSo there\u2019s a break of several years after \u201cThe King Is Dead.\u201d You go off and write young-adult novels and have another child \u2014 and you return with side one, track one \u2014 \u201cThe Singer Addresses His Audience,\u201d and sing \u201cWe know you built your lives around us. And would we change? We had to change some.\u201d How tongue in cheek are we to take this ? Or is this a statement from Colin Meloy?\n\nThis is a real statement. (laughs) It can be both things. And to be honest, I had kind of written it intending it to be. I mean, of course, it is a reflection of my trying to make sense of the relationship between singers or entertainers and their audience, but also I wanted to try and write in the voice of what I imagined was, like, the lead singer of a boy band who was just trying to figure it all out \u2014 who had never known any other life other than being onstage and being the sort of property of a fan base. How would they sort of view their lives and live their lives? But then, you know, of course its populated with my own weird ideas about what that relationship is. But in the end, it\u2019s a different character as opposed to myself, and it\u2019s an exploration of the loneliness of the singer, and why did they do this in the first place \u2014 sacrifice or give themselves up to the needs and the expectations of people who don\u2019t know them, complete strangers \u2014 and construct their lives and the decisions they make creatively around what those expectations might be. And in the end, they do belong to them\u2013 it\u2019s kind of this idea of possessiveness. They don\u2019t necessarily belong to themselves. But the reason the singer was even doing it in the first place was just really like the refrain in the end: \u201cto belong, to belong.\u201d\n\nHad you felt that paradox when The Decemberists would change \u2014 and there were lots of changes over the years, from 17-minute songs to prog-rock concept albums and then jangle-rock perfection \u2014 that there was resistance from people who wanted you to keep you writing the same kinds of songs on \u201cCastaways and Cutouts\u201d? And that you had found a way to belong, but also had to change?\n\nRight. I don\u2019t know that I was very much aware of it. I think I was just kind of following whims. Maybe it would\u2019ve behooved me to pay a little bit more attention to what people wanted of me.\n\nYou really should\u2019ve spent more time in those old AOL Decemberists chat rooms, or on the indie-pop list.\n\nI know. If only I had spent more time hearing criticism! I think also I have a weird thing about kicking against expectations in a sometimes self-destructive way. (laughs) I guess I myself am trying to figure out where I exist between those two ideas \u2014 between satisfying my own creative needs and the creative needs of others. Kind of like a sexual thing. (laughs)\n\nWe\u2019ll get back to the sexual thing! But there\u2019s also a funny line in this song about selling your songs for advertisements: \u201cWhen your bridal processional is a televised confessional to the benefits of Axe Shampoo, you know we did it for you.\u201d Have you heard from the fine folks at Axe yet? Can they spin this into viral gold?\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know that they would. It\u2019s really not a positive spin.\n\nAnd people might look at photos of The Decemberists in those Pacific Northwest outfits and think, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s not who we want shilling our sweet-smelling teen body wash.\u201d\n\n(laughs) Right. Right. Exactly.\n\nOne of the other centerpieces, the song which gives the album its title, is the Sandy Hook song, \u201c12/17/12.\u201d It sounds like a truly personal reaction, as if you wrote this as an emotional pouring-out, trying to make sense of this at a time when children were on your mind.\n\nYeah. Hank was a first-grader, so he was the same age as those kids. And there was even one kid who was an autistic kid, and Hank is autistic. The closer you can map your own life onto these things \u2014 is that what makes them real? There\u2019s something really superficial about that.\n\nSo I\u2019m hesitant to say that this is any kind of centerpiece because I don\u2019t think it is. And in fact, I didn\u2019t initially want to put too much of a point on the fact that it was written about that incident because I didn\u2019t feel as if I could really communicate what was happening. I don\u2019t know that I have any place trying to write a song that\u2019s directly about what happened. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in my powers. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m good enough.\n\nI think that that was just what a lot of people did at that time, and I think it wasn\u2019t until hearing the names read\u2026 It took several days to process. I feel like when the names were read at that press conference, suddenly I was able to start processing it in a way that I think was helpful, in that I think a lot of people were taking stock of their own surroundings in their own world. I was doing that and wanting to bring my family closer to me and bring in the protective embrace \u2014 but then also feeling sort of unmoored from what that pain must be for someone else.\n\nIt almost seems staggering the first songs have arrived, and that the responses from artists and from the culture, these two years later, are faster than the political responses \u2014 which have been next to none, really.\n\nYeah. And even maybe moving in the other direction, I think that the other side has been so entrenched. That\u2019s another story all together. It\u2019s been really frustrating.\n\nI\u2019m going to make the world\u2019s most awful segue and shift from that song to \u201cPhilomena,\u201d which appears to be the Decemberists\u2019 ode to oral sex. \u201cOpen up your linen lap and let me go down.\u201d I wasn\u2019t an English major, but I think I might know what that means. Your attempt at an AC/DC song?\n\n(laughs) You are not mistaken. I think this is my attempt of making a portrait \u2014 a bundling idea of what human sexuality is and could be. It started out as this very innocent chord progression and a melody that was so pristine and \u201850s innocent that it felt like it needed to be dirtied up significantly, and out came the dirtiest Decemberists song ever written.\n\nIt just might be. I mean, \u201cI\u2019ll be your lashing loop of leatherette\u201d?\n\nI know.\n\nBawdy stuff, Colin Meloy.\n\nBawdy stuff through like, the eyes of a 12-year-old, discovering what it is to be a sexual person.\n\nBut 12-year-olds are not opening linen laps. How did you personally discover those terms in song? I think back to camp counselors playing AC/DC songs in the summer of 1980. But then there\u2019s Quiet Riot, and we totally sang that in the backseat of the car somehow without knowing exactly what it meant. It\u2019s still horrifying to think about it.
