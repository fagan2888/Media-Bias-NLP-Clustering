The Arizona Housing Forum, now in its 11th year and presented by the Arizona Department of Housing, recently concluded with an awards presentation at the JW Marriott Starr Pass Resort in Tucson, Arizona, where the Pascua Yaqui Tribe were honored.

In total seven awards were distributed to recipients of the 2014 Brian Mickelsen Housing Hero Awards in categories based on efforts to support affordable housing for moderate and low-income Arizona families. The Pascua Yaqui Tribe received the Tribal Initiatives Award. The award was bestowed on the 17,000-member tribe for its success in completing two projects totaling 96 unites in less than three years. Known as Pascua Yaqui Homes II and IV add 40 new units along with over 70 rehabilitated units.

Tribal needs for housing in Arizona are especially high, where the average household size for the state is 2.66 persons, on the reservation the average is 5 persons. These 96 units will put a small dent in the more than 500 households currently on a waiting list for housing. Pascua Yaqui Homes II and IV offer a mix of three, four and five bedroom single-family homes to help address overcrowding issues.

“The Pascua Yaqui Tribe has succeeded in providing their lowest income residents with safe and affordable homes while preserving the tribe’s rich history and tradition. It can charge minimal rent to its impoverished residents and still utilize a very secure financing structure. The tribe’s achievements serve as a source of hope and an example to other tribes,” an Arizona Department of Housing release said announcing the awards.
