William Kendall.\n\nReno County District Judge Timothy Chambers said Friday the additional term might not make any difference on whether the 37-year-old inmate ever gets out of prison. He said the new sentence sends a message that such attacks have real consequences.\n\nKendall told Wilkerson he's not angry, though he sometimes gets upset over things he can no longer do.\n\nWilkerson has spent the last three years in solitary confinement because of the attack.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dajuan Wilkerson was convicted in August of attempted second-degree murder in the July 2010 attack on former Sgt.
