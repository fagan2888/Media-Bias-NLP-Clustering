He added that the program\u2019s administrator, Helen Clark\u2019s response to his warnings were \u201cdisturbingly ambiguous\u201d and reinforced his position that her agency \u201cis not taking a proactive approach to oversight of this important reconstruction fund.\"\n\nClark\u2019s agency, was forced under the spotlight last year after The Wall Street Journal reported that a U.N. internal investigation confirmed there was fraud in the program.\n\n\"The fact that procurement fraud occurred and continued undetected for so long was only possible due to the failure of UNDP management, in particular the country office, to provide the necessary oversight, guidance, support and quality assurance to the LOFTA project and staff,\" the report said.\n\nThough the agency dismissed some employees and put others on administrative leave, Sopko says the UN still fails to provide oversight over the program.\n\nIn a response to SIGAR, Clark argued that LOTFA had been scrutinized for things that it has no obligation to oversee.\n\nRelated: Afghanistan: No End in Sight to America\u2019s Longest War\n\n\u201cLOTFA\u2026 has no institutional mandate to conduct auditing and investigation of MoIA (the Ministry of Interior of Afghanistan); she added that \u201cLOTFA does not exercise direct actions of control and oversight [of pension funds] due to the mandate of the LOTFA project itself\u2026.\u201d\n\nSIGAR disagreed and said that UNDP has \u201ca duty to oversee the expenditure of LOTFA funds and to ensure that donor money is spent for its intended purposes rather than attempting to shift blame for LOTFA shortcomings.\u201d\n\nThe auditors are scheduled to meet with the UN agency next week to further discuss their findings.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Mismanagement and lax oversight at the United Nations agency in charge of administerin", "title": "The UN Can\u2019t Account for How $200 Million in Afghan Aid Was Spent", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/06/UN-Can-t-Account-How-200-Million-Afghan-Aid-Was-Spent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08092013_Afghan_Trucks_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/06/UN-Can-t-Account-How-200-Million-Afghan-Aid-Was-Spent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08092013_Afghan_Trucks_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Mismanagement and lax oversight at the United Nations agency in charge of administerin", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Last year, the Defense Department\u2019s Inspector General found that the Afghan Ministry of Interior \u201ccould not account for $17.4 million in pension withholdings and $9.9 million in cooperative fund withholdings\u201d according to SIGAR.\nSopko\u2019s letter paints a disturbing picture of hundreds of millions of dollars going out the door\u2014paying for inflated police salaries, potential \u201cghost employees\u201d and questionable \u201cdeductions\u201d to the Afghan Ministry of Interior.\nNow, U.S. auditors are once again sounding the alarm on the UN Development Program for not being able to account for more than $200 million from the Afghanistan Law and Order Trust Fund known as LOFTA.\nIn his letter, Sopko faulted the U.N. agency for not providing proper oversight over the multi-billion dollar fund.\nMismanagement and lax oversight at the United Nations agency in charge of administering billions of dollars in aid to the Afghan Police force has left tax dollars vulnerable to fraud and abuse for years."}
