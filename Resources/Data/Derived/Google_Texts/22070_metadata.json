But these operators soon could be seeing more opportunities to expand their footprints by purchasing \u2014 if they\u2019re willing and able to navigate the more complex types of deals around distressed properties.\n\nFinancial distress is increasing in the health care sector \u2014 including senior housing \u2014 even as bankruptcies have fallen sharply across U.S. industries as a whole, attorney Bobby Guy, a shareholder in the health care practice at Kansas City, Missouri-based firm Polsinelli, tells SHN.\n\nWhile acquiring these properties has historically been the province of a relatively small \u201cdistress community,\u201d they present a \u201csignificant strategic opportunity\u201d that should not be overlooked by the development departments of senior living operators, including smaller players, Guy says.\n\nHealth care reform and market forces make it likely that financial distress will continue to increase in the seniors housing space, so providers looking to grow through acquisitions could see a more inviting playing field, experts tell SHN. The takeaway? Now is the time to develop the right skills for this game.\n\nWinners and losers\n\nThe fact that financial distress in on the rise in seniors housing is not a secret. Guy\u2019s former firm, Frost Brown Todd, has published a \u201cDistress Index\u201d showing the development of this trend over the past three quarters.\n\nThe latest edition of the Index, for the fourth quarter of 2014, showed that Chapter 11 filings in the health care services sector continued on an upward trend. Among all Index-measured Chapter 11 filings, health care filings increased from 1.1% in 2010 to 3.8% in the latest report.\n\n\u201cWe have not made a determination yet as to the causes of why the health care index is climbing,\u201d he explains.\n\nHowever, he notes that the industry is seeing sweeping changes and increased pressures, both legal and competitive, due to a variety of factors. These include the Affordable Care Act and the evolution of health care technologies.\n\nProviders that can adapt to these changes \u2014 such as by partnering with larger health systems \u2014 are emerging as winners, while the losers may be struggling financially and ultimately entering Chapter 11, Guy surmises.\n\nThe health care services part of the index includes hospitals as well as senior care settings, and Frost Brown Todd has not broken out those individual sectors. However, it is likely that a \u201cfairly high percentage\u201d of the bankruptcy filings come from across the spectrum of seniors housing, Guy says.\n\nContinuing care retirement communities in particular continue to face financial distress challenges, which they\u2019ve encountered ever since the economic crisis made it difficult for prospective residents to tap into their home equity to pay for high entrance fees, says Louis E. Robichaux, principal at consulting firm Deloitte Transactions and Business Analytics LLP.\n\nAlthough Robichaux believes the market may be returning for CCRCs, for years they have had to pursue creative strategies to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nSkilled nursing facilities also are facing performance challenges as they try to adapt to a post-ACA world, Robichaux says. He does not see financial distress or bankruptcy as a particular issue for assisted living providers.\n\nHowever, given that health care reform aims to more closely align providers across the whole continuum of care, it\u2019s likely that every type of provider will need to make changes \u2014 or face potentially unsustainable balance sheets.\n\n\u201cWe would anticipate some uptick [in bankruptcies] across the seniors housing market as the change separates the winners from the losers,\u201d Guy explains.\n\nA REIT end-run\n\nAs a senior living provider nears or enters bankruptcy, it becomes an acquisition prospect \u2014 so more providers in Chapter 11 or heading that way means more potential targets for buyers.\n\n\u201cChapter 11 is always an acquisition opportunity,\u201d Guy says.\n\nIn particular, these properties could be ripe for the picking for the smaller and mid-sized operators and owners that have not been able to compete with large-cap real estate investment trusts (REITs) in terms of acquisitions, as per-unit prices in seniors housing have reached such high levels that it has led to talk of a bubble.\n\n\u201cDistressed, underperforming properties that may or may not be on the verge of bankruptcy are not attractive to the REITs and funds going after stabilized [properties],\u201d says Rick Shamberg, co-managing partner of Cerulean Partners, a venture capital-backed real estate investment firm specializing in acquiring and developing undervalued senior living properties. He also is a consultant to both private equity firm Chicago Pacific Founders and senior living developer Grace Management.\n\nWhile even Fortune 500-size companies go after distressed properties, Guy also emphasizes that \u201cthere\u2019s a pricing opportunity\u201d there for mid-market buyers. However, there\u2019s still plenty of reason to proceed with caution, he advises.\n\nHigh risk, high reward\n\nAcquiring a distressed property is not to be undertaken lightly, Guy, Robichaux and Shamberg agree.\n\n\u201cDistressed health care acquisitions are highly specialized,\u201d Guys says. \u201cIt\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea.\u201d\n\nTo execute this type of deal and come out a winner demands due diligence, he emphasizes. This stands to reason \u2014 the property mostly likely was distressed for a number of reasons and these may not all be revealed without some digging. For example, financials may be inaccurate, as sellers sometimes believe they own items they don\u2019t, and liabilities that they believed were small actually turn out to be much larger.\n\nThere also could be legal issues behind a bankruptcy. Take the case of California-based North American Health Care, a skilled nursing operator which has sought Chapter 11 protection due to being faced with multiple quality of care lawsuits. Its bankruptcy attracted attention from The New York Times.\n\nSome suggest that providers such as North American Health Care are subpar operators taking advantage of Chapter 11 to escape legal consequences and sell off buildings, while others argue that this is not a new or underhanded tactic, and that it may represent a responsible strategy to preserve as much value as possible for stakeholders in the enterprise.\n\nBankruptcy also is a public process, so properties that actually have entered Chapter 11 go through a public bidding process. This means that an organization could sink significant resources on the potential acquisition and still not come away with the prize, Guy notes.\n\n\u201cMedicare has become more strict on forcing a buyer to take all of the exposure when you transfer \u2026 you get all the liabilities, if there were civil money penalties or overpayments to repay,\u201d Robichaux adds. \u201cThere are only so many things you can do in bankruptcy to scrub those things off.\u201d\n\nBeing strategic about which opportunities to pursue is essential, Shamberg says. There are multiple variables to consider when determining whether a distressed property can be turned around.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be thoughtful about the property\u2019s location and unit mix, ask if it\u2019s functionally obsolete, think about how much capital expenditure is it going to take to make it competitive in the marketplace,\u201d he says.\n\nEven after weighing all these factors, there\u2019s not a surefire formula for success.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an art more than science,\u201d Shamberg says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at each project as its own animal.\u201d\n\nDespite these challenges, there\u2019s a reason why this type of acquisition remains attractive: The potential rewards justify the risks.\n\nFirst, buyers are afforded certain valuable legal protections if they are acquiring a Chapter 11 property, Guy explains. For example, the buyer may be able to pick and choose contracts it wants to retain. The buyer also generally does not have legal successor liability, which means that the creditors of the distressed seller cannot come after the buyer for debts owed.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the return on investment if the property can be turned around.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal case, you buy something for $5 million, put $2 million in, you\u2019re all in for say $7 million, you fill it up, raise the rates, put a new name on it, come to market with a fresh concept and energy, and three to five years later you\u2019ve got a $12 million building,\u201d Shamberg says, offering ballpark figures that he believes are reasonable for the current market. \u201cThat\u2019s a really nice return.\u201d\n\nAt that point, the building becomes attractive to the REIT or private equity market, he notes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen assets that were financially challenged, highly difficult assets for the seller become the flagship asset in the portfolio of the buyer,\u201d Guy says.\n\nConsidering this potential, these types of deals could \u2014 and perhaps should \u2014 be appealing to a wider pool of buyers.\n\n\u201cDistressed health care acquisitions are a specialized area, but are not only for a small cadre of players,\u201d Guy says. \u201cThey\u2019re a growth opportunity for many operators in the industry, but they need to go in prepared, with eyes wide open.\u201d\n\nWritten by Tim Mullaney", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "cerulean partners, chicago pacific founders, deloitte, frost brown todd, grace management, north american health care, polsinelli, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "Mid-sized senior living providers that are looking to grow have opted to build rather than buy lately, in part because they\u2019ve been priced out of the acquisition market.
