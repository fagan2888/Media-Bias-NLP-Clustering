A man and his daughter say they encountered a whale about 10:30 a.m. Sunday morning off the Lavallette coast.

Howie Allen, of Lavallette, and his daughter, Paige Allen, were out in a kayak near Reese Avenue in Lavallette when Howie said they saw what he believes was a humpback whale. When the family first spotted the whale, it was about 150 yards away, but according to Allen it came within 30 feet of the kayak.
