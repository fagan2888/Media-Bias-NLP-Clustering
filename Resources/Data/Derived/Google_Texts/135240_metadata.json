Thing was, on Saturday the trails were good to go \u2014 high and dry next to a river made mighty in recent weeks by strong rains that have broken the drought\u2019s five-year stranglehold on Dallas and the state.\n\nBut today the floodway is yet again flooded: The National Weather Service says the Trinity is at 35.67 feet at the time of this posting \u2014 more than five feet above minor flood stage \u2014 on its way to a projected 39 feet, which puts it between moderate and major flooding. Our media partners at KXAS-Channel 5 grabbed us aerial look-see below this morning \u2014 one in a series, I guess.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, that is a long way from levee-topping. That happens at 62 feet. Still: If they ever do built the Trinity River toll road along the east levee, city officials might think about investing in new-car lots filled with these.
