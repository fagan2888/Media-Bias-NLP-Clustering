COLORADO SPRINGS — A tow for illegal parking led to gunfire and a car chase through downtown early Saturday and police are still hunting for the gunman.

Police say a tow truck driver put his hook on a Jeep Cherokee downtown just after 4 a.m. when a man claiming to be the owner came up and tried to talk his way out of the tow. The tow truck driver declined the man’s pleas and hauled the Jeep to an impound lot.

A short time later, a station wagon pulled up to the impound lot involved in the incident and someone opened up with a rifle, firing as many as four bullets.

The station wagon sped away, but had the tow truck on its tail, police said.
