In fact, every day we hear from family caregivers like Nancy.\n\nWayne from Connecticut cares for his wife: \u201cAlthough I find caregiving a labor of love, my main need is periodical respite.\u201d\n\nMarilyn from Pennsylvania cared for her mother: \u201cIt was a 24/7/365 job\u2026 I spent every waking hour with her.\u201d\n\nLuz from the Virgin Islands cares for both her parents: \u201cI\u2019ve retired so that I could move back and assist and now I take care of my parents 24/7\u2026 I don\u2019t take breaks. I\u2019d have to have someone take care of them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, AARP fought in states across the country to ensure that respite care programs \u2014 such as adult day services or periodic visits in the home \u2014 are available for family caregivers in their communities. These programs help family caregivers to take a break so they have the strength, energy and spirit to carry on. While several states increased funding for respite care services, it is clear more needs to be done.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving\n\nTo all the family caregivers out there, this year, I\u2019m thankful for you; thank you for all that you do each and every day. I wish you and your families a happy and safe Thanksgiving, one that also includes some time to take care of you.\n\nOrganize and privately share info with family and caregivers \u2014 AARP\u2019s Caregiving App \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019re a family caregiver, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nTo stay up to date or to get involved with AARP\u2019s caregiving advocacy in the states, sign up for the AARP Advocates e-newsletter or visit your state Web page .\n\nor visit your .
