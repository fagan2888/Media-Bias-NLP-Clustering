New census data shows that the number of people in poverty in Colorado hasn't budged a bit, even as unemployment declines and economists are waving goodbye to the recession. At 13 percent, the poverty rate is still above pre-recession levels and far above the poverty rate before the 2001 recession. Nearly 40 percent of Colorado's children live in households whose income is not sufficient to meet their basic needs. And funding for human services from the State of Colorado cannot fill the gap. These sorry facts make it important to vote Yes on issue 1B.

Boulder County voters passed a visionary mill levy in 2010 to shore up the safety net with a small increase in property taxes. The proceeds have made child care subsidies, housing assistance, health coverage, basic needs services and disaster relief available to thousands of people in need who would otherwise have been turned away. In some instances, those services helped people get back on their feet after a temporary setback. In other instances, those services prevented a family from becoming homeless or requiring more expensive interventions. Across the board, the services strengthened the fabric of Boulder County. Voters demonstrated in 2010 that we are a compassionate and welcoming community.

Advertisement It is time to extend that mill levy. Voting yes will not increase property taxes. It will continue the $21 increase on a $300,000 home approved in 2010.Voting yes on 1B will allow Boulder County's nonprofit agencies to serve more people. It will make us a stronger community. It is as simple as neighbors helping neighbors. It works!
