Muir is also a generation younger than the 55-year-old Williams and 57-year-old Pelley.\n\nMuir is already known well to \u201cWorld News\u201d viewers as Sawyer\u2019s chief sub, and, since the start of the year, he has anchored half as many weeknights (46) as Sawyer (92), according to news consultant Andrew Tyndall. Muir has groomed himself for the job since he was a child.\n\nAs a latchkey child of divorced parents growing up near Syracuse, Muir took comfort from the news \u201cfamily\u201d that appeared on his television each evening. He watched ABC\u2019s Peter Jennings, trying to guess who would be named \u201cperson of the week.\u201d At 12, he wrote to Syracuse anchorman Ron Curtis for advice on how to get into the business and had an internship at WTVH-TV by the next summer.\n\nMuir became so familiar that the newsroom had a spot on the wall to mark how much he\u2019d grown each year. When he was still at nearby Ithaca College, WTVH hired Muir to anchor the weekend news.\n\nAfter five years at WTVH, he moved on to Boston and, in 2003, came to ABC News. Hurricane Katrina was one of the first places his work attracted attention.\n\n\u201cAll of the elements of being a news anchor he does superbly,\u201d said David Westin, the ABC News president who hired Muir. He shows versatility in reporting, interviewing and working in the studio, he said.\n\nNetwork anchors traveling to stories used to be more commonplace, and when Westin appointed Bob Woodruff and Elizabeth Vargas to replace Jennings a decade ago, it was on the theory that at least one would be on the road regularly. It has become less frequent, in part because of costs. Muir considers the reporting an important part of his identity and, he believes, what viewers expect of him.\n\n\u201cThe evening news is evolving rapidly, and I think we have to be extraordinarily nimble,\u201d he said.\n\nThe dinnertime newscasts have been shadowed by predictions of their demise for about as long as Muir has been working. But each has seen its viewership increase over the past year. Muir, who frequently tweets during commercial breaks, said the programs\u2019 abilities to sum up the day\u2019s most important stories is valuable at a time people are bombarded with information.\n\nTyndall, whose website monitors the content of evening newscasts, said \u201cWorld News\u201d tends to be faster-paced with a higher story count when Muir is anchor. More than half of Muir\u2019s newscasts have nine or more reports with correspondents or interviews, compared to 29 percent for Sawyer. Muir resists the notion that he packs the broadcast with more material, but he said he wants to keep some things short so more important stories have room to breathe.\n\nMuir will start \u201cWorld News\u201d with a new executive producer, Almin Karamehmedovic, who he said shares \u201ca thirst to travel the world.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to judge at the start where a new anchor will take a broadcast. Westin likened it to a president appointing a new Supreme Court justice \u2013 the person may not turn out as liberal or conservative as was initially thought.\n\nTyndall\u2019s name is mud at ABC because of a report last winter criticizing the \u201cDisneyfication\u201d of \u201cWorld News,\u201d specifically a greater emphasis on consumer and entertainment news at the expense of global concerns.\n\n\u201cWhen I see reports like that or words like that, I think of the moment when I\u2019m standing in Tahrir Square with a producer and photographer and Mubarak\u2019s men come charging in on their horses with their whips,\u201d Muir said. \u201cOr when we were in Mogadishu and were fired upon by forces linked to al-Qaida.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019d be very hard-pressed to tell them that what we\u2019re doing out there is \u2018soft.\u201d\u2019\n\nMuir\u2019s role will be slightly different than that of his predecessor; ABC said. George Stephanopoulos will be the network\u2019s main anchor on breaking news reports. Muir said that\u2019s fine, and it ties into his desire not to always be deskbound.\n\nHe recently unearthed the letter that the Syracuse anchorman sent back to the advice-seeking 12-year-old, which today sounds prescient.\n\n\u201cCompetition in television news is keen,\u201d Curtis wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s always room for the right person. It could be you.\u201d\n\nDavid Bauder can be reached at dbauder(at)ap.org or on Twitter(at)dbauder.
