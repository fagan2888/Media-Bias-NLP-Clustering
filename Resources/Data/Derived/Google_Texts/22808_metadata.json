He bashed the Scott Administration for the Governor\u2019s request earlier this year to order state health officials to audit more than 100 hospitals as part of his ongoing battle with those facilities, which the governor said was driving up Medicaid costs.\n\n\u201cAnd what have we found at this point?\u201d asked Narain. \u201cAbsolutely nothing. So political theater is taking place in the state of Florida.\u201d\n\nCruz, who also represents parts of Tampa, agreed, saying that the public hospitals are \u201cunder attack,\u201d and said it reminded her of previous attacks on the public schools in Florida.\n\n\u201cWhere they\u2019re looking at this big pot of dollars and moving to voucher programs and charter schools,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to move away from the public hospitals that in my opinion serve the uninsured and the underinsured. The move is to privatize, and the hospitals are next.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the Governor created the Commission on Healthcare and Hospital Funding and directed it to examine the rate of return on tax dollars used for Medicaid. That panel was blasted as being biased, with only one of the nine appointees an actual physician (Gainesville microsurgeon Jason Rosenberg).\n\nIn September, Scott said he wanted to help Floridians to fight against unfair hospital prices by requiring hospitals to post their prices and average payments, along with their annual IRS reports, in an easily accessible location on their website. He also proposed to create additional protections by allowing the referral of any suspected hospital price gouging to the appropriate law enforcement agency or regulatory authority.\n\nBut he hasn\u2019t had much help in acquiring a sponsor in the Legislature for such a proposal.\n\nAlthough Cruz, Narain and Republican state house member Jamie Grant, the third member of the panel who participated in the Tampa Bay Healthcare Collaborative on Wednesday, all said that Medicaid expansion was dead for 2016, it didn\u2019t stop the partisan attacks that have been part and parcel of the debate for years in Florida.\n\nAmong the House Republicans talking points in opposing Medicaid expansion has been their contention that the state\u2019s existing Medicaid program already provides a safety net for low-income children, pregnant women, elderly and disabled people. Grant says Medicaid expansion would have come at expense of kids and the elderly.\n\n\u201cIf the question is to provide health care to a larger population that overwhelmingly was made up of able bodied men who chose not to work and didn\u2019t have children, and we were going to pay for it by taking health care from kids and the medically needy, that\u2019s never, ever ever going to pass the Florida House,\u201d Grant said.\n\nCruz immediately responded that she didn\u2019t like speaking after Grant because \u201che\u2019s so bright and so eloquent \u2013 but he\u2019s wrong here.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the Medicaid population is sick children and lots of very sick children,\u201d Cruz said. It is a sad day in the state Legislature that we refuse to offer care to working families. \u2026it\u2019s an atrocity, and it\u2019s wrong, and we have a budget surplus in a $76 billion budget. We still refuse to provide some kind of care for our working families. It\u2019s just wrong, it\u2019s wrong that we didn\u2019t and we don\u2019t expand healthcare coverage in Florida.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have too many people in this state that, when they think of the doctor, they\u2019re thinking of the ER,\u201d added Narain.\n\nGrant is director of national markets for CareSync, an app and website that allow people to store and control their medical records online. His background in health care was apparent as he expounded effortlessly on his opinions regarding various aspects of the industry.\n\nHe kicked off the conversation by boldly stating that the traditional fee-for-service model of paying for health care was on the way out, to be value-based-care. \u201cFee-for-service is going to die,\u201d he said. \u201cThe days for performed service, get paid for that service a set amount is going away.\u201d\n\nGrant said that was a move led by the federal government, and Florida has nothing to do with that. He said what the Legislature could do to augment that would be to allow for more price transparency in health care. \u201cThere\u2019s zero reason that a hospital or a health system should be getting data from AHCA (Florida Agency for Health Care Administration) that\u2019s a year or two years old. It\u2019s 2015, it\u2019s about to 2016. It\u2019s laughable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Florida Governor Rick Scott has been targeting\u00a0the\u00a0Florida public hospital industry for much of this year, after the Florida Hospital Association made a strong pitch for the Legislature to expand Medicaid\u00a0under the\u00a0Affordable Care Act, a push that failed for the third straight year in Tallahassee, and after the federal government announced deep cuts in hospital funding \u2026", "title": "Tampa house Democrats blast Scott administration's investigation into public hospitals - Florida Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://floridapolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/unnamed-8-1-e1449708967220.jpg", "height": 425}, "updated_time": "2015-12-09T19:56:14-04:00", "url": "http://floridapolitics.com/archives/196377-tampa-house-democrats-blast-scott-administrations-investigation-into-public-hospitals", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/flpolitics", "section": "Headlines", "tag": "scroll", "published_time": "2015-12-09T15:36:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-09T19:56:14-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1643817879175164}, "twitter": {"description": "Florida Governor Rick Scott has been targeting\u00a0the\u00a0Florida public hospital industry for much of this year, after the Florida Hospital Association made a strong pitch for the Legislature to expand Medicaid\u00a0under the\u00a0Affordable Care Act, a push that failed for the third straight year in Tallahassee, and after the federal government announced deep cuts in hospital funding [\u2026]", "title": "Tampa house Democrats blast Scott administration's investigation into public hospitals - Florida Politics", "image": "http://floridapolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/unnamed-8-1-e1449708967220.jpg", "creator": "@Fla_Pol", "site": "@Fla_Pol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He said what the Legislature could do to augment that would be to allow for more price transparency in health care.\nHis background in health care was apparent as he expounded effortlessly on his opinions regarding various aspects of the industry.\nHe kicked off the conversation by boldly stating that the traditional fee-for-service model of paying for health care was on the way out, to be value-based-care.\nNarain is a freshman elected a year ago in the House District 61 which encompasses much of the urban corridors of Tampa.\n\u201cThey want to move away from the public hospitals that in my opinion serve the uninsured and the underinsured."}
