CANNES, France (AP) — Todd Haynes’ 1950s lesbian romance “Carol,” with Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, had the Cannes Film Festival swooning after its premiere.

The long-in-development adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel was received rapturously at Cannes for its tale of an illicit love between two women amid conservative ’50s New York. Speaking to reporters Sunday, Blanchett said “Carol” is more than a period piece.

“We’re living in deeply conservative times,” said Blanchett. “And if we think otherwise, then we’re very foolish.”

Blanchett noted that in many countries around the world, homosexuality is still illegal. She also added her voice to the growing chorus over sexism is Hollywood.

“It’s important to keep talking about it,” said Blanchett. “It fell of the agenda and I think we lost a lot of ground.”
