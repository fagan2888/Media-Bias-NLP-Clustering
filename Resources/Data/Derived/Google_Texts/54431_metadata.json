Regarding the Boulder Canyon climb, \u201cHills are actually my strong point,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019m so light weight.\u201d\n\n(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)\n\nHis steed is a custom bike that took nine months to put together. Brown, who lives in Rockville, Maryland, started bicycling February 2012. Brown was injured (\u201cblown up,\u201d he said) on his third deployment in Afghanistan, in February 2011.\n\nHe picked up bicycling as a means of exercise. Swimming wasn\u2019t an option, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s a great way to deal with stress,\u201d Brown said. That\u2019s not to mention the physical benefits: \u201cYou get in shape, and chicks like you more when you\u2019re in shape.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s with two other riders on this trip, all Ride The Rockies first-timers.\n\nFast forward to day three, a ride looping to the west of Steamboat Springs. It\u2019s the shortest day yet of the ride at 54 miles and 3,831\u2032 of elevation gain.\n\nHere are photos from today\u2019s seven-hour ride.\n\n\n\n(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)\n\n(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)\n\n(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)\n\n(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)\n\n(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)\n\n(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)\n\n(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ride the Rockies", "description": "When you meet a triple-amputee riding up Boulder Canyon two hours into your first day of Ride The Rockies, your on-bike challenges feel smaller.", "title": "Ride the Rockies 2014, Day Three: Triple-amputee Tim Brown rides custom bike", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/2014/06/10/ride-rockies-2014-day-three/2452/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/files/2014/06/20140610-173630.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "When you meet a triple-amputee riding up Boulder Canyon two hours into your first day of Ride The Rockies, your on-bike challenges feel smaller.", "creator": "@denverpostjoe", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/2014/06/10/ride-rockies-2014-day-three/2452/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/files/2014/06/20140610-173630.jpg", "title": "Ride the Rockies 2014, Day Three: Triple-amputee Tim Brown rides custom bike", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "When you meet a triple-amputee riding up Boulder Canyon two hours into your first day of Ride The Rockies, your on-bike challenges feel smaller."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbf6\"", "article_summary": "(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)\nWhen you meet a triple-amputee riding up Boulder Canyon two hours into your first day of Ride The Rockies, your on-bike challenges feel smaller.\nTim Brown, the 30-year-old former Marine, is pushing himself across Ride The Rockies\u2019 six-day, 471-mile route with his left arm and his right shoulder.\n\u201cI\u2019m so light weight.\u201d(Joe Murphy, The Denver Post)His steed is a custom bike that took nine months to put together.\nRegarding the Boulder Canyon climb, \u201cHills are actually my strong point,\u201d Brown said."}
