“Most people who have a sore throat do not get a CT scan,” Henry said.

“Most people are not the president of the United States,” Earnest quipped.

Earnest added that he wasn’t a “medical professional” but pointed out that Obama’s doctors felt that it was necessary.

Earnest also explained during the briefing that Obama’s sore throat was “a minor but persistent problem” and that the decision to travel to Walter Reed for a CT scan was only a “matter of prudence.”

The final diagnosis turned out to be the result of acid reflux, according to a doctor’s statement provided by the White House to reporters.
