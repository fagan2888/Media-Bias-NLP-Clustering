COLUMBIA, SC (WACH) - South Carolina Democrats are calling for legislative action to adopt Medicaid Expansion.

Wednesday, a panel in Orangeburg discussed the importance of expansion to the state.

"We are all so locked in on saying the words expand medicaid; I'm more concerned about access to care and people getting covered," said House Representative, Gilda Cobb-Hunter.

South Carolina is one of more than a dozen states refusing to expand medicaid under the affordable care act, creating a large number of people who are not covered.

Out of the roughly 200,000 people in South Carolina that uninsured and living in poverty, more than 30,000 are living in the Midlands, according to South Carolina Hospital Association spokesperson.

Opponents have argued that spending money to expand what they call a broken medicaid system is not the best way to improve people's health.

Congressman Jim Clyburn said he hopes state lawmakers will take up the issue next legislation session.

"I think it's a fundamental basic right that everyone born in America should have accessibly, affordable quality heath care," Clyburn said.
