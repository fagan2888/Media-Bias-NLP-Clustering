The next most-active industry, technology/media/telecom category, saw 62% forecasting corporate marriages in the next year.\n\nNext up was energy/oil and gas sector at 36%, then consumer markets at 34%, followed by manufacturing at 24%.\n\n\u201cWe see a convergence of factors facing providers, health plans, and drug and device makers that are forcing them to make tough decisions about strategy and those decisions sometimes entail selling the business,\u201d Bill Baker, an advisory partner in KPMG\u2019s health-care practice, said in a prepared statement.\n\nOverall, the technology sector ranked higher than several components of the health-care sector. The survey said 47% of respondents saw technology as the most active segment, while 33% saw the pharmaceutical/biotechnology sector as the most active.\n\nOil and gas came in third, while health-care providers were fourth, with 27% of those surveyed predicting mergers in that sector.\n\nKPMG said the biggest driver for health-care sector M&A in 2015 will likely be the Affordable Care Act, but a jump in patent expirations for many drug companies was also seen as a potential driver of merger activity for that part of the industry.\n\nOverall, the report says momentum for mergers is building, with 82% of those surveyed saying they planned at least one purchase next year. It said 19% plan at least two acquisitions.\n\n\u201cM&A in the U.S. has finally reached pre-recession levels,\u201d the report said.
