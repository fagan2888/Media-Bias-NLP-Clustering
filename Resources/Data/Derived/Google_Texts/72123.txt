Weaver Lola Cody, Navajo, has won the Best of Show award at the 2014 Santa Fe Indian Market for a massive rug that interim COO Dallin Maybee calls "incredibly impressive." The process of selecting the piece that will receive the show's top honor usually requires a few rounds of voting, but Cody's creation was picked on the first vote.

The 8' x 13'8" wool rug took two years to make, and Cody's son had to build an extra-large loom for his mother to work on. “It’s been a long journey,” Lola Cody told the Albuquerque Journal. "I had to give up a lot of things, to sacrifice to weave my rug." She stresses that the support and encouragement from her husband was key to completing the piece.
