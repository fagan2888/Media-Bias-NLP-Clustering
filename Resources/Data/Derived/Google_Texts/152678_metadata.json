Spoke of the soccer history ingrained in RFK Stadium. Evoked lessons learned there about professionalism and work ethic.\n\nBut before the U.S. women\u2019s national team trained Monday, it only took Wambach one venture through RFK\u2019s dark, dusty and seemingly never-ending tunnels for her to remember the venue\u2019s less glamorous side.\n\nWidening her eyes, Wambach let out a laugh and declared: \u201cI definitely did that walk one too many times.\u201d\n\nIt was an inglorious aspect of what\u2019s turned into a glorious career. Since playing at RFK Stadium with the now-defunct Freedom from 2002 to 2003, Wambach has become the most prolific scorer in international soccer history, reaching 160 goals in June to surpass Mia Hamm.\n\nAs Wambach grows older and younger players are integrated into the U.S. squad, she realizes the goals are only one part of her evolving role. With the United States set to face Mexico in a friendly Tuesday at RFK, the 33-year-old is more influential than ever.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played with Abby for a while now, and I\u2019ve just seen an immense change in her leadership,\u201d said U.S. midfielder Carli Lloyd, Wambach\u2019s teammate with the NWSL\u2019s Western New York Flash. \u201cShe\u2019s really coming into her own and really being the leader that she needs to be. We look up to her. We look to her for support.\u201d\n\nEleven years ago in the nation\u2019s capital, Wambach was the one in search of mentorship.\n\nAfter a standout career at the University of Florida, the 5-foot-11 forward came to Washington with the physical gifts but she was still rough around the edges.\n\nLooking back, Wambach is quick to cite then-Freedom coach Jim Gabarra and Hamm, her teammate with Washington and the U.S. team, for creating a competitive atmosphere that set her on the right path.\n\n\u201cThese were the building blocks for the kind of career I\u2019ve created for myself,\u201d Wambach said. \u201cAt the end of the day, when you leave college it really is up to you. Everybody is good enough \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of putting all of the tools together and having the mentality to be able to withstand whatever is thrown your way.\u201d\n\nWambach later played for the reincarnated Freedom at the Maryland SoccerPlex in Boyds from 2009 to 2010.\n\nBut lately she\u2019s been plying her trade for her hometown Flash, who she led to an appearance in the inaugural NWSL title game this past Saturday.\n\nAlthough she has made her name as a dominating finisher, Wambach added some class to her all-around game while ending up second in the league in assists (8) as well as goals (11).\n\nAs Wambach noted, \u201cAdaptation is important as you get older.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbby is obviously one of a kind,\u201d U.S. midfielder Lauren Holiday said. \u201cYou see her in the NWSL and she\u2019s setting people up, she\u2019s not just scoring with her head. I feel like you can put Abby in a box a lot of the time, but she\u2019ll always surprise you with something else.\u201d\n\nWith the next World Cup nearly two years away, there\u2019s little urgency surrounding Tuesday\u2019s friendly. Yet even after 207 international appearances, Wambach doesn\u2019t take wearing her country\u2019s colors for granted.\n\nShe\u2019s spent the past decade raising the bar for her sport, after all, and sees no point in slowing down now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more excited than anybody,\u201d Wambach said. \u201cIt\u2019s always really fun to put the jersey on, get the gear, to be in the environment where the standard is higher. Those are the kind of environments that I thrive in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since playing at RFK Stadium with the now-defunct Freedom from 2002 to 2003, Abby Wambach has become the most prolific scorer in international soccer history, reaching 160 goals in June to surpass Mia Hamm.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Since playing at RFK Stadium with the now-defunct Freedom from 2002 to 2003, Abby Wambach has become the most prolific scorer in international soccer history, reaching 160 goals in June to surpass Mia Hamm.", "title": "Abby Wambach has become international star in her days after the Freedom", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/2/abby-wambach-has-become-international-star-her-day/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/08/09/london-olympics-socce_hasc-16.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/08/09/london-olympics-socce_hasc-16.jpg", "description": "Since playing at RFK Stadium with the now-defunct Freedom from 2002 to 2003, Abby Wambach has become the most prolific scorer in international soccer history, reaching 160 goals in June to surpass Mia", "card": "summary", "title": "Abby Wambach has become international star in her days after the Freed"}, "Author": "Thomas Floyd - Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Abby Wambach, Rfk Stadium"}, "article_summary": "Back where it all began, Abby Wambach recalled her roots with the Washington Freedom.\n\u201cShe\u2019s really coming into her own and really being the leader that she needs to be.\n\u201cThese were the building blocks for the kind of career I\u2019ve created for myself,\u201d Wambach said.\nSince playing at RFK Stadium with the now-defunct Freedom from 2002 to 2003, Wambach has become the most prolific scorer in international soccer history, reaching 160 goals in June to surpass Mia Hamm.\nYet even after 207 international appearances, Wambach doesn\u2019t take wearing her country\u2019s colors for granted."}
