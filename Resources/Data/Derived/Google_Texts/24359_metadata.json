The other side would respond with a question meant to suggest hypocrisy on the part of the accuser. \u201cWell, what about the time when your government did X?\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin Would \u2018Welcome\u2019 a Donald Trump Presidency\n\nDuring the Cold War, whataboutism was generally the province of Soviet spokesmen and their defenders in the West. On Friday, though, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump took a page from the Kremlin playbook, seeming to defend the fact that journalists and political opponents who challenge the government of President Vladimir Putin have a habit of winding up dead or in prison.\n\nIn an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, host Mika Brezinski asked Trump about comments Putin had made about him the day before.\n\n\u201c[Trump] is a very flamboyant man, very talented, no doubt about that,\u201d Putin said near the end of his annual marathon press conference with regional media outlets in Moscow. \u201cHe is an absolute leader of the presidential race, as we see it today. He says that he wants to move to another level of relations, to a deeper level of relations with Russia. How can we not welcome that? Of course we welcome it.\"\n\nTrump responded, \u201cWhen people call you \u2018brilliant\u2019 it\u2019s always good, especially when the person heads up Russia.\u201d (Some media outlets translated Putin\u2019s first adjective describing Trump as \u201cbrilliant.\u201d)\n\nRelated: Brits Sign Petition to Ban Trump, Who Cameron Calls \u2018Divisive and Stupid\u2019\n\nTaken slightly aback, host Joe Scarborough said, \u201cWell, I mean, also is a person who kills journalists, political opponents and \u2026 invades countries, obviously that would be a concern, would it not?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when things got weird.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s running his country, and at least he\u2019s a leader, unlike what we have in this country,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cBut, again, he kills journalists that don\u2019t agree with him,\u201d Scarborough said.\n\n\u201cWell, I think that our country does plenty of killing, also, Joe,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stupidity going on in the world right now, Joe. A lot of killing going on, a lot of stupidity and that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rubio Outshines Trump, Cruz in GOP Foreign Policy Debate\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d Scarborough said. \u201cYou obviously condemn Vladimir Putin killing journalists and political opponents, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh sure, absolutely,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBrezinski moved on to a question about how U.S.-Russia relations would fare under a Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt fine about Putin,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a strong leader, he\u2019s a powerful leader, he\u2019s represented his country, and that\u2019s the way the country is being represented. He\u2019s actually got popularity within his country. They respect him as a leader, certainly over the last year they\u2019ve respected him as a leader.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Outrageous Defense Spending Puts Russia Back in the USSR\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s up in the 80s. You see where Obama\u2019s in the 30s and low 40s and he\u2019s up in the 80s so, I don\u2019t know who does the polls. Maybe he does the polls. But I think they\u2019re done by American companies.\u201d\n\nSo, for those keeping score at home, Trump not only suggested that he\u2019s not all that concerned about the state-sanctioned murder of journalists and activists, but thinks that the U.S. government is engaged in morally equivalent activities.\n\nHe also seems quite taken with Vladimir Putin\u2019s style of leadership. For the good of the nation, let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t lead to Trump taking shirtless horseback rides.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump really, really likes Vladimir Putin.
