Will that happen to me?\n\nA: Nine months after the launch of the controversial health insurance exchanges, confusion hasn\u2019t died down over what exactly health reform means for the average American. A new poll found that 65% of workers are very or somewhat worried that their firms will drop health coverage and have employees go it alone on the new federal and state insurance exchanges.\n\nSuch a move would hurt, at least in workers\u2019 minds, according to the survey of 1,240 likely voters by Morning Consult, a digital media company. Half said that if their employer exited the benefits business, they would be negatively affected; only 16% expected to benefit from such a switch.\n\n\n\nEven though Obamacare requires firms with 50 or more workers to offer insurance or owe a fine starting in 2015, the concern is that some will opt to pay the fine, since individual coverage can cost two to three times as much\u2014and substantially more for a family plan. What\u2019s more, employers with fewer than 50 workers that already offer health benefits\u2014even though they are not required to\u2014may decide to get out of the business now that all workers have the alternative of buying coverage on an exchange.\n\nAre workers right to worry about getting dumped? As long as you work for a large firm, you shouldn\u2019t lose sleep over the issue, at least not yet, says Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at consultant Mercer. Earlier this year\u2014well after the exchanges went live\u2014an overwhelming 94% of big firms reported that they will keep offering health coverage for the next five years, Umland says. That percentage has remained consistent since Mercer first asked the question in 2008.\n\nSeparate research from the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers, also found about 95% of those firms plan to stick with the status quo, says CEO Brian Marcotte.\n\nA wait-and-see approach\n\n\n\nBig business remains committed for lots of reasons, experts say. For one, good benefits are crucial to attracting talent. More than 90% of workers say health-care benefits are as important as pay, according to Mercer. In the Morning Consult poll, more than half of respondents say they would consider looking for a new job if they had to shop for coverage.\n\nCompany leaders are also uncertain about how premiums and plan features on the individual market will evolve after last year\u2019s shaky launch. Until the exchange offerings become more predictable, executives are unlikely to send their employees there, with or without a subsidy to buy coverage, says Tracy Watts, who leads the health care reform group at Mercer.\n\nEven then, large firms may not go that route. \u201cThe math doesn\u2019t work for most firms,\u201d says Watts. Today your boss pays its share of your health premium with pre-tax dollars. If the firm decides to offer you a subsidy to buy your own plan instead, the loss of that tax benefit means it would likely have to dole out more for you to get the same plan\u2014or risk facing worker backlash.\n\nSmaller firm, bigger risks\n\nYou\u2019re more likely to be moved to an exchange if you\u2019re at a firm with fewer than 50 workers. About one-third of small businesses that offer coverage today say they are considering getting out of the game, up from only 23% a year ago, says Mercer\u2019s Umland.\n\nYou also face a higher likelihood if you work at a firm with a large low-wage or part-time workforce, such as a store or hotel, says Marcotte. Many firms in those industries do not offer health insurance to all their workers today. Rather than add them to the plan, companies may decide workers are better off on the exchanges, where they can qualify for government subsidies only if their boss fails to offer an affordable plan.\n\nKeep in mind that while most firms say they\u2019ll remain in the game for the foreseeable future, they\u2019re not nearly as confident over the long haul. \u201cHealth care is changing pretty rapidly right now,\u201d says Marcotte. \u201cSo they\u2019ve got to look at it every year.\u201d By then, though, you too should have a better sense of how you\u2019d fare on your own too.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Obamacare requires most employers to offer coverage next year, but fears persist that many will dump workers onto the insurance exchanges instead.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Obamacare requires most employers to offer coverage next year, but fears persist that many will dump workers onto the insurance exchanges instead.
