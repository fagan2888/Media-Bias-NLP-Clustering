Will it finally take governing seriously, or will it go on using its majority in Congress to shut down the government, hold show votes on health care reform, stymie President Obama and try to stop Hillary Clinton from becoming president?\n\nThe current conventional wisdom holds that the leading candidate is the majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California. Mr. McCarthy, at least, said on Monday that it is time to stop \u201cgoverning by crisis,\u201d and that he would look for \u201cthe most conservative solution I can find.\u201d That might, possibly, hint that he is open to compromise.\n\nHis promotion, however, would leave the majority leader spot open. And, as Jennifer Steinhauer reports today, some in the party are hoping to elevate Trey Gowdy to that position.\n\nMr. Gowdy, of South Carolina, was elected in 2010 and built a reputation sponsoring marginal and often bizarre bits of legislation, like the 2014 bill that would allow the House of Representatives to sue the president of the United States if it did not like the way the president was enforcing the law.\n\nHe\u2019s a big supporter of repealing the Affordable Care Act and, of course, of denying federal money to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBut Mr. Gowdy has made his biggest splash by running the congressional investigation that is ostensibly into the killings at the Benghazi diplomatic compound on September 11, 2012, but that most often just seems like an attempt to mess around with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Gowdy was part of Representative Darrell Issa\u2019s team when he took over the House Government Oversight Committee after the 2010 elections and vowed to conduct \u201cseven hearings a week, times 40 weeks\u201d just to thwart President Obama.\n\nMr. Gowdy raises lots of money for other members of the committee. And if you\u2019re lucky enough to be on their mailing list, you will know that he is the darling of the StopHillaryPAC, which says it is single-mindedly dedicated to doing just that. Mr. Gowdy, for the record, has said he doesn\u2019t want to raise money off the Benghazi investigation or to have his name used for that purpose.\n\nChoosing Mr. Gowdy as majority leader would cement the current Republican Party as the party of the marginal right, of obstruction as a substitute for lawmaking, and of the abuse of congressional investigative and subpoena powers for partisan purposes.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150929145221, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/takingnote/post", "per": "Boehner, John A;Clinton, Hillary Rodham;Gowdy, Trey;Issa, Darrell E;McCarthy, Kevin (1965- );Obama, Barack", "org": "House of Representatives;Planned Parenthood Federation of America;Republican Party;Senate", "keywords": "Boehner John A,Clinton Hillary Rodham,Gowdy Trey,Issa Darrell E,McCarthy Kevin (1965- ),Obama Barack,Benghazi Attack (2012),Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Presidential Election of 2016,Shutdowns (Institutional),United States Politics and Government,House of Representatives,Planned Parenthood Federation of America,Republican Party,Senate,Benghazi (Libya),California,South Carolina,United States,Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/The Disturbing Prospect of Trey Gowdy as Majority Leader ( 20150929 )", "news_keywords": "2016 Presidential Election,Barack Obama,Benghazi,Benghazi Attack 2012,California,Closings,Darrell E Issa,Hillary Clinton,House of Representatives,John Boehner,Kevin McCarthy,Obamacare;Affordable Care Act,Planned Parenthood,Republicans,Senate,South Carolina,Trey Gowdy,US,US Politics", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Andrew Rosenthal", "SCG": "takingnote", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Andrew Rosenthal", "byl": "Andrew Rosenthal", "twitter": {"url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/the-disturbing-prospect-of-trey-gowdy-as-majority-leader/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/09/29/opinion/29rosenthalWEB/29rosenthalWEB-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "Mr. Gowdy runs the investigation into the Benghazi attack, and built his reputation sponsoring marginal and often bizarre legislation.", "card": "summary", "title": "The Disturbing Prospect of Trey Gowdy as Majority Leader"}, "blogpostid": 100000003945688, "description": "Mr. Gowdy runs the investigation into the Benghazi attack, and built his reputation sponsoring marginal and often bizarre legislation.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 29, 2015", "article": {"tag": "Featured Posts", "published_time": 1443552741, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2015-10-23T12:19:10-04:00", "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/andrew_rosenthal/index.html"}, "geo": "Benghazi (Libya);California;South Carolina;United States", "utime": 20151023121910, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150929, "pdate": 20150929, "des": "Benghazi Attack (2012);Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Presidential Election of 2016;Shutdowns (Institutional);United States Politics and Government", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/09/29/opinion/29rosenthalWEB/29rosenthalWEB-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Taking Note", "description": "Mr. Gowdy runs the investigation into the Benghazi attack, and built his reputation sponsoring marginal and often bizarre legislation.", "title": "The Disturbing Prospect of Trey Gowdy as Majority Leader", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/the-disturbing-prospect-of-trey-gowdy-as-majority-leader/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/09/29/opinion/29rosenthalWEB/29rosenthalWEB-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/the-disturbing-prospect-of-trey-gowdy-as-majority-leader/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Disturbing Prospect of Trey Gowdy as Majority Leader", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/09/29/opinion/29rosenthalWEB/29rosenthalWEB-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 29, 2015"}, "article_summary": "The current conventional wisdom holds that the leading candidate is the majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California.\nHis promotion, however, would leave the majority leader spot open.\nMr. Gowdy, for the record, has said he doesn\u2019t want to raise money off the Benghazi investigation or to have his name used for that purpose.\nMr. Gowdy raises lots of money for other members of the committee.\nAnd, as Jennifer Steinhauer reports today, some in the party are hoping to elevate Trey Gowdy to that position."}
