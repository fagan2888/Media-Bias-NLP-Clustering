From Staff Writers Charles Scudder and Brandon Formby:

On DART’s Green Line to Fair Park this morning, Texas and Oklahoma fans were still waking up. Many clutched coffee. A lot of Oklahoma fans stood in the aisles, held on to support bars and took selfies. It was a fairly quiet ride. Until somewhere between Akard and St. Paul stations.

“Boomer!” a woman’s voice yelled out.

“Sooner!” dozens of other Oklahoma fans answered.

“Boomer! Sooner! Texas! Sucks! Texas! Sucks!” they chanted.

Texas fans wryly smiled and shook their heads. But after the chants echoed through the train a second time, Longhorn fans answered back with a song.

“The eyes of Texas are upon you…”

Cloudy skies didn’t keep fans away from Fair Park as fans crowded toward the Cotton Bowl. At the fair, Sooner fans checked out Chevys and Longhorn fans lounged on mattresses.

Pockets of crimson and burnt orange filled the Midway, rarely mixing as fans exchanged chants of “Texas Fight!” and “Boomer Sooner!” Under the feet of Big Tex, fans stood in lines for coupons, beers and corn dogs. By 10 a.m., boozy breaths filled the air.

Brent Lilly and Craig O’Dell, old neighbors from McKinney, drank beer just outside the Cotton Bowl. Lilly wore an OU cap and shirt, O’Dell wore a UT cap and shirt.

Lilly used to be a Longhorn fan, he said. The two would have watching parties at each other’s homes and cheer on Texas. Then Lilly’s daughter decided to go to Oklahoma, and he gave O’Dell all his UT gear.

“I’m sending thousands of dollars to Oklahoma, so I decided I’d better be a fan,” he said.

Today, the two will sit on the UT side of the Cotton Bowl side by side and cheer on their respective teams.

“We tried to split the middle and sit right on the line,” O’Dell said.
