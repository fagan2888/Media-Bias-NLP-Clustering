Ohio’s Planned Parenthood chapter has caught the eye of the state’s attorney general after an investigation found that the non-profit’s three locations in the Buckeye State sent aborted baby parts to their disposal service, who then dropped them into landfills, according to the Hill. Of course, Planned Parenthood denied the claims, but also said that the question about baby parts ending up in landfills is something for their disposal service to answer. The publication added that Mike DeWine, Ohio’s Attorney General, has also notified the state’s Department of Health. He said that Planned Parenthood violated Ohio’s Administrative Code, which states that a “fetus shall be disposed of in a humane manner.”

"You're really asking a question for the disposal company," she said.

Asked where Planned Parenthood thought the fetal remains ended up, if not landfills, Kight responded, "The Ohio attorney general hasn't said that any law has been broken. What he seems to be upset about is what the law allows."

She said that the new allegations are trying to bury the fact that the investigation found no evidence to support the original allegation that Planned Parenthood sells fetal tissue.

She said it is "highly motivated by a political agenda that both the governor and attorney general are pushing right now in Ohio."

In a follow-up call with The Hill, Kight emphasized that the remains end up in a facility that is specially licensed to receive medical material, as prescribed by Ohio law.

She said it is the same way medical material from other healthcare providers is disposed of. "Every healthcare provider follows these laws, every surgery center, every hospital," she said.

According to cleveland.com, DeWine said in a press conference that the disposal system the state found does not violate Ohio law but does violate state administrative code, which states that a "fetus shall be disposed of in a humane manner."
