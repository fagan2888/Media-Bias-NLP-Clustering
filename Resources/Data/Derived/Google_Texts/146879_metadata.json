Bael III. \u201cMost people when they come, they say it feels different. And it\u2019s not just an act. We believe Jesus is love. We believe Jesus is a healer. [And] we believe in the need to get in touch with God, then we feel the love of God.\u201d\n\nTOP helps people in this journey, largely with professional counseling. Bael said several on the ministerial staff have been trained to administer counseling and do so as people request it. If an issue, is beyond the scope of what they can offer, he said the church will connect them with other resources that can help.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came here, I was very wounded,\u201d said Jacqueline Hooper, a TOP member for nine years. \u201cI was in a crazy relationship and it broke my heart. Life itself broke me down. [But] pastor and the elders \u2014 they took their time and ministered to me. The love they showed me was overwhelming.\u201d\n\nHooper detailed that when she \u201cneeded counseling, she got it\u201d and several times when she needed prayer, the pastor and congregation were there to wrap around her with prayer. Beyond the spiritual aspect, she shared she was also in financial need when she joined the church. TOP answered that as well, giving her money when she was unable to afford her medicine, providing food and helping her with transportation.\n\nTo further help her in the future, Hooper said one of the other members, Sister Terri, \u201ctook time with me to show me how to budget on time with my bills. They care about your whole life.\u201d\n\nChris Jones, 25, grew up at TOP. And although he said he does not come to church often, he has always been guided and accepted by the ministers, something that has helped him along, even as he attends church every now and then.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s always been straightforward here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people don\u2019t let you fall of. And Pastor Will definitely wants the best for you. Throughout my life, I have been real curious-minded but they would always take the time and explain why some things aren\u2019t OK. Growing up I didn\u2019t have my father. And going in the world \u2014 not knowing how to look at things, you can be lost. [But] they will keep it real with me. It\u2019s a foundation they set.\u201d\n\nFor Zegeory Smith, a member for four years, TOP\u2019s love is also life-impacting, not so much through the counseling, however, as through the acceptance from the congregation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very loving atmosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people accept you as you are. When I joined, I had a whole lot of different problems \u2014 alcohol was my number-one problem. I talked to a lot of different people \u2014 that helped [and] it was acceptance.\u201d\n\nSmith added that \u201cthe church \u2014 it turned my life around. I used to work for the state [liquor store] full time. Now, I praise the Lord full time.\u201d\n\nPraise and worship at TOP is a significant part of the experience.\n\nOn the Sunday of the Tribune\u2019s visit, the praise and worship team, accompanied by praise dancers, opened the service at 10:30 a.m. After they finished, a little after 11, the church continued to sing and praise well into noon, led by Minister Daniel Mack, who also jumped up and down and shouted.\n\nWorshippers were free to shout as they pleased and several worshippers danced with each other. One member, whose foot was in a cast, danced as best she could as well.\n\n\u201cWe believe, according to the Scripture, \u2018Let everything that have breath, praise the Lord,\u2019\u201d said Bael. \u201cWe believe in freedom in praise and worship \u2014 expressing yourself spontaneously.\u201d\n\nEvangelist Tonie, a member since 1991, describes the entire TOP experience as free.\n\n\u201cOur church has a freedom \u2014 from how we dress to what we do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not organized but it\u2019s controlled.\u201d\n\nAnother major way Bael said TOP works to touch people\u2019s lives, in the physical sense, is through several external ministries.\n\nThree times a week, through a partnership with Target, they distribute groceries \u2014 including food and household items to members and nonmembers in need. Quarterly, they host fellowship events so members can socialize.\n\nThey also operate a daycare, offering affordable care for parents and families. The daycare began as a volunteer service to help parents during service and meetings.\n\nBael added that they are in the process of renovating their building to serve as a multipurpose training facility to teach life skills and career development skills to teens and adults.\n\n\u201cWhatever we can do to help, we will,\u201d Bael said. \u201cWe believe in the whole Bible \u2014 prayers, miracles, that Jesus is a healer. [And] we believe in Scripture \u2014 practicing what you preach and being the model for what you preach.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Philadelphia Tribune", "description": "The Oasis of Praise (TOP) Ministries is committed to changing people\u2019s lives using a freedom-oriented strategy \u2014 offer a nondenominational worship experience that is free from judgment and encourages free praise.", "title": "TOP Ministries promotes freedom to express praise and worship", "url": "http://www.phillytrib.com/religion/top-ministries-promotes-freedom-to-express-praise-and-worship/article_9be4b12c-bd08-5bc9-83fd-ad650a56f7eb.html", "image": {"width": 944, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/phillytrib.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/d5/ed517264-4f42-59ac-b361-80813b41c02f/56a2a7203d41a.image.jpg?resize=944%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@PhillyTrib", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The Oasis of Praise (TOP) Ministries is committed to changing people\u2019s lives using a freedom-oriented strategy \u2014 offer a nondenominational worship experience that is free from judgment and encourages free praise.", "fb": {"app_id": 192095830844175}, "keywords": "church of the week,top ministries,enewsletter,religion,church_of_the_week,featured", "google-site-verification": "awU4tGDYLbxW_pvA8W2ZKl9Gx4HCDtahI2b3E4fP8Fg", "news_keywords": "church of the week,top ministries,enewsletter,religion,church_of_the_week,featured"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd59b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe believe in freedom in praise and worship \u2014 expressing yourself spontaneously.\u201dEvangelist Tonie, a member since 1991, describes the entire TOP experience as free.\nThe Oasis of Praise (TOP) Ministries is committed to changing people\u2019s lives using a freedom-oriented strategy \u2014 offer a nondenominational worship experience that is free from judgment and encourages free praise.\nNow, I praise the Lord full time.\u201dPraise and worship at TOP is a significant part of the experience.\n\u201cWhat makes us special is our love of God and our love for people,\u201d said Senior Pastor William T.
