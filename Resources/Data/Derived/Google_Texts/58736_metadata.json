Bob Casey told reporters that Senate Republicans are in step with Trump\u2019s ideology on opposing immigration reform, in their approach to fighting ISIS, in seeking to repeal Obamacare, and in not putting forward economic policies that would help the middle class.\n\n\u201cYou could almost say to that caucus, \u2018You built that candidacy,\u2019\u201d said Casey, putting a twist on a phrase that Republicans used derisively against President Obama during the 2012 election.\n\nTop Republican lawmakers had sought to portray a sense of unity after Wednesday's meetings. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has yet to endorse Trump, released a statement that he and Trump are \"totally committed\" to working together.\n\nAsked about a poll of Pennsylvania voters this week showing Trump in a dead heat with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Casey said the state often has had close races for the presidency.\n\nBut Casey said he believes Democrats \u2013 and Clinton in particular \u2013 have an advantage this fall in the state on economic issues and foreign policy.\n\nCasey's position alongside New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and others during the afternoon press conference may reflect the larger role that he'll play as his tenure in the Senate continues to grow, according to political analysts. He's also been outspoken in calling on his Republican colleagues to consider President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.\n\nIt's a leadership role Casey is likely to reprise throughout the year, including at this summer's Democratic National Convention, thanks to Casey's position not only as a prominent Democrat but as a Pennsylvanian.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Bob Casey seeks to link Senate GOP, Donald Trump", "Description": "After Trump's whirlwind series of meetings with Capitol Hill Republicans, Senate\u00a0Democrats sought to portray the presumptive nominee and GOP legislators as", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "After Trump\u2019s whirlwind series of meetings with Capitol Hill Republicans , Senate \u00a0 Democrats sought to portray the presumptive nominee and GOP legislators as sharing a set of identical and destructive policy stances.", "title": "Bob Casey seeks to link Senate GOP, Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/capitol-ideas/mc-bob-casey-seeks-to-link-senate-gop-donald-trump-20160512-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5735021d/turbine/mc-bob-casey-seeks-to-link-senate-gop-donald-trump-20160512", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp02.14", "twitter": {"site": "@mcall", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=501096172, app-argument=http://www.mcall.com/deeplinkid/87179082", "fb": {"admins": 1762506491, "page_id": 73291032902, "app_id": 377275452340817}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-05-12", "y_key": "7164478e9f100cbd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "It's a leadership role Casey is likely to reprise throughout the year, including at this summer's Democratic National Convention, thanks to Casey's position not only as a prominent Democrat but as a Pennsylvanian.\nAfter Trump\u2019s whirlwind series of meetings with Capitol Hill Republicans, Senate Democrats sought to portray the presumptive nominee and GOP legislators as sharing a set of identical and destructive policy stances.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, who has yet to endorse Trump, released a statement that he and Trump are \"totally committed\" to working together.\nBut Casey said he believes Democrats \u2013 and Clinton in particular \u2013 have an advantage this fall in the state on economic issues and foreign policy.\nPennsylvania U.S. Sen.
