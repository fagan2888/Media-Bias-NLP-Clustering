As you may have seen, yesterday Fox offered up this hilariously misleading chart of Obamacare's enrollment progress:



The numbers on that chart said 6 million and 7 million, but visually, it was pure gibberish. According to the height of the bars, the ratio was actually 3:8. Making it worse, there wasn't even a scale.

Well, today, Fox has apologized and issued a correction, saying the chart should have looked like this:



the right thing

Indeed, the chart is now properly scaled—but before you go run off and congratulate Fox for doingtheir job, there's one little thing they didn't mention: The fact that Obamacare enrollments are now expected to hit that 7 million target (update @ 10:56 AM PT: WH spokesman Jay Carney just announced Obamacare enrollments have cleared the 7 million threshold), rendering the 6 million figure irrelevant—unless you want to talk about the big last minute surge of enrollment.

Bottom-line: Fox would rather issue corrections that allow them re-report outdated information than talk about what's actually happening today with Obamacare. That's not a good sign for the anti-Obamacare crusaders.
