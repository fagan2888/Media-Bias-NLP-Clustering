Income from continuing operations after minority interests increased 57% to $98.8 million, or $2.56 per diluted share, in the current year from $62.9 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, in the prior year. For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 12% to $249.2 million as compared with $222.4 million during the prior-year period. Earnings from continuing operations after minority interests increased 72% to $23.4 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to $13.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\n\nThe Company made the decision during the fourth quarter of 2014 to discontinue all operations conducted by its subsidiary, American Jets, Inc. (AJI), a long-range fixed wing medical transportation provider acquired in July 2013. Ongoing operating losses were a key factor in the decision to discontinue all of AJI's operations in late December 2014. Accordingly, after-tax losses of $2.0 million, or $.05 per share, and $3.9 million, or $0.10 per share, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014, respectively, have been excluded from results from continuing operations. The loss from this discontinued operation was $0.01 per diluted share for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2013.\n\nThe fourth quarter of 2013 included $2.4 million in pre-tax charges associated with severance for certain terminated employees, reserves for pending legal matters, impairment/disposition losses on aircraft and certain intangible assets, and transaction costs associated with acquisition activities. The current-year quarter includes $1.1 million in pre-tax charges from these activities.\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per share for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2013, were reduced by $0.05 for the impact of an equity put option related to our redeemable non-controlling interest in one of our consolidated subsidiaries. The equity put option allows the non-controlling interest party to sell its ownership interest in a joint venture to the Company at a future date for a minimum pre-established amount. While net income on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income was not reduced by the amount of this equity put option, earnings per share are required to be calculated after reducing net income by the amount of the equity put option. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 were increased by $0.05 associated with an adjustment to the value of the same equity put option during the third quarter of 2014.\n\nFinancial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014, include operations associated with the Company's acquisition of Helicopter Consultants of Maui, LLC (doing business as Blue Hawaiian Helicopters) and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Blue Hawaiian) on December 13, 2013. Revenue generated from Blue Hawaiian during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014 was $13.8 million and $56.3 million, respectively, compared with $2.8 million from December 13 through December 31 of 2013.\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nNet patient transport revenue increased 15% to $174.3 million from $151.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Net revenue per patient transport increased 6% to $12,238 from $11,531 in the prior-year quarter. Total patient transports from community-based locations increased 9% to 14,209 from 13,054. Patient transports from community-based locations open greater than one year (Same-Base Transports) increased 71 transports, as compared with the prior-year quarter. Weather cancellations for these same base locations increased by 272 transports compared with the prior-year quarter. Air medical services contract revenue decreased by 8% to $41.9 million from $45.8 million.\n\nMaintenance expense (excluding tour operations) for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the prior-year period decreased by 10%, or $2.5 million, while flight volume, including volume associated with hospital contracts, decreased by 2%. Fuel costs (excluding tour operations) per flight hour decreased by 14% during the current year quarter.\n\nRevenue and divisional net loss from tour operations were $26.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, compared with revenue and net income of $14.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the prior year quarter. Decrease in divisional net income was attributed, in part, to more severe weather in certain markets.\n\nRevenue from our United Rotorcraft Division, excluding revenue generated from internal projects, decreased to $3.4 million from $9.3 million in the prior-year quarter, a 63% decrease. Excluding internal projects, the division generated a net loss of $2.7 million in the current-year quarter compared to a net loss of $1.0 million in the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe Company also provided an update on preliminary January flight volume and net revenue per patient transport. Total community-based transports during January 2015 were mostly unchanged at 4,534 compared with 4,542 during January 2014. Same-Base Transports for January decreased 335 transports, or 8%, while weather cancellations for these same bases increased by 365 transports. Preliminary net revenue per patient transport during January 2015 increased 15% to $12,740 compared with $11,074 during January 2014. The Company also announced that community-based transports for February to date reflect a 13% increase, due in part to reduction in weather cancellations month to date.\n\nAaron Todd, Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We have achieved a key milestone in exceeding $1 billion in revenue in 2014. Healthy growth in air medical flight volume throughout 2014 and quarter to date in 2015 is very encouraging. We have also seen less seasonality in our net reimbursement results during the winter months thus far, as well. Fuel price decreases and continued outsourcing activity within our hospital-based operations should continue to be key earnings growth drivers in 2015. We are also pleased to have generated strong earnings accretion from our helicopter tourism diversification in 2014, despite more severe weather conditions in both key markets.\"\n\nThe Company will discuss these results in a conference call scheduled today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern.

Statements in this press release that are \"forward-looking statements,\" including statements made with regard to the Company's preliminary January and February 2015 operational and financial results, including those related to (i) total community-based patient transports, (ii) same base transports, (iii) weather cancellations, and (iv) net revenue per patient transport, and the anticipated impact of fuel price decreases and outsourcing activity, are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the size, structure and growth of the Company's air medical services, United Rotorcraft Division and Tourism Division; the collection rates for patient transports; the continuation and/or renewal of air medical service contracts; weather conditions across the U.S.; development and changes in laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; increased regulation of the health care and aviation industry through legislative action and revised rules and standards; and other matters set forth in the Company's filings with the SEC. The Company is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Information: This press release discusses EBITDA, which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposition of assets. A table is provided in this press release to reconcile such non-GAAP financial measure to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Such table below includes all information reasonably available to the Company at the date of this press release and adjustments that the Company can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include, but are not limited to, acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and goodwill and other asset impairments.\n\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the Company's core operating results and thus is appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance and its prospects for the future. Management believes the additions and subtractions from net income used to calculate EBITDA reflect the measurements that its bank creditors and third party stock analysts use in evaluating the Company. These adjustments to the Company's GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results and trends and performance. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's financial results. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial results determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nPlease contact Christina
