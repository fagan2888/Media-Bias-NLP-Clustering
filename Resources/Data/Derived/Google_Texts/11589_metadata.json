(AP) - Moments after Maryland concluded its season with a disheartening loss to Kansas, senior guard Rasheed Sulaimon expressed hope that the team\u2019s appearance in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament would serve as a \u201cspringboard\u201d for the future of the program.\n\nWhether that happens depends heavily on the events of an offseason that began a week earlier than anticipated.\n\nMaryland entered the 2015-16 season with the expectation of reaching the Final Four. The Terrapins appeared headed in that direction in early February, when they were 22-3 and ranked second in the country.\n\nSix losses over the next 11 games followed. Although Maryland reached the Sweet 16 for the first time in 13 years, a 79-63 defeat to Kansas on Thursday put an end to an up and down season.\n\n\u201cHopefully,\u201d Sulaimon said, \u201cthis group is remembered as winners.\u201d\n\nAfter a 15-1 start - the best in school history - Maryland shook off losses to Michigan and Michigan State to climb in the rankings. But successive defeats against Wisconsin and lowly Minnesota followed, and the Terrapins staggered into the NCAA Tournament as a No. 5 seed.\n\nWins over South Dakota State and Hawaii served to make the season palatable for Maryland (27-9).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my group for what they did. We fought to the end,\u201d coach Mark Turgeon said. \u201cIt was a fun team to coach.\u201d\n\nHighlights were a 16-1 record at home, including blowouts against Ohio State and Illinois. Most of all, the Terps reached the round of 16 for the first time since 2003, when they were defending the national championship under coach Gary Williams.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to hold our heads down for,\u201d Sulaimon said. \u201cI thought we had a tremendous season. Hopefully, this was the springboard for great Maryland teams in the future under coach Turgeon.\u201d\n\nComing up with an encore won\u2019t be easy. Not only do the Terrapins lose Sulaimon and senior forward Jake Layman, but the three other starters - sophomore guard Melo Trimble, freshman center Diamond Stone and junior forward Robert Carter Jr. - all are expected to consider the possibility of heading toward the NBA.\n\nLosing any one of those underclassmen would be devastating to a program that has reached the NCAA Tournament in successive seasons after missing out in Turgeon\u2019s first three years as Williams\u2019 successor.\n\nAll five starters averaged in double figures. Trimble was the team\u2019s leading scorer ahead of Stone, voted the Big Ten newcomer of the year. Carter led the team in rebounding and was third in scoring.\n\nFighting a hamstring injury, Trimble tailed off late in the season and conceivably hurt his stature in the NBA draft - which might prove beneficial to Maryland.\n\nRegardless of who sticks around, the Terrapins will have to get production from bench players who contributed little this season. Guards Jared Nickens and Jaylen Brantley will be joined the backcourt by Dion Wiley, who missed the whole season with a knee injury.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "Moments after Maryland concluded its season with a disheartening loss to Kansas, senior guard Rasheed Sulaimon expressed hope that the team's appearance in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament would serve as a \"springboard\" for the future of the program.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Moments after Maryland concluded its season with a disheartening loss to Kansas, senior guard Rasheed Sulaimon expressed hope that the team\u2019s appearance in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament would serve as a \u201cspringboard\u201d for the future of the program.", "title": "Maryland\u2019s late-season fade leads into offseason of change", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/25/marylands-late-season-fade-leads-into-offseason-of/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/24/ncaa_maryland_kansas_basketball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/24/ncaa_maryland_kansas_basketball.jpeg", "description": "Moments after Maryland concluded its season with a disheartening loss to Kansas, senior guard Rasheed Sulaimon expressed hope that the team's appearance in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament would se", "card": "summary", "title": "Maryland\u2019s late-season fade leads into offseason of change"}, "Author": "DAVID GINSBURG", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Hopefully, this was the springboard for great Maryland teams in the future under coach Turgeon.\u201dComing up with an encore won\u2019t be easy.\nBut successive defeats against Wisconsin and lowly Minnesota followed, and the Terrapins staggered into the NCAA Tournament as a No.\nWhether that happens depends heavily on the events of an offseason that began a week earlier than anticipated.\nAlthough Maryland reached the Sweet 16 for the first time in 13 years, a 79-63 defeat to Kansas on Thursday put an end to an up and down season.\nThe Terrapins appeared headed in that direction in early February, when they were 22-3 and ranked second in the country."}
