And the rate of M&A deals is hitting all-time highs as well.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cSince the end of 2010, the S&P 500 Health Care sector has been the stellar performer, rising 144% in price compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 69% advance, while six of 10 sectors underperformed the broader market,\u201d Sam Stovall, U.S. Equity Strategist at S&P Capital IQ said in a July 20 report.\n\nIn addition, Stovall points out that the Health Care sector has beaten the 500 in each of the past five calendar years (including this one), something no other sector can boast. In addition, Health Care\u2019s weighting within the S&P 500 is now 15.5%, which is near its all-time of 15.9%, and is 45% higher than it was in early 2011, according to Stovall.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMost recognize the fact that this sector has had such a significant run in 2015 due mainly to the enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and that will apparently be in play for many years to come.\n\nAnother major factor for this aggressive movement has been the heightened volume of M&A deals which has been a boon to the sector.\n\n\u201cU.S. Health Care M&A totals $347 billion this year-to-date, and never in a YTD period has a sector had so much volume as Healthcare,\u201d says Dealogic. The next biggest YTD volume for the top sector was Telecoms with $292 billion in 1999 YTD.\n\nIn fact, Dealogic reports that U.S. Health Care volume this YTD exceeds all full year volumes for the top sector in every year except 1999, when Telecoms finished the year on $462 billion, including exceeding last year\u2019s full year volume for U.S. Health Care which was $323 billion.\n\nWith the recent news of Teva Pharms (TEVA) acquiring Allergan\u2019s (AGN) generic drug business for $40.5 billion, many more deals are likely to be on the horizon.\n\nJason Gerberry, Managing Director, Equity Research at Leerink Partners believes there will continue to be significant M&A activity this year as well as next year.\n\n\u201cWe see Allergan poised to engage in major M&A activity with Monday\u2019s divestiture of their generics unit, which cleaned their balance sheet arming them with cash to pursue high growth biopharma targets,\u201d notes Gerberry.\n\nHe also points out that Pfizer (PFE) has communicated a desire to do a tax inversion deal and may look to engage in \u201ca merger of equals,\u201d which gets around any of the restrictions outlined in the U.S. Treasury Notice (Sept. 2014).\n\nMeanwhile, Stovall believes a partial explanation for health care\u2019s weighting upsurge is due to widening representation by the high-growth biotech sub-industry from a sub-10% weighting in 2001 to a near 22% exposure today.\n\nAnd Gerberry is of the opinion that: \u201csome of these biopharma companies that have redomiciled to Ireland (for tax purposes) may look to move quickly and acquire U.S. biopharma companies before the U.S. enacts any legislation that prevents these companies from the practice of EPS stripping, e.g. using debt to shield taxes on U.S. derived profits.\u201d\n\nStovall also notes that: \u201cDespite a near doubling in weighting since early 2011, we [S&P Capital IQ] still recommend an overweighting to Health Care.\u201d\n\nAs of the close of the market yesterday, the Health Care sector was still the leader of the pack YTD, up 9.1%, with Consumer Discretionary not far behind, up nearly 8.4%.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-05 03:25:36 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The Healthcare Sector is pumping up tremendous gains and is on a historic run.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2015/07/27/can-healthcare-sector-continue-on-its-enormous-run.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2015/07/27/can-healthcare-sector-continue-on-its-enormous-run/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1451982338718.jpg?ve=1", "description": "The Healthcare Sector is pumping up tremendous gains and is on a historic run.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Can the Health Care Sector Continue on its Incredible Run?"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE\"],\"author\":\"Matthew Morrow\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Can the Health Care Sector Continue on its Incredible Run?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2015/07/27/can-healthcare-sector-continue-on-its-enormous-run/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1451982338718.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-28T16:30:41Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2015/07/27/can-healthcare-sector-continue-on-its-enormous-run.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"1e33e88a-36c3-4734-8e82-0132ad67a9cf\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "The Healthcare Sector is pumping up tremendous gains and is on a historic run.", "dc.identifier": "1e33e88a-36c3-4734-8e82-0132ad67a9cf", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "classification-isa": "healthcare", "description": "The Healthcare Sector is pumping up tremendous gains and is on a historic run.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Can The Health Care Sector Continue On Its Incredible Run?", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-05 03:25:36 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "The Healthcare Sector is pumping up tremendous gains and is on a historic run.", "title": "Can the Health Care Sector Continue on its Incredible Run?
