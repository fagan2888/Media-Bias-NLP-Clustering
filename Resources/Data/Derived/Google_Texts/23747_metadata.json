It was the Board\u2019s view that Petitioner had not established a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on its positions with respect to these claims.\n\nThe \u2018828 patent relates to \u201ccompositions comprising tigecycline, a suitable carbohydrate, and an acid or buffer.\u201d Petitioner had challenged claim 1-23 of the \u2018828 patent on the following grounds: (1) obviousness of claims 1-3, 6-9, 12, 13, 18, and 19 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) in view of CN \u2018550, Kirsch, and Herman; and (2) obviousness of claims 4, 5, 10, 11, 14-17, and 20-23 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) in view of CN \u2018550, Kirsch, Herman, Pawelczyk, and Remmers.\n\nPatent Owner had argued that Petitioner was estopped from seeking from requesting inter partes review of these claims \u201cbecause the asserted grounds are based on prior art that Petitioner \u2018was aware of, cited, and relied on in [its previous] \u2018115 IPR[.]\u2019\u201d According to Patent Owner, because Petitioner could have raised these asserted grounds in the previous \u2018115 IPR, Petitioner was estopped from bringing the instant proceeding by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 315(e)(1).\n\nThe Board found that because Petitioner could have raised ground (2) in its previous \u2018115 IPR, Petitioner was estopped under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 315(e)(1) from asserting ground (2) in the instant proceeding. On the other hand, the Board found that Petitioner was not estopped from asserting ground (1) in the instant proceeding because the panel in the previous \u2018115 IPR had not reached the merits of the challenge of ground 1 in deciding whether to institute a trial in the previous \u2018115 IPR. As reasoned by the Board, \u201cgrounds raised during the preliminary proceeding [in the \u2018115 IPR], but not made part of the instituted trial, are not raised \u2018during\u2019 an inter partes review and cannot be the basis for estoppel under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 315(e)(1).\u201d The Board further reasoned that \u201c[n]or are such grounds ones that \u2018reasonably could have been raised during\u2019 the review, because once denied, the Board\u2019s decision on institution prevents Petitioner from raising that ground during the trial.\u201d\n\nPatent Owner also requested the Board to decline institution under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 325(d). However, the Board elected not to exercise its authority to decline inter partes review of the \u2018828 patent under \u00a7 325(d) in view of the fact that the panel in the previous \u2018115 IPR had not \u201c[reached] the merits of Petitioner\u2019s arguments with respect to [ground (1)] when considering the \u2018115 IPR.\u201d\n\nAs for the obviousness challenges under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a), the Board concluded that \u201cPetitioner [had] not provided sufficient rationale to explain why a person having ordinary skill in the art would have substituted tigecycline for minocycline in the CN \u2019550 compositions.\u201d This led the Board to the ultimate conclusion that \u201cthe record . . . does not establish a reasonable likelihood that Petitioner would prevail in showing claim 1 and claims 2, 3, and 6\u20139 that depend therefrom, and claim 12 and claims 13, 18, and 19 that depend therefrom, would have been obvious over the combination of CN \u2018550, Kirsch, and Herman.\u201d\n\nApotex Inc. v.
