Ahead of her expected presidential campaign, Carly Fiorina, made a stop in Dewitt, Iowa, speaking at a dinner for Clinton County Republicans.

Fiorina told the crowd that she will make an announcement about a possible presidential candidacy in the next few weeks.

"Our government has become so big, so powerful, so costly, so complex, so corrupt," she said.

She started her speech by sharing her story; how she started as a secretary, eventually becoming CEO of Hewlett Packard.

"And that was a company with a lot of problems when I arrived," she said.

After what she described as several successful years, she was fired.

"I've been absolutely transparent about that ever since. I was fired in a boardroom brawl and so of course, I learned that sometimes, when you challenge the status quo, when you change the order of things, not everybody likes it," she said.

In 2010, Fiorina ran for the U.S. Senate and lost. Now considering a presidential run, she is making several stops in Iowa.

"West Des Moines, Marshalltown, Ames, Ottumwa and now, Dewitt. And I didn't do it on a scooby van either," she said.

The scooby van reference was one of several she made about Hillary Clinton.

"She should not be president because she lacks a track record of accomplishment and she should not be president because the policies that she will pursue will make crony capitalism worse and will crush the middle class further and will continue to destroy possibilities for too may Americans," she said.

She also said the Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank should be repealed and mentioned meetings she has had with Russia's President, Vladimir Putin and Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

So far, the only woman in the field of potential republican candidates, she is behind in the polls. She ended her speech in Dewitt, though, with a standing ovation.
