Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), an early supporter of the Defund Obamacare effort that pledged not to pass a budget if the health-care law funding was part of it, said shutting down the government was a "dumb idea" -- but that he wouldn't change his approach in the future.

"I said throughout the whole battle that shutting down the government was a dumb idea," Paul said Monday night on Fox News. "Even though it did appear as if I was participating in it, I said it was a dumb idea."

Paul didn't say that he regretted his vote against the budget and debt ceiling increases. In fact, he suggested he would again resist a so-called "clean" debt-ceiling increase while hoping that it wouldn't lead to a shutdown.

"I'm in favor of voting for the principled position, but trying not to be the fly in the ointment that shuts the government down," he said.

Paul said he faced a conundrum between allowing government to be funded and allowing the debt to explode.

The Kentucky senator said a shutdown was unlikely to happen again because the GOP lost its edge.

"I think they will resist, and I think they know that our leverage is diminished and our will to shut down the government is diminished," Paul said.
