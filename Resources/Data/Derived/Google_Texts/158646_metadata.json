They favor free markets, but aren\u2019t sure whether markets or government best drive income mobility. In all, millennials are neither a Democratic nor a Republican generation; they remain politically unclaimed.\u201d\n\nSome have taken the results to mean that when it comes to politics, millennials are kind of mixed-up. In a Vox piece titled \u201cThis poll proves that millennials have totally incoherent political views,\u201d Dylan Matthews pulls out some possible contradictions:\n\n\u201c\u2022 65 percent of Millennials think it would help the economy to cut spending\u2026\n\n\u2022 \u2026but 62 percent and 58 percent think it\u2019d help the economy to boost spending on job training and infrastructure, respectively.\n\n\u2022 58 percent think that it\u2019d help the economy to cut taxes\u2026\n\n\u2022 \u2026but 66 percent think it\u2019d help the economy to raise taxes on the wealthy.\u201d\n\nOf these and other findings, Derek Thompson of The Atlantic writes:\n\n\u201cSome of these positions suggest, rather than prove, utter incoherence. For example, you can technically support (a) reducing the overall tax burden and (b) raising taxes on the wealthy by raising the investment tax and absolving the bottom 50 percent of Social Security taxes. Somehow, I think what\u2019s happening is simpler than young people doing the long math of effective tax rates. I think they\u2019re just confused.\u201d\n\nAre millennials uncertain about their desires, unable to articulate what they truly want in life? Not so, says Pizza Hut.\n\nSee Bruce Horovitz\u2019s USA Today story on the \u201cpizza cookie,\u201d which is a cookie, shaped like a pizza. Mr. Horovitz quotes Carrie Walsh, Pizza Hut\u2019s chief marketing officer: \u201cMillennials tell us it\u2019s what they want. They like to cap off a great pizza with a great dessert.\u201d\n\nThe pizza cookie is apparently especially millennial because it is social media in dessert form. Mr. Horovitz reports:\n\n\u201cThe key for the chains is to make the desserts as shareable as the pizzas, says one pizza guru. It\u2019s oddly similar to the reason that hookah sales have jumped among Millennials \u2014 because they like to feel a part of social gatherings, says Steve Green, publisher of PMQ Pizza Magazine, a trade publication. \u2018You never get a pizza for yourself. Now, you take a chocolate chip cookie and make it communal \u2014 and you\u2019ve got a party.\u2019\u201d\n\nWill pizza cookies be able to overcome the carb hatred that has doomed cereal? At Today.com, Ben Popken betrays some skepticism: \u201cAmid an obesity crisis and increasingly health-conscious nation, it doesn\u2019t seem like America would have the appetite for such a dish.\u201d However, he writes, \u201cthe desire among a certain high-metabolism group to feel a part of communal gatherings is even stronger than their need to watch their waistline.\u201d\n\nThe pizza cookie looks pretty tasty (the Today.com staff verdict: \u201cit tastes like a cookie\u201d). But the notion that millennials are especially interested in eating with one another, something that humans have been doing for thousands of years (and that\u2019s also popular among, just for instance, sharks), recalls a point many made about the Reason survey.\n\nMr. Thompson put it this way:\n\n\u201cOverall, Millennials offer the murky impression of a generation that doesn\u2019t really understand basic economics. To be fair, neither do most Americans. Or many economists, perhaps. Or most journalists. Economics is hard.\u201d\n\nMr. Matthews wrote:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth questioning the value of trying to force these answers into a coherent political framework rather than accept that Millennials, like most people, have much, much better things to do with their time than form highly nuanced and non-contradictory political opinions. Political nerds tend to really overestimate how much most people care about public policy, and how much they feel it connects to their daily lives.\u201d\n\nBut Matt Buchanan of The Awl articulated the point perhaps most forcefully of all:\n\n\u201cMillennials are no more or less incoherent about their political beliefs than any other relatively arbitrary generational grouping of Americans clustered together largely for marketing purposes. The fundamental American political right is not to vote, but to be willfully contradictory in your core belief systems, often in the same breath. At worst, this shows that Millennials, if they weren\u2019t a myth, will grow up to be the thing that they, and every other young generation, supposedly fears most \u2014 their parents.\u201d\n\nShort version: Millennials are a lot like other people. They hold some contradictory political opinions, they may not have a perfect grasp of economics, and they like eating stuff with their friends.
