Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said if elected he will create \u201cuniversal health care for every man, woman and child,\u201d and put private insurance companies \u201cout of business.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCo-host Norah O\u2019Donnell asked, \u201cThere\u2019s no disputing what you\u2019re talking about. I think, what your own Democratic governor \u2014 and you\u2019re running as a Democrat \u2014 encountered in Vermont is that while it was an ideal to give everyone health care for all. The ability of actually paying for it became the real problem and he didn\u2019t want to bust the budget in Vermont.\u201d\n\nSanders answered, \u201cWhat we are talking about now, number one, let\u2019s be clear. We spend far more per capita on health care than do the people of any other country. Thirty million people today have zero health insurance. Millions more are under insured. No one debates that fact. What the story is, is how can you create universal health care for every man, woman and child and do it in a cost and effective way. Other countries do it. The United States of America can do it. Now, I know the private insurance companies don\u2019t like this idea, we\u2019re going to put them out of business. And the drug companies that are ripping off the American people and charging us the highest prices in the world, don\u2019t like the idea. Tough luck.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sanders: We\u2019re Going To Put the Private Insurance Companies \u2018Out of Business\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Sanders: We\u2019re Going To Put the Private Insurance Companies \u2018Out of Business\u2019", "title": "Sanders: We\u2019re Going To Put the Private Insurance Companies \u2018Out of Business\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/sane.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/09/18/sanders-were-going-to-put-the-private-insurance-companies-out-of-business/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sanders: We\u2019re Going To Put the Private Insurance Companies \u2018Out of Business\u2019", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/sane.jpg", "title": "Sanders: We\u2019re Going To Put the Private Insurance Companies \u2018Out of Business\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Sanders: We\u2019re Going To Put the Private Insurance Companies \u2018Out of Business\u2019", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Bernie Sanders", "published_time": "2015-09-18T07:47:09-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6f7\"", "article_summary": "Now, I know the private insurance companies don\u2019t like this idea, we\u2019re going to put them out of business.\nWe spend far more per capita on health care than do the people of any other country.\nThirty million people today have zero health insurance.\nWhat the story is, is how can you create universal health care for every man, woman and child and do it in a cost and effective way.\nI think, what your own Democratic governor \u2014 and you\u2019re running as a Democrat \u2014 encountered in Vermont is that while it was an ideal to give everyone health care for all."}
