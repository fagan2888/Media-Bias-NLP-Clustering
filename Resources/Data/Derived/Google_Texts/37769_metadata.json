And then Slick Willy can get back to the intern business.\n\nOh, and if you thought Obama was bad, just wait until Wall Street\u2019s Devil in Prada assumes control of the Oval Office.\n\nPathological Liar Extraordinaire\n\nMark Twain once said: \u201cPoliticians and diapers must be changed often, and for the same reason.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that politicians lie.\n\nIt\u2019s what they\u2019re designed to do.\n\nFor example, Obama lied about Obamacare when he famously said, \u201cIf you like your insurance plan, you can keep your insurance plan.\u201d\n\nNot sure if that beats President Bill Clinton\u2019s now classic, \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.\u201d\u200b\n\nBut it\u2019s pretty close.\n\nObama also lied when he promised that Obamacare would reduce healthcare premiums by $2,500 per year.\n\nInstead, average premiums have skyrocketed. For some groups, the rate hike has been as much as 78%.\n\nAnd he lied when he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t raise taxes once.\u201d\n\nObamacare is jam-packed with more hidden taxes than we can count\u2026 or even figure out.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Obamacare.\n\nA few years ago, he said: \u201cWe have to turn the page on the bubble and bust mentality that created this mess,\u201d referring to the 2008 financial collapse.\n\nBut he knows damn well how that mess was created.\n\nHe knows the Federal Reserve is responsible for the bubbles and the busts of the last 15 years.\n\nAnd if you think he\u2019s bad, just wait until you see Hillary in the White House\u2026\n\nWhen she gives a speech, the lies come so fast and so furious, I can\u2019t keep track. An encyclopedia of Hillary lies might be a bestseller\u2026 or just useful as toilet paper.\n\nAre You Ready for the Deep State\u2019s Candidate?\n\nLook, I think Hillary is a certified crook. From the cattle futures scam in the early days to the $153 million paid to her and Slick Willy over the last 15 years by Wall Street banks, it\u2019s corruption on par with the Sopranos.\n\nWhat\u2019s really shocking is that she has a real chance at getting to the White House\u2026 even though her email scandal should have already put her in prison.\n\nBut not so fast\u2026\n\nAccording to the latest Rasmussen Reports survey, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump and Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton are tied nationally.\n\nIs there a glimmer of hope?\n\nAt this point, it could go either way.\n\nBut Trump isn\u2019t just up against Hillary.\n\nHe\u2019s also up against the immensely powerful Deep State.\n\nYou see, for the past few decades, it hasn\u2019t really mattered who was in the White House.\n\nPresidents are mere marionettes controlled by the Wall Street bankers, the big corporations and the military industrial complex.\n\nThat\u2019s no conspiracy, just fact.\n\nThey give orders. Our elected \u201crepresentatives\u201d obey\u2026 then check their bank accounts for their snack money.\n\nThis year could be different, though.\n\nTrump is a wild card. Nobody knows if he will take orders from the Deep State. And the powers that be are clearly concerned Trump might take their power levers.\n\nMeanwhile, Hillary is the establishment candidate. Even noted libertarian Charles Koch is touting her. She has been vetted by the Deep State and has amassed a massive fortune for her loyalty.\n\nHowever, if Trump can unmask her as the crook she is, maybe he\u2019ll have a chance. But it\u2019s going to be a tough fight.\n\nHe\u2019s up against a massive amount of vitriol. Have you seen the Trump protest videos? They\u2019re loaded with topless girls screaming expletives, Mexican flag waving and the destruction of police cars. It\u2019s a sad narrative about modern day America.\n\nBut don\u2019t get me wrong.\n\nI\u2019m not ruling out Trump.\n\nI\u2019m simply pointing out the system is rigged. It\u2019s likely we\u2019ll just get more of the same in the next eight years.\n\nI\u2019m talking about more lies\u2026\n\nMore taxes\u2026\n\nMore market manipulations leading to boom and busts\u2026\n\nMore government boondoggles, like negative interest rates that will hurt retirees and the middle class.\n\nAnd there\u2019s nothing you can do to change that.\n\nThe best we can do is to have a strategy that can profit from whatever is happening in the markets.\n\nThat means we have to be ready for up, down and surprise markets.\n\nNo one can predict the election. And no one can predict market direction.\n\nBut there are ways to get on the right side of trends\u2026 and make some money.\n\nIn a crazy world, where common sense has ceased to be common, that\u2019s the best we can do.\n\nPlease send your feedback to coveluncensored@agorafinancial.com. Send me your thoughts on the upcoming election\u2026 and anything else.\n\nRegards,\n\nMichael Covel\n\nfor The Daily Reckoning", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michael Covel reveals the Deep State's favorite candidate.. and why the next eight years will lead to more corruption, lies and market manipulation.", "_token": "349e65554f", "twitter": {"description": "Michael Covel reveals the Deep State's favorite candidate.. and why the next eight years will lead to more corruption, lies and market manipulation.", "creator": "@DailyReckoning", "image": "http://dailyreckoning.com/dr-content/uploads/2016/05/Hillary-Clinton.jpeg", "title": "The Devil Is Coming to the White House", "site": "@DailyReckoning", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Reckoning", "description": "Michael Covel reveals the Deep State's favorite candidate.. and why the next eight years will lead to more corruption, lies and market manipulation.", "title": "The Devil Is Coming to the White House", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://dailyreckoning.com/dr-content/uploads/2016/05/Hillary-Clinton.jpeg", "height": 400}, "updated_time": "2016-05-03T10:05:17-04:00", "url": "http://dailyreckoning.com/devil-coming-white-house/", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "x5-ya0Q-OQWibgURcZJ2JNkVa8zSG3TJQfwGy_RqTH0", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailyReckoning", "section": "Covel Uncensored", "tag": "White House Correspondents Dinner", "published_time": "2016-05-02T12:04:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-03T10:05:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "You see, for the past few decades, it hasn\u2019t really mattered who was in the White House.\nWhat\u2019s really shocking is that she has a real chance at getting to the White House\u2026 even though her email scandal should have already put her in prison.\nThe Devil Is Coming to the White HouseAt this weekend\u2019s White House Correspondents Dinner, President Obama made a prediction:\u201cNext year at this time, someone else will be standing here in this very spot, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who SHE will be.\u201dYou know I\u2019m not a fan of predictions, but he\u2019s probably right.\nConsidering that more and more Americans support socialism, are looking for \u201cfreebies\u201d from the government, and expect someone else to take care of them\u2026I think Hillary has a fantastic shot at the White House.\nLook, I think Hillary is a certified crook."}
