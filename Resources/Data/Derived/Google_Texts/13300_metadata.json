Whole grains comprise the entire grain kernel, including the bran, germ, and endosperm, whereas refined grains only contain the endosperm. The difference is huge, as the process that refined grains go through removes dietary fiber \u2014 the healthy part \u2014 iron, and many B vitamins, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Whole grains usually come in the form of whole-wheat breads, brown rice, oatmeal, popcorn, and quinoa.\n\nEating whole grains, which contain dietary fiber, makes us full faster, speeds up metabolism \u2014 helping prevent constipation \u2014 and helps control one\u2019s weight, according to the National Institutes of Health. Whole grains have been tied to a whole range of health benefits. A study from last month found that a high-fiber diet can help prevent asthma and allergies. Another one from December found that eating foods high in dietary fiber could lower the risk of cardiovascular disease \u2014adding fiber to one\u2019s diet every day \u201cmay turn out to be the most important nutrition recommendation of them all,\u201d Dr. Robert Baron, a professor of medicine at the University of California, said.\n\nThe current study, which was funded by the cereal company General Mills, looked at data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. It found that 39 percent of people ages 18 and under, and 42 percent of adults ate not even one serving of whole grains. Meanwhile, only three percent of kids and eight percent of adults ate the recommended three, one-ounce servings or more of whole grains each day. \u201cMost people do not consume whole grains in amounts that can be most beneficial,\u201d Marla Reicks, study leader from the University of Minnesota, St. Paul, told Reuters. \u201cAlso, many people, even health professionals, are confused about the relationship between whole grain and fiber.\u201d\n\nThe USDA recommends that children and adults get a total of five to eight servings of grains each day, with half of them being whole grains. A serving, called an ounce-equivalent, can include anything from one slice of bread to a half-cup of rice, pasta, or cereal. In terms of fiber intake, the Institute of Medicine recommends 38 grams and 25 grams for men and women ages 50 and younger, respectively. Men and women over 50 should get 30 grams and 21 grams, respectively, according to Mayo Clinic. The USDA advises that consumers read nutrition labels to find fiber content in foods. Consumers should also be wary of food labels saying \u201cmulti-grain,\u201d \u201c100% wheat,\u201d \u201cseven-grain,\u201d or \u201cbran,\u201d because the USDA says that these might not actually be whole-grains.\n\nSource: Reicks M, Albertson A, Joshi N, et al.
