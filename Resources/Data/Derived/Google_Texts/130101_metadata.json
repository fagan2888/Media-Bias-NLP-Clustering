The 31-year-old man had become a trooper in 1968 after serving three years in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was a highly regarded and decorated trooper.\n\nCarpenter was married to Phyllis and the couple had three young children, ages 9, 7, and 4. They lived in Lafayette. He was a quiet, religious man who didn\u2019t drink alcohol. He wanted to make a career of being a CSP trooper.\n\nCarpenter was assigned to the Colorado State Patrol\u2019s Broomfield district that Thursday, Dec. 27, 1973. He worked the Interstate 25 corridor.\n\n9:58 a.m.\n\nHe drove to the side of U.S. 36 near Broadway that morning. A car was pulled off on the shoulder of the highway. Carpenter was either intending to see if he could help a stranded motorist or he had seen something that appeared to be suspicious.\n\nHe did not make a radio report that he had pulled over at the time. Witnesses would later tell police that they saw Carpenter driving a patrol car with two men in the back seat at about the same time.\n\nThat morning at 9:58 a.m., Carpenter received a call from a dispatcher to go to an accident at East 58th Avenue and I-25. He told the dispatcher that he was at Interstate 70 and Havana at the time.\n\nThat was somewhat odd. He was about eight miles east from the area he was supposed to patrol.\n\n10:04 a.m.\n\nA dispatcher called again six minutes after the first call to ask Carpenter if he was going to the accident.\n\n\u201c10-4\u2026I\u2019m on my way,\u201d he replied tersely.\n\nMinutes later, a Denver police officer saw the patrol car in a parking lot behind the Lakes apartment complex at 13870 Albrook Drive in Montbello in northeast Denver.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Broomfield,Colorado State Patrol,denver,Denver police,fingerprints,kidnapped,Marine Corp,Montbello,Rocky Flats,Stapleton Airport,Thomas Ray Carpenter,trooper", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Cold Cases", "description": "Denver: State trooper kidnapped, shot in the head", "title": "Denver: State trooper kidnapped, shot in the head", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/2014/11/01/denver-state-trooper-gunned/9499/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/files/2014/11/trooperThomasCarpenter.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Denver: State trooper kidnapped, shot in the head", "title": "Denver: State trooper kidnapped, shot in the head", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/2014/11/01/denver-state-trooper-gunned/9499/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/files/2014/11/trooperThomasCarpenter.jpg", "creator": "@kmitchelldp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Denver: State trooper kidnapped, shot in the head"}, "article_summary": "By the day he was kidnapped and murdered, Thomas Ray Carpenter had been a Colorado state trooper for five years.\nWitnesses would later tell police that they saw Carpenter driving a patrol car with two men in the back seat at about the same time.\nMinutes later, a Denver police officer saw the patrol car in a parking lot behind the Lakes apartment complex at 13870 Albrook Drive in Montbello in northeast Denver.\nThe 31-year-old man had become a trooper in 1968 after serving three years in the U.S. Marine Corps.\nCarpenter was assigned to the Colorado State Patrol\u2019s Broomfield district that Thursday, Dec. 27, 1973."}
