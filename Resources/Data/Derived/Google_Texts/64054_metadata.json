Abrams. Abrams recently addressed his support for the service at CinemaCon, saying the industry has to adapt to keep itself viable.\n\nBut those feelings aren't shared across the industry. Director James Cameron said, \"It's essential for movies to be offered exclusively in theaters on their initial release.\"\n\nWhich was obviously echoed by theater companies and movie distributors, which see Screening Room as a serious threat. But the service doesn't cut them out entirely.\n\nStreaming Room would set aside up to $20 per movie for theater owners and pay distributors and production companies for the films.\n\nParker reportedly did land a few closed-door meetings at CinemaCon, so even though companies don't seem excited about it, they are definitely paying attention.\n\nThat could be a smart move because streaming has proven to be a pretty hard trend to fight. Just look at what's happened with television and music.\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images and clips from Warner Bros. Pictures / \"Batman V.
