On a 100-point scale, the Yum chain earned a 79 satisfaction score, followed by 78 for Starbucks and 76 for McDonald's.\n\nThe report also found that highly satisfied clients were 81% more likely to prefer the brand over others and 75% more likely to make another purchase there.\n\nALSO:\n\nTGI Fridays may be sold by owner Carlson\n\nGreg Dollarhyde is Veggie Grill's 'chief energizing officer'\n\nSome restaurants serve up iPads for customers to place orders", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Fast-food workers protest for higher wages", "Description": "Fast-food workers, union organizers and community supporters are expected to protest nationwide for higher pay Thursday as the restaurant industry criticizes the campaign as \u201cpart of an ongoing effort to replace fact with fiction while ignoring simple truths.\u201d   At 6 a.m. at a McDonald's in Florence,...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Fast-food workers, union organizers and community supporters are expected to protest nationwide for higher pay Thursday as the restaurant industry criticizes the campaign as \u201cpart of an ongoing effort to replace fact with fiction while ignoring simple truths.\u201d", "title": "Fast-food workers protest for higher wages", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mo-fast-food-protests-20131205-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-52a0a328/turbine/la-fi-mo-fast-food-protests-20131205", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp11.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/78442224", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2013-12-05", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbace\"", "article_summary": "But in a statement, the National Council of Chain Restaurants disagreed.\n\u201cKeep your burgers, keep your fries, make our wages supersized,\u201d they chanted continuously, as passing cars honked in rhythm.\nBefore and during the Black Friday shopping bonanza last week, Wal-Mart workers and their sympathizers protested with similar demands.\n\u201cIt is a well studied and accepted fact that beyond teenagers and some part-timers, the vast majority of restaurant workers make more than the starting wage,\u201d said Rob Green, the group's executive director.\nSwaddled against the chill in beanies and hoodies, they crowded the sidewalk bordering the eatery as employees inside prepped for customers."}
