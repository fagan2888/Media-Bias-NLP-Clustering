But proposed CMS reporting requirements for doctors who treat the condition are drawing mixed reviews.\n\nUnder the requirements, set to take effect in October, providers must take several steps to treat the condition, including measuring the patient's lactate level, obtaining blood cultures and administrating broad-spectrum antibiotics. Providers must take these steps within the first three hours of care.\n\nSome providers, however, take issue with the federal government's definition of severe sepsis, which is significantly different from the consensus definition among providers, Scott Weingart, M.D., an emergency physician at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, wrote in a blog post.\n\nIt's \"pretty unacceptable to hold every hospital in the U.S. accountable to an arbitrary definition that has not been tested in large-scale trials,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, he said the new measures will lead doctors to treat patients for sepsis when they may not actually have it.\n\nBut Christopher Seymour, M.D., of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, told MedPageToday that sepsis is difficult to define by nature, because there is no single concrete identifier for the condition. And research shows that for every one-hour delay in administrating antibiotics, there is a three percent to seven percent increase in the odds that the patient will die from sepsis.\n\n\"Sepsis is under recognized and underdiagnosed,\" he said, \"and anything we can do to promote doctors and hospitals to take better care of patients with sepsis is serving the greater good.\"\n\nSeymour recently co-published in JAMA a set of best practices for the condition, which lays out key features of any effective approach such as IV antibiotics, assessment and reassessment of severity and other complications.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the requirements (.pdf)\n\n- here's Weingart's blog post\n\n- check out the MedPageToday article\n\n- read the JAMA article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSepsis major driver of readmissions, mortality and costs\n\nHow Main Line Health cut sepsis mortality rates by 55%\n\nSepsis rivals pneumonia, heart failure for readmissions\n\nWhat hospitals can do to tackle the deadly threat of sepsis\n\nSepsis contributes to half of hospital deaths\n\nEarly, personalized interventions could prevent sepsis readmissions\n\nHospitals, government take on sepsis and other drug-resistant infections\n\nSepsis mortality rates on the decline", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sepsis is one of the top drivers of costs, readmissions and mortality for hospitals,\u00a0accounting for up to half of all hospital deaths,\u00a0but until recently it has not received the same scrutiny as other top causes\u00a0from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Sepsis is one of the top drivers of costs, readmissions and mortality for hospitals,\u00a0accounting for up to half of all hospital deaths,\u00a0but until recently it has not received the same scrutiny as other top causes\u00a0from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.", "title": "Critics complain proposed sepsis reporting rules could lead to overtreatment", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/critics-complain-proposed-sepsis-reporting-rules-could-lead-overtreatment/2015-08-20", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Best Practices,Care Delivery,hospital mortality,hospital-acquired conditions (HAC),hospital-acquired infections (HAI),Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,reporting requirements,Sepsis,sepsis mortality rates", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "In addition, he said the new measures will lead doctors to treat patients for sepsis when they may not actually have it.\nBut proposed CMS reporting requirements for doctors who treat the condition are drawing mixed reviews.\n\"Sepsis is under recognized and underdiagnosed,\" he said, \"and anything we can do to promote doctors and hospitals to take better care of patients with sepsis is serving the greater good.\"\nUnder the requirements, set to take effect in October, providers must take several steps to treat the condition, including measuring the patient's lactate level, obtaining blood cultures and administrating broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nIt's \"pretty unacceptable to hold every hospital in the U.S. accountable to an arbitrary definition that has not been tested in large-scale trials,\" he said."}
