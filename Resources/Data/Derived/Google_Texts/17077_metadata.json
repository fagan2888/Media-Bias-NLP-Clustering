But the law routed the penalty \u2014 and subsidies that help pay for insurance \u2014 through the tax system, assigning major new responsibilities to the Internal Revenue Service, an agency struggling with a shrunken budget, diminished staff and plummeting levels of customer service.\n\nAt a time when people still may be asking what health insurance has to do with their taxes, those seeking help from the IRS this tax season face historically long telephone holds, slow written responses and limited in-person help, according to the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an organization representing taxpayers inside the IRS.\n\nThe IRS has warned that the combination of new work and fewer employees could delay refunds. A miscalculation on health-related forms sent to 820,000 people is already delaying refunds for many. The IRS didn't make the mistake, but the incorrect forms contain information people are supposed to report on their taxes, creating confusion. Some tax experts worry that more mistakes could be on the way as the agency processes millions of new forms.\n\n\"Overall, I do not believe they're as prepared as they could have been,\" said Kristy Maitre, an Iowa tax specialist who ended a 28-year career at the IRS last year, when she was a liaison to tax preparers for the agency. \"I think there will be issues, but we aren't going to know what those are until we get to the end of the filing season.\"\n\nMost of the country's 150 million taxpayers just need to check a box on their tax form indicating they had coverage last year. No one needs to send proof of insurance. Insurers and employers were supposed to submit proof this year that the people they covered were insured, but that requirement was delayed until next year, according to the IRS website.\n\n(Chicago Tribune Graphics)\n\nBut there are additional filing requirements for about a quarter of taxpayers, according to the Treasury Department. Those who didn't have insurance last year must claim an exemption or pay a penalty. Those who received subsidies, which come as tax credits that reduce monthly premiums, need to show they received the right amount each month.\n\nThe Supreme Court is weighing a legal challenge that could strike down the subsidies in Illinois and about three dozen other states, with a decision expected in June. For now, the subsidies \u2014 and their tax requirements \u2014 remain in place.\n\nHow many people know any of that remains a question.\n\n\"I think there's quite a bit lacking in people's awareness of the law, the implications of the law and the opportunities of the law,\" said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt, a company that processes about 2 million tax returns each year.\n\nYet as of Feb. 21, just 40 percent of taxpayers who called the IRS reached a representative, and those who got through waited an average 26 minutes on hold \u2014 the worst level of service since the agency adopted its current performance measures in 2001, National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson said in written testimony to a Senate subcommittee.\n\nThe wait time should be less than five minutes, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen testified to the subcommittee. Koskinen said the health law and other new requirements have added significant new work for the agency.\n\n\"I remain deeply concerned that the significant reductions in the IRS budget will degrade the agency's ability to continue to deliver on its mission during filing season and beyond,\" Koskinen said in written Senate testimony.\n\nThe IRS, which declined to answer questions for this story, had about 1,200 employees dedicated to the health law at the start of the tax season, said James McTigue Jr., the Government Accountability Office's director of tax issues. The agency had stated it would need 2,046 workers dedicated to the law for the 2015 fiscal year, but Congress didn't allot money for the hires.\n\nSome members of Congress have said the IRS should spend its money more efficiently. Rep. Ander Crenshaw, a Florida Republican who heads an appropriations subcommittee, told Koskinen in a Wednesday hearing that the agency had overspent on executive travel, conferences and employee bonuses as well as mismanaging funds in other ways.\n\n\"We deliberately lowered the IRS funding to a level that will make the IRS think twice about what you are doing and why you are doing it,\" Crenshaw said.\n\nCongress has reduced the agency's budget by 10 percent since 2010 and the agency has reduced its staff from about 95,000 people to about 83,000, according to the Taxpayer Advocate Service.\n\nIn addition to staffing concerns, some experts worry that technical systems being used for the first time this year carry the potential for delays and mistakes administering the health law's subsidies and penalties.\n\nThree to 5 percent of the nation's taxpayers received the tax credits for insurance last year, according to the Treasury Department. The credits were based on income estimates for the year, and people who earned more or less than expected now either owe the government money or are supposed to get money back.\n\nInsurance marketplaces send planholders 1095-A forms that they use to report any tax credits. The IRS verifies the reported information against Department of Health and Human Services data using an automated system.\n\nThe system is similar to others the IRS uses to match tax returns with external records, such as W-2s, but the IRS doesn't normally start matching those records until July, after tax season is over, McTigue said. The agency is checking returns against marketplace data during the filing season, increasing the potential of delayed refunds, he said.\n\nMaitre, the Iowa tax specialist, worries the agency could make mistakes matching the forms.\n\n\"There's a potential of a lot of errors with that,\" she said, noting that discrepancies often result in automatic violation notices to which taxpayers must respond or face penalties.\n\nThe IRS is also administering the penalties for people who didn't have insurance last year, as well as processing forms for those who were exempt from the coverage requirement because of low income or other conditions.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "It's Obamacare's first tax season.
