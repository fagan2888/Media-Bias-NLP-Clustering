Mike Rogers, who represents Lee County and much of east Alabama in Washington, counters that Americans actually chose a divided Congress in the 2010 midterm elections. That\u2019s when Republicans won control of the House, breaking Democratic control in the House, Senate and presidency.\n\nFor now, Rogers said many Americans would rather have a divided Congress that does little instead of a Democratic-controlled Congress that enacts liberal policies.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s because (voters) want to put the brakes on,\u201d Rogers said Tuesday afternoon during a town hall meeting in Opelika. \u201cThey want the government to leave them alone now.\u201d\n\nRogers touched on core conservative themes during his Tuesday visit to Lee County, where he spoke at the East Alabama Society for Human Resource Management luncheon and then at East Alabama Medical Center.\n\nRogers predicts that Republicans will win control of the Senate in the November election, and says there\u2019s a good chance a Republican will win the presidency in 2016. He cites recent political history, and the rarity of a party winning the presidency three times in a row.\n\nRogers says repealing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and \u201csignificant\u201d tax reform likely wouldn\u2019t happen until at least 2017, if a Republican replaces President Barack Obama in the White House. Rogers also predicted the Affordable Care Act \u201cwould collapse on its own weight.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said it\u2019s important for Republicans to win the House and Senate this November.\n\n\u201cWhen we get the Senate, we\u2019ll be able to control the budget,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nRogers said funding for agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) needs to be cut.\n\n\u201cWe intend to help some people find other employment,\u201d he said.\n\nRogers also called for increased military funding, citing conflicts in Ukraine and Iraq as examples for the need of a strong military. He said national defense spending has \u201cshrunk to a level that is dangerous,\u201d and that countries such as Russia, North Korea and China do not fear the United States.\n\nRogers, who is Chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, said the military budget has historically been 5 to 6 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Now, according to the World Bank, it is less than 4 percent.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s dangerous. That\u2019s Western European levels of spending,\u201d he said.\n\nRogers said the U.S. should fund the military at previous levels so it remains a superpower.\n\n\u201cIf we get into a fight with another country, make sure it\u2019s not a fair fight and we fight in their country,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to be afraid to mess with the United States.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "OANow.com", "description": "Many Americans grumble about what is often described as a \u201cdo nothing Congress.\u201d", "title": "Rep.
