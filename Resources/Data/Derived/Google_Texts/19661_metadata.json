Why? Because they are or might be predators getting their jollies out of watching other people of the gender from which they have \"trans-gendered\" go to the bathroom.\n\nMeanwhile, some 49 million people across Africa are starving. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are loose in the world with no place to go. The Islamic State continues its death grip in the Middle East. China is getting away with selling expired and unrefrigerated vaccines. North Korea now has the ability to mount nuclear warheads on long-range missiles. Another war broke out between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. And the Ebola virus has made a comeback in Guinea and Sierra Leone.\n\nHere at home, classes are canceled for some 400,000 students in Chicago after a teacher walk-out over school funding. The Supreme Court is divided over whether or not religiously affiliated institutions can be exempt from the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate. We remain the only civilized nation that doesn't require maternity leave. Our House of Representatives kills a bill allowing students to borrow at .75 percent and advances a bill that gives a multi-billion dollar tax cut to the rich. According to figures from the U.S. Department of Labor, since 1978 the cost of college tuition has increased by 1,120 percent, medical care by 601 percent, food by 244 percent and housing by 380 percent.\n\nIn that same period of time, the pay of a typical worker rose by just 10 percent and minimum-wage workers' fell by 5.5 percent \u2014 but the average CEO's income rose by 937 percent. Just recently Congress said it needs a raise because members cannot afford to live \"decently\" on $174,000 a year.\n\nAnd yet North Carolina calls an emergency meeting to deal with a problem that doesn't exist. What restroom do they think trans people have been using all these years? How many little girls or boys have been raped or sexually abused by transgender people in these bathrooms? None. Zero.\n\nWrapping bigotry in such bogus fear is sophomoric, unkind, self-serving and a brand of idiocy that flies in the face of democracy and in this case is ungrounded in any kind of reality.\n\nHow can Republicans justify disallowing transgender people to use their appropriate bathroom as a matter of public safety while allowing \u2014 even encouraging \u2014 people to carry assault weapons into grocery stores, bars and parks? (But not their own convention.)\n\nA police officer in Texas just last week posted on Facebook: \"I'd beat a trans woman unconscious if she tried to share a bathroom with my daughter.\"\n\nIt takes only a teaspoon of sensitivity and compassion to imagine the emotional suffering of people who know themselves to be different than they appear physically, soft targets for bullying and the brunt of jokes from the cruel-minded.\n\n\"Republicans who fear going to the bathroom with transgender people certainly realize, at least in their saner moments, that they do it all the time and just don't know it. If Caitlyn Jenner walked into a men's bathroom, there would be bedlam. Chaz Bono in a ladies' room would cause a ruckus.\n\nEmergency meetings to \"fix\" potty problems born out of bigotry and fear make a mockery of civility and political responsibility. People who are so threatened by the idea of transgender people using their rightful bathroom can pee at home, just in case.\n\nWe should get our minds out of the toilet and tackle the real problems.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Real problems not found in restrooms", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/opinion/columnists/ina-hughs/real-problems-not-found-in-restrooms-31f1620d-a781-20ef-e053-0100007fd4ec-378015761.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/ina_8671518_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 419}, "type": "article", "description": "What restroom do they think trans people have been using all these years?", "title": "Real problems not found in restrooms"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/ina_8671518_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "Real problems not found in restrooms", "description": "What restroom do they think trans people have been using all these years?", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "We should get our minds out of the toilet and tackle the real problems.\nEmergency meetings to \"fix\" potty problems born out of bigotry and fear make a mockery of civility and political responsibility.\nWhat restroom do they think trans people have been using all these years?\nPeople who are so threatened by the idea of transgender people using their rightful bathroom can pee at home, just in case.\nHere at home, classes are canceled for some 400,000 students in Chicago after a teacher walk-out over school funding."}
