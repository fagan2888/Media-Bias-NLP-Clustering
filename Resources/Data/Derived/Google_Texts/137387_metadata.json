Mary Landrieu lost her seat by double digits to Republican challenger Bill Cassidy. That Republican pickup means the GOP gained nine seats in the Senate, commanding a 54-46 majority starting in January. Senate Republicans are already debating whether or not they should restore the filibuster. Attention has also shifted to the 2016 election. According to WaPo,Rick Santorum is running for president again and a new Q-poll shows Hillary Clinton \u201cmows down\u201d Chris Christie and other GOP presidential hopefuls in the Garden State.\n\nGruber Hearing: Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber was in the hot seat on Tuesday to explain his controversial comments regarding the Affordable Care Act. During the House Oversight Committee hearing, Chairman Darrell Issa, Rep. Trey Gowdy and other congressional Republicans hammered the MIT professor for his role in deceiving the American people to pass the law. Gruber repeatedly used a rehearsed apology for his \u201cinexcusable comments\u201d but insisted he was not the \u201carchitect\u201d of the law, despite being paid more than $5 million for his consultation work law through federal and state grants.\n\nInterrogation Report: Senate Democrats released a highly partisan and controversial report this week on the CIA\u2019s Enhanced Interrogation Techniques post-9/11. The report concludes that the methods used were not effective in acquiring intelligence\u2014a finding that was slammed by CIA operatives and called an \u2018egregious falsehood\u2019 by the man who oversaw the program. CIA Director John Brennan also pushed back, providing context for why EITs were adopted in the first place. He admitted, however, that the causal relationship between the use of EITs and intelligence is \u201cunknowable.\u201d Meanwhile, Americans working on counterterrorism operations overseas are on high alert, as Republicans warned the report\u2019s release could endanger their lives, incite violence, and be used by terrorists as a recruitment tool. And finally, in an attempt to stay relevant, war on women expert Sandra Fluke weighed in, making an unintelligible comparison between the report and sexual assault/police brutality against men of color.\n\nCromnibus: Sen. Elizabeth Warren led the liberal crusade against the spending bill all week over business-friendly deregulatory provisions, but the media covered her plan to shut down the government very differently than they did last year\u2019s. The $1.1 trillion spending bill passed in the House, 219-206, with just hours until the deadline. Earlier in the day it was nearly killed on a procedural vote, but President Obama had Boehner\u2019s back. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is \u201cenormously disappointed\u201d with the legislation over language she says weakens restrictions in Dodd-Frank. Marijuana supporters in D.C. are also upset, as the deal reached blocks legalization in the District. The bill has now moved over to the Senate, where lawmakers have given themselves a two-day extension of current funding to get the bill passed. Sen. Jeff Sessions has vowed to fight against the amnesty funding in the bill.\n\nOn the Hill: Retiring Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), bid an emotional farewell speech on the floor Thursday. And Sen. Barbara Boxer, one of the Senate\u2019s most liberal and insufferable members, is planning to step down, according to sources close to the California Democrat.\n\nImmigration: President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty will be paid for by millions of legal immigrants, giving illegal immigrants a free and expedited path to legal status. Twenty-four states have now joined Texas\u2019 lawsuit challenging the president\u2019s immigration program, which could be stopped before it even starts if the motion prevails. Interestingly, the judge hearing the challenge foresaw this summer\u2019s humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\nHealth Care: The shortage of primary care physicians continues under Obamacare, which is more unpopular than ever before. Yet somehow, former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius thinks all the law needs is a rebranding. And with tax season on the horizon, the CBO said it will be a chaotic and frustrating time for many Obamacare consumers.\n\nGlobal Security: The Islamic State, which John Kerry is now referring to as \u2018Daesh,\u2019 claims to have a \u2018radioactive device\u2019 in Europe. The terrorist group is responsible for the most deaths worldwide in November, when jihadists conducted 664 attacks that killed more than 5,000 people in 14 countries. While Islamic extremism shows no signs of abating, morale in the U.S. military is alarmingly low.\n\nMedia and Culture: Like World War II hero Louie Zamperini\u2019s survival, the film \u201cUnbroken\u201d took years of patience and endurance. Zamperini\u2019s daughter doubts anyone today could survive what her father did.\n\nIn Other News: Judicial Watch documents show Lois Lerner, former head of tax exempt groups at the IRS, met with the Election Crimes Division at the DOJ just one month before the 2010 midterms. Over in The Badger State, unions are up in arms as Wisconsin GOP weighs right-to-work law.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphics by Feven Amenu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.  \r\n.05/26/2016 18:48:47PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - The Friday Filibuster", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/12/12/friday-roundup-n1930679", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/12/12/18.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - The Friday Filibuster", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/12/12/friday-roundup-n1930679", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/12/12/18.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Friday Filibuster , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.\nSenate Republicans are already debating whether or not they should restore the filibuster.\nInterrogation Report: Senate Democrats released a highly partisan and controversial report this week on the CIA\u2019s Enhanced Interrogation Techniques post-9/11.\n60% of Americans oppose President Obama bypassing Congress to make changes to immigration law.\n52% of Americans believe it\u2019s more important to protect gun rights, compared to 46% who say gun control is more important."}
