(WTHI) \u2013 You\u2019ve made your end of the year donations to charity. Now, it\u2019s time to find out what credits you may claim on your tax return. The 2015 tax season is right around the corner, and the Affordable Care Act could change how you file this year\u2019s return. Those who have insurance could be in line for a significant tax credit.\n\nThe US has a massive tax code, about 5 million pages long. There are major tax credits that you may be eligible for, but you may not know about it. A common credit you may be eligible for is the Earned Income Tax Credit. You can get it if you are single or if you have children or college students in your home.\n\n\u201cIf you have children in your home with you and your income is below $53,000, you\u2019ll be eligible for some EIC, and EICt can exceed $6000,\u201d said Andy Stadler, who is an enrolled agent and owns Stadler\u2019s Tax Service.\n\nHe also talked about the child dependent credit, which you may also claim if you have an adult dependent, up to $3000 per dependent. If your kids are 16 or younger, see if you qualify for an additional $1000 per child.\n\nThen there\u2019s something called the Additional Child Tax Credit.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re eligible for the Chlid Tax Credit, also look to see if you\u2019re eligible for the Additional Child Tax Credit,\u201d Stadler suggested.\n\nThere\u2019s also a saver\u2019s credit for those of you who are putting away money for retirement via an IRA or a retirement plan at work. How about the American Opportunity Tax Credit? It\u2019s a College Tax Credit, up to $2500 credit that you may claim for yourself, your spouse or children.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThis is brand new and could be really substantial,\u201d said Stadler. \u201cIt could be over $10,000, but you\u2019ve got to meet certain income limits, and you gotta have healthcare type insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a family of four, if they have an income of less than $94,000, they\u2019ll be eligible for some kind of healthcare tax credits. Either they can get a refund on their tax return, or they get them throughout the year to help pay for healthcare.\u201d\n\nSo, there\u2019s a lot to consider. Consult your certified tax professional or get to work on your return early so that you may take advantage of the credits that might come your way.\n\nCongress cut the IRS budget by $341 million heading into this tax season. Stadler says this resulted in cuts in taxpayer services, which means longer wait times if you call the IRS with tax-related questions.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Leading the Way in Terre Haute and the Wabash Valley with the most accurate and reliable news, weather, and sports coverage, along with the latest breaking news and severe weather coverage.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488538858", "og": {"site_name": "WTHITV.com", "description": "The 2015 tax season is right around the corner, and the Affordable Care Act could change how you file this year\u2019s return.
