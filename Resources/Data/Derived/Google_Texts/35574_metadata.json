(OTCBB: MHCC) through its wholly owned subsidiary, Millennium Medical Devices, LLC is assisting primary care physicians to offer their patients breakthrough diagnostics that are reimbursable by Medicare and private insurance companies.\n\nAt a time when physician practices are challenged by increasing patient needs and falling practice revenues, Millennium Healthcare has positioned itself to provide innovative solutions by offering an advanced early detection diagnostic assessment test for cardiovascular disease, currently the number one cause of death in the United States. This test not only provides physicians with a new and innovative way to better provide preventative and early detection health management and care to their patients, but also provides opportunities for additional revenue streams. Millennium Healthcare has contracted with numerous US based healthcare organizations representing over 1,000 locations that will be utilizing this cardiovascular assessment test. Millennium Medical Devices, a Millennium Healthcare wholly owned subsidiary, has secured the exclusive marketing rights to the VasoScan cardiovascular assessment test.\n\nWith the passing of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in January 2014, costs associated with certain preventative medical testing will no longer be applied to the deductible portion of a patient's medical insurance. This results in Medicare and private insurance and reimbursement agents being responsible for 100% of the cost of these tests. The Company believes that this single change may create a tremendous surge in the demand for and utilization of early detection diagnostic testing and may create and bolster the need to make these tests available to physician practices and ultimately, millions of additional patients across the nation.\n\nVasoScan is a breakthrough FDA cleared diagnostic test for the early detection of cardiovascular disease. The procedure is non-invasive and uses a small LED clip and sensor placed on the finger. The test requires three minutes and is easily performed in the 11-minute window when a technician takes patients' vital signs while the patient waits for the doctor. \"The test is designed to help doctors identify high risk cardiovascular issues years in advance,\" says Chris Amadola, President of Millennium Healthcare. If a positive reading occurs while using VasoScan for early detection of cardiovascular disease, a follow up visit would be scheduled for an advanced imaging procedure to pinpoint the problem. The doctor and or specialist could then order the best and most cost-effective treatment available to the patient. By detecting a cardiovascular problem early, VasoScan has the potential to save millions of lives as well as billions of dollars. The Company believes VasoScan could potentially become a \"Standard of Care\" with general practitioners in conjunction with blood pressure and cholesterol testing in the assessment of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe VasoScan system immediately delivers a report showing:\n\nHeart Rate Variability\n\nHeart Rate (Average, Highest, Lowest)\n\nOverall Tone of Autonomic Nervous System\n\nBalance of Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Tone\n\nPhysical Stress\n\nEmotional Stress\n\nStress Dissolution Ability\n\nStress Score\n\nPhotoplethysmography\n\nAPG (Accelerated Plethysmoraph or 2 nd Derivative) Waveform\n\nDerivative) Waveform DPI (Differential Pulse Wave Index)\n\nCardiac Construction power\n\nArterial Elasticity\n\nRemaining Blood Volume\n\nWave Type (1-7)\n\nBiological Age of the Arteries\n\nVasoScan Advantages\n\nEarly detection of arterial wall elasticity and determination of biological arterial age in less than 5 minutes.\n\nEasy to use, non-operator dependent Software.\n\nMonitors effectiveness of therapeutic intervention.\n\nMonitors arterial wall response to lifestyle changes / reduction of cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nNon-invasive, uses a LED/Photodiode finger probe sensor.\n\nFDA Cleared.\n\nLightweight and Portable (1.5 lbs)\n\nUser friendly and delivers instant report.\n\nAffordable.\n\nCovered by Insurance.\n\nNew Revenue Source for Primary Care Physicians.\n\nAbout Millennium HealthCare Inc.\n\nMillennium HealthCare Inc. through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries provides primary care physician practices, physician groups and healthcare facilities of all sizes with cutting edge medical devices focused primarily on preventive care through early detection.
