CINCINNATI (AP) - The Bengals signed safety Derron Smith of Fresno State on Tuesday, leaving two draft picks under contract.

Smith was Cincinnati’s sixth-round pick. He started 44 games at Fresno State and had 15 interceptions.

Receiver Mario Alford of West Virginia - Cincinnati’s seventh-round pick - also has signed a contract.

The Bengals’ most intriguing signing so far is former Ohio State quarterback Terrelle Pryor, who attended a rookie camp last weekend on a tryout basis and got a deal after impressing the coaches. He’ll have a chance to compete for a job backing up Andy Dalton.

The Bengals also have AJ McCarron and Josh Johnson as backup quarterbacks. McCarron was a fifth-round pick last year, but missed the season with a sore shoulder.
