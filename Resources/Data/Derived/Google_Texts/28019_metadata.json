The school is partially funded by the Bureau of Indian Education and is located on the Passamaquoddy Tribal Reservation of Pleasant Point. It is run by the tribe, and serves some 125 Native American students from Pleasant Point and surrounding areas.\n\nJewell and Duncan toured the school to get a first-hand look at conditions in BIE-funded schools and to see what additional funding is needed for rehabilitation.\n\nThey were showed around the school by principal Michael Chadwick, reported Bangor Daily News. During the tour, BDN said Chadwick pointed out a kitchen range in a special education classroom that is used to help heat the room in the winter.\n\nHe also explained that the school is becoming crowded because of young families having children, BDN reported.\n\nChadwick also expressed to Jewell and Duncan how teachers and other tribal entities work well together to make sure children have the services they need, including counseling.\n\n\u201cIt looks like they\u2019ve got some great things going on at Beatrice Rafferty School,\u201d Jewell said at the conclusion of the tour, reported BDN. She noted that the biggest need was to upgrade the building, which as BDN reports, has been on a list of schools targeted for replacement for 10 years.\n\nIn January, U.S. Reps. Chellie Pingree and Mike Michaud announced a budget that included $18.5 million to replace the Beatrice Rafferty School. The budget that passed included $1 million for planning a new school and the next budget is expected to include $2.2 million toward construction, with the rest coming in subsequent budgets, upon approval, BDN reports.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan toured the Beatrice Rafferty School in Perry, Maine on Monday, August 18", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/20/jewell-and-duncan-see-poor-conditions-passamaquoddy-school-156481", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/jewell-duncan-beatrice-rafferty-school-group.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Jewell and Duncan See Poor Conditions at Passamaquoddy School"}, "abstract": "Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan toured the Beatrice Rafferty School in Perry, Maine on Monday, August 18.", "dc": {"title": "Jewell and Duncan See Poor Conditions at Passamaquoddy School"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/20/jewell-and-duncan-see-poor-conditions-passamaquoddy-school-156481", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point, Native American students, Native American Education, Bureau of Indian Education, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, Arne Duncan", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-20T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Jewell and Duncan See Poor Conditions at Passamaquoddy School"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4ec\"", "article_summary": "Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan toured the Beatrice Rafferty School in Perry, Maine on Monday, August 18.\n\u201cIt looks like they\u2019ve got some great things going on at Beatrice Rafferty School,\u201d Jewell said at the conclusion of the tour, reported BDN.\nJewell and Duncan toured the school to get a first-hand look at conditions in BIE-funded schools and to see what additional funding is needed for rehabilitation.\nIn January, U.S. Reps.
