Complimentary trial through mid-June.\n\nHillary Clinton (left) pushed back on the attacks from her invigorated opponent Bernie Sanders | Getty 5 takeaways from the US Democratic debate Clinton ditches the easy demeanor, Sanders goes full indignant, and the crowd loves Obama.\n\nHillary Clinton, facing an unexpectedly stout challenge from Bernie Sanders, threw diplomatic dignity to the wind in the fourth Democratic debate, attacking the senator even if it reinforced his characterization of her as an establishment politician so desperate she\u2019d say anything to win.\n\nSanders\u2019 stunning gains in New Hampshire and Iowa have put a jolt into a Clinton campaign that had grown increasingly confident at the end of 2015 \u2013 and it forced her to take risks she might have avoided with a firmer grasp on her party\u2019s loyalty. In the three previous debates, Clinton adopted an attitude of pre-presidential diffidence \u2013 but on Sunday night she was brawling like a Republican, slamming Sanders on guns, health care reform and taxes.\n\nThe increasingly chippy tone of the intra-Democratic squabbling is to be expected with just over two weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses \u2013 but Clinton, the most polarizing politician in the country this side of Donald Trump, risks alienating a progressive party base which likes her fine, but really loves Sanders.\n\nWith that in mind, here are five takeaways:\n\n1. Hillary turns it up to 11. If there was any doubt that Clinton is facing an existential threat from Sanders, you simply had to turn up the volume on the flat-screen to hear her rattle the speakers. In previous debates, Clinton spoke in a honeyed monotone \u2013 calmly defending her positions and professing comity with her opponents \u2013 but Clinton (hoarse from a week of tough campaigning) spent the better part of Sunday night near-shouting, attacking Sanders just like she did during the bad old days of early \u201908.\n\nWithin the first 15 minutes, Clinton accused Sanders of voting to support the Democrat-detested NRA in its drive to shield manufacturers from lawsuits filed by victims of gun violence. \u201c[He] voted against the Brady Bill five times,\u201d she said in an agitated tone typically reserved for shouting a late-night order into a balky drive-thru speaker. \u201cHe voted for what we call the Charleston Loophole. He voted for immunity for gun makers and sellers, which the NRA said was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years\u2026 He voted to let guns go on to Amtrak, go into national parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives.\u201d\n\nClinton \u2013 who has struggled to stoke the passion of her supporters \u2013 had a surfeit of oomph in the Charleston debate hall, but her jacked-up performance also reinforced the impression that she\u2019s more motivated by personal survival than a fervor to reverse economic injustices. In a dial-test focus group held near the venue by Democratic consultant Chris Kofinis, 29 out of 30 undecided voters declared the less-strident Sanders the winner of the debate\u2019s first hour. The Clinton campaign dismissed that as aberration, claiming recent polls showed a hefty majority of undecideds breaking for Clinton.\n\n2. Clinton made Sanders shvitz. Maybe it\u2019s the unruly white mane, the laundry-sack off-the-rack suits, or the Brighton Beach butcher\u2019s accent \u2013 but the greatest misimpression about Bernie Sanders is that he\u2019s an all-natural, unaffected anti-politician who simply says what comes from his heart. He is, to the contrary, one of the most icily disciplined politicians around (far more on-message than Clinton, in fact) and it\u2019s hard to knock him out of his crusty-but-loveable grandfatherly high-road mode. But Clinton \u2013 through sheer force of will \u2013 put Sanders on the defensive and (for a while anyway) he seemed like just another lifelong politician covering his inconsistent record.\n\nTaken as a whole, his debate performance was more polished \u2014 but that, in itself, implies artifice that undercuts his brand as a principled outsider. And in the days leading up to the debate he engaged in some political clean-up-on-aisle-five \u2013 reversing his opposition to gun-maker lawsuits and releasing, in the hours before the debate, a single-payer health care plan in response to the Clinton campaign\u2019s relentless goading. His toughest moments came when NBC\u2019s moderators grilled him on the plan\u2019s new taxes \u2013 which seemed to violate a no-middle-class-tax-hike pledge he made earlier in the campaign. \u201cNo, it is not breaking my word,\u201d he said, a sheen of perspiration on his forehead \u2013 adding: \u201cYes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes,\u201d which could easily become a line in Clinton\u2019s anti-Sanders playbook in a week or so.\n\n3. Bernie\u2019s Goldman Sachs attack is money. Clinton\u2019s two biggest weaknesses, in the eyes of the Sanders camp: Her connections to Wall Street and the fact that she has personally profited from the financial industry plutocrats who she claims would be in her crosshairs as president. Sanders razor-stropped that attack in the debate, focusing \u2013 bluntly, directly and personally \u2013 on Clinton\u2019s lucrative six-figure speechmaking career after leaving the State Department.\n\n\u201cSecretary Clinton \u2014 and you\u2019re not the only one, so I don\u2019t mean to just point the finger at you \u2013 you\u2019ve received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year,\u201d he said, turning to face the grim-looking frontrunner. \u201cI find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence.\u201d\n\nThe audience erupted \u2013 and Clinton\u2019s debate hall momentum was arrested for a while.\n\n4. Clinton hugged Obama so hard he needs new ribs. Iowa was a world of hurt for Clinton in 2008, but South Carolina was the killing ground for her presidential aspirations. The Democratic primary there is dominated by African-American voters (who now support Clinton by a two-to-one margin) and President Obama, for all of his mediocre polling nationally is still a near-unanimous favorite of black voters. He is almost equally popular among hyper-progressive Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa \u2013 so Clinton has been effusive in her defense of the White House during campaign appearances in both states.\n\nShe took that support to a new level on Sunday night \u2013 accusing Sanders of undermining Obama\u2019s legacy by challenging parts of the affordable care act, which she says would \u201ctear up\u201d Obamacare. \u201cI certainly respect Senator Sanders\u2019 intentions, but when you\u2019re talking about health care, the details really matter,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I don\u2019t to want see us start over again.\u201d\n\n5. Bernie and Trump, they love polls. The socialist and the billionaire fond of touting how \u201cvery rich\u201d he is, don\u2019t have a ton in common, but they do both share one characteristic \u2013 a love for boasting about their polling. When he was grilled about his struggles to gain traction with black and Hispanic voters, Sanders cited a raft of recent polls showing how well he polled in head-to-head matchups against \u201cmy good friend\u201d Trump.\n\n\u201cIn Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re ahead in New Hampshire\u2026 We are on the path to victory,\u201d he added, as Clinton peered sourly down at her lectern.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clinton ditches the easy demeanor, Sanders goes full indignant, and the crowd loves Obama.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Clinton ditches the easy demeanor, Sanders goes full indignant, and the crowd loves Obama.", "title": "5 takeaways from the US Democratic debate", "url": "http://www.politico.eu/article/5-takeaways-democratic-debate-january-hillary-sanders-elections/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/GettyImages-505439140-1200x628.jpg", "height": 628}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-18T06:44:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-18T06:50:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/GettyImages-505439140.jpg?w=640", "site": "@POLITICOEurope", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton (left) pushed back on the attacks from her invigorated opponent Bernie Sanders | Getty 5 takeaways from the US Democratic debate Clinton ditches the easy demeanor, Sanders goes full indignant, and the crowd loves Obama.\n\u201cI certainly respect Senator Sanders\u2019 intentions, but when you\u2019re talking about health care, the details really matter,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe finally have a path to universal health care.\nSanders razor-stropped that attack in the debate, focusing \u2013 bluntly, directly and personally \u2013 on Clinton\u2019s lucrative six-figure speechmaking career after leaving the State Department.\nWhen he was grilled about his struggles to gain traction with black and Hispanic voters, Sanders cited a raft of recent polls showing how well he polled in head-to-head matchups against \u201cmy good friend\u201d Trump."}
