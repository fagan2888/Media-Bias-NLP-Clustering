:20 — Time between pitches within an inning. The clock starts once the pitcher receives the ball in the mound area and stops when he begins his windup or comes set. A pitcher can reset the clock by stepping off the rubber. A batter or catcher can do so by requesting and being granted a timeout. The clock is not used on the pitch following a foul ball.

2:25 — Amount of time between half-innings. Pitchers must have thrown their final warm-up pitch by the time the clock reaches 35 seconds. The catcher and batter must be ready to go by the time it expires.
