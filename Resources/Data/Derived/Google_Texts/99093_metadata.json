Congress was finally learning to compromise and get things done, an email from Politico told me. After years of gridlock, stagnation, dysfunction and crisis, Congress had found a way to set aside partisanship and childish things. Now was the time, Politico intimated, when this august legislative body would begin to tackle the challenges of the present moment as only the most powerful nation in the world can.\n\nYes indeed, the rumors were true: Both sides in Congress had reached an agreement to once and for all pass a permanent \u201cdoc fix.\u201d And once the deed is done, and news of it proliferates throughout the media and trickles down to the people, I imagine we\u2019ll witness public displays of exuberance and relief unlike any we\u2019ve seen since World War II ended \u2014 or Osama bin Laden was killed. So wrap yourself in the biggest flag you can find and say it with me now: USA! USA! USA!\n\nAll right, I\u2019ll stop with the sarcasm, lest I reach Mitt Romney-levels of bitterness. You\u2019ll forgive me, though, if I find the level of enthusiasm the permanent doc fix has inspired at Politico, the New York Times and other organs of the Washington establishment to be perplexing. Yes, it\u2019s generally preferable that Congress stop wasting time every year with the \u201cdoc fix,\u201d which postpones scheduled cuts to Medicare reimbursement rates that are strenuously opposed by doctors and their lobbyists. And, yes, it\u2019s good that this permanent fix will include two years of funding for children\u2019s health insurance.\n\nBut to call this agreement, as some have, a major, legacy-building accomplishment for Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Nancy Pelosi is ridiculous. And to extrapolate that it might herald a new era of productive bipartisanship would not only be dumb, but would be proof that the folks who live \u2014 physically or psychologically \u2014 in what my colleague Digby likes to call \u201cthe Village\u201d still don\u2019t understand why the last six-plus years have been so bad. It\u2019s not because Congress can\u2019t get anything done, per se; it\u2019s because the only things Congress can get done are relatively minor and only matter to the 1 percent.\n\nWhich is, to a tee, the doc fix. As you may have heard, the American medical establishment is not only quite rich, but is also quite adept at working with lobbyists. You may also be aware that members of Congress, regardless of their party or ideological orientation, spend so much of their time fundraising, even Sisyphus would wince. Put those two facts together, and most anyone even vaguely familiar with the mechanics of Washington could guess what would come next. And since Congress can\u2019t get itself to do anything about issues of greater importance, doc fix it is!", "article_metadata": {"description": "The D.C. establishment is patting itself on the back for a pending bipartisan agreement.
