(CNN) George W. Bush is bringing his fundraising power to Washington next week and enlisting help from his former colleagues.

The former president will headline a fundraiser for his brother's presidential campaign while he's in town for a Bush-Cheney alumni event, according to an invitation obtained by CNN.

The 43rd president has headlined a number of events for his brother in recent months, including as recently as Sunday in Denver. He's also lent his name to fundraising solicitations via email, and he's set to appear at a donor retreat, along with the Bush brothers' father, next weekend in Houston.

Both events take place on October 29, one day after the next Republican debate. Hosted by the Bush Center, the alumni reception will be held in Georgetown for those who were part of the Bush administration and now resides in the Washington-Virgina-Maryland area.
