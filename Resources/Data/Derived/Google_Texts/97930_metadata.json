The recent Providence and St. Joseph\u2019s merger as well as the partnership between Aetna/Humana and Anthem/Cigna were given as examples. Of that number, almost 20% were \u201cvery negative.\u201d\n\nGenerally speaking, optimism is up. 51% of leaders reported that they feel \u201csomewhat positive\u201d or \u201cvery positive\u201d heading into 2016.\n\nWhen we dug deeper, asking respondents to choose from a list of adjectives to best describe their outlook \u201cchallenged\u201d was the top choice (55.8%), followed by \u201cengaged\u201d (33.9%), and \u201cfrustrated\u201d (31.6%).\n\nPreviously, Peter Long, President and CEO of Blue Shield of California Foundation commented on the mentality of health care leaders during an executive keynote in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThe thing that I\u2019ve been struck by, in a good way, is the tension between where we\u2019ve come from and where we want to go and managing that tension to determine what is the right path in terms of building incrementally on the investments of the Affordable Care Act and the framework of bringing people into the system,\u201d said Long. \u201cPeople don\u2019t seem exhausted after five years of the Affordable Care Act, they actually seem energized and ready for what is next.\u201d\n\nOne very important development that will cut across work in multiple silos in 2016 is CMS\u2019s $6 billion in funding for the state\u2019s 1115 waiver. We asked leaders to provide honest reactions to the direction of funds. Ultimately, 33.6% reported that they are supportive of investments in community health and the safety nets as a pathway to transformation.\n\nCalifornia leaders had the highest regard for the following organizations:\n\n\u2022 Kaiser Permanente\n\n\u2022 California Health Care Foundation\n\n\u2022 Sharp HealthCare\n\n\n\nConversely, organizations with the lowest ratings, according to this data include:\n\n\u2022 Humana\n\n\u2022 United Healthcare\n\n\u2022 Aetna Health\n\nDownload the full results of the State of Reform study.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California: 447 market leader's feedback on topics ranging from the performance of hospital systems to their opinion on the 1115 waiver", "og": {"site_name": "State of Reform", "description": "In State of Reform\u2019s annual survey of California health care leaders, we asked for honest feedback on how they feel about the future of \u2026", "title": "2016 California Health Leaders survey: 54.4% negative about mergers and feeling \u201cchallenged\u201d", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://stateofreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ca-survey-image.png", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T10:18:26+00:00", "url": "http://stateofreform.com/news/industry/2016/02/2016-california-health-leaders-survey-54-4-negative-to-mergers-optimism-is-up/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California: 447 market leader's feedback on topics ranging from the performance of hospital systems to their opinion on the 1115 waiver", "creator": "@StateofReform", "image": "http://stateofreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ca-survey-image.png", "title": "2016 California Health Leaders survey: 54.4% negative about mergers and feeling \"challenged\" - State of Reform", "site": "@StateofReform", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 17821687}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/stateofreform/", "section": "California", "published_time": "2016-02-03T12:00:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T10:18:26+00:00"}, "OBKey": "12RjP7ip2KRyl5dliGRkEQ==", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In State of Reform\u2019s annual survey of California health care leaders, we asked for honest feedback on how they feel about the future of the health care industry in 2016.\nSurprisingly, 54.4% responded negatively when asked about the increase in consolidation among health care organizations.\nPreviously, Peter Long, President and CEO of Blue Shield of California Foundation commented on the mentality of health care leaders during an executive keynote in Los Angeles.\n51% of leaders reported that they feel \u201csomewhat positive\u201d or \u201cvery positive\u201d heading into 2016.\nWe asked leaders to provide honest reactions to the direction of funds."}
