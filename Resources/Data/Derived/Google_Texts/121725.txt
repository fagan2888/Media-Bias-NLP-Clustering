From WMC-TV:

“Fried chicken has mysterious powers,” said Oak Hill Missionary Baptist Church pastor Michael Minor, who says you cannot just eat one piece.

Minor banned fried chicken at church dinners along with sugary drinks to help combat obesity.

“People are healthier, more energy. Their weight is down and once you get the weight down, you want to keep it down,” said Minor.
