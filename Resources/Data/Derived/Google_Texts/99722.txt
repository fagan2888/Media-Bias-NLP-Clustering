The Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby decision may have been a victory for religious liberty, but the Obama Administration isn’t giving up without a fight.

Tuesday, the administration announced it will be taking further legal action against the Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of nuns who care for the poor and elderly, Life News reports.

Under the Supreme Court ruling, the Little Sisters of the Poor were free from covering abortifacient drugs.

Adele Keim, Counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which represents the Little Sisters, said the Administration’s targeting is unwarranted.

“The government has already exempted millions of Americans from this requirement for commercial or secular reasons, so it should certainly protect the Little Sisters for religious reasons,” Keim said.

Ted Cruz called the Obama Administration out, and twitter users eagerly responded.
