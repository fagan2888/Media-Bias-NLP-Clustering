A 38-year-old suspect is in critical condition after being shot by a Jefferson County Sheriff deputy and bitten by a police dog late Friday night, officials said.

The shooting happened at 9880 West Belleview Avenue in Littleton at 11:30 p.m., according to a news release Saturday by the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office.

The wounded man, identified as Michael Manaois, was taken to Swedish Medical Center and was in critical condition on Saturday following overnight surgery, the sheriff’s office said. He is expected to survive.

No deputies were injured in the shooting.

Deputies were trying to apprehend Manaois inside the Governor’s Plaza Shoes & Service store when he bolted out a back door into the alley and pointed a handgun at deputies, a news release said.

One of the deputies hit the suspect twice, and a K9 dog that had been chasing him through the store bit him at the same time, the release said.

Manaois has two felony warrants, one for sexual assault/sexually violent predator and the second for failure to register as a sex offender, the release said. He will face additional charges for multiple counts of felony menacing.

The deputy involved in the shooting has been placed on routine administrative leave during an investigation.
