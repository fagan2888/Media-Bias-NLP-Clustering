And when Kelo bought the home, she painted it pink\u2014Odessa Rose from Benjamin Moore\u2019s historic collection, Kelo specifically remembers.\n\nFrom her front porch, the mother of five boys could see the mouth of the Thames River. On a clear day, she could see all the way to Montauk Point on New York\u2019s Long Island.\n\nBut less than one year after moving to her piece of paradise, Kelo found out the city of New London wanted to take her waterfront property and others belonging to her Fort Trumbull neighbors.\n\nThe city used its power of eminent domain.\n\nAnd so she, along with six other families who owned 15 properties in Fort Trumbull, fought back.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started this battle, it was about me and this little pink house,\u201d Kelo told The Daily Signal. \u201cBut it grew into something much bigger than that. It turned into a nationwide battle to save the Fort Trumbull neighborhood.\u201d\n\nKelo and her fellow plaintiffs\u2014Thelma Brelesky, Pasquale Cristofaro, Wilhelmina and Charles Dery, James and Laura Guretsky, Richard Beyer and Bill von Winkle\u2014fought the city of New London to keep their homes. The city wanted to transfer the property to a private nonprofit organization, which would facilitate its development.\n\nTheir fight went all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled against the property owners on June 23, 2005.\n\nThough Kelo and her neighbors lost, the case became one of the most contested in the high court\u2019s history, and it sparked reform in the vast majority of the states.\n\nBut the land where their homes once stood remains vacant, now a decade later.\n\nThe city spent $78 million bulldozing the homes and preparing the area for development, but so far, all plans have fallen through.\n\n\u201cThey put in infrastructure and roads to nowhere, sidewalks to nowhere with always the thought that they were going to have this redevelopment plan where a hotel would come, a health club, cafes, restaurants and stuff like that that never came to be,\u201d Kelo told The Daily Signal.\n\nAnd for Kelo and Michael Cristofaro\u2014who grew up in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood and whose father was one of the plaintiffs in the case\u2014the wounds from their battle with New London haven\u2019t yet healed.\n\n\u201cIf you look out, this is what the city of New London wanted,\u201d Cristofaro told The Daily Signal, standing in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood. \u201cThis is what they took our homes for\u2014this vast amount of land. This is what the U.S. Supreme Court said that the city of New London was justified in taking our homes\u2014an empty field. As far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s an empty dream.\u201d\n\n>>> Interested in learning more? Read \u201cA Decade After Kelo: Time for Congress to Protect American Property Owners\u201d\n\nFighting Back\n\nKnown by its signature pink color, Kelo\u2019s home became the symbol of the battle she and her neighbors waged against the city of New London.\n\nKelo v. City of New London examined whether the government has the power to take private property for economic development through eminent domain. The Fifth Amendment allows the government to take property from private residents if it satisfies two conditions: it\u2019s for public use and just compensation is provided.\n\nHowever, over the last few decades, the definition of public use has expanded from seizing property to build a school, bridge or road, to transferring property from one private party to another.\n\nIn the Kelo case, the land the Fort Trumbull neighborhood sat on would be transferred from private residents to a private nonprofit group, the New London Development Corporation, which would then develop the property. Plans for the land included a new hotel, restaurants, shops and a renovated marina.\n\nThe city hoped redeveloping the neighborhood would boost the local economy and grow its tax base, with the help of a new facility built by Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant, located adjacent to the property.\n\nThe city first tried to convince the Fort Trumbull residents to sell their homes, and many of them did. But seven families, including Kelo\u2014who owned 15 properties combined\u2014pushed back and refused to leave their homes and businesses, many of which had been in their families for generations.\n\nThe property owners were threatened by the New London Development Corporation for years. Some residents were locked out of their homes, and others had their water turned off. On more than one occasion, residents would find a bulldozer parked outside their houses. When its engine revved, the structures would shake, Cristofaro remembered.\n\nBut Kelo and her neighbors held strong and, with the help of Institute for Justice, took their case from the Superior Court of New London to the Connecticut Supreme Court and all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cEminent domain is used against the people who the government thinks can\u2019t fight back,\u201d said Dana Berliner, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice who argued the case at the Connecticut Supreme Court. \u201cPeople need to organize in opposition to eminent domain when it occurs.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled 5-4 against the property owners and argued that states could use eminent domain to take private property for a \u201cpublic purpose\u201d or to meet a \u201cpublic need\u201d so long as just compensation is provided.\n\nNow, 10 years after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Kelo v. City of New London remains one of the most disputed rulings in the high court\u2019s history.\n\nIn the wake of the decision, though, more than 40 states passed laws limiting the use of eminent domain transferring property to a private party for economic development. In 11 of those states, legislatures passed constitutional amendments addressing the Kelo ruling.\n\n>>> Supreme Court Rules Government Can\u2019t Pick and Choose What Speech Is Free\n\nTen Years Later\n\nYears ago, the Fort Trumbull neighborhood was the type where a kid would run out of his or her back door, through the backyard, and into the home of a neighbor, Cristofaro recalled.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of neighborhood that you had,\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to worry about your kids. The neighbors looked after your kids.\u201d\n\nThe neighborhood was filled with \u201cworking class\u201d families, and the property owners took great pride in their homes. The lawns were well-manicured, and many of the homeowners showed off their green thumbs. Cristofaro\u2019s dad, Pasquale, grew rhododendrons and grapes in their yard on Goshen Street.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I don\u2019t think people realize about eminent domain,\u201d Cristofaro said. \u201cA lot of people say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s just a house. It\u2019s just four walls. Move on. Go find another home and go live.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s the memories of knowing that your children and grandchildren have been stomping around the property, that the markings on the walls where they grew up that you refused to paint over because it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh no, that\u2019s my first grandchild, that\u2019s my second grandchild.\u2019 You can\u2019t just say, \u2018It\u2019s a material type of thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the months after the high court issued its ruling, Kelo had a number of visitors wanting to relive their own memories with her little pink house. She recalled walking out on her front porch one day to find a man staring up at her home. He had been born in the house, he told her.\n\nAnother woman traveled with her mother, who was in her 90s, to Fort Trumbull from California. The house once belonged to her grandmother, and she remembered sliding down the bannister as a child. In a third encounter, Kelo recalled taking care of an elderly woman who was married in the home when it belonged to the Bigelow family in the 1950s.\n\n\u201cYour home is your sanctuary,\u201d Kelo said, \u201cand it should be protected by the government so you can have your home and life there, and have your life, your dreams, your memories.\u201d\n\nNow, the land where Cristofaro and Kelo lived\u2014the land where weddings were held and babies were born, and where a multi-year court battle was fought over\u2014remains overgrown with weeds.\n\nThe streets surrounding the neighborhood serve as an overflow lot to the employees of General Dynamics\u2019 Electric Boat division, which took over the Pfizer facility after the company left New London in 2009. The employees park their cars around 7 a.m., and by 3:30 p.m., the streets are empty once again.\n\nThe only reminders of the homes and businesses that used to make up the sprawling neighborhood are remnants of foundation\u2014a slate of concrete marking the entrance to Charles Dery\u2019s Italian market\u2014and telephone poles lining what used to be Goshen Street.\n\n>>> Court Again Affirms You Have to Intend a Threat for It to Be a Threat\n\nA transformer sits high atop one of those poles, and it\u2019s what Cristofaro uses as a landmark for where his family\u2019s old home sat.\n\nKelo, who bought her little pink house on the corner of East and Trumbull Streets just months before the city began its crusade to take it, left New London after the Supreme Court ruled against her and her neighbors.\n\nShe now lives in Groton, Conn., where on a clear day, she can see the peninsula where her old neighborhood sits from across the Thames River.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like\u2014it\u2019s not sort of like\u2014it\u2019s a sour note,\u201d she said. \u201cThey took our homes by eminent domain \u2026 It\u2019s just a hurtful spot.\u201d\n\nKelo\u2019s home was spared from demolition and moved to 36 Franklin Street. It\u2019s still the signature pink.\n\n\u201cThis house, moved from the Fort Trumbull neighborhood, stands as a testament to the bravery of Susette Kelo and her neighbors, and to the thousands of others who have battled and are battling the abuse of eminent domain across the country,\u201d reads a plaque on the front of the house, dedicated in 2008.\n\nOf the six other property owners, only Cristofaro returns, but really just to show out-of-town reporters around the site.\n\n\u201cIf I had to bring my kid here and say this was our family homestead growing up, I mean, I have a rock to reference the property. A telephone pole knowing that was the edge of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame. That\u2019s totally a shame. They should\u2019ve never taken this property for eminent domain just for private development. That was totally wrong.\u201d\n\nA Future for Fort Trumbull\n\nIn 2012, not long after Mayor Daryl Justin Finizio, a Democrat, was elected mayor to New London, he apologized to the residents of Fort Trumbull on behalf of the city.\n\nAnd though the land remains vacant, he has big plans for the old neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have not committed the worst sin in eminent domain in the Kelo case until we transfer that property to private development, and that has not happened yet,\u201d Finizio told The Daily Signal.\n\nInstead, the first-term mayor has talked about using the land for what he says is actual\u201cpublic use\u201d\u2014build water purification facilities, a tiny-house neighborhood filled with green, environmentally friendly homes, a community center or city-run green parking garage in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThere are numerous ways to develop Fort Trumbull and to do it on a way that would also show the country that this spot, where there was a real national embarrassment for the city of New London, could become a national model for how green, sustainable living can be produced in our country,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Kelo and Cristofaro, though, they would rather see the land remain empty.\n\n\u201cTo us, it\u2019s better that it stays empty because that\u2019s the biggest memorial of all\u2014that it\u2019s empty\u201d Kelo said. \u201cProof to the pudding.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEW LONDON, CONN.\u2014All Susette Kelo wanted was to live with a view of the water.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "NEW LONDON, CONN.\u2014All Susette Kelo wanted was to live with a view of the water.", "title": "The Government Took Their Homes, All That\u2019s Left is a Field", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150612_Kelo_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T20:13:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1SE17j9"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "NEW LONDON, CONN.\u2014All Susette Kelo wanted was to live with a view of the water.", "title": "The Government Took Their Homes, All That\u2019s Left is a Field", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150612_Kelo_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "executive overreach", "published_time": "2015-06-23T03:01:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T20:13:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Susette Kelo, Michael Cristofaro, Kelo v.
