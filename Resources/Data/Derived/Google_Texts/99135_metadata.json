Not only do inmates develop debilitating conditions at a younger age than people who are not incarcerated, but caring for them in the harsh environment of prisons is far more expensive than it is on the outside.\n\nOf the 2.3 million adults in state and federal prisons, about 246,000 are 50 or older, according to the National Institute of Corrections. The U.S. currently spends more than $16 billion annually caring for these aging inmates, and their numbers are projected to grow dramatically in the next 15 years.\n\n\u201cIn a couple of years,\u201d said Donna Strugar-Fritsch, a consultant with Health Management Associates, \u201cthis is the only thing people are going to be talking about. It\u2019s getting worse by the minute.\u201d\n\nIn the past five years, a handful of states have tried to contract with private nursing homes to care for some of their elderly and disabled inmates under so-called \u201cmedical parole\u201d programs that allow prisoners to receive care outside of a prison while remaining in state custody. But few private facilities have been willing to accept them. Likewise, courts and communities have tended to resist so-called \u201ccompassionate release,\u201d which cuts short the sentences of elderly or dying inmates so they can spend their last days on the outside.\n\nNEW APPROACH\n\nTwo years ago, Connecticut tried a different approach. Instead of attempting to place prisoners in nursing home beds next to someone\u2019s elderly parent, the state asked the commercial nursing home industry to provide a facility that would accept a steady stream of prison inmates and patients from the state mental hospital who required long-term nursing care.\n\nA handful of states are interested in following Connecticut\u2019s lead; Michigan is seeking industry proposals for a similar arrangement, and Kentucky and Wisconsin are considering doing the same. But in other states, officials may lack the political will to take on residents who don\u2019t want convicts in their midst. And even in Connecticut, it remains to be seen how far the state can take its plan, given the public backlash it already has experienced.\n\nTechnically, the winning bidder for Connecticut\u2019s corrections business, 60 West, is just like any other nursing home. It is not locked down, does not employ guards and it accepts applications from anyone. Located in Rocky Hill, the 95-bed nursing facility opened in May 2013 and is already half-full. Its only residents are patients transferred from state prisons and Connecticut Valley Hospital, the state\u2019s only residential mental institution.\n\nBesides providing more humane and less expensive care than Connecticut\u2019s prisons can offer, 60 West is certified to receive federal Medicaid payments. As a result, the state\u2019s taxpayers will save more than $5 million in corrections health care costs annually, once 60 West is filled.\n\nRULE\u2019S EXCEPTION\n\nUnder the 1965 law that created Medicaid, anybody entering a state prison forfeited Medicaid eligibility. The same went for those entering local jails, juvenile lock-ups and state mental institutions.\n\nBut an exception to that general rule opened up in 1997 when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services wrote to state Medicaid directors saying inmates who leave state or local facilities for care in hospitals or nursing homes can get their bills paid by Medicaid. The exact federal contribution varies by state. But in all of them, Washington covers at least half the costs of the federal-state health care program for the poor.\n\nIn addition to the incarcerated, those on probation or parole or under house arrest can participate. Even in states that have not expanded Medicaid to low-income adults under the Affordable Care Act, most elderly or disabled prison inmates qualify under existing Medicaid rules, as long as they receive care outside.\n\nThat means some portion of the nation\u2019s elderly and disabled inmates could receive federally subsidized long-term care outside of prison walls, potentially saving states millions of dollars in health care costs.\n\nThe prison population in Connecticut is aging faster than in most other states and its growth is not expected to subside any time soon. Between 2007 and 2011, the proportion of inmates age 55 and older increased 45 percent, according to a survey by the Pew Charitable Trusts and the Association of State Correctional Administrators. Nationwide, the number of elderly inmates is projected to more than triple in the next 15 years, according to data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe rise in older prisoners is partly a result of tough-on-crime laws in the 1980s and 1990s, including mandatory minimum sentences and \u201cthree strikes\u201d rules. It also reflects the aging of the U.S. population generally.\n\nPrisoners, like everyone else, are living longer. Many elderly inmates came into the prison system late in life, some after serving previous sentences.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON | Providing health care to an aging prison population is a large and growing cost for states.
