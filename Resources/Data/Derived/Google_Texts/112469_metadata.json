Mark Begich told the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium last month. \u201cFailure to pay the full costs is unacceptable and I will continue to use my position on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to keep up the pressure on the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe IHS, a Department of Health and Human Services agency, provides health service systems for about 2.2 million of the nation\u2019s estimated 3.4 million American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nFunds allocated by the IHS, currently $4.4 billion per year, go toward administering medical care to tribes or are turned over to tribes for them to administer the care themselves. The IHS had been failing to provide full payments of contract costs until the Supreme Court ruled in June 2012 that the government must pay, determining that the tribes had been underpaid \u201cbetween 77 percent and 92 percent of the tribes\u2019 aggregate contract support costs\u201d during previous decades.\n\nYet, according to Jacqueline Johnson Pata, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, \u201cpayment has not happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe class action lawyers recently reported to NCAI on the lawyer\u2019s discussions with the Justice Department. Although they couldn\u2019t share much information, they did explain that there are close to 9,000 claim years at issue involving about 500 tribes and 19 years worth of contracts (1994-2013),\u201d she told the U.S. Senate Committee of Indian Affairs last year.\n\nSen. Begich introduced Senate Bill 2669 in July to the Senate Appropriations Committee\n\nto mandate funding for certain payments to Indian tribes and tribal organization. Additionally, the federal government has treaty and statutory obligations under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, which requires the government to contract with tribes to operate BIA and IHS programs. The agreement between the government and tribes is embedded in Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAt the end of 2013, less than 1 percent of thousands of claims in more than 200 lawsuits filed by tribes seeking a combined $200 billion had been settled \u2014 just 16 claims of an estimated 1,600.\n\nOf the 566 nations the federal government recognizes, 229 are spread across the vast 572,000 square miles of Alaska, where they occupy small villages in remote areas \u2014 many only accessible by air or boat. For these tribes in remote areas, seeing a doctor might be inconvenient, to say the least, and almost definitely costly.\n\nLead counsel in the cases establishing government liability for IHS\u2019s failure to pay, Lloyd Miller, an attorney based in Anchorage, Alaska, said IHS is severely underfunded.\n\n\u201cIHS is a prepared health plan paid for with a lot of blood and millions of acres of land,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBecause the government took away their lands, there\u2019s a responsibility.\u201d\n\nIHS gets $4.4 billion from Congress annually for what\u2019s estimated to be a $15 billion need to meet the costs, he said.\n\nMiller represents about 60 tribes, each with several claims filed for the costs owed.\n\nIn an August 2007 letter to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs requesting an oversight hearing, Alaskan tribal health care providers reminded the committee that the Indian Self-Determination Act requires money to provide federal trust responsibilities.\n\n\u201cWe write to once again call your attention to the grave crisis we face as a result of insufficient contract support cost appropriations which, together with Indian Health Service policies, have left our tribal organizations with annual shortfalls running from $2 million to over $8 million. We respectfully request that the Senate Indian Affairs Committee convene an urgent oversight hearing this Fall, to review what has become a genuine crisis in Indian country, and a crisis that has seriously eroded the national policy of Tribal self-governance and the delivery of quality health services to Alaska Native people,\u201d the letter stated.\n\nBy August of this year, 12 of Alaska\u2019s tribal health providers received $449 million to resolve contract support costs disputes with the IHS. Another 11 providers were still in negotiations. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, serving more than 143,000 native people, received the largest payment, with a $153 million settlement that includes $115.5 for past-due costs and $37.7 million in interest. At about $128 million, Southcentral Foundation received the next largest settlement.\n\nThe NCAI has been working with tribes and the IHS on contract costs since the Indian Self-Determination Act went into effect.\n\nThe congress is hosting the annual Tribal Unity Gathering and Legislative Impact Days on Sept. 16 and 17 in Washington. During the event, tribal leaders and representatives will meet with their delegates to the U.S. Congress to encourage action on important delegation before this session ends. IHS appropriations will be among the issues discussed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s strong support from the House and Senate,\u201d said Amber Eberb, program manager of the NCAI Policy Research Center. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a few champions who understand that tribes administering their own programs to respond to their community needs is more effective than a federal agency.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s still progress to be made, Eberb said.\n\n\u201cContract costs and other treaty issues should not be considered discretionary but mandatory,\u201d Ebarb said. \u201cAll program money that uphold treaty agreements should be mandatory. It\u2019s morally correct to do. Perhaps a little difficult to do right now.\u201d\n\nDisparities in well-being\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) death rates were nearly 50 percent greater than rates among non-Hispanic whites during 1999-2009, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nThe study was carried out by the CDC\u2019s Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics, CDC researchers, the IHS, and partners from tribal groups, universities and state health departments.\n\nIt revealed:\n\nAmong AI/AN people, cancer is the leading cause of death, followed by heart disease, while the opposite is true for other races studied;\n\nDeath rates from lung cancer have shown little improvement in AI/AN populations. AI/AN people have the highest prevalence of tobacco use of any population in the United States;\n\nDeaths from injuries were higher among AI/AN people compared to non-Hispanic whites;\n\nSuicide rates were nearly 50 percent higher for AI/AN people compared to non-Hispanic whites, and more frequent among AI/AN males and persons under age 25;\n\nDeath rates from motor vehicle crashes, poisoning, and falls were two times higher among AI/AN people than for non-Hispanic whites;\n\nDeath rates were higher among AI/AN infants compared to non-Hispanic white infants. Sudden infant death syndrome and unintentional injuries were also more common. AI/AN infants were four times more likely to die from pneumonia and influenza;\n\nBy region, the highest mortality rates were in the Northern Plains and Southern Plains, while the East and Southwest had the lowest.\n\n\u201cMany of the observed excess deaths can be addressed through evidence-based public health interventions,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nIn November 2013 testimony before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said:\n\n\u201cI listened very intently yesterday at the tribal summit when the President spoke. I went there specifically to hear what he was going to say on the issue of contract support costs. What I heard him say is, we have heard you loud and clear, but we are still working to find the answers. I don\u2019t think we need to work to find any answers. I think that the court laid it out very, very clearly. It said that full reimbursement will be provided. So we have to make that happen within that budget. We have to make that priority.\u201d\n\nMurkowski said she had listened to the stories of the impact of lack of funds, saying, for example, that the regional health provider in Juneau had to close its alcohol treatment facility. Further north, in the Yukon Delta, the regional health provider laid off 20 employees, permanently closed 40 vacant positions, and reduced services for elders, she continued.\n\nThe impacts of the sequestration, she said, also meant that tribes would not be able to reduce waiting times at emergency rooms or outpatient and dental clinics.\n\n\u201cThe impact, I think we recognize, has been significant,\u201d she said.\n\nMurkowski submitted comments she received from Alaska Natives around the state, including the Association of Village Council Presidents.\n\nProposed Increase for IHS Budget\n\n\u201cTribes have not recovered from sequestration that resulted in across-the-board cuts to all federal programs that tribes are reliant upon. Nowhere was this more impactful than to the Indian Health Services, where due to sequestration, continuing resolutions, and the 16 day government shutdown \u2014 healthcare to Indian people was jeopardized,\u201d U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs Chairman Jon Tester, of Montana, said in March.\n\nTami Truette Jerue, tribal administrator and director of social services for the Anvik Tribal Council in Alaska addressed the committee\u2019s oversight hearing in February. The Anvik are an Athabascan village of about 275 members on the west bank of the Yukon River.\n\nJerue represented the 37 federally recognized tribes that make up the Tanana Chiefs Conference, an inter-tribal health and social services consortium that serves an area of Interior Alaska that is roughly the size of Texas.\n\nShe delivered a message from more than 200 tribes across Alaska:\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely essential that, without regard to technical land titles and the technical Indian country status of lands or tribal communities, our Tribes must have the tools necessary to combat drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, and violence against women. Fighting these scourges in our communities and healing our people cannot be made to stand on technicalities. We need to get to work, and now. And we need Congress\u2019s help to do that. The State is not the problem, because the State is nowhere to be found in most of our Villages\u2026.\n\n\u201cToday, the tribes of Alaska come to you, not as victims of a failed governmental policy, but as powerful and responsible advocates for our people. We are stepping up to do what we must do. But without equally firm action from Congress, our people will suffer, we will continue with decades more of litigation battles and loopholes will continue to be found which deny our tribes the funding necessary to improve law and order in our communities.\u201d\n\nIn the budget for the 2015 fiscal year, the Obama administration proposed a 4.5 percent increase for IHS, representing a $200 million increase over the current level to $4.6 billion.\n\nThe 2015 budget request includes:\n\nAn additional $50 million to help obtain health care from the private sector through the Purchased/Referred Care program (formerly known as the Contract Health Services program). This program allows for the purchase of essential health care services that the IHS and tribes do not provide in their local facilities;\n\nAn additional $71 million to support staffing and operating costs at four new and expanded facilities;\n\nAn additional $30 million to fully fund the estimated amount of contract support costs for new and expanded contracts and compacts in fiscal year 2015. This will help tribes cover the cost of administrative functions for compacts or contracts established under the authority of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act;\n\nAn additional $31 million to address medical inflation costs;\n\nAdditional funding to pay costs for new tribes and restoration of reductions in the fiscal year 2014 operating plan.\n\nIn his statement, Tester noted the \u201cpositive highlights\u201d in the budget request.\n\n\u201cThe Committee is pleased that the Administration finally understands its legal obligation to fully fund Contract Support Costs for the both the Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs,\u201d Tester said. \u201cI am particularly encouraged by the $11 million increase for social services and job training to support an initiative to provide a comprehensive and integrated approach to address the problems of violence, poverty, and substance abuse.\u201d\n\nCovering IHS shortfalls with the Affordable Care Act\n\nThe Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium and more than 50 tribes wrote a letter to President Obama on Oct. 13.\n\nIn part, it said, \u201cAmong your administration\u2019s most important achievements has been the development of historic settlements with Indian Tribes in several major litigations, its advocacy for amendments to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and the Violence Against Women\u2019s Act, and its commitment to critical appropriations measures. But when it comes to honoring the Nation\u2019s commitment to the contracting and compacting Tribes who were historically, and illegally, underpaid, and who continue to be underpaid, the administration has permitted fiscal concerns to eclipse the imperative to do justice and to honor the nation\u2019s obligations.\u201d\n\nIn July the IHS reached a settlement with the consortium for claims during the years 1999 through 2013. The payment \u2014 $39.5 million plus interest \u2014 totals about $53 million.\n\n\u201cA lot of tribes had to close down programs because of lack of funds,\u201d Andrea Thomas, outreach and enrollment manager of SEARHC, told MintPress News. \u201cPart of what the settlement can do is bring back what was lost.\u201d\n\nAlaska did not create reservations like the 48 contiguous states, and many Native communities formed consortiums, like SEARHC, to use IHS funding for health care to serve them all.\n\nSEARHC is a nonprofit tribal health consortium of 18 Native communities which serves the health interests of the Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, and other Native people of Southeast Alaska. In 1982, the consortium took over operations at the IHS clinic in Juneau, and then took over operations at Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital, formerly an IHS-run facility, in 1986.\n\n\u201cIn Alaska we have the highest cost of health care in the nation,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThere\u2019s vast wilderness surrounding each place. In order for me to get out of my community, I\u2019d have to fly or take a ferry. This gets incredibly expensive.\u201d\n\nMany Alaskan villages have a community health clinic, but complicated procedures such as chemotherapy or serious surgeries, require patients to go to hospitals at regional hubs or to the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage. The burden is on the tribal health consortium to pay the costs of a commercial jet, float plane, ferry, or boat.\n\nIf a medical evacuation helicopter is needed, it would cost SEARHC about $95,000 \u2014 a cost that could be absorbed by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe issue is that IHS only provides about half the money for services,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe rely on other revenues like grants and billing Medicare and Medicaid. If native people enroll, it puts more money back and we could offer more services or expanded services.\u201d\n\nFurther, a member of a federally recognized tribe can get a lifetime exemption. Alaska Natives and American Indians are exempt from Affordable Care Act tax penalties because they receive care through the IHS. But through the new health care scheme, they are eligible for subsidies from private insurance. Thomas said that those who fall between 100 percent and 500 percent of the federal poverty level pay a monthly premium, but no deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nYet, of more than 100,000 self-identified Alaskan Natives or American Indians, only 115 had signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act as of April.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of people realize what the Affordable Care Act does for Alaskan Native people,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nCoverage also extends to Native people who are not enrolled members of a federally recognized tribe and meet federal guidelines. Thomas said they can receive a lifetime hardship exemption, rather than a tribal exemption, and there may be some out-of-pocket expense.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Slowly but surely, tribal governments -- especially those in Alaska -- are receiving millions of dollars in decades of unpaid contract costs from the Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Christine Graef", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Slowly but surely, tribal governments -- especially those in Alaska -- are receiving millions of dollars in decades of unpaid contract costs from the Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs.", "title": "Indian Country Grapples With Health Funding Shortfalls, Non-Payment", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/indian-country-grapples-health-funding-shortfalls-non-payment/196625/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP992305229770.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-19T07:40:38-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Slowly but surely, tribal governments -- especially those in Alaska -- are receiving millions of dollars in decades of unpaid contract costs from the Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP992305229770.jpg", "title": "Indian Country Grapples With Health Funding Shortfalls, Non-Payment", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: Health & Lifestyle", "tag": "Native American", "published_time": "2014-09-17T06:47:44-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-19T07:40:38-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c67\"", "article_summary": "Indian Country Grapples With Health Funding Shortfalls, Non-PaymentSlowly but surely, tribal governments -- especially those in Alaska -- are receiving millions of dollars in decades of unpaid contract costs from the Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Tribal health programs working to serve native people are not seeing funding of administrative costs keeping pace with need, and the Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs owe millions to tribal governments.\nSen.
