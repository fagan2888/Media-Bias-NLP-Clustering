The purpose of the \"documentaries\" was to stir up fundamentalist Christians, and also Jews, to fear Muslims, and to hate liberals who didn't want Christians and Jews to defend themselves against Muslims. These aristocrats were stirring up the boobs to vote their cultural fears. Subsequent evidence suggested that the agreement that the Koch conferees came to at their secret meeting was probably to stir these hatreds specifically against Obama, by personalizing cultural hatreds in order to remove the \"alien\" Obama from the White House.\n\n\n\nThen, on 6 September 2011, Mother Jones bannered \"Exclusive Audio: Inside the Koch Brothers' Secret Seminar,\" and Brad Friedman of bradblog.com reported that some attendee had given him recordings of the sessions the next year, in June 2011, held at the Kochs' Vail Colorado compound. \"Several GOP governors made it to the Vail seminar in June, among them Florida's Rick Scott, Virginia's Robert McDonnell, and White House hopeful Rick Perry of Texas,\" none of whom made their attendance public. Charles Koch greeted these people with a speech saying, \"We've talked about our competitive disadvantage, how we're overwhelmed in a number of areas. ... One of those areas, of course, is the media - and we're overwhelmed.\" The keynote speech was from Fox \"News\" legal \"expert,\" and retired N.J. Superior Court Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, who \"declared that the Second Amendment was created to ensure 'the right to shoot at the government.'\" The Judge added there, 'if it is taken over by tyrants,' but at this seminar's start, Charles Koch himself had said of President Obama, \"We have Saddam Hussein\" in the White House, so that everyone there knew that they were attending a congregation which believed that, by rights, they or any other American would be a hero to assassinate the man who was now inside the White House. Many of the attendees had contributed during the year $1 million or more to the Kochs' political operation. This list included many oil, gas, and coal, investors, as well as the hedge fund founder Ken Griffin, who had \"bundled money for both President Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain during the 2008 campaign.\" Perhaps Griffin now wanted to shoot Obama because Obama still supported elimination of the enormous \"carried interest\" tax-dodge which was halving the taxation-rate on managers of hedge and private equity funds, such as Ken Griffin. Another such mega-donor was Paul Singer (via his flak Annie Dickerson, \"who runs a foundation for Paul Singer\"). Singer specialized in \"vulture fund\" investments that harmed and impoverished the world's poorest nations, and he had been one of Rudy Giuliani's biggest financial backers, as well as an enormous contributor to the Republican Party. John Templeton Jr., son of the namesake mutual funder and founder of the Templeton Foundation, the organization bribing scientists to endorse religion, also was. Charles Schwab was also on the list. And, of course, Dick DeVos of Amway was on the list. However, most of the names on this list of $1 million+ contributors to the Kochs' political funds were obscure billionaires and centi-millionares.\n\n\n\nJudge Napolitano's speech, delivered on the event's closing night of 27 June 2011, said: \"Now, you're home one night, there's a knock on the door [thump, thump, thump,]. You open the door. There's a guy with a gun. The guy says to you, 'Give me your money. I want to give it away in your name.' You said [sic] 'What the heck is this all about?' You call the police. Turns out it was the police. It was a federal agent! Come to collect your taxes!\" (\"Laughter and appause.\") This ideology he espoused - the belief that money the government takes in and spends is stolen and wasted, and that the money charities take in and spend is not but is instead purely voluntary and is productive - is Ronald Reagan's heritage to America, and it's a massive lie from the aristocracy and its agents. Judge Napolitano went on: \"Charity comes from the heart! Charity is only charitable when it's done voluntarily!\" So: when a non-mega-rich person pays taxes that go for flood relief, or for education of poor children, and etc., that's not \"charity\"; but when these rich thugs \"donate to charity,\" which ends up financing the university where they got their degree, or something else that helped them in their life, it's \"charity,\" and it's automatically superior to the donation-decisions that are made by the general public, via everyone voting in a democracy, which determines where roads will be built, and which determines whose children will be subsidized by how much in their public schooling, food stamps, and health care. The basic idea here is: Let the poor starve, unless I happen to know them and like them and donate to them. Judge Napolitano went on: \"You know, Fox is a great place to work.\" He was a happy servant to aristocrats.\n\n\n\nThis type of speech opens wallets for millions of dollars, to fund fascist political campaigns. Fascist funders don't want to finance the public schools and roads, etc., but do want to fund politicians who will bankrupt those democratic things and so cause people to become disenchanted with democracy.\n\n\n\nThese people are both evil and powerful. They are enemies of democracy. And they are winning.\n\n\n\nThe next day, 7 September 2011, Friedman headlined \"Audio: Chris Christie Lets Loose at Secret Koch Brothers Confab,\" and he presented the speech that the Koch-funded New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had given to the Kochs' adulatory crowd on 26 June 2011, a speech that had, until now, been entirely secret. \"Christie managed to fly to Colorado and back undetected. ... After we told his deputy press secretary that we wanted to talk about Christie's Colorado trip that day, nobody from his office would return our calls, despite multiple attempts.\" This was the new American \"democracy.\" The speeches that had been delivered by Florida's Governor (and former convicted HCA fraudster) Rick Scott, and by Texas Governor Rick Perry, were apparently not captured on these recordings.\n\n\n\n\"In his introduction, David Koch lauded Christie as a 'true political hero.'\" Koch said, \"Five months ago we met in my New York City office and spoke, just the two of us, for about two hours on his objectives and successes in correcting many of the most serious problems of the New Jersey state government. ... At the end of our conversation, I said to myself, 'I'm really impressed and inspired by this man. He is my kind of guy.'\" Christie's speech said that the time had now come to tackle \"Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security systems, because they are bankrupting America.\" He bragged that he had ended collective bargaining for employees of the state's government. He bragged that he had impounded money for local school districts, hospitals, state and community colleges, and the commuter-rail system, and had added $150 million in aid for the wealthiest towns in the state. \"[The Democrats] were gonna raise what, in New Jersey, we call 'the Millionaires' Tax. ... But the New Jersey 'Millionaires' Tax' applies to anyone, individual or business, who makes over $400,000 a year. That's called New Jersey math [laughter]. And what's great, I say to people all over the country: 'If you're not a millionaire but want to feel like one [more laughter], come to New Jersey! We'll tax you like a millionaire even if you're not one!\" Though a person who makes $400,000 per year can safely be assumed to be a multi-millionaire, Christie's audience were apparently delighted to deceive themselves to believe that blocking a tax on such people and cutting government services to the public were patriotic and public-spirited; so, Christie received a standing ovation from these mobsters - the kinds of people who were heros (like \"John Galt\") to the followers of Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman, Ronald Reagan, and other such intellectual thugs.\n\n\n\nThe Republican Party had been moved even farther to the right. Heritage Foundation played a key role in this. Jim DeMint led it all the way, even before he ran the place.\n\n\n\nOn 30 October 2010, The New York Times headlined \"Tea Party Kingmaker Becomes Power Unto Himself,\" and reported that South Carolina's U.S. Senator Jim DeMint was the new political powerhouse in the Senate, and his protege Marco Rubio was now virtually certain to win the U.S. Senate seat in Florida. \"Koch Industries, which finances libertarian causes like the Cato Institute and Americans for prosperity, is among the top donors to both Mr. DeMint and his political action committee.\" Rubio was a lifelong libertarian, and his hero was Ayn Rand. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal bannered \"Swing Voters Are Flocking to GOP,\" and quoted mainly Democratic Party strategists as saying, of independent voters, that \"They are behaving like Republicans.\" No matter how far to the right the new crop of Republican candidates were, voters were increasingly preferring them to Democratic candidates; and, clearly, the next Congress would be far more conservative than any previous Congress in U.S. history. John Birch Society extremism of the 1960's had now emerged as the ordinary Republicanism of 2010, and (for the first time ever) was being preferred to the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nGallup headlined the same day, \"Republicans Appear Poised to Win Big on Tuesday,\" and reported that, \"Republicans' 15-point lead [55% to 40%] among likely voters contrasts with their 4-point lead, 48% to 44%, among registered voters,\" and, \"This year's 15-point gap in favor of the Republican candidates among likely voters is unprecedented in Gallup polling.\" (Exit polls ended up showing that the richest 2% of the U.S. population constituted 8% of the voters in the November 2010 elections. Fear of having their taxes raised on all their income above $250,000 brought them out even more than usually. 8% of the vote can easily sway outcomes in close races.)\n\n\n\nAll polls showed that the Republicans were roaring back into power, and farther to the right than ever. On November 1st, election eve, Fox \"News\" star Sarah Palin was asked by Fox \"News\" star Bill O'Reilly, \"Can you be too far right in this country?\" She answered \"No,\" and explained that rightist extremism would be the only way to restore \"a balance of power,\" to counteract the \"extreme liberalism that has control of the House, the Senate and the White House.\" She said that, \"At this point in time, ... a far right bent would be healthy.\" Of course, O'Reilly didn't ask her whether Mussolini had been too far right, or whether Hitler had been too far right. She probably would have said that both men had been extreme leftists, closet Marxists like Obama. And this verbal exchange occurred on the most-watched program in all of cable news, the \"O'Reilly Factor.\" Yet, probably few of the viewers were disturbed that even after this nation's war against fascism in WWII, fascist propaganda was victorious, now, finally, in 2010. \"... a far right bent would be healthy\" -- Really? Achtung!\n\n\n\nThe mid-terms replaced numerous congressional and gubernatorial Democrats by Republicans. For example, early on election night, 2 November 2010, it was announced that the progressive Democratic U.S. Senator Russ Feingold -- the independent Democrat, who had been the McCain-Feingold law co-sponsor, who had also been one of 28 Senators (all Democrats) to vote against invading Iraq, and who had been one of only three voting against Obama's war in Afghanistan -- was replaced by a far-right millionaire, Ron Johnson, who had said that he didn't believe in global warming, \"not by any stretch of the imagination. I think it's far more likely that it's just sunspot activity.\" Johnson was a wealthy industrialist who received massive cash infusions from the Kochs and their friends. (There were subsequently headlines such as \"Ron Johnson Votes 100% for Koch Brothers During First Year,\" and \"Sen. Johnson Dines With David Koch.\") He supported discrimination against homosexuals, and opposed a woman's right to choose an abortion; he even opposed embryonic stem cell research. Though Feingold received a four-point edge among female voters, Johnson won a decisive five-point edge among male voters. Feingold won the cities, but Johnson won the suburbs and rural areas. Independent voters in this election were fascists and not middle-of-the-road; so, Johnson won. And so too did many other Koch servants, such as Rick Scott. Then, at 8AM on Wednesday morning, Mother Jones headlined \"Rick Scott Buys, Er, Wins Florida Governor Race,\" and Andy Kroll reported that \"Rick Scott, the health care executive whose former company engaged in massive Medicare and Medicaid fraud under his watch, narrowly edged out Democrat Alex Sink, the state's chief financial officer.\" Scott, who should have been a convict in prison sentenced to life, was instead to become Florida's extremely wealthy fascist Governor in the Governor's mansion, instead of merely in his own mansion.\n\n\n\nWithin a few months as Florida's Governor, Scott required drug testing four times yearly for all employees of Florida's government. His family owned a giant drug-testing company, and soon the headlines were \"Rick Scott Wants the Tax Payers to Fund His Clinics.\" What type of suckers would have voted for such a psychopath? The same type that had voted for George W. Bush who then lied the U.S. into invading Iraq. In Florida, they were now the majority.\n\n\n\nToday's shutdown-Republicans are Representatives in districts that were gerrymandered by the Congress produced by this 2010 Republican landslide, and these districts are so solidly Republican that the only elections that count for these politicians now are their own Republican primaries. No Democrat stands a chance in such a district. Winning the primary means being re-elected. And Jim DeMint's strategy is for there to be enough of them in such districts where the only competition is to be as far right as possible, so as to be able to block whatever a Democratic President puts forth. The result is governmental paralysis. This comes from the anti-government Party; but the only type of \"government\" that they really oppose is democracy. Fascism is fine with them.\n\n\n\nThus, on 18 September 2013, Norm Ornstein, the only resident non-fascist at the American Enterprise Institute (who had been placed there so they'd be able to call themselves \"nonpartisan\") headlined at the National Journal, \"Congress's Fiscal Fiasco Forces Americans to Wear Badge of Shame,\" and he boldly wrote: \"It is clear that a slew of Republicans inside Congress, bolstered by forces outside like [Heritage Foundation chief Jim DeMint's] Heritage Action, will push their crusade to crush Obamacare by holding the debt-ceiling hostage.\" The same day, Greg Sargent blogged at the Washington Post, \"If We Get a Debt Ceiling Crisis, It's Because Republican Voters Want One,\" and he reported that in the latest ABC News Washington Post poll, taken on September 12-15, \"Among Republicans who believe not raising it [the debt limit] would cause serious harm, a majority say don't raise it, by 53-32.\" That 53% of Republicans were enemies of the country: they wanted to harm the country. Obama still, even in his fifth year, had not explained Obamacare in any clear terms to the American people, not countered the Koch propaganda against it, and so this same poll reported that by a 52% to 42% margin, Americans chose \"Oppose\" when asked, \"Overall, do you support or oppose the federal law making changes to the healthcare system?\" John Boehner's team were now taking advantage of this Republican-electorate intransigence, combined with American-public Obamacare-confusion, so as to claim that they had an argument to either shut down the Government or else force Obama and congressional Democrats to abandon Obamacare. Ornstein closed: \"We are careening toward economic disruption triggered by outrageous demands [by Republicans] that jeopardize the economy and endanger the most vulnerable among us. Shameful is the only way to describe it.\"\n\n\n\nOn 26 September 2013, BusinessWeek bannered \"Jim DeMint, Congressional Republicans' Shadow Speaker,\" and profiled the top strategist for the Republicans, noting that, \"DeMint helped to elect many of the most influential rising conservatives, including [Ted] Cruz [Senator from Texas] and Marco Rubio [Senator from Florida].\" Texas was George W. Bush country, and Florida was Jeb Bush country; and DeMint was carrying the Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute rabid libertarianism into the Party's inner sanctum, to become the leadership of the Party. Senator Cruz was currently leading in the Senate the support of the Republican extremists in the House, who wanted to shut down the U.S. Government unless Obamacare was defunded - the long-time goal and campaign of Jim DeMint, who now held the Party in his grip from his seat atop Heritage Foundation and its Heritage Action.\n\n\n\nAlso on September 26th, Bloomberg News headlined \"American [sic] Reject Effort to End Obamacare Amid Ad Barrage,\" and reported their poll, which showed that \"three in five people say they think the law will raise medical-care costs, and more say they will be worse off ... under it,\" but \"Half of Americans say Republicans should stop demanding\" ending it \"as part of legislation to keep the government running.\" This article also noted that an estimated $500 million \"has been spent on political and advocacy ads related to the law in the past three years,\" and \"about $500 million more will be spent in the coming year.\" One ad, from the Kochs, titled \"Creepy Uncle Sam,\" was presenting a creepy-looking \"Uncle Sam\" about to look between the legs of a female patient, then of a male patient; another, from the Kochs' Americans For Prosperity, insinuated that if Obamacare went into effect, \"we can't pick our own doctor,\" though that was false. Under the circumstances, and given that Republicans' prejudices were in accord with almost all of these ads, Republican voters were overwhelmingly opposed to letting Obamacare start, and most Americans thought that Obamacare would hurt both themselves and the nation.\n\n\n\nDeMint had introduced his strategy years earlier, at Heritage, even before he ran the place. Soon after Bush II, GWB, came into office, it was explained in \"Bush's Trillions,\" an article by Nicholas LeMann in the New Yorker on 19 February 2001, in which the Republican South Carolina Congressman (soon to be Senator) DeMint, was quoted as saying, \"Today fewer and fewer people pay taxes, and more and more are dependent on government. ... Every day, the Republican Party is losing constituents, because every day more people vote themselves more benefits without paying for it.\" The goal, therefore, has been to loosen the bond between voters and government, by privatizing Social Security, Medicare, public schools, and other social programs, and by making those programs as bad as possible while they continue as government-run programs. And the best way to force that to happen is to starve government of funds for such programs. (For public education, another means is private school vouchers, which transfer some students into parochial and other private schools, while starving public schools of those funds.) As LeMann put it, \"A program of tax cuts stretching out over many years would make it more difficult for the Democrats to launch new programs that would increase voters' loyalty to them. All these changes would have the collateral benefit of strengthening Republican interest groups, like stockbrokers.\" (Private schools were also a Republican interest group.) This analysis, promoting class warfare by aristocrats against everyone else (the people who rely on those social programs), was developed by DeMint at greater length soon afterward in a lecture on 8 May 2001 at the neo-fascist Heritage Foundation. So, when the Kochs and their friends placed their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Jim DeMint at the helm of their Heritage Foundation, they knew that they saw eye-to-eye with him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This blog is the second part of a story chronicling the Koch brothers' influence on the shutdown.
