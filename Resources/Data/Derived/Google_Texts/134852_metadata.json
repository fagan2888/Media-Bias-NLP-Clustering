Many also have no clear idea of how much their insurance tab would run.\n\nIf you've asked yourself, \"How much will Obamacare cost me?\" We can help you find the answer.\n\nA calculator produced by the Kaiser Family Foundation in collaboration with NPR allows shoppers to find out if they qualify for subsidized insurance coverage or Medicaid.\n\nEnter your ZIP code, income, age, family size and a few other factors into the calculator to get subsidy estimates and insurance premiums available for coverage sold on the marketplaces, or exchanges, once enrollment begins.\n\nThe calculator makes use of premium data from 46 states plus the District of Columbia.
