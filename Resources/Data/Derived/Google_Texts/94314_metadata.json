The deal, which could be valued at more than $1.5 billion, is expected to close in the fourth quarter.\n\nDezima is currently developing TA-8995, an oral drug that reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by up to 48% in a mid-stage trial. In August, the Food and Drug Administration approved Amgen\u2019s cholesterol-lowering Repatha, teeing up a rivalry with a similar treatment that was approved just weeks earlier.\n\nThe agreement with Xencor XNCR, +2.26% covers six programs for which Amgen will be fully responsible for preclinical and clinical development and commercialization.\n\nThe collaboration, which includes molecular engineering by Xencor and preclinical development of bispecific molecules for five programs proposed by Amgen, brings together Amgen\u2019s capabilities in target discovery and protein therapeutics with Xencor\u2019s XmAb antibody engineering technology platform, the companies said.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BH365_amgen__MG_20130826103455.jpg", "height": 398}, "description": "Deals are aimed at expanding cardiovascular and immuno-oncology portfolios.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Lisa Beilfuss", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Deals are aimed at expanding cardiovascular and immuno-oncology portfolios.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amgen-to-buy-dezima-signs-pact-with-xencor-2015-09-16", "author": "Lisa Beilfuss", "parsely-title": "Amgen to buy Dezima, signs pact with Xencor", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-16T10:44:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Deals are aimed at expanding cardiovascular and immuno-oncology portfolios.", "title": "Amgen to buy Dezima, signs pact with Xencor", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amgen-to-buy-dezima-signs-pact-with-xencor-2015-09-16", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BH365_amgen__MG_20130826103455.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BH365_amgen__MG_20130826103455.jpg"}, "article.id": "7FA43114-5C80-11E5-834F-F548A71C505E", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd927d\"", "article_summary": "Amgen AMGN, +1.87% will pay $300 million in cash upfront and up to $1.25 billion in milestone payments for cholesterol-drug maker Dezima.\nThe agreement with Xencor XNCR, +2.26% covers six programs for which Amgen will be fully responsible for preclinical and clinical development and commercialization.\nIn August, the Food and Drug Administration approved Amgen\u2019s cholesterol-lowering Repatha, teeing up a rivalry with a similar treatment that was approved just weeks earlier.\nDezima is currently developing TA-8995, an oral drug that reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by up to 48% in a mid-stage trial.\nBloombergAmgen Inc. said Wednesday that it has agreed to buy Netherlands-based Dezima Pharma BV and struck a research and license agreement with Xencor Inc., as the biotech company aims to expand both its cardiovascular and immuno-oncology portfolio."}
