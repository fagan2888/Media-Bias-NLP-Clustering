There is another company that can be added to the list in the form of GROUNDFLOOR, which is based in Raleigh, N.C.\n\nThe company, which is described as a progressive real estate crowd-funding startup, announced this week that it has closed its initial first round of funding led by investors Bandwidth Labs and the American Underground. Harnessing the breadth and scale of the Web, the company connects independent real estate entrepreneurs with early-stage loans funded online by mass-market savers and investors. The seed capital will allow GROUNDFLOOR to bring a series of pilot projects to market in late 2013 and early 2014.\n\n\u201cThe Web has a message for Wall Street,\u201d says Brian Dally, co-founder and CEO of GROUNDFLOOR. \u201cReal estate innovators and doers frustrated with the bank underwriting status quo are ready to be unleashed. Banding together, depositors and self-directed investors can do everything traditional lenders do, but better\u2014to the benefit of a broader base of people well beyond accredited investors and powerful incumbent financial institutions.\u201d\n\nCo-founders Dally and Nick Bhargava built GROUNDFLOOR on a common interest in commercializing radical technologies designed to disrupt entrenched incumbents. John Austin introduced the duo in October 2012 through NC IDEA\u2019s Groundwork Labs. Dally, a 15-year veteran of technology startups based in Silicon Valley, Boston and London, most recently engineered the launch of Bandwidth.com\u2019s Republic Wireless, a provider that successfully battled the big four cellphone carriers to enter the smartphone service market. Bhargava lends expertise in securities law innovation earned during his role in developing Title III of the JOBS Act, in which he fought to ease securities regulations for unaccredited investors and bring the concept of equity crowd funding to the mainstream.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress", "author": "Darren Currin", "og": {"site_name": "The Journal Record", "description": "In my Lot Lines column in today\u2019s Journal Record, I talked about the rise of crowd funding in commercial real estate and some of the online companies attempting to facilitate crowd-sourced commerci...", "title": "[BLOG] Yet another crowd funding firm targets commercial real estate", "url": "http://journalrecord.com/2013/10/25/blog-yet-another-crowd-funding-firm-targets-commercial-real-estate/", "image": "http://journalrecord.com/files/2013/10/20131024100129ENPRNPRN-GROUNDFLOOR-LOGO-CL03564-1y-1382608889MR.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "[BLOG] Yet another crowd funding firm targets commercial real estateThe Journal Record", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "commercial real estate,commercial real estate trends", "google-site-verification": "vAy42WJoFK0to-yBz3axT36JMlFa0BIJdchVGi9IPXw", "y_key": "b211670718d8bd21", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce444\"", "article_summary": "\u201cReal estate innovators and doers frustrated with the bank underwriting status quo are ready to be unleashed.\nIn my Lot Lines column in today\u2019s Journal Record, I talked about the rise of crowd funding in commercial real estate and some of the online companies attempting to facilitate crowd-sourced commercial deals.\nHarnessing the breadth and scale of the Web, the company connects independent real estate entrepreneurs with early-stage loans funded online by mass-market savers and investors.\nThe company, which is described as a progressive real estate crowd-funding startup, announced this week that it has closed its initial first round of funding led by investors Bandwidth Labs and the American Underground.\nThere is another company that can be added to the list in the form of GROUNDFLOOR, which is based in Raleigh, N.C."}
