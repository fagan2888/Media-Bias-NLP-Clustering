A former aide and long time friend of former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown has left his role inside New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's office to serve as Brown's campaign manager for his Senate race in New Hampshire, WMUR Political Scoop has learned.

Colin Reed served as the Brown's communications director for his re-election campaign in 2012. The pair talked frequently after the campaign and during Brown's flirtation with running in New Hampshire over the past year.

"I've known Scott for more than four years. An opportunity to work with him again is something I couldn't pass up. I am excited for the next seven months and a victory in November," Reed said.

Reed left his job earlier this week as the deputy communications director for Christie. Democrats will surely point out that he was subpoenaed as part of the Bridge-gate controversy. So far, though, Reed has not been suspected to be involved in the matter.

On Friday, Reed was already in New Hampshire traveling in western New Hampshire with Brown.

Prior to Christie and Brown, Reed, a Massachusetts native, worked on the John McCain presidential campaign and for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. His first job in politics was an intern with Gov. Mitt Romney's office, where he first came into contact with Ryan Williams, who is a consultant for the New Hampshire Republican Party.

This move puts two former Christie aides in top spots in New Hampshire Republican politics. In addition to Reed running the Brown campaign, former Christie campaign aide Matt Mowers is the executive director of the state Republican Party.
