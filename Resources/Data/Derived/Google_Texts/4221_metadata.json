Torres entered a consent decree of permanent injunction against the company and its two owners, Teresa Martinez and Elsy Cruz.\n\nUnder the terms of the consent decree, the company will not be allowed to manufacture or sell dietary supplement products until the FDA has determined that the business is in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\n\u201cThe FDA is committed to protecting the public health by ensuring dietary supplement makers operate in accordance with the law,\u201d stated Melinda Plaisier, associate commissioner in the FDA\u2019s Office of Regulatory Affairs. \u201cGood Manufacturing Practice regulations are designed to safeguard consumers and violation of these requirements will result in enforcement action.\u201d\n\nThe FDA issued Sunset Natural Products a Warning Letter on March 19, 2013, for violations of the cGMP requirements as well as unapproved drug claims. The FDA\u2019s follow-up inspections in 2014 found that although the company removed drug claims from its products, it failed to bring its manufacturing operations into compliance with cGMP.\n\nThe consent decree prohibits the company and its owners from marketing dietary supplements until they, among other things, recall and destroy the dietary supplements that have been manufactured or distributed since April 2, 2014, hire a cGMP expert and receive written permission from the FDA to resume operations.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_thumbnail_image/09-2015/vitamins.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Michael Johnsen", "description": "Under the terms of the consent decree, the company will not be allowed to manufacture or sell dietary supplement products until the FDA has determined that the business is in compliance.", "og": {"image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_medium_image/09-2015/vitamins.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "title": "FDA shuts down Miami company for non-compliance with GMPs"}, "twitter": {"description": "Under the terms of the consent decree, the company will not be allowed to manufacture or sell dietary supplement products until the FDA has determined that the business is in compliance.", "title": "FDA shuts down Miami company for non-compliance with GMPs", "url": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/article/fda-shuts-down-miami-company-non-compliance-gmps", "image": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_main_image/2015-09/vitamins.jpg", "site": "@drugstorenews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-28 01:01:00", "sailthru.title": "FDA shuts down Miami company for non-compliance with GMPs", "keywords": "fda, vms, gmp, short, story", "google-site-verification": "qD-DLdnS9RBbjYJ-MITi4cSvUByohsoX4WClEJJuv7I", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_main_image/2015-09/vitamins.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Torres entered a consent decree of permanent injunction against the company and its two owners, Teresa Martinez and Elsy Cruz.\nThe FDA\u2019s follow-up inspections in 2014 found that although the company removed drug claims from its products, it failed to bring its manufacturing operations into compliance with cGMP.\nUnder the terms of the consent decree, the company will not be allowed to manufacture or sell dietary supplement products until the FDA has determined that the business is in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\nThe consent decree prohibits the company and its owners from marketing dietary supplements until they, among other things, recall and destroy the dietary supplements that have been manufactured or distributed since April 2, 2014, hire a cGMP expert and receive written permission from the FDA to resume operations.\n\u201cThe FDA is committed to protecting the public health by ensuring dietary supplement makers operate in accordance with the law,\u201d stated Melinda Plaisier, associate commissioner in the FDA\u2019s Office of Regulatory Affairs."}
