An outrageous (& liberal) view of abortion

Joseph Cotto's conclusion that liberalism's advocacy of Roe v. Wade has kept the USA from sliding into the Third World abyss is outrageous (“A rational (& conservative) view of abortion,” Sept. 20).

This is like saying forced labor and the Holocaust significantly reduced unemployment in the Third Reich.

You can depend on liberals to paint conservatives in a bad light and apply a happy face on misguided liberal policies. In this case, 54 million pre-born — mostly minorities — were eradicated before ever seeing daylight. In any other time, this would be condemned as genocide.

If a conservative rationalized the genocide of 54 million children, social media would explode from the outcry.

Mr. Cotto did not speculate on how well off the USA would be less 30 million illegal aliens or what would happen if ObamaCare applied a similar solution for the ills of the old, the infirm and the handicapped as a matter of cost avoidance to national health care.

When a society begins to rationalize the killing of what a prophet once termed “the lest of these” as an acceptable means to solve social ills, that society is near collapse.
