Police arrested three men who reportedly broke into a pickup truck in northeast Oklahoma City and stole a guitar worth $4,500.

At about 10:30 a.m. Monday, the victim reported to police that someone had gotten into his truck in the 9100 block of Bella Vista Lane and stolen his guitar. The victim believes that the suspect may have used a Slim Jim because the truck was not damaged.
