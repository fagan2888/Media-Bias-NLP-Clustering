Defending champion Uruguay ended with four points but advanced as one of the best-two third-place finishers.\n\nJamaica, eliminated before the match began, finished the tournament with zero points and no goals scored.\n\nBy finishing first in the group, Argentina will get to play the quarterfinals against the second-best third-place finisher in all three groups.\n\nArgentina is trying to end a 22-year title drought. It hasn\u2019t won a significant trophy since the 1993 Copa America in Ecuador, when Messi was only six years old.\n\n\u201cWe reached the first goal, which was to advance in first place,\u201d Messi said. \u201cWe played a great first half and we could\u2019ve scored more, but in the second we didn\u2019t have the same intensity, everything was slower. In the knockout matches we can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nMessi put in a lackluster performance in his milestone match. His most significant chance came in the 56th, when his lob shot from the top of the area was barely stopped by the outstretched arms of Jamaica goalkeeper Dwayne Miller.\n\nThe mediocre performance didn\u2019t affect Messi\u2019s popularity, though. After the final whistle, Jamaican striker Deshorn Brown was seen taking a selfie with the Barcelona star before the teams left the field.\n\nArgentina outplayed Jamaica from the beginning at the Sausalito Stadium. It created a series of scoring chances, especially in the first half, but had difficulties capitalizing on the opportunities. Twice it hit the crossbar of goalkeeper Miller.\n\n\u201cThe second half was boring,\u201d Argentina coach Gerardo Martino said. \u201cWe were in control but didn\u2019t have enough quickness to be able to threaten Jamaica or any other rival. If we play like this in future games we will be in trouble.\u201d\n\nHiguain, in his 50th match with the national team, scored the winner with a right-footed strike from near the penalty spot, turning in front of three Jamaican defenders before sending a low shot into the net after a pass by Angel Di Maria.\n\nJamaica, focused on the upcoming Gold Cup, tried to push forward near the end but it wasn\u2019t enough to get the equalizer.\n\n\u201cIn the first half we had too much respect for Argentina, the second-best team in the world,\u201d Jamaica\u2019s German coach Winfried Schafer said. \u201cThe players were nervous facing Messi, Di Maria, (Javier) Mascherano.\u201d\n\nThe Argentines won the previous four Copa Americas played in Chile, the last in 1991. The World Cup finalists hosted the South American tournament in 2011, but Messi and his teammates were eliminated by eventual champion Uruguay in the quarterfinals. Argentina lost consecutive Copa America finals to Brazil in 2004 and 2007.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Argentina defeated Jamaica 1-0 in Lionel Messi's 100th game with the national team on Saturday, securing first place in its Copa America group.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Argentina defeated Jamaica 1-0 in Lionel Messi\u2019s 100th game with the national team on Saturday, securing first place in its Copa America group.", "title": "Argentina beats Jamaica to finish 1st in Copa America group", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/20/argentina-beats-jamaica-to-finish-1st-in-copa-amer/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/20/8899ee2489aef51b790f6a7067001f02.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/20/8899ee2489aef51b790f6a7067001f02.jpg", "description": "Argentina defeated Jamaica 1-0 in Lionel Messi's 100th game with the national team on Saturday, securing first place in its Copa America group.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Argentina beats Jamaica to finish 1st in Copa America group"}, "Author": "SEBASTIAN PEREZ-FERREIRO", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1579\"", "article_summary": "VINA DEL MAR, Chile (AP) - Argentina defeated Jamaica 1-0 in Lionel Messi\u2019s 100th game with the national team on Saturday, securing first place in its Copa America group.\nIt hasn\u2019t won a significant trophy since the 1993 Copa America in Ecuador, when Messi was only six years old.\nArgentina lost consecutive Copa America finals to Brazil in 2004 and 2007.\nArgentina reached seven points with the victory in Group B, two points more than Paraguay, which earlier in the day drew Uruguay 1-1 in La Serena.\nBy finishing first in the group, Argentina will get to play the quarterfinals against the second-best third-place finisher in all three groups."}
