But blacks are expected to become 5.5 percent of our state by 2040. These issues won't go away.\n\nWith race relations, America seems to be in \"a phase where there's a false belief that things were equalized, and they were not,\" Welburn said\n\nNagging racial disparities are a statistical reality that help frame the issues that the Register's \"Black Iowa: Still Unequal?\" series will explore in the months ahead. Some examples:\n\n\u2022FAMILY LIFE: The very structure of black and white families in Iowa can be starkly different. Married families represent only about a quarter of African-American households in Iowa, compared with more than half of white households. A single mom lives with her kids in 20 percent of black Iowa households, compared with about 5 percent of white households.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Marshon Glover, Jr., wasn't the intended target of recent gun violence that broke out in Waterloo, but a 3-inch scar in his belly will forever remind him of the day he was struck by a stray bullet. Bryon Houlgrave/The Register\n\n\u2022POVERTY: Thirty-nine percent of black families in Iowa with children under 18 live below the poverty level, compared with 13.9 percent for the state overall.\n\nFood stamps are received by 42 percent of black households, compared with 11 percent of white households.\n\n\u2022HOUSING: More blacks are renters (73.4 percent) than Iowans in general (29.2 percent).\n\n\u2022JOBS AND INCOME: The median income for black Iowa households is $27,406 compared with $52,652 for whites.\n\nEven before the recession, blacks endured an unemployment rate two or more times higher than whites \u2014 as high as 20 percent in 2005. The 2013 comparative statistics show an 11.6 percent unemployment rate for blacks, compared with 4.8 percent overall.\n\n\u2022HEALTH: Shortly before the Affordable Care Act kicked in, only 44 percent of black Iowans had private health insurance, compared with 77 percent of white Iowans.\n\nAn overwhelming percentage of white Iowa children, 91 percent, had a health status of \"excellent\" or \"very good\" in a 2013 University of Iowa Public Policy Center study, compared with just 76 percent of black children.\n\n\u2022EDUCATION: Five percent of students in Iowa's K-12 classrooms are African-American, yet 14 percent of all school dropouts are black. And this figure has worsened in a little more than a decade: Only 8 percent of dropouts were black in the 2002-2003 school year.\n\nFewer black students are at grade level than their white or Hispanic classmates, according to National Assessment of Educational Progress scores. By this measure, black students in Iowa also fare worse than the national average \u2014 56 percent of them are below grade level in Iowa, compared with half of black students nationally.\n\nBlack students' graduation rates have edged up through the decades, from just 64 percent in 1996 to 75 percent in 2002 and 79 percent last year. But they still lag behind Iowa's overall graduation rate of 91 percent.\n\nThere are just 15 percent of black Iowans age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree, compared with 26 percent overall.\n\n\u2022INCARCERATION: Iowa most stands out from national norms \u2014 and not in a positive way \u2014 in key criminal justice statistics.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Waterloo\u2019s police chief and director of safety, Dan Trelka, takes you on a driving tour of his city, highlighting areas of recent violence and shootings. Trelka has worked to increase outreach with the black community. Bryon Houlgrave/The Register\n\nA USA Today analysis of census data combined with FBI and U.S. Bureau of Justice statistics found that blacks were arrested nearly 10 times as often as other races in Iowa. Bettendorf (9.9 times) and Cedar Falls (9.7) had the highest disparities.\n\nIowa in 2007, the most recent data available, ranked worst in the nation in the ratio of blacks in prison, according to the Sentencing Project, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nBlacks represent more than a quarter of Iowa's prison population.\n\nA study released in 2013 by the ACLU showed that blacks in Iowa were about eight times more likely than whites to be arrested for possession of a small amount of marijuana, even though both groups used the drug at about the same rate. That disparity was the worst in the nation.\n\nChief Justice Mark Cady of the Iowa Supreme Court in his State of the Judiciary address at the start of the year called for Iowa to lead the way in reducing theses disparities. He noted that 9.4 percent of Iowa's adult black men are incarcerated \u2014 the third-highest percentage in the nation.\n\nThere has been a push for Iowa to join the \"ban the box\" movements \u2014 removing questions about criminal records from the first stage of job applications to give candidates a chance to show their qualifications before disclosing their criminal history.\n\nDespite some of these grim statistics, Welburn also struck a hopeful tone. Although driven by one crisis after another, this past year has seen a renewed focus on entrenched racial disparities in modern America. Intense, sustained news coverage \"has enabled the discussion to have more of a national audience,\" she said.\n\n\"The severity of the events and the persistence of activists, protesters, community leaders and others of not letting the stories go away, not letting people lose sight of the loss of life,\" Welburn said, \"has enabled some of these issues to be brought to the forefront.\"\n\nAfrican-American population in Iowa\n\nTop 5 counties\n\n1.
