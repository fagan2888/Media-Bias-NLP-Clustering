For every one adoption referral, the organization performed 174 abortions. Their adoption referrals dropped by 14 percent from the previous year.\n\nPlanned Parenthood highlighted its abortion advocacy in the report. A student named Dakota quoted in the report plans to \u201cgo to medical school and become an abortion provider\u201d because of Planned Parenthood.\n\nTaxpayer funding accounts for 41 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s revenue.\n\nWhile the number of abortions performed by the organization increased, Planned Parenthood\u2019s other services, such as cancer screenings, prenatal care and contraceptive services decreased.\n\nPlanned Parenthood also distributed 1,440,495 \u201cemergency contraceptive kits.\u201d Opponents of these drugs say they are an abortifacient, terminating a fertilized egg, thus ending a pregnancy and a life.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2013-14, Planned Parenthood received more than $528 million in taxpayer funds; or about $1.4 million per day. Taxpayer funding accounts for 41 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s revenue.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, a nonprofit, currently holds more than $1.4 billion in net assets.\n\n\u201cThe abortion rate may be declining across America, but not in Planned Parenthood clinics,\u201d Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said in a statement.\n\nTheir latest annual report is fresh evidence that Planned Parenthood remains an abortion-centered, profit-driven business. In 2013, Planned Parenthood upped the number of abortions they performed to 327,653. Meanwhile, their already limited cancer screenings, prenatal services, adoption referrals \u2013 and even contraception services \u2013 continue to drop. Planned Parenthood claims to be an altruistic health care provider for women and girls but their bottom line is all about abortion.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, according to the report, \u201cremains the nation\u2019s leading reproductive health care provider.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions in 2013\u2014all while accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer funds.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions in 2013\u2014all while accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer funds.", "title": "Planned Parenthood Performed 327,653 Abortions in 2013", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150102_PlannedParenthood.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-02T16:57:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1D0jtpt"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions in 2013\u2014all while accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer funds.", "title": "Planned Parenthood Performed 327,653 Abortions in 2013", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150102_PlannedParenthood.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-01-03T03:01:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T16:57:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Abortion, pro-life, pro-choice, abortion provides, abortion clinics, planned parenthood, taxpayer funded abortion, Susan B.
