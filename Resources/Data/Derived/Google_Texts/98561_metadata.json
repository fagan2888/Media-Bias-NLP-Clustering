But for a Palestinian student studying in the West Bank, this subject didn\u2019t have consistent or accessible course materials. Alsaafin would have also preferred another major and says, \u201cEnglish language was my second choice.\u201dOn Nov. 12, Hammad and Alsaafin spoke at Stanford University about their experiences having their education interrupted by the Israeli state as part of that national tour. The two students have been traveling to campuses and communities across the U.S., as part of the Right to Education tour that aims to highlight the injustices Palestinians face as university students.Kristian Davis Bailey, a member of National Students for Justice in Palestine and a 2014 graduate of Stanford, helped plan the U.S. tour. \u201cI went to Palestine last summer and met with the coordinator of the Right to Education Campaign at Birzeit,\u201d Bailey explained. \u201cA couple weeks later, I got an email saying, \u2018Hey, would Stanford want to host some students for a speaking visit?\u2019 And that turned into, \u2018Oh, why don\u2019t we get students to come across California?\u2019 And that turned into, \u2018Oh, why don\u2019t we have a national tour?\u2019\u201dDuring their talk, Hammad and Alsaafin explained how checkpoints \u2014 the many passageways guarded by armed Israeli soldiers \u2014 mean that students have to leave for class at a nearby university three hours early. They also may not have a teacher in class, as many of their professors have been jailed by the Israeli state.\u201cSometimes you\u2019re not able to get to school because of checkpoints,\u201d Hammad said. \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t let you in, sometimes they hold you for hours \u2026 [It] doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re an old woman, a kid, a man or a young boy.\u201dAlsaafin added: \u201cWe also don\u2019t really have intellectual exchange among students because everyone is so localized \u2026 due to the Israeli restriction of movement.\u201dThe Right to Education tour is part of the larger Right to Education Campaign that was started in the late-1980s \u201cas a reaction to the Israeli military orders to shut down all the educational institutions,\u201d according to Hammad. The campaign is based out of Birzeit University in the West Bank and has the goal of protecting the human right of education for Palestinians.\u201cEducation is a form of justice,\u201d Hammad said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Two Palestinian students have been traveling across the U.S., as part of the Right to Education tour that aims to highlight the injustices Palestinians face as university students.", "title": "Palestinian students campaign for the right to education  - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PalestinianStudents.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-21T11:30:21+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/12/19/palestinian-students-right-to-education-tour/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Culture", "tag": "Right2Edu", "published_time": "2014-12-19T10:50:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-21T11:30:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two Palestinian students have been traveling across the U.S., as part of the Right to Education tour that aims to highlight the injustices Palestinians face as university students.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PalestinianStudents.jpg", "title": "Palestinian students campaign for the right to education  - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe80\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI went to Palestine last summer and met with the coordinator of the Right to Education Campaign at Birzeit,\u201d Bailey explained.\nThe campaign is based out of Birzeit University in the West Bank and has the goal of protecting the human right of education for Palestinians.\u201cEducation is a form of justice,\u201d Hammad said.\nBut for a Palestinian student studying in the West Bank, this subject didn\u2019t have consistent or accessible course materials.\nThe two students have been traveling to campuses and communities across the U.S., as part of the Right to Education tour that aims to highlight the injustices Palestinians face as university students.Kristian Davis Bailey, a member of National Students for Justice in Palestine and a 2014 graduate of Stanford, helped plan the U.S. tour.\nShatha Hammad and Deema Alsaafin study English language and literature, not because of an undying love for Shakespeare, but because getting textbooks and materials for other majors proved unmanageable."}
