Powerful thunderstorms pelted parts of the metro area with heavy hail on Monday, and forecasters warned that more hail and tornadoes are possible as two weather systems collide.

Up to 4 inches of hail fell on parts of Centennial. A tornado watch has been issued for 14 counties in the metro area and on the Eastern Plains, according to the National Weather Service. Those counties included Douglas, Adams, Logan and Weld.

That watch was downgraded to a warning at about 3:15 p.m., although Arapahoe and Elbert counties had a warning in effect until 3:45 p.m.

The Adams 12 Five Star Schools system delayed the release of children after classes until the severe weather subsided.

A severe thunderstorm warning is also in effect for most of the metro area and northeastern Colorado.

Several thunderstorms are expected to form over the state and slowly move to the northeast Monday evening.

There is an 80 percent chance of precipitation in Denver and wind gust could be as strong as 23 mph overnight.

Large hail and gusty winds are possible in the eastern metro area and Eastern Plains. Winds could be as strong as 60 to 70 mph in counties such as Logan and Phillips.

Operations at Denver International Airport are normal, but officials said staff will remain on alert for the duration of the tornado watch and thunderstorm warnings.
