According to Margot Sanger-Katz of The New York Times:

“After rising for a decade, the number of Americans experiencing financial distress from their medical bills has started to decline, a new survey has found…In each survey through 2012, a higher percentage of Americans said they struggled to pay their medical bills, were paying off medical debt or had been contacted by a collection agency. The most recent installment of the survey, the first since the health law’s major provisions kicked in, shows a reversal in that trend.” Sanger-Katz adds “The survey also found that fewer people were avoiding doctors’ visits because of concerns about cost.”

The survey, by the Commonwealth Fund, is being cited by Sanger-Katz as a success story for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as the increased “financial security” with regards to medical care was a “major goal of the law.” However, Sanger-Katz notes:

[T]here is another trend cutting against those improving financial protections for individuals. Employers are increasingly asking their workers to pay deductibles and other fees when they seek health care, and several recent surveys have shown that the average size of those deductibles and fees is rising.

It’s questionable to cite general “increased financial security” as a means test for a law that requires major tax increases in order to function. Citing increased financial security as a success implies that the increase is pervasive, and as such, helps all who participate in the ACA.

However, while some Americans are paying less, some are paying more. Much more.

According to a NYT/CBS poll conducted in December, 33% of Americans say that they are paying substantially higher prices for their care “over the last few years” than they were previously.

Additionally, according to Fox News, the tax increases levied against Americans because of the ACA appear to have the effect of a transfer of wealth, rather than a net benefit. Fox breaks down the share of the ACA tax burden Americans will pay over the next ten years, according to their income bracket:

“If you make under $15,000: it’s just over $59.00. If you make between $50,000 and $100,000, it’s $6,069.90. And if you make between $200,000 and $250,000, it’s $38,200.66”

The NYT article doesn’t take into account the spectrum of “increased” financial security. Some may be benefiting from the ACA because they are seeing reduced costs — driving down the number of “financially distressed” Americans — the increased burden on the middle, and upper class isn’t being measured.

While some lower-income Americans may be benefiting from the ACA, premiums are increasing for others. It’s truly an exchange of wealth, and that exchange is resulting in fewer Americans “experiencing financial distress,” according to the cited study.

Although the reduction in “financial distress” for a small portion of individuals is certainly a piece of the puzzle in terms of measuring the success of the ACA, there are numerous other factors at play that have equal or greater weight, such as rising premiums and increased tax burdens.
