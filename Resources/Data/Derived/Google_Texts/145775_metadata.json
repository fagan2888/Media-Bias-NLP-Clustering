After observing family-owned business leaders for over a quarter century, we are still amazed\u2013and we know we\u2019re stepping on toes here\u2013at how poorly they manage themselves and their time. Their time management problems can be squeezed into four broad categories:\n\nDoing things they shouldn\u2019t be doing at all Doing the right things, but doing them inefficiently or ineffectively Time spent which is purely waste Possessing no system or technique for mastering the 24-hour day and the executive requirements that must fit into it\n\nNinety-five percent of family business leaders would be well served to enroll in a Time Management 101 class.\n\nSome small-business leaders see themselves as the employee of last resort for various routine jobs.\n\nThey\u2019re the ones who change the light bulbs, run errands, make deliveries, handle the mail, etc.\n\nSurely they know intellectually that another employee could do these mundane tasks at a much lower cost to the organization. Worse, they don\u2019t see the opportunity costs of using their executive time unwisely.\n\nIf they devoted a few more hours per week to business development, long-term business planning, communicating their vision and values among their teams, rigorously evaluating their talent and getting super-competent new hires on board, and improving corporate quality, they\u2019d see dividends and impact immediately.\n\nSmall-business and family-business leaders love business, but often they seem to love busyness more. Their words and actions give testament to their belief in hard work as the primary contributor to success.\n\nBut hard work is no substitute for smart work; if small-business owners used their time more intelligently, they\u2019d produce not only better companies but better and more well-balanced lives.\n\nWayne Rivers is the co-founder and president of the Family Business Institute and author of books about family and closely held business, including \u201cThe Top Nine Reasons Family Businesses Fail and The Eight Building Blocks for Creating a Sustainable Closely Held Company.\u201d\n\nRead the latest Small Business Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The resource small-business owners should stop using is themselves!", "title": "Four Ways Entrepreneurs Waste Their Time", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/11/06/four-ways-entrepreneurs-waste-their-time/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FK148_expert_P_20141105171342.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "Four Ways Entrepreneurs Waste Their Time", "description": "The resource small-business owners should stop using is themselves!", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "The resource small-business owners should stop using is themselves!", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-11-06T11:05:45-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/11/06/four-ways-entrepreneurs-waste-their-time/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-4529", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The resource small-business owners should stop using is themselves!", "title": "Four Ways Entrepreneurs Waste Their Time", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/11/06/four-ways-entrepreneurs-waste-their-time/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FK148_expert_P_20141105171342.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-4529", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-11-05T22:26:16-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Some small-business leaders see themselves as the employee of last resort for various routine jobs.\nAfter observing family-owned business leaders for over a quarter century, we are still amazed\u2013and we know we\u2019re stepping on toes here\u2013at how poorly they manage themselves and their time.\nSmall-business and family-business leaders love business, but often they seem to love busyness more.\niStockWAYNE RIVERS: The resource small-business owners should stop using is themselves!\nSurely they know intellectually that another employee could do these mundane tasks at a much lower cost to the organization."}
