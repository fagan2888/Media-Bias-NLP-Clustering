But when the little stuff is right, it lets you focus on the big stuff.\n\nThose details, small as they are, can keep bad things from happening.\n\nThinking about adapting housing to an aging population\u2019s needs has been part of architect Shekhar Bhushan\u2019s life for nearly 30 years, since his first job. At Bella Vita, the redevelopment of the former city of Aurora office building at South Havana Street and East Florida Avenue that he worked on with Studio K2 Architects, those details go from floor to ceiling, literally.\n\nThe nuts and bolts of the project read like a list of what homeowners of any age can (and probably should) demand from housing and home improvement: Value, flexibility, and amenities.\n\nThe current generation of downsizing seniors is very different from that of 25 years ago, Bhushan said. They don\u2019t want to be told when and where they\u2019ll take their meals, or when and where they\u2019ll access the services they might need in the future.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll tell you what they want, and you\u2019ll provide it, or they\u2019ll go elsewhere,\u201d Bhushan said.\n\nThey also want connection, says the owner and developer of the building that was re-opened this summer.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing we\u2019re trying to build there is a senior environment where people still feel like they\u2019re part of the community,\u201d said owner Dennis Witte of Omni Development Corp., a company that had never worked on senior housing before. Aurorans \u201ccan go to their same church and their same doctor,\u201d and Omni consulted with a very active homeowners association in the neighborhood, one that has actually booked future meetings into Bella Vita\u2019s common areas.\n\nOmni bought the building about eight years ago. Then the commercial-space market in Aurora plummeted, and after a few close misses on bids for the building as office space, \u201cwe started thinking, \u2018well, what else can we do with it?\u2019 \u201d Witte said.\n\nThe something else was maximize its assets. It had location, adjacent to residential housing and retail, but set a few blocks back from busy Havana Street. Its eight stories gave it the kind of views that would have been costly and logistically difficult to achieve building from scratch in urban or suburban settings.\n\nThe high-rise structure gave it security, one of the qualities that the market research said prospective \u201c55 and better\u201d tenants for the 80-unit building prized.\n\nThose tenants also prized a certain amount of independence. So there\u2019s no meal service.\n\nThere\u2019s a kitchenette and a coffee bar on the ground floor. There\u2019s a wraparound deck on the third floor where residents can grill. But no balconies, because seniors said they didn\u2019t use them.\n\nInstead, there are big, floor-to-ceiling windows with sliding glass doors and screens and decorative wrought-iron railings, because Bhushan has learned that the elderly crave and need more air circulation.\n\nThe lobby, rather than being a cavernous, hotel-like space, is broken into more intimate seating areas, some around a two-sided fireplace, others clustered around a big flat-screen.\n\nBhushan (and Studio K2 Architects, the architect of record on the building) paid a huge amount of attention to lighting. \u201cYou don\u2019t want shadows,\u201d Bhushan said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want glare. You want lots of indirect lighting.\u201d\n\nThe reason: The aging eye reads harsh shadows and contrasts as hazards or changes in elevation, and the body reacts quicker than the mind can correct it. In the lobby rooms, there are four layers of light: ceiling can lights, suspended chandeliers, lamps on the end-tables and wall sconces. In hallways, there are three: Carefully shaded fluorescents, cans and wall sconces. Studio K2\u2019s Geneva Kowalski said bulb choices and real glass or onyx shades helped the lighting feel warm.\n\nIn one of the smaller apartments\u2019 bathrooms, there are two can lights plus a four-light fixture over the mirror. A kitchen in a larger unit has a full six-pack of can lights, evenly spaced across the ceiling. There are 86 units, in sizes ranging from one-bedroom to two-bedroom plus den. Monthly rent, which includes utilities and trash pickup, housekeeping and on-site concierge, range from $1,085 to $2,515.\n\nNearly as much attention went into choosing sofas and chairs for common areas: seat depth, seat height and arms to help one rise were all important. Firm cushions and lots of pillows for lumbar support were crucial; upholstery patterns used similar shades for interest, but low contrast.\n\nDennis Witte\u2019s wife, Debbie, helped choose accessories that gave the models a vibrant but affordable feel, from stores that prospective tenants would find familiar: Pier 1, West Elm, even Target.\n\nEach unit\u2019s exterior doorway has its own package shelf, so that residents have a place to set a handbag, briefcase or bundle of mail while they fish out a key. And a light, so they can also see to find it. It\u2019s a particularly empathetic touch.\n\nAfter all, said Dennis Witte, 62: \u201cI\u2019m part of the group we\u2019re marketing to. We want to stay active. We\u2019re very willing to swim against the tides of time.\u201d\n\nSusan Clotfelter: 303-954-1078; sclotfelter@denverpost.com. Twitter: @susandigsin\n\nConvenience and safety\n\nSome of the details at Bella Vita that homeowners can look for in age-in-place design:\n\n\u2022 In the kitchens, the oven/ranges have knobs on the front panel \u2014 no reaching across hot burners or steaming soup. Microwaves are convection equipped so that residents who don\u2019t want to fire up an oven can still bake a batch of muffins or a loaf of bread.\n\n\u2022 Sinks are single-basin, because in double sinks, the bottoms are often sloped, not flat, creating breakage hazards for dishes. Cabinets have easy-glide drawers and wide handles that can be grasped with a single finger.\n\n\u2022 The Moen faucets can be turned on and off with levers that don\u2019t need to be gripped (a feature every cook who\u2019s ever chopped up a raw chicken breast could appreciate). The same faucet was used for bathroom sinks and showers.\n\n\u2022 Flooring choices included non-slip tile, laminate over wood (softer underfoot and more forgiving of falls) or low-pile carpet, with low-profile thresholds and flooring transitions so that scooters, walkers and wheelchairs can keep rolling. Carpet pads are dense, but thin so that carpet and padding don\u2019t bunch up, creating yet another hazard.\n\n\u2022 The apartments don\u2019t have what are known as comfort-height toilets \u2014 nor are the toilets standard height. Instead, they\u2019re a midrise. \u201cWith the higher seat,\u201d said Moraine Byrne of the building\u2019s manager, Covenant Retirement Services, \u201cwomen with shorter legs, their legs can fall asleep and it\u2019s a fall hazard.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Doors and pathways are all 36 inches wide; door handles are all levers, not knobs.\n\n\u2022 Wi-Fi everywhere. \u201cAlmost no one is asking for a land line anymore,\u201d Byrne said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Designing age-in-place apartments meant focusing on the big picture", "title": "Designing age-in-place apartments meant focusing on the big picture", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/13/designing-age-in-place-apartments-meant-focusing-on-the-big-picture/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__20130914_C1_FE14AHAGINGp1.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__20130914_C1_FE14AHAGINGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-13T16:13:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:56:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Bhushan (and Studio K2 Architects, the architect of record on the building) paid a huge amount of attention to lighting.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll tell you what they want, and you\u2019ll provide it, or they\u2019ll go elsewhere,\u201d Bhushan said.\n\u2022 The apartments don\u2019t have what are known as comfort-height toilets \u2014 nor are the toilets standard height.\nIn one of the smaller apartments\u2019 bathrooms, there are two can lights plus a four-light fixture over the mirror.\nIt had location, adjacent to residential housing and retail, but set a few blocks back from busy Havana Street."}
