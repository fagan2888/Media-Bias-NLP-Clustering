Eek declined to comment on the price.\n\nTuckus said the LNG price agreed with Statoil would not be fixed but would \"reflect the trends in the global gas market\".\n\nLitgas was also planning to sign master trade agreements with multiple LNG suppliers to buy LNG cargoes on the spot market, he added.\n\nStatoil's Snoehvit LNG facility, Europe's only liquefaction plant, processed about 4 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas in 2013, while Lithuania's total gas consumption amounted to 2.7 bcm last year. Snoehvit mainly delivers LNG to Europe and Asia.\n\nNorway's Hoegh LNG earlier agreed to lease a floating LNG import terminal to Lithuania.
