HOLLYWOOD — God bless America, and how’s everybody?

Highmark Health Insurers sued the U.S. for the $200 million the U.S. owes them for Obamacare reimbursements. The insurers are facing the same extra expenses as the patients. Obamacare is just like one of those hospital gowns that ties in the back, you just think you’re covered.

The GOP on Tuesday formed a political action committee called Amish PAC to convince 60,000 Amish voters in Pennsylvania and Ohio to vote for Donald Trump. Presentation is everything to the Amish. Don’t miss Donald Trump entering Lancaster in a horse drawn Boeing 747.

Donald Trump said in an interview Tuesday as president he’d have no problem speaking with North Korea’s brutal dictator Kim Jung Un. This could really work out for U.S. interests. If there’s one thing Kim Jung Un is sure to respect, it’s the one man in the world with crazier hair than he has.

The British Museum curators said they discovered an original copy of America’s Declaration of Independence in their basement vault in London. It got nice laugh. Parents always save the notes that their children write to them, especially the ones that say they’re running away from home.

Donald Trump met with Henry Kissinger Tuesday for a foreign policy tutorial from Nixon’s legendary diplomat. As a young Harvard professor in 1957, Kissinger wrote a book on how America could survive a nuclear war with the Russians that was so scary that Hollywood’s Stanley Kubrick made Kissinger the role model for Dr. Strangelove. Six Flags never had a ride as wild as the Cold War.
