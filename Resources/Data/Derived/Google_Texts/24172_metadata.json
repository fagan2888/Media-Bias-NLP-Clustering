Pornhub Insights\n\nA person's porn history can tell us a lot about society\u2019s beauty standards, according to Pornhub and Mic.com.\n\nThe two sites argue that 2015 has been \u201ca major year for body positivity,\u201d from the love people have shown for plus-size models, like Tess Holliday and Denise Bidot, to the more than 9,000 posts tagged to #effyourbeautystandards \u2014 and that\u2019s just on Instagram. It's not so clear, however, if this shift has made its way to porn. So Pornhub analyzed its users' data to see if there were any changes in trends.\n\nThe results showed that \u201cbig beautiful women\u201d (BBW) searches have increased by 10 percent in the United States since May 2013. Across the globe, BBW searches have increased by 47 percent, with an even higher increase among sub-continents of Africa and Asia. While BBW searches tend to occur less in Asia, in Japan, these searches have increased 162 percent over the course of the last year.\n\nNot only do users seem to be searching more for \u201ccurvy ladies,\u201d but they\u2019re also searching for older women: \u201cMILF\u201d and \u201cmature\u201d ranked higher among the top 20 search terms. These two factors, curves and age, are the opposite of what we've known society to prefer, which in the U.S. is thin, young women. A recent study suggested that this may be out of our (men's) control: From an evolutionary perspective, thinness signals better health, youth, and fertility.\n\n\u201cLike it or not, porn is a part of the dialogue that informs society\u2019s notions of beauty and ideal body type,\u201d Pornhub said.\n\nYou can check out the infographics below for a greater breakdown of the site's data.\n\nPornhub search terms across the globe.
