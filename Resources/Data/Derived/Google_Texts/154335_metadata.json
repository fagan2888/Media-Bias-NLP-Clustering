To many, the four-legged cast member was a necessary part of the Griffin family, and a replacement dog \u2014 even one voiced by \u201cThe Sopranos\u2019 \u201d Tony Sirico \u2014 just isn\u2019t going to cut it.\n\n\u201cThe writers of family guy didn\u2019t just kill off one of their creations, they killed off the dog who has lived in our homes for the last 15 years,\u201d reads the online petition. \u201cThey killed the dog we all have come to love. They killed America\u2019s dog!\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the petition had already amassed 35,000 signatures and counting. \u201cBrian Griffin was an important part of our viewing experience,\u201d the petition says. \u201d \u2018Family Guy\u2019 and Fox Broadcasting will lose viewers if Brian Griffin is not brought back to the show.\u201d\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s episode, titled \u201cLife of Brian,\u201d the dog\u2019s demise seemed pretty permanent. Brian was hit by a car attempting to play with his constant companion, baby Stewie, and the devious tot couldn\u2019t use his time machine to solve the heartbreaking problem.\n\nIf Brian were to return, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time a TV show has resurrected a character, but Fox did already air a farewell to the smart and snarky pet.\n\nInterestingly, MacFarlane has yet to comment publicly on Brian\u2019s death, although a few creatives who\u2019ve been involved with the series have spoken up. \u201cWilfred\u201d executive producer David Zuckerman tweeted Monday that although he\u2019s no longer involved with \u201cFamily Guy\u201d and knows \u201cthe show\u2019s in good hands,\u201d he still hopes \u201cBrian isn\u2019t really dead.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, TV critic and author Alan Sepinwall believes \u201cBrian will stay dead just like Superman did,\u201d as does the New York Times\u2019 Dave Itzkoff, who speculated on Monday, \u201cEveryone will cover Family Guy just as fervently when the \u2018dead character\u2019 comes back in a week or two, right?\u201d\n\nAdding to hopes that Brian isn\u2019t gone for good is a website called BriansAnnouncement.com, spotted by Deadline Hollywood and Variety. Along with a road sign welcoming visitors to the Griffin family\u2019s hometown of Quahog, Rhode Island, there\u2019s a countdown clock for a \u201cspecial announcement from Brian\u201d in 10 days.\n\nProducer Steve Callaghan didn\u2019t drop any hints about such a site while speaking with E! News after Sunday\u2019s episode, although he did explain that the idea to kill off Brian caught on in the writers\u2019 room and was seen as \u201ca fun way to shake things up.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur fans are smart enough and have been loyal to our show for long enough, to know that they can trust us,\u201d Callaghan told E!. \u201cWe always make choices that always work to the greatest benefit of the series.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CNN) -- \"Family Guy\" fans are not letting Brian Griffin go gently into the night.
