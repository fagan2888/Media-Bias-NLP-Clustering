All rights reserved. To generations of medical students, from mine to the present, the name Frank Netter has a magical connotation. He was the doctor who drew the remarkably lifelike images that we all used to learn anatomy. They were so lifelike, we joked, that we trusted them more than what we actually saw in our cadavers or on CAT scans. Who was Frank Netter and how did he come to be the world\u2019s most famous medical illustrator? Fortunately, his daughter Francine has written a forthcoming biography of her father, entitled Medicine's Michaelangelo. As we learn, if Netter\u2019s mother had had her way, Netter would have retired his paintbrush in favor of a stethoscope. It is because he did not, though, that we have timeless illustrations like this. Copyright Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Netter was born in Manhattan in 1906 and showed aptitude for art at an early age. During high school, he studied at the prestigious National Academy of Design, where he drew nude figures. At New York\u2019s City College, Netter drew portraits and cartoons for the school\u2019s yearbook and spent the summers as an artist and set designer at a hotel in the Catskills.\n\nBut despite his remarkable talent, he had promised his mother he would go to medical school and, in 1927, he enrolled at New York University Medical College. While his fellow classmates spent their spare time studying for examinations, Netter drew haunting images of Bellevue Hospital, where he would eventually complete his internship and, in a harbinger of things to come, a picture entitled \u201cHealing Hands,\u201d in which a doctor applied a bandage to a patient\u2019s fingers. \u201cI do not know of anybody in the past several hundred years who has done anything like this.\u201d Netter did practice medicine briefly but, as Francine writes, \u201cthe demand for Frank\u2019s sable brush grew faster than the demand for his scalpel.\u201d His portraits, drawings of body parts and, at the behest of pharmaceutical companies, images of new drugs and how they worked were simply too vivid and unique to ignore. In 1934, Netter saw his last patient. It would be Netter\u2019s relationship with drug manufacturers that propelled forth his career as a medical artist. In 1937, the Ciba Company asked him to prepare an illustrated flyer for its version of digitalis, a heart drug. A remarkably long marriage was born. Over the next five decades, Netter worked with the company, later known as Ciba-Geigy, to produce the Ciba Collection of Medical Illustrations and the Clinical Symposia, beautifully illustrated books that depicted both normal anatomy as well as the pathology associated with specific diseases. The over 4,000 illustrations made by Netter during his career also depicted patients (drawn from models) suffering from conditions like bronchial asthma, angina and major depression. One picture showed a patient with end-stage liver disease on water restriction desperately drinking from a toilet. When Netter required surgery for an aortic aneurysm near the end of his life, he used the occasion to make diagrams of the operation he needed. Netter\u2019s work was voluminous, covering a vast array of topics and diseases. Ciba distributed his illustrations far and wide to medical students and physicians\u2014usually for free\u2014as a marketing tool.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new biography tells the story of one of the most influential doctors of the past century, and his evolution as an artist.", "author": "Barron H.
