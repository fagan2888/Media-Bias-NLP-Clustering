He is Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, Pathology, and Decision Science; and former Chief of Cardiology (Pediatric). Dr. Deane serves on the Board of Directors of the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange (NMHIX). Opinions offered here are Dr. Deane's alone, and do not necessarily reflect those of the NMHIX Board.\n\nMetro District of Columbia is saddled with an Emergency Medical Service that is \u201cplagued by\u2026continuous, unnecessary loss of life.\u201d To fix this problem, the District hired someone from outside to reform the department.\n\nAfter seven months at her new job, Juliet Saussy quit and released her four-page resignation letter on Scribd.com. Whether you live within the Beltway, in Boise, Idaho, or Bend, Oregon, you should be worried, very worried.\n\nWhat Saussy wrote about D.C. EMS is equally true in your area. Indeed, what she described is what ails all of American healthcare.\n\nYou really should read her letter in its entirety, as my isolated quotes cannot do Ms. Saussy justice.\n\nWhat\u2019s Wrong With EMS Is Worse In Healthcare\n\n\u201c\u2026 highly toxic [culture] to the delivery of any semblance of quality pre-hospital patient care.\u201d\n\nEvery hospital has a sign at the front door that the \u201cPatient Comes First.\u201d Every politician shouts what he or she is doing to healthcare is for your own good.\n\nYet, we know that the first priority for the hospital is the budget, not the patient. It is the same for the politician, as money is the way they get elected and re-elected. The culture of both healthcare in general and the Beltway in specific is highly perverse. The culture rewards the very results we don\u2019t want.\n\n\u201c\u2026 refuses to measure true performance \u2026 You cannot improve that which you do not measure.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to healthcare, all we seem to talk about is money: cost, over-spending, and income redistribution.\n\nSaving money is not the purpose of healthcare \u2014 the health of people is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for every healthcare system in the world. That is not to say money is unimportant. But it is distant second to your welfare and mine.\n\nWhere Is the VALUE in Healthcare?\n\nSo why do we measure money expended and never determine the value we get for those expenditures? Where are the measurements of better mobility after hip replacement, of extended lifespan after heart surgery, and net cost of Sovaldi? How can you improve health outcomes if, as Saussy queried, healthcare doesn\u2019t measure our individual health benefits from care?\n\n\u201c\u2026 the lines of authority are not reflective of the work done.\u201d\n\nWho determines what care you get and when you get it? You? You know better. Your doctor? Both you and she know better.\n\nYour medical decision maker is some insurance agent, following rules set up by a Washington bureaucrat, who is implementing policy established by Congress. That is who determines your medical care. That is how the budget, not your good health, determines what medical care you get, or don\u2019t get, or don\u2019t get in time.\n\nThat is how \u201c307,000 Americans may have died waiting for approved medical care.\u201d Neither the veteran\u2019s wellbeing nor the doctor\u2019s recommendations determined the care provided. A set of federal rules, guidelines, and budget allocations did.\n\nWashington Policy IS Medical Practice\n\n\u201cI have been told I am here for \u2018medicine\u2019 and not policy or operational input. EMS is not an area of medicine where policy can be separated from practice.\u201d\n\nWe all know, and our politicians constantly reiterate, that only a doctor can practice medicine; only a nurse can practice nursing. Every doctor and nurse in our country knows they are speaking hogwash. Washington\u2019s policy choices are our only practice options.\n\nWhen some federal bureau\u2014such as Obamacare\u2019s Independent Payment Advisory Board\u2014declares what is Cost Effective and what is not, they are practicing medicine. By authorizing or not authorizing payment, they make medical treatments available or not available for use by the professionals. This decides the care you get or do not get.\n\nFor example, a Washington policy decision that kidney dialysis over age 55 years is Not Cost Effective, as the British National Health Service has done, \u201cpractices medicine\u201d on all older individuals in kidney failure\u2014it says they die.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what the patient wants, what the doctor recommends, or what is medically possible, federal government policy determines the care you get. What Ms. Saussy said about D.C. EMS is just as true everywhere else. Their policy is your doctor\u2019s medical practice, and that is not good for your health.\n\nDr. Deane Waldman MD MBA is author of just released \u201cThe Cancer in the American Healthcare System;\u201d Host of www.wecanfixhealthcare.info; Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, Pathology and Decision Science; and Adjunct Scholar (Healthcare) for the Rio Grande Foundation, a public policy think tank.
