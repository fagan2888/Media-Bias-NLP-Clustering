Since that time we\u2019ve seen the CIA\u2019s own inspector general describe how CIA exceeded the limits set by the Department of Justice and the CIA. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse laid out the U.S. court precedent \u2014 ignored by John Yoo when he rubber-stamped CIA\u2019s torture while at the Department of Justice \u2014 that concluded waterboarding is torture. Gitmo\u2019s own convening authority, Susan Crawford, admitted in 2009 we tortured Mohammed al-Qahtani at the prison. A top British court called our treatment of detainee Binyam Mohammed \u201cat the very least cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment,\u201d making it a violation of the Convention Against Torture. The European Union Court of Human Rights declared Poland complicit in our torture of Abu Zubaydah and Abd al Rahim al-Nashiri. And we\u2019ve seen Republicans \u2014 both those voting for and against the declassification of the torture report \u2014 calling CIA\u2019s torture \u201ctorture.\u201d\n\nIt is no longer controversial. Many independent and even interested parties have deemed the CIA\u2019s torture torture.\n\nAnd yet journalists (Hosenball is by no means the only one) still use the Bush administration\u2019s euphemism, \u201cenhanced interrogation,\u201d as if using the language of propaganda somehow marks them as objective reporters. They still introduce torture by insinuating that only human rights advocates or CIA (or Bush) critics would consider all this torture. They still wield scare quotes to separate such nasty issues from their own journalistic voice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans tortured. We've seen pictures. Reports prove it.
