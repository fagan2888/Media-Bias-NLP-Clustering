Almost all of us who are 50-plus share one important desire: We want to be able to live independently, in our own homes and communities, as long as we possibly can — and we don't want to be a burden to our families.

We also share a fear that some awful thing we can't control — a bad fall, a chronic illness — will force us into institutionalized care.

Technology can be our friend here. New health technology can help many of us live at home for as long as we choose. Some of this is in the works, and some is on the market. All of it is thrilling.
