More on this Sanitation Creations UNC student's waterless porta-potty could help developing countries Find News Near Me



— Porta-potties can be pretty gross.

But where some see a problem, Liz Morris sees a solution.

Liz Morris, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has developed a portable toilet that doesn’t require water.

“I was doodling toilets on my thesis instead of writing my thesis and realized that I actually had an idea that could be something,” she said.

Morris formed a venture called Sanitation Creations to market the Dungaroo. It works with a foot pedal flush. Just press, and the waste goes away.

With each “flush,” the Dungaroo spreads antimicrobial pellets over the waste, rendering it odorless and killing germs without using water or harsh chemicals.

The waste is sealed in a bag.

“It all goes into a larger plastic bag with a drawstring, so that's all you're touching,” Morris said. “You’d just tie it up and throw it away.”

Morris is marketing it to the RV and boat industry, and she hope the Dungaroo will eventually replace traditional porta-potties.

In developing countries such as Haiti, where sanitation is a public health crisis, the Dungaroo could save lives, Morris said.

While Morris is trying to get the Dungaroo to market, she’s keeping her sense of humor in a business that seems to bring out the 5-year-old in everyone.

“My nephew calls me a 'poopologist.’ I go with it,” she said with a laugh.
