In 2013, 11.3 percent of workers were union members.\n\nTotal union membership grew in 2014 to 14,577,000, but the increase of 49,000 union members was not enough to match the nation\u2019s overall job creation rate.\n\nUnion bosses\u2019 role in private industry in the United States has been declining for years, a trend union coalition AFL-CIO and its political allies hope to turn around with help from President Obama\u2019s appointees on the National Labor Relations Board and from Thomas Perez, head of Obama\u2019s staunchly pro-union Department of Labor.\n\n\u201cIn 1983, the first year for which comparable union data are available, the union membership rate was 20.1 percent, and there were 17.7 million union workers,\u201d BLS noted Friday.\n\nAccording to BLS, public-sector workers had a union membership rate \u201cmore than five times higher than that of private-sector workers\u201d in 2014. Less than 7 percent of America\u2019s private-sector workers and more than 35 percent of government workers were members of unions.\n\nAlmost half of America\u2019s union members are public-sector workers whose unions exist for the express purpose of increasing the cost of government. Millions of government workers belong to National Education Association, Service Employees International Union, American Federation of Teachers or American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the four largest unions in the country.\n\nEven with government unions large and growing, the rate of union membership in America has continued its decline.\n\n\u201cThe anemic growth of union membership shows organized labor needs to change its business model to expand and thrive in the 21st century workforce,\u201d F. Vincent Vernuccio, director of labor policy at the free-market Mackinac Center for Public Policy, told Watchdog.org via email.\n\n\u201cWorkers deserve modern unions which serve them as individuals and not as parts of a once size fits all contract,\u201d Vernuccio continued. \u201cUnions need to be more responsive and put the individual worker at the center of the labor movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey must become more like modern and voluntary professional associations, rather than the industrial-era unions of old,\u201d he added, noting his research on the issue is detailed in Mackinac\u2019s recent Unionization for the 21st Century study.\n\nMichigan, which in 2012 passed right-to-work legislation supported by Mackinac, was one of several states where union membership dropped considerably in 2014. Right-to-work laws give workers the freedom to opt out of union membership without being forced to pay union \u201cfair share\u201d fees.\n\n\u201cFor many workers in Michigan 2014 was the first time they had the choice to not support a union and still keep their job,\u201d Vernuccio told Watchdog.org. \u201cRight-to-work was likely one of several factors that lead to unions losing 48,000 members in the Wolverine state.\u201d\n\nHe noted, however, that Indiana added 50,000 new union members, despite being a right-to-work state.\n\n\u201cThis shows that union membership can grow in right-to-work states but those unions cannot take their members for granted as they can do in forced unionism states,\u201d Vernuccio said.\n\nAlthough union membership rates remained highest in forced-unionization states where unions can take mandatory dues, union membership grew in more than half of all right-to-work states in 2014.\n\nCompared to 2013, union membership increased in 13 of 24 right-to-work states and 12 of 26 forced-unionism states. Union membership declined in nine right-to-work states and 12 forced-unionism states.\n\nUnions lost 48,000 members in Michigan and 41,000 in North Carolina, both right-to-work states \u2014 but unions also lost 55,000 members in Washington, which is a forced-unionism state.\n\nIn addition to gaining 50,000 members in right-to-work Indiana, unions gained 50,000 members in forced-unionism Colorado, 42,000 in forced-unionism California, and 41,000 in right-to-work Florida.\n\nThe most heavily unionized states in 2014 were New York at 24.6 percent union membership among all workers, Alaska at 22.8 percent and Hawaii at 21.8 percent. The 10 states with the highest union membership rates were all forced-unionization states.\n\nNorth Carolina had the lowest rate of union membership at 1.9 percent, followed by South Carolina at 2.2 percent and Mississippi and Utah, both at 3.7 percent. The 15 states with the lowest union membership rates were all right-to-work states.\n\nUnion membership figures reported by BLS for 2014 for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia are listed below.
