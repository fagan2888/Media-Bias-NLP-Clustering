In June, HHS awarded $300 million in grant funding to health centers to expand care for 1.25 million new patients. In July, the agency awarded $100 million that it estimated would help to support up to 150 new health center sites mostly in medically underserved areas.\u201cHealth centers are a key part of how the Affordable Care Act is working to improve access to care for millions of Americans,\u201d Burwell said in a statement.Indeed, health centers say that the influx of new patients newly covered under the healthcare reform law has put them in desperate need of more resources to handle the volume.\u201cIt could not come at a more important, opportune and critical time,\u201d said Daniel Hawkins, vice president of federal, state and public affairs for the National Association of Community Health Centers. \u201cEvery health center I talk to around the country is bursting at the seams with new folks coming in to see them in states where they've expanded coverage like in California and New York.\u201dThe grant awards are part of $3.7 billion in total appropriations Congress allocated to health centers in January, representing a $700 million increase over last year. Aside from a onetime increase of $2 billion in 2009 as a result of the stimulus law, health center funding had increased very little since 2003. That changed in 2011, when the program got a large annual boost with the implementation of the Community Health Care Fund under the Affordable Care Act, which has provided $11 billion in additional funding from 2011 to 2014 for expanding community health center services to accommodate the millions who gained health coverage as a result of the health insurance marketplaces and the expansion of Medicaid.There are nearly 1,300 community health centers across the country, and they operate more than 9,000 delivery sites that provide care for more than 21 million patients. According to figures from the National Association of Community Health Centers, about 76% of patients who visit a community health center are uninsured or covered through either Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. Overall, almost three-quarters of all health center patients are low-income, earning up to 100% of the federal poverty level.Hawkins said he hoped health centers would use the grant funding toward increasing their hours of operations in order to better serve their patient populations.\u201cHealthcare is the last place in America that still operates on bankers' hours,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to operate healthcare with hours that are available, accessible and convenient to people.\u201dBut the funding that made the current round of grants possible\u2014and accounts for up to 70% of a health center's total federal grant allocation\u2014is set to expire next September. Hawkins is concerned that many of the gains that have been made toward expanding access to primary care might be in jeopardy if lawmakers fail to fund health centers at a level that enables them to sustain the increases in demand seen.Hawkins said many health centers would be forced to reduce their scope of services or raise their sliding-scale charges, which would create barriers to access, with the biggest impact occurring in states that have not expanded Medicaid to adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level.\u201cThe reality is that there are few health centers in America that could continue their operation at current levels if that grant funding was cut,\u201d Hawkins said.Follow Steven Ross Johnson on Twitter: @MHsjohnson", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Community health centers across the country are slated to receive $295 million in federal funding in an effort to expand access to primary-care services to more than a million new patients.", "title": "Feds mark $295M for community health centers", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Community health centers across the country are slated to receive $295 million in federal funding in an effort to expand access to primary-care services to more than a million new patients.", "title": "Health centers to get $295M cash boost to expand primary-care services", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140912/NEWS/309129960", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Community health centers across the country are slated to receive $295 million in federal funding in an effort to expand access to primary-care services to more than a million new patients.", "title": "Health centers to get $295M cash boost to expand primary-care services", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140912/NEWS/309129960", "published_at": "2014-09-12", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc455\"", "article_summary": "In June, HHS awarded $300 million in grant funding to health centers to expand care for 1.25 million new patients.\nAside from a onetime increase of $2 billion in 2009 as a result of the stimulus law, health center funding had increased very little since 2003.\nAccording to figures from the National Association of Community Health Centers, about 76% of patients who visit a community health center are uninsured or covered through either Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program.\nThe funding marks the last big round of grant awards this fiscal year under a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act .\n\u201cWe need to operate healthcare with hours that are available, accessible and convenient to people.\u201dBut the funding that made the current round of grants possible\u2014and accounts for up to 70% of a health center's total federal grant allocation\u2014is set to expire next September."}
