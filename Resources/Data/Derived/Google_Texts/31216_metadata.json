Whether you agree with our recommendations or not, please vote.\n\nProposition 1\n\nVote yes for this constitutional amendment that will put half the revenue collected by the Texas Rainy Day Fund into the highway fund.\n\nU.S. Senator\n\nJohn Cornyn, the Republican who is the minority whip in the Senate, has served Texas well and should be re-elected.\n\nHe has a common-sense, realistic and conservative approach to issues that seek smaller government, balancing the budget each year and a strong national defense and security.\n\nU.S. Representative\n\nRandy Neugebauer, who supports the conservative values shared by most West Texans.\n\nAmong them are opposing further increases to the national debt, supporting border security and concerns about harm to our health care system from Obamacare.\n\nTexas House District 83\n\nDustin Burrows would be the stronger representative for West Texas in the House in this election to replace Charles Perry.\n\nTexas House District 84\n\nWe recommend John Frullo to a third two-year term. He has effectively represented his district.\n\nGovernor\n\nWe share Attorney General Greg Abbott\u2019s concerns about federal overreach in the state and believe he would work to continue to boost the economy of Texas.\n\nLieutenant governor\n\nThe strong conservatism of Sen. Dan Patrick makes him the more likely candidate to keep the state government as small as possible, defend Texas from Washington encroachment and effectively protect Texas borders.\n\nAttorney general\n\nDemocrat Sam Houston would be the better attorney general for Texas. We think he\u2019ll put the needs of Texans first, defend the state when necessary in the courtroom and do an effective job of child support enforcement in Texas.\n\nComptroller of public accounts\n\nGlenn Hegar gets our endorsement. He plans to reduce waste and duplication and do a more efficient job of estimating revenue for Texas.\n\nLand commissioner\n\nThe depth of experience of George P. Bush as a veteran, lawyer, businessman and former teacher and administrator would serve him well in this office.\n\nAgriculture commissioner\n\nSid Miller, a conservative Republican legislator, is the better choice for this office.\n\nRailroad commissioner\n\nRyan Sitton wants to modernize the office\u2019s operations, establish a long-term energy strategy and prepare for downturns in the energy industry.\n\nChief justice, Supreme Court: Nathan Hecht.\n\nPlace 6, Supreme Court: Jeff Brown.\n\nPlace 7, Supreme Court: Gina Benavides.\n\nPlace 8, Supreme Court: Phil Johnson.\n\nPlace 3, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals: Bert Richardson.\n\nLubbock County judge: No endorsement", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Filed online, Editorials, A-J Editorial Board", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "After many months of focus on federal, state and local races, it's Election Day, and here are our recommendations, published before early voting began.
