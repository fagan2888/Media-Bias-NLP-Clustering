In all, there have been about 700 recall announcements \u2014 an average of two a day \u2014 affecting the equivalent of one in five vehicles on the road.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAlso, by the numbers, eight of the largest car makers recalled more cars this year than they have since 1966 when tracking began.\n\nSome in the industry claim this year is changing the very nature of the business.
