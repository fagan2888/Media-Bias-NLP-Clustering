If the idea of America is to live, it must be stopped,\u201d said Sasse.\n\nSasse is one of four Republicans in the race to succeed outgoing U.S. Sen. Mike Johanns. With friends and family on hand, he formally launched his campaign in Fremont, the eastern Nebraska town where he grew up and where he now presides as president of Midland University.\n\nLast week, Sasse stunned the political world when he announced that he had raised more than $800,000 in eight weeks. For any politician, $800,000 would have been impressive, but it was especially noteworthy since Sasse is a political newcomer making his first bid for public office.\n\nSo far, two of the three other Republican candidates in the race have not disclosed their third-quarter financial reports. Former State Treasurer Shane Osborn and Omaha trial attorney Bart McLeay have until Oct. 15 to file their reports with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe fourth candidate in the race, Omaha banker Sid Dinsdale, did not officially file for the race until last month and has until January to file his first report.\n\nSo far, no Democrat has entered the race.\n\nSasse made it clear Monday that health care and his opposition to President Obama's controversial health-care reform initiative will be a cornerstone of his campaign.\n\nSasse was a former top adviser in former President George W. Bush's Health and Human Services Department. After he left the federal government, he worked as a consultant, helping to advise companies on health-care laws.\n\nHe also toured the country, giving lectures in which he outlined his opposition to Obama's health-care initiative, arguing the country needs a more \u201cmarket-based\u201d approach to reforming its health-care system.\n\nSasse said the new law \u201cinsinuates\u201d government into every aspect of Americans' lives from \u201ccradle to grave.\u201d\n\nHe also said it would create a \u201cdependency culture\u201d in this country.\n\n\u201cThe dependency culture wants America to look less like America and more like Europe,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring the coming months, Sasse said, he will talk more about how he would like to reform America's health-care system.\n\n\u201cOver the course of this campaign, we plan to talk a great deal about patient-centered health policy solutions \u2014 for we want both to wreck Obamacare but then also to replace it with something actually workable,\u201d Sasse said.\n\n\u201cAnd we will talk about the emerging golden age of American energy, about rolling back the regulatory state, about an economic agenda of growth, about a prioritized foreign policy, and more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Sasse, 41, president of Midland University in Fremont, said that if he is elected to the U.S. Senate, his goal will be to repeal the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "If Obamacare survives, U.S. won't, Ben Sasse says as he officially launches Senate bid", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/if-obamacare-survives-u-s-won-t-ben-sasse-says/article_9bc7f5ad-a83c-5030-974a-4d3ba57efdbb.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/28/42834601-b565-5cff-a3c0-05519a96b402/5332e963953b7.image.jpg?resize=760%2C641", "height": 641}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Sasse, 41, president of Midland University in Fremont, said that if he is elected to the U.S. Senate, his goal will be to repeal the Affordable Care Act.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2f2\"", "article_summary": "Republican Ben Sasse says the fate of America hinges on the fate of President Obama's health-care initiative.\nIf the Affordable Care Act survives, America will cease to exist, said Sasse, as he officially launched his bid Monday for U.S. Senate.\nSasse, 41, said that if he is elected to the U.S. Senate, his goal will be to repeal the law.\nDuring the coming months, Sasse said, he will talk more about how he would like to reform America's health-care system.\nHe also toured the country, giving lectures in which he outlined his opposition to Obama's health-care initiative, arguing the country needs a more \u201cmarket-based\u201d approach to reforming its health-care system."}
