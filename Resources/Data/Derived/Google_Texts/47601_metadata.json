A team of geneticists and dermatologists set out to find a treatment for the balding disease known as alopecia areata and published their hopeful findings in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disease in which the body mistakenly attacks hair follicles and causes them to fall out. It affects one percent of the population, causing a person to lose hair from not only the head, but also the legs, arms, chest, back, and virtually anywhere hair may grow. Researchers from Columbia University Medical Center used a drug designed to treat bone marrow disorders because of its ability to block enzymes in the immune system from attacking the hair.\n\nSuccess came after the new class of medicines known as JAK inhibitors were tested on mice, and they continued on testing a small group of seven men and five women with alopecia areata. One of the study\u2019s participants, Brian H., who asked The New York Times that his last name be withheld for privacy reasons, began experiencing alopecia areata in his 20s and believes it marred his job and relationship success. Everything changed after numerous failed treatments and he enrolled into the study.\n\n\u201cPretty quickly, there were sort of fringes,\u201d Brian said. Then \u201cthree or four large areas started to show hair growth,\u201d and by five months, he had hair on his head, arms, and even his back. \u201cI was blown away.\u201d He is one of the lucky ones, for not all of the participants experienced his level of success, and it is too early to announce a cure for the disease, which currently has none.\n\n\u201cIt appears to work \u2014 not in everyone, but in the majority,\u201d the study\u2019s co-author Dr. Julian Mackay-Wiggan, who serves as the director of Columbia\u2019s dermatology clinical research unit, told The Times. \u201cWe need a lot more data on the long-term risks in healthy individuals. But it\u2019s certainly very exciting in terms of hair growth. It was surprising how quickly and impressively the growth occurred.\u201d\n\nCurrently, corticosteroids in the form of injections or topical medications are being used to treat patches of baldness caused by alopecia areata because of the steroid\u2019s ability to suppress the immune system, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. However, injections are painful and the topical treatment doesn\u2019t work as well but is often used on children to avoid the pain of the shots. There is a \u201cmajor need for improving the treatment,\u201d according to Dr. Luis Garza, a dermatologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital who was not involved in the research.\n\nThe Columbia University team also plans to have participants undergo another trial test with a different JAK inhibitor called tofacitinib, which is approved for rheumatoid arthritis and has already successfully grown hair on mice. In June, Yale researchers published a study on their two-month experiments with tofacitinib, which improved hair loss and plaque psoriasis, a skin condition that causes red, scaly, and irritated areas of skin. Researchers believe the remarkable hair growth is a result of the drug's ability to turn off the immune system\u2019s attack on hair follicles.\n\n\u201cThe results are exactly what we hoped for,\u201d Dr. Brett A. King, assistant professor of dermatology at Yale University School of Medicine, said in a press release. \u201cThis case highlights the interplay between advances in science and the treatment of disease and it provides a compelling example of the ways in which an increasingly complex understanding of medicine, combined with ingenuity in treatment, benefits patients.\u201d\n\nSource: Christiano AM, Clynes R, Xing L, Dai Z, Jabbari A, Cerise JE, and et al.
