Tonight marks the sixth anniversary of U.S. Sen. Barack Obama accepting the Democratic nomination for president in front of 80,000 people at Mile High stadium in Denver.

It was a historic evening: Obama was the first African-American to ever be nominated for president by a major party.

Six years later, a divided country is split on President Obama, whose approval ratings remain the low 40s.

Just days after Obama’s speech, the Republican vice presidential nominee took a dig at the setting.

“But when the cloud of rhetoric has passed, when the roar of the crowd fades away, when the stadium lights go out and those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot, when that happens, what exactly is our opponent’s plan?” asked Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.

Obama accepts nomination, rocks Mile High By Kevin Vaughan

The Rocky Mountain News Thursday night, on a date symbolic of both the worst and the best of recent life for African-Americans, a black man stood in a football stadium in Denver and made history, accepting the Democratic Party’s nomination for president. Barack Obama’s moment came exactly 53 years after two Mississippi men murdered a black teenager for whistling at a white girl, and exactly 45 years after Martin Luther King Jr. dared to dream of a world where people would “not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” It came with two of King’s children inside Invesco Field at Mile High, and with brown and black faces in every section of the stands. But the night wasn’t just about the past. It was also about pomp and politics and Obama’s call for change.
