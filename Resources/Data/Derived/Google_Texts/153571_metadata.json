That\u2019s what I was able to do,\u201d said Rusin, who became the 19th pitcher in Rockies history to throw a shutout, and the 13th to do it in Denver. \u201cI was able to get weak contact. I just knew I had good location and was able to hit my spots. I just did that the entire game.\u201d\n\nThe victory ended the Rockies\u2019 six-game losing streak \u2014 and snapped a seven-game losing streak against the Padres.\n\nThe nine innings pitched were a career high for Rusin, whom the Rockies claimed off waivers from the Chicago Cubs last season. He induced 13 outs by groundballs, struck out four and needed only 106 pitches (71 for strikes) to blank the Padres. For good measure, he singled and scored a run in the eighth.\n\n\u201cIf you keep the ball down, pitch to both sides of the plate and change speeds, you can pitch here,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cIt can be done here. We\u2019ve seen it enough before. Rusin is a heck of a competitor, and he\u2019s unflappable. That was an impressive performance.\u201d\n\nRusin \u2014 3-1 with a 3.31 ERA in eight games (seven starts) at Coors Field this season \u2014 has become a different pitcher. He has added a quick-pitch windup to his arsenal, something Weiss calls a \u201croll-through windup.\u201d Catcher Michael McKenry calls it a \u201cCueto,\u201d after Kansas City Royals ace Johnny Cueto, whose drives batters mad by constantly altering his delivery.\n\n\u201cRusin pounded the zone today,\u201d McKenry said. \u201cHe messed with hitters\u2019 timing. He was speeding up his motion and slowing it down.\u201d\n\nRusin typically throws more two-seam sinking fastballs than four-seamers, but he switched that up Sunday.\n\n\u201cA lot of his pitches were just in, tight,\u201d McKenry explained. \u201cHe has a lot of life with that four-seamer. It\u2019s 92 mph, and it sort of sneaks up on (hitters) because he has such a quick arm.\u201d\n\nRusin walked a tightrope in the sixth. Two-out singles by Derek Norris and Matt Kemp and a walk by Justin Upton loaded the bases. Rusin was then called for a balk by second-base umpire Lance Barrett, sending Norris to the plate for a run. But the umpires conferred and waved off the balk, much to the consternation of San Diego manager Pat Murphy.\n\n\u201cIt looked funky because Chris is using that roll-through windup,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut he was pitching out of the windup. \u2026 He wasn\u2019t pitching from the stretch, so he doesn\u2019t have to come to a complete stop. I think that\u2019s what the confusion was.\u201d\n\nAfter all the fuss, Murphy was ejected, and Rusin got Jedd Gyorko to ground out to third as the Rockies\u2019 1-0 lead held.\n\nThe Rockies finally shattered the pitchers\u2019 duel with a three-run seventh inning against San Diego starter Ian Kennedy. The rally was propelled by McKenry\u2019s three-run double.\n\nColorado\u2019s outburst began with a whimper. Nolan Arenado hit a two-out popup to Norris at first base. He simply dropped the ball and opened the flood gates. Ben Paulsen followed up with a double, and Kennedy intentionally walked DJ LeMahieu to load the bases.\n\nMcKenry stepped up and lashed a double into the gap in right-center. LeMahieu slid in safely at the plate, just beating catcher Austin Hedges\u2019 tag. The Padres asked for a review \u2014 one that took 3 minutes, 27 seconds \u2014 but the call stood.\n\nCarlos Gonzalez broke a scoreless tie with a solo blast to dead center with two out in the fifth. CarGo teed off on Kennedy\u2019s 1-0, 91 mph fastball for his 27th homer.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 Chris Rusin tosses shutout against San Diego Padres", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Chris Rusin tosses shutout against San Diego Padres", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/16/rockies-chris-rusin-tosses-shutout-against-san-diego-padres/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150816__chris-rusin-rockiesp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150816__chris-rusin-rockiesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-16T17:02:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T04:01:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Chris Rusin didn\u2019t need a 98 mph heater or a diabolical curveball to tame the San Diego Padres, or the savage beast that is Coors Field.\nBut the umpires conferred and waved off the balk, much to the consternation of San Diego manager Pat Murphy.\nThe Rockies finally shattered the pitchers\u2019 duel with a three-run seventh inning against San Diego starter Ian Kennedy.\n\u201cIt looked funky because Chris is using that roll-through windup,\u201d Weiss said.\nRather, the Rockies left-hander used a surgical 90 to 92 mph fastball, a confounding changeup and a versatile new delivery to pitch a five-hit, complete-game shutout against San Diego on Sunday."}
