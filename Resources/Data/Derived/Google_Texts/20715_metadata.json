I need a place to live!\u201d\n\nChristopher Mack, a lead community outreach worker for a health clinic in the heart of Los Angeles\u2019 Skid Row, squats next to her. He gently tells her to calm down, to breathe, to remember to see her case worker in the morning about housing. He also wants to know if she has health insurance.\n\nBut Scott, who will turn 61 soon and has lived on Skid Row for 18 months, is in no mood to hear sweet talk. She\u2019s bone thin. Her sweater is ripped and riddled with holes. Her clothes and important papers are squashed into various size bags all around her. Tears of frustration drip down her face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a racist,\u201d she tells Mack apologetically, \u201cBut I can\u2019t go to Mexico to get a house and you can\u2019t find me a place to live here.\u201d\n\nToday is not Scott\u2019s day, Mack determines. She is too angry. Despite the fact that she and many others will qualify for health insurance by the end of the year under requirements of the Affordable Care Act, finding a place to live, not health care, is Scott\u2019s priority. So Mack will try again another time.\n\nThe encounter demonstrates how difficult it can be to provide health coverage to some of the most destitute, even those who qualify for free or subsidized plans. Some of them say that simply trying to survive or find a roof over their heads takes precedence even over caring for their own health.\n\n\u201cOut here, it\u2019s about repeated education,\u201d said Mack, who has worked the streets of Skid Row 10 years for the JWCH Institute, which runs the Center for Community Health on downtown\u2019s 5th Street. \u201cIt\u2019s about what we in social work call multiple encounters. Where there\u2019s a willingness, there are no barriers.\u201d\n\nMack\u2019s work is part of what has been an aggressive, three-year outreach campaign by the Los Angeles Department of Health Services to enroll as many of the estimated 390,000 potentially eligible uninsured residents into Healthy Way LA, a no-cost county health insurance that will convert to Medi-Cal in January. Outreach workers from clinics countywide have gone to churches, schools, soup kitchens, homeless shelters and the streets of Skid Row in an effort to find those who qualify.\n\n\u201cThe goal is an ambitious one, but we think it is doable given the multitude of incredible partners, internal and external, that we are working with to make it happen,\u201d said Amy Luftig Viste, director of community partner programs for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the work and the program has had its challenges, she said.\n\n\u201cWe have had some difficulties along the way: adequate staff capacity to enroll patients, technological challenges, outreach challenges,\u201d Luftig Viste said, but much of that has been remedied by funding that has provided more staff.\n\n\u201cYes there have been challenges, but we\u2019re at 257,000 enrolled \u2014 approximately two-thirds of the state\u2019s total \u2014 so despite the challenges we are proud of our success,\u201d she said.\n\nOne challenge for DHS is the annual renewal of Healthy Way LA. Many of those who have the insurance didn\u2019t know they had to renew it, Luftig Viste said.\n\n\u201cMost recently we have created a redetermination mail-in unit, and are now even calling our patients to confirm that they received their renewal paperwork and if necessary to help them fill it out,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has improved our redetermination rate significantly, but there is still much work to do to ensure that covered members stay covered.\u201d\n\nOn Skid Row, for example, a complex knot of homelessness, mental illness and drug or alcohol use, along with a deep distrust of government, makes it difficult for Mack and other outreach workers to help people understand how starting in January, Medi-Cal will have expanded to cover all low-income individuals, ages 19 to 64, who are U.S. citizens or national or legal permanent residents for at least five years, and are not pregnant. Those who are pregnant qualify for another insurance.\n\n\u201cMost people come to the clinic already in crisis,\u201d Mack said.\n\nAnd there are other issues. Community clinics are working to expand as all the new patients are coming in. But there are not enough primary care physicians.\n\n\u201cThe patients in our system now are being seen, but I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s enough capacity for the new (patients),\u201d said Al Ballesteros, chief executive officer for the JWCH Institute.\n\n\u201cWe are seeking to bring in more primary care providers and looking at new sites,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely, all community centers are in expansion mode. Right now, we have several positions for physicians, but we\u2019re competing with large health care systems like Kaiser Permanente.\u201d\n\nAnd yet the goal is to make sure all of the newly insured find a medical home within these clinics to help relieve emergency departments. All too often those who suffer from chronic illnesses such as diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure need support to manage their medications.\n\nOn a recent morning, Mack and Juan Rivera, a patient enrollment and eligibility manager with JWCH, walked down crowded 5th Street, near the Midnight Mission. Their goal was to invite people into the clinic to enroll in Healthy Way LA. About 35 people a week are enrolled, Rivera said.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest comments I get is nothing is free,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cWe say this is free. It\u2019s based on your income and where you live.\u201d\n\nBut there are many obstacles for the homeless, including proof of citizenship and ID. Others simply don\u2019t know about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhen Mack tells Phillip Evans, an older man with a heart condition who uses a walker, that he qualifies for free health care, Evans places his hand to his chest and bends forward. Sharon Dike, a volunteer with AmeriCares who goes out to Skid Row to bring people to the JWCH Institute clinic, steadies him.\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Denise Scott shouts angrily over the way America has forgotten her.\u201cWe don\u2019t need no more illegals comin\u2019 over here!\u201d she screams from a Skid Row sidewalk littered with chicken bones, paper plates and discarded cloth", "title": "Affordable Care Act: Homeless, but not without care on Skid Row", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20130921/affordable-care-act-homeless-but-not-without-care-on-skid-row", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20130921/NEWS/130929896/AR/0/AR-130929896.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "998px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Affordable Care Act: Homeless, but not without care on Skid Row"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Denise Scott shouts angrily over the way America has forgotten her.\u201cWe don\u2019t need no more illegals comin\u2019 over here!\u201d she screams from a Skid Row sidewalk littered with chicken bones, paper plates and discarded cloth", "title": "Affordable Care Act: Homeless, but not without care on Skid Row", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20130921/affordable-care-act-homeless-but-not-without-care-on-skid-row", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20130921/NEWS/130929896/AR/0/AR-130929896.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca9bb\"", "article_summary": "Sharon Dike, a volunteer with AmeriCares who goes out to Skid Row to bring people to the JWCH Institute clinic, steadies him.\nBut Scott, who will turn 61 soon and has lived on Skid Row for 18 months, is in no mood to hear sweet talk.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need no more illegals comin\u2019 over here!\u201d she screams from a Skid Row sidewalk littered with chicken bones, paper plates and discarded clothes.\nOutreach workers from clinics countywide have gone to churches, schools, soup kitchens, homeless shelters and the streets of Skid Row in an effort to find those who qualify.\nI need a place to live!\u201dChristopher Mack, a lead community outreach worker for a health clinic in the heart of Los Angeles\u2019 Skid Row, squats next to her."}
