After the No. 3 Baylor Bears were upset by No. 14 Yale 79-75 in the NCAA Tournament on Thursday, Bears forward Taurean Prince was asked how the Bulldogs outrebounded his team during the post-game press conference.

His response was priceless.

Reporter: “How did Yale out rebound Baylor?”

Prince: “Well, you grab the ball off the rim when it comes off. And you grab with two hands and you come down with it and it’s considered a rebound. So they got more of those than we did.”
