We still get half our power by burning coal, a fuel that made sense in the time of Charles Dickens.\n\nFour years ago, a Michigan Environmental Council study found our nine oldest coal plants cost state residents about a billion and a half a year in increased health care costs.\n\nThey aren\u2019t good for people in neighboring states and Canada, either.\n\nNaturally, Bill Schuette is joining some other Republican attorneys general in suing the Obama Administration, claiming the President\u2019s Clean Power Plan is illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nSignificantly, spokespersons for the Snyder Administration yesterday said they had no interest in that. They are more interested in getting something meaningful done.\n\nNow, if all this elicits a sense of what Yogi Berra called \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again,\" it should. Two years ago, Michigan had the option of creating a state health care exchange, or directory, to comply with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGovernor Snyder tried to do that.\n\nBut it was killed by Republicans in the state House, who hated \u201cObamacare\u201d so much they refused to do anything to go along with it. So they killed the exchange, and a less good federal one was imposed on us instead, an act of spite which cost Michigan $40 million.\n\nYesterday, there were signs Republican legislators may have learned from the experience.\n\nAfter the ritual denunciation of the Clean Power Plan as an \u201cabuse of federal power,\u201d State Senator Mike Shirkey, R-Clark Lake, told the Gongwer News Service, \u201cI believe we need to come up with our own plan,\u201d to make the best of what he believes is state power \u201crun amok.\u201d\n\nWell, what do you know? Once in a while, people do learn from their mistakes.\n\nJack Lessenberry is Michigan Radio's political analyst.
