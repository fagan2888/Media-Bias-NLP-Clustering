Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican and ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nMr. Mayorkas has faced difficult questions in the past.\n\nDuring his recent confirmation hearing, he was asked about his role in a Clinton-era scandal in which politically connected former officials lobbied the White House for grants of clemency for Carlos Vignali, a convicted drug trafficker, among others.\n\nIn a 2002 report by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Mr. Mayorkas said he conveyed to the White House the pleas of Horacio Vignali, whose son had been convicted and sentenced to 15 years for drug trafficking.\n\n\u201cWhile Mayorkas does not recall the details of his conversation, he now concedes that his call [to The White House] conveyed support for the Vignali commutation,\u201d the committee concluded. \u201cMayorkas supported the Vignali commutation despite his ignorance of the facts of the case and his knowledge that the prosecutors responsible for the Vignali case opposed clemency.\u201d\n\nBut crucial details of the account \u2014 most notably whether he contacted the White House or officials reached out to him \u2014 appear to have shifted over time.\n\nIn 2009, when he was being confirmed as director of citizenship services agency, Mr. Mayorkas testified that \u201cit was a mistake\u201d to talk to the White House about the clemency request.\n\nAsked again about the subject during his most recent confirmation hearing, Mr. Mayorkas said the White House reached out to him and he told officials he did not support the commutation and that officials should defer to the prosecutor who handled the case.\n\nB. Todd Jones, then the U.S. attorney in Minnesota who prosecuted Vignali and is now director of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told committee investigators in 2002 that he emphasized to Mr. Mayorkas at the time that the younger Vignali was \u201cbad news,\u201d and that he should not \u201cgo there\u201d in supporting clemency.\n\nStaff at the homeland security committee said no votes or other actions were scheduled on Mr. Mayorkas\u2018 nomination, but in a statement emailed to The Washington Times, Sen. Thomas R. Carper, Delaware Democrat and committee chairman, said he was determined to press ahead with confirmation.\n\n\u201cEverything I have learned about Director Mayorkas \u2014 whether it was recommendations from his former colleagues, [or] my extensive reviews of his FBI files, has convinced me that he is highly qualified for the job,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The man in charge of a controversial immigrant visa program under FBI review has more to worry about than just a criminal investigation into his alleged attempts to influence a visa application on behalf of a political insider.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The man in charge of a controversial immigrant visa program under FBI review has more to worry about than just a criminal investigation into his alleged attempts to influence a visa application on behalf of a political insider.", "title": "Homeland security pick\u2019s remarks questioned", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/27/homeland-security-picks-remarks-questioned/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/27/10272013_mayorkas-28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/27/10272013_mayorkas-28201.jpg", "description": "The man in charge of a controversial immigrant visa program under FBI review has more to worry about than just a criminal investigation into his alleged attempts to influence a visa application on beh", "card": "summary", "title": "Homeland security pick\u2019s remarks questioned"}, "Author": "Jeffrey Anderson, Shaun Waterman and Jeffrey Anderson, Shaun Waterman", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Alejandro Mayorkas, Federal Bureau of Investigation, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e35\"", "article_summary": "President Obama earlier this year nominated Mr. Mayorkas to be deputy secretary of homeland security, but the nomination seems stalled amid a criminal investigation by the agency\u2019s inspector general and questions about the candor of his Senate testimony.\nMr. Mayorkas has faced difficult questions in the past.\n\u201cEverything I have learned about Director Mayorkas \u2014 whether it was recommendations from his former colleagues, [or] my extensive reviews of his FBI files, has convinced me that he is highly qualified for the job,\u201d he said.\nIn 2009, when he was being confirmed as director of citizenship services agency, Mr. Mayorkas testified that \u201cit was a mistake\u201d to talk to the White House about the clemency request.\nStaff at the homeland security committee said no votes or other actions were scheduled on Mr. Mayorkas\u2018 nomination, but in a statement emailed to The Washington Times, Sen.
