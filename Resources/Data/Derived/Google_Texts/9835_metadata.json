The two exchanged niceties amid laughter, with Stewart pointing out Obama has \u201cabout a year\u201d left in office and Obama responded by saying he is going to issue an executive order forbidding Stewart from leaving The Daily Show. (Stewart previously announced he is leaving the show in August.)\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAccording to Deadline, Stewart then began making observations and asking questions based on Obama\u2019s limited time in office.\n\nStewart said, \u201c\u201cYou don\u2019t have that much time to take away Americans\u2019 guns [and] declare martial law\u2026 if you\u2019re going to do that, you better get started.\u201d The audience chuckled and Stewart added, \u201cThere\u2019s an ebb and flow to every administration, to every president. It appears that you\u2019re feeling it right now.\u201d Stewart then suggested the \u201cdeal with Iran\u201d is proof.\n\nObama said, \u201cA lot of the work that [his administration] did early starts bearing fruit later and it just so happened over the last couple of months that seeing some of the work that we started way back when I first came in.\u201d He pointed to the Obamacare and the Iran deal as proof of this.\n\nAfter talking about the Supreme Court decision upholding Obamacare, President Obama said, \u201cSo, the way I\u2019m feeling right now is. I\u2019ve got 18 months and that are a bunch of other things we want to get done.\u201d He then listed climate change as one of those things.\n\nStewart then asked Obama to explain the Iran deal, if he would, and Obama said, \u201cThey\u2019re an adversary. They\u2019re anti-American, anti-Israel, they sponsor terrorist organizations like Hezbollah.\u201d But he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t make peace with your friends.\u201d\n\nObama added: \u201cWhen you hear critics talk about, \u2018Well it\u2019s a bad deal and we could have gotten a better deal,\u2019 you ask them, \u2018Well, what represents a better deal? What is it you think could happen?\u2019 Typically they\u2019re vague and they fall back on, \u2018Well, if you\u2019d beat your chest a little bit more or if you\u2019d brought Dick Cheney to the negotiations.\u201d\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
