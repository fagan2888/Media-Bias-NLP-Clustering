But it was hard to find agreement on whether to focus on that issue, state appropriations for higher education, for-profit colleges or issues such as health care policy as senators and higher education experts considered how federal and state governments could work together to reduce college costs.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions held the hearing as part of an ongoing effort to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, a law that governs federal student financial aid.\n\nAt the beginning of the hearing, Senator Lamar Alexander from Tennessee, the committee\u2019s ranking Republican, said states must lead the way on college affordability. Madigan, however, insisted that the federal government had a major part to play when it came to protecting and serving student-loan borrowers.\n\nFederal student loan servicing is \u201cextremely problematic and extremely confusing,\u201d she said. Borrowers are often unaware of federal loan repayment programs, and they have difficulty understanding which loan \u2013 and which repayment program \u2013 might suit them best.\n\nAnd companies that provide federal loans are failing to adequately advise student borrowers. Her office has received complaints from borrowers who say loan servicers are pressuring them to get their loans current rather than providing information about repayment options.\n\nThe complaints are reminiscent of problems her office saw during the mortgage and foreclosure crisis, she said, when homeowners struggled to make their mortgage payments.\n\nBecause of these deficient servicing practices, borrowers are falling victim to debt-relief scams, in which predatory companies attempt to extract large sums of money from desperate borrowers \u2013 all for repayment programs that borrowers can access for free through the Education Department.\n\nEarlier this year, Madigan launched a multistate investigation into Sallie Mae, which provides and collects on federally guaranteed student loans. In May, Sallie Mae agreed to pay $97 million in fines after government officials alleged the company illegally overcharged active-duty service members.\n\n\"Congress should create a uniform process for all student loan servicers to follow,\u201d she said. \u201cServicers should be required to tell struggling borrowers all their options.\u201d\n\nIn another twist reminiscent of Obama\u2019s first term, the hearing nearly tipped, at several points, into a debate about health care reform.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the committee\u2019s chair, said there was a \u201cdirect link between rising college costs and long-term state disinvestment.\u201d\n\nState funding has dropped, and public colleges have responded by hiking tuition, the Democrat said. He condemned the \u201cstunning abdication of responsibility on the part of states to preserve college affordability.\u201d\n\nBut Alexander was quick to propose an alternative hypothesis for climbing tuition rates. \u201cThe principal culprit is Medicaid,\u201d said the senator, who served as education secretary under George H.W. Bush. \u201cIt\u2019s the federal requirements on states to pay for Medicaid\u2026 those dollars come mostly out of higher education.\"\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why tuitions go up around the country,\u201d he said \u2013 adding that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid provisions would make the problem worse.\n\nHarkin\u2019s rewrite of the Higher Education Act, for which he is soliciting comments, runs to nearly 800 pages. In those pages, Medicaid is not mentioned once. Later in the hearing, Harkin shot back at Alexander, saying that declines in state revenues caused by tax cuts -- not Medicaid spending -- accounted for lapsing state support for higher education.\n\nHarkin\u2019s draft lays out two proposals for state-federal partnership. First, his rewrite suggests that the federal government should give eligible states annual block grants for additional public higher education funding. Public institutions would be required to use this money to reduce tuition costs or mitigate tuition increases, and to increase enrollment of Pell Grant-eligible students.\n\nSecond, Harkin\u2019s draft includes a competitive grant system, under which states can apply for money to carry out comprehensive reforms \u2013 such as shortening the length of time to a postsecondary degree and promoting the use of technology in \u201cincreasing personalized learning.\u201d\n\nThe senators and experts at the hearing did not discuss the details of Harkin\u2019s proposals for state-federal partnerships. Instead, they inveighed against for-profit institutions (which Madigan called \u201cso-called schools\u201d); discussed their desire to simplify financial aid procedures, including loans, without disrupting aid to the worst-off students; and considered higher education initiatives that had worked well in states such as Maryland and Indiana.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, expressed her disappointment that the student loan refinancing bill she championed, which would have allowed borrowers to refinance their student loans at lower rates, had not passed.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s time to cut the interest rate on student loans, and I think that\u2019s something we should be able to support, both Democrats and Republicans,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/25/senate-hearing-aimed-states-role-college-affordability-indiana-attorney-general", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "At Senate hearing, state and federal officials point fingers at one another when discussing who can fix issues of college cost and access.", "title": "At Senate hearing aimed at states' role in college affordability, Indiana attorney general points finger at feds"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "At Senate hearing, state and federal officials point fingers at one another when discussing who can fix issues of college cost and access.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "follow, index"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d90\"", "article_summary": "Federal student loan servicing is \u201cextremely problematic and extremely confusing,\u201d she said.\nEarlier this year, Madigan launched a multistate investigation into Sallie Mae, which provides and collects on federally guaranteed student loans.\nHarkin\u2019s rewrite of the Higher Education Act, for which he is soliciting comments, runs to nearly 800 pages.\nAnd companies that provide federal loans are failing to adequately advise student borrowers.\n\"Congress should create a uniform process for all student loan servicers to follow,\u201d she said."}
