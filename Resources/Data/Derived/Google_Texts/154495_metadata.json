(And) everything is free.\u201d\n\nScreenings for blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and other health tests, including blood lead testing for children aged 6 and under, and pregnant women, are provided. Doctors and pharmacists are on hand to answer questions on medications and other health issues. Hearing and eye tests, breast exams, podiatry, stress assessments and dental screenings will be offered.\n\nLeona Patterson, a co-chairman of the Healthy Affair, said the fact that there is no charge for screenings and tests is an incentive for persons to take advantage of Healthy Affair.\n\n\u201cEveryone is still not tied into the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the past, some serious health issues had been discovered and caught in time at the Healthy Affair. Patterson recalled an instance when one woman visiting from out of town, upon examination, discovered a health emergency. \u201cHer blood pressure was so high, we had to call an ambulance,\u201d said Patterson of the woman, who is in good health now.\n\nAnother woman returned the following year, to tell that in her examination, a malignant mass had been found, and properly treated.\n\n\u201cThe reception has been very good,\u201d said Co-Chairwoman Dorothy Herron, \u201c(but) our biggest problem is getting the teens in. (And) we\u2019ve been reaching out to the Hmong community.\u201d\n\nAll Oakland County residents are eligible to attend the Healthy Affair, but no one will be turned away. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some people come from Canada,\u201d Dowell said.\n\nTranslators will be on hand and also help for the hearing impaired will also be available. For those without a way to get to the event, free transportation to and from destinations, by appointment, is available.\n\nA continental breakfast will also be served.\n\nThe Healthy Affair will be held from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 23 at Welcome Baptist Church.
