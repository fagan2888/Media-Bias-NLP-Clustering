FRESNO, California (AP) — While police in the Northern California city of Stockton searched Saturday for an accomplice in a bank robbery that led to a police chase and deadly shootout, investigators said they suspect the same men carried out other area bank heists, including one at the same branch hit this week.

Officer Joe Silva of the Stockton Police Department said there are striking similarities between a late-January robbery at the Bank of the West and one Wednesday that left a hostage and two robbers dead. In both cases, Silva said, armed robbers made their get-away by stealing a bank employee’s car.

“Investigators have been looking at that January case really hard,” Silva said.

In Wednesday afternoon’s robbery, police say that three men, one armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, were dropped off at a Bank of the West branch, where they took three women as hostages, including a customer and two employees.

Fleeing in a bank employees’ SUV, the hour-long pursuit ended with two of the three robbers killed. The surviving suspect was arrested after using a hostage as a human shield during a gunfight with police.
