(FRC)\n\nIn a discussion with a caller disappointed with her pastor, who apparently is a strong supporter of President Barack Obama, radio host and Family Research Council President Tony Perkins suggested that the caller prayerfully consider changing churches, and added that the Obama administration has \u201csystematically targeted the Christian faith for quarantining\u201d inside churches, out of the public square.\n\nOn his March 9 program, Washington Watch with Tony Perkins, the caller, Theresa, explained that her preacher \u201cthinks Obama is the greatest\u201d and will not listen to other opinions about the president.\n\nPerkins said, \u201cTheresa, it sounds like you need to be praying about changing churches and finding another church. I would be very concerned after seven years of this administration that has systematically targeted the Christian faith for quarantining that faith within the walls of our churches.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no question about the intentions of this administration,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, this administration has been pushing abortion on demand, elective abortions, funded by taxpayers.\u201d\n\nPerkins continued, \u201cThey have systematically taken away religious freedom from members of the military. The president facilitated the redefinition of God\u2019s institution of marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat more in Heaven and what more evidence is necessary that this president is not in alignment with Biblical truth and even historical truth?\u201d said Perkins. \u201cSo, I think it\u2019s time for a new church, myself, Theresa.\u201d\n\nTony Perkins, 52, is the president of the Family Research Council. He is a U.S. Marine and served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1996-2004. Perkins is married and has five children.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "...", "title": "Perkins: Obama Administration Has 'Systematically Targeted the Christian Faith for Quarantining'", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/blog/michael-w-chapman/perkins-obama-administration-has-systematically-targeted-christian-faith", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/800px-tony_perkins_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-16T16:45:36-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-16T16:44:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T16:45:36-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "...", "title": "Perkins: Obama Administration Has 'Systematically Targeted the Christian Faith for Quarantining'", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/blog/michael-w-chapman/perkins-obama-administration-has-systematically-targeted-christian-faith", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/800px-tony_perkins_1.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cf2\"", "article_summary": "Family Research Council President Tony Perkins.\nI would be very concerned after seven years of this administration that has systematically targeted the Christian faith for quarantining that faith within the walls of our churches.\u201d\u201cThere is no question about the intentions of this administration,\u201d he said.\n(FRC)In a discussion with a caller disappointed with her pastor, who apparently is a strong supporter of President Barack Obama, radio host and Family Research Council President Tony Perkins suggested that the caller prayerfully consider changing churches, and added that the Obama administration has \u201csystematically targeted the Christian faith for quarantining\u201d inside churches, out of the public square.\n\u201cSo, I think it\u2019s time for a new church, myself, Theresa.\u201dTony Perkins, 52, is the president of the Family Research Council.\nOn his March 9 program, Washington Watch with Tony Perkins, the caller, Theresa, explained that her preacher \u201cthinks Obama is the greatest\u201d and will not listen to other opinions about the president."}
