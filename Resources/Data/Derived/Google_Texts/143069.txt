The official jobs report was released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Friday and it showed that in April 166,000 jobs were added to the economy, the lowest in seven months. Economists predicted that 200,000 jobs would be added. These numbers are in line with the 156,000 private sector jobs that ADP reported Wednesday. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.0 percent.

In addition, the BLS revised their previously reported jobs reports for February and March downward by 19,000. February was revised down from 245,000 to 233,000, and March was revised from 215,000 down to 208,000. Over the past 3 months, job gains have averaged 200,000 per month, however.

One reason for the drop in net job creation is that the federal and state governments shed a combined 11,000 jobs in April. The federal government accounted for 9,000 of the laid off workers, and state governments 2,000 due to budget cuts.

On bright spot in the report is that wages increased in April. The average earnings for all non-farm employees increased by 8 cents an hour in April to $25.53. This follows an increase of 6 cents in March. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.5 percent. In April, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by 5 cents to $21.45. The average work week increased as well to 34.5 hours as fewer workers were working part time.

The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) declined by 150,000 to 2.1 million in April. These individuals accounted for 25.7 percent of the unemployed. The number of discouraged workers also fell in April, down by 188,000 from a year earlier. Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.1 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in April had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.

Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Hispanics increased to 6.1 percent in April, while the rates for adult men (4.6 percent), adult women (4.5 percent), teenagers (16.0 percent), Whites (4.3 percent), Blacks (8.8 percent), and Asians (3.8 percent) showed little or no change. This shows that opportunity is still not equal across the various segments of the American society.

In April, employment gains occurred in professional and business services, health care, and financial activities, while mining continued to lose jobs due to decreased oil and gas activity because of low global oil prices.

Professional and business services added 65,000 jobs in April. The industry has added an average of 51,000 jobs per month over the prior 12 months. Health care employment rose by 44,000, with most of the increase occurring in hospitals (+23,000) and ambulatory health care services (+19,000). Over the year, health care employment has increased by 502,000. This is due to the fact more people are able to receive healthcare services due to the Affordable Care Act. The numbers debunk continued GOP claims that Obamacare is killing healthcare jobs.

Employment in the financial sector rose by 20,000 in April, with credit intermediation and related activities contributing 8,000 to the gain. This sector has added 160,000 jobs over the past 12 months. Mining employment continued to decline in April losing 7,000 jobs. Since reaching a peak in September 2014, employment in mining has decreased by 191,000, with more than three-quarters of the loss in support activities for mining.

Employment in other major industries, including construction, manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail trade, transportation and warehousing, information, leisure and hospitality, and government, showed little or no change over the month.

The slowdown in job creation will most likely insure that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates again in the short-term. There is no evidence that the job numbers are related to the recent rate increase. If anything, it is due to the uncertainty over a sluggish global economy and the turmoil surrounding the U.S. presidential election. Until this is settled, many businesses are likely to hold back on major hiring.
