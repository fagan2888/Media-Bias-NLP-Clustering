The Republicans have 10 officially declared candidates for the 2016 election. Four Democrats have formally tossed their hats into the race. With more GOP candidates expected to announce this month (Bush, Jindal, possibly Trump,), it’s becoming tougher for people to ferret out the candidate who best synchs up with their personal preferences — until now.

Thanks to the web site I Side With, voters can take a simple survey covering eight categories and be presented with a list showing how their specific interests and beliefs match up with each candidate.

The quiz asks you to answer a few questions on these topics:

Social (same sex marriage, abortion, death penalty and religious freedom)

Environmental (global warming/climate change, national parks management, energy policy and fracking)

Economic (minimum wage, welfare and unemployment policy)

Domestic Policy (gun control, term limits and redistricting)

Health Care (Obamacare, legalizing marijuana and increasing Medicaid funding)

Education (Common Core and increasing taxes on wealth to pay for student loan interest reduction)

Foreign Policy (military spending, fighting ISIS and giving foreign terror suspects the same rights as citizens)

Immigration (border security, requiring immigrants to learn English and giving healthcare to illegals)

In addition to answering the questions, you’re allowed to designate how important (or not important) each specific issue is to you.

After responding to the questions, the program processes your answers, matching them to the party and candidate most aligned to you.
