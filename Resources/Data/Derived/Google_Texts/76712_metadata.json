The actress, who languishes in utter obscurity when she\u2019s not making banal and moronic statements, was blasted by another black conservative for foolishly saying that all black people in Louisiana were \u201cuneducated\u201d and felt \u201cworthless\u201d under the President Obama\u2019s leadership and Obamacare.\n\nAppearing on the \u201cSean Hannity\u201d show, Fox News contributor Dash called all black people in Louisiana listless government freeloaders who subsist on charity and handouts.\n\nSean Hannity asked the \u201cClueless\u201d actress \u2014 and she is indeed clueless \u2014 some leading and loaded questions and Dash walked right into it like a sheep led to a slaughter: \u201cHas voting with Obama 95 percent of the time and Obamacare, has that helped the minority community in Louisiana?\u201d Hannity asked disingenuously.\n\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Dash said. \u201cIt still keeps them stuck. They\u2019re getting money for free. They feel worthless. They\u2019re uneducated. I mean, as long as you are that way, they can keep you under their control \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have a plantation mentality,\u201d Dash continued. \u201cAs long as they give you this much money, you\u2019ll stay right there. You don\u2019t need to know too much because if you do, you might start thinking for yourself.\u201d\n\nEven other black conservatives were shocked and appalled by Dash\u2019s nonsensical and irrational perspective.\n\nConservative Black Chick blog founder Crystal Wright, in particular, torched Dash for her sheer ignorance in an editorial piece for CNN:\n\n\u201cI think Stacey Dash needs to get out more, perhaps visit Louisiana and the rest of America and see that all blacks, myself included, certainly don\u2019t feel \u201cworthless\u201d under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cWhether Democratic or Republican, scores of black people \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Allen West, Condoleezza Rice, Ben Carson, Shelby Steele, Bill Cosby, Robin Roberts, and many many others \u2014 are highly educated, gainfully employed, paying their bills and frankly doing quite well. Dash is one of them.\n\n\u201cMany black people may want Obama to provide more productive policies, but to suggest, as Dash does, that blacks are largely \u201cuneducated\u201d and \u201cgetting money for free\u201d is a racist narrative that conservatives need to stop perpetuating. That kind of talk is an offensive nonstarter in getting blacks to consider voting Republican. So is the often repeated meme by some black conservatives that blacks \u201chave a plantation mentality.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re white or black, it\u2019s never cool to invoke metaphors of slavery, which was a gruesome, painful institution protected by Democrats in America that went on way too long. Conservatives should remind Americans of the history of slavery and how the Democratic Party perpetuates policies of paternalism that don\u2019t benefit blacks.\u201d\n\nTo read the commentary in its entirety, click here:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://ioneadwnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/staceydash.jpg?w=150", "sailthru.author": "Terry Shropshire, National Correspondent", "description": "Conservative Black Blasts Stacey Dash for Saying All Blacks Are 'Uneducated'", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=, affiliate-data=, app-argument=", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Daily World", "description": "It has become obvious to even the most casual cultural observer that conservative groupie Stacey Dash has about as much depth as a sidewalk puddle.
