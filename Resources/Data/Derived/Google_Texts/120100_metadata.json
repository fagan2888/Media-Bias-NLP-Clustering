Zients' replacement has not yet been announced.\n\nIt is not clear when he will begin at the National Economic Council. Sperling will stay for the month, a White House official said, speaking on background. The extension was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nThat timetable means Sperling will be around leading up to Obama's State of the Union address, slated for Jan. 28. The president's budget request to Congress normally is released in February.\n\nZients had promised to make the website work smoothly for most people by the end of November, leading a team of contractors in a round-the-clock overhaul of the site.\n\nSince those improvements, more Americans have been able to enroll in health insurance leading up to Dec. 23, a critical deadline for consumers needing insurance coverage by January. Work continues to build other \"back end\" parts of the site.
