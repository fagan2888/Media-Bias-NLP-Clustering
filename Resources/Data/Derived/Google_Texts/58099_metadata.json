He wasn\u2019t much in the mood for games.\n\nEventually, however, as Dr. Moriah Tarpey checked the 11-month-old\u2019s vision with what looked like a colorful wand, Malakai came out of his post-sleep haze and grabbed it.\n\n\u201cHow is he doing with language?\u201d Tarpey asked Malakai\u2019s parents, Amber Barnett and Richard Nelson, while Malakai sat on his mother\u2019s lap playing.\n\n\u201cHe says, \u2018dada\u2019 a lot,\u201d Barnett said.\n\n\u201cI just love his chubby marshmallow hands,\u201d Tarpey said sweetly, looking into Malakai\u2019s eyes.\n\nSpeaking of baby weight, Barnett and Nelson had some questions for Tarpey about introducing cow\u2019s milk.\n\nShould they give their chubby baby whole milk? Should they warm it up?\n\n\u201cThey ask detailed questions,\u201d Tarpey said with a smile. \u201cI love that.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t worry about baby weight, Tarpey assured first-time parents Barnett and Nelson. Babies need the fat of whole milk for brain development. Once Malakai\u2019s mobility increases, he\u2019ll lose weight.\n\nAs for milk temperature? Pay attention to what he likes. Some babies dislike cold cow\u2019s milk as they transition from breast milk or formula, Tarpey said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very honest,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI love that about her. If she doesn\u2019t know something, she\u2019ll figure it out for you.\u201d\n\nTarpey, 38, has been Malakai\u2019s pediatrician for months but practiced as a pediatrician in the Grand Valley for nearly seven years. In 2015, she joined Marillac Clinic, 2333 N. Sixth St., after it was named a Federally Qualified Community Health Center, paving the way for the facility to see more children for medical visits.\n\nMarillac Clinic\u2019s new focus to care for people from birth (and even before with prenatal visits) to death came at the perfect time for Tarpey, who as recently as 2014 was in talks to start a local, nonprofit clinic for children in the same model as the Church Health Center based in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nTarpey did her residency in Memphis and became familiar with the center\u2019s mission offering quality, affordable health care for working, uninsured people and their families. The center is one of the largest faith-based health care organizations of its type in the United States, according to churchhealthcenter.org.\n\nTarpey reached out to the center for advice and guidance on starting a replication clinic in Grand Junction. She even learned about a funding company in Texas.\n\nWith changes to the Affordable Care Act, however, Tarpey\u2019s funding was put on hold in January 2015. She wanted to serve the uninsured or under-insured people of western Colorado but was left wondering how.\n\nThen she received a phone call from Dr. John Whiteside, the chief medical officer at Marillac Clinic. He told Tarpey the local clinic, which up until that point had only served uninsured and under-insured adults, was looking to expand services into prenatal, obstetrics and pediatrics.\n\nWould she be interested in coming on board as the clinic\u2019s first pediatrician?\n\n\u201cI wanted to know if I even needed to interview,\u201d Tarpey joked.\n\nTarpey\u2019s desire to serve the working poor dates back to her childhood in rural Illinois as the daughter of Jim and Marsha Heyen. Her father was an auto mechanic who taught vocational classes for teenagers who weren\u2019t bound for college. Her mother was a Macoupin County public health worker.\n\nHer parents both showed compassion and love toward everyone they worked with, qualities Tarpey admired.\n\n\u201cIt was in my awareness as a kid there was a lot of poverty surrounding us, and we weren\u2019t too far from it either,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Tarpey enrolled at St. Louis University, a Jesuit university in Missouri, she was interested in both the sciences and theology.\n\nWhen she took a nurse assistant position as a side job during college, however, Tarpey was exposed to the importance of quality paPhotos by CHRISTOPHER TOMLINSON/The Daily Sentinel\n\nDr. Moriah Tarpey is Marillac Clinic\u2019s first pediatrician. \u201cEvery day here, I feel like there\u2019s at least one person who I can look at and say, \u2018This is the reason I\u2019m here today,\u2019 \u201d Tarpey said.tient care for all demographics.\n\n\u201cI feel like so many physicians end up in medical school and haven\u2019t actually touched a person and done the work they order,\u201d Tarpey said.\n\nMidway through her undergraduate time at St. Louis University, she declared her major as pre-med and was eventually accepted to five medical schools, selecting St. Louis University but deferring enrollment for a year so she could drive her grandmother to chemotherapy.\n\nHer grandmother would introduce Tarpey to people as \u201cMoriah, my granddaughter who\u2019s going to be a doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeeing that perspective as a patient and family, I realized how important it was to have a good bedside manner,\u201d Tarpey said.\n\nWhen Tarpey started medical school in 2001, she was drawn to pediatrics thanks to the top-notch pediatricians she was surrounded by while working at Cardinal Glennon Children\u2019s Hospital, a St. Louis-based hospital that serves the poor as part of its mission.\n\nIn 2005, she became Dr. Moriah Tarpey, just as her grandmother foretold.\n\nWhile in medical school, Tarpey met her eventual husband, Dr. Jeffrey Tarpey. They both moved to Memphis for residency.\n\n\u201cWhen my husband was like 8 years old, he used to come out to Ouray from Chicago,\u201d Tarpey said. \u201cThere was a point where he met the mayor of the town who asked him, \u2018What do you want to do when you grow up?\u2019 Jeff wanted to be a doctor and the mayor said he could be a doctor in Ouray, Colorado. He set his sights on that.\u201d\n\nWhile in Memphis, they looked for a community close to Ouray that could support two physicians.\n\nGrand Junction, it was.\n\nIn 2009, Jeffrey Tarpey was offered a hospitalist position at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, and Moriah Tarpey moved into private practice, taking a position at Dino Peds, where she saw for the first time the business-side of primary care.\n\nAfter a couple years, the couple\u2019s second son, Sean, arrived, joining his older brother, Liam, who was born in Memphis. The boys are now 4 and 8.\n\nTarpey then moved to Western Colorado Pediatric Associates.\n\nHowever, after the couple\u2019s third son, Finn, arrived \u2014 he\u2019s now 2 \u2014 Tarpey quickly realized the strain her work was putting on the family.\n\n\u201cMy little guy wouldn\u2019t eat,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized I wasn\u2019t where I needed to be.\u201d\n\nTarpey left private practice in February 2014 to take care of her boys, and, as Finn grew up a bit, her desire to resume medical practice also grew.\n\nThat\u2019s when plans fell through for the children\u2019s clinic, which led her to Marillac Clinic.\n\n\u201cEvery day here, I feel like there\u2019s at least one person who I can look at and say, \u2018This is the reason I\u2019m here today,\u2019 \u201d Tarpey said. \u201cI feel like the mission of this office and this group is apparent in everything we do. I\u2019ve never worked in a setting like that before. The focus is service. It\u2019s not paper, it\u2019s people.\u201d\n\nWhiteside said the decision to hire Tarpey was an easy one.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an experienced pediatrician,\u201d he said. \u201cIn doctor speak, from a hiring perspective, first, she comes from a good school and has excellent training. Second, is her passion for serving the under-served.\u201d\n\nIn Tarpey\u2019s experience, children are some of the most vulnerable patients in need of quality care, particularly children living at or below the poverty line. Emergency rooms are not a place to track a child\u2019s development. That\u2019s what she\u2019s for, Tarpey said.\n\n\u201cShe spends quite a bit of time talking to her patients and gets down to the bottom of patient concerns,\u201d said Tania Acevedo, Tarpey\u2019s medical assistant at Marillac Clinic. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t just go in and say, \u2018What do you want today?\u2019 We have tough patients, and she manages to pull it off with a smile. She\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nTarpey is accepting new patients and is in the office from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday. She wants to build a rapport with parents so they feel comfortable enough to ask questions and don\u2019t hesitate to bring children in for routine dental check-ups, eye exams and childhood wellness check-ups no matter their income.\n\nPediatrics is \u201can area of medicine where there\u2019s hope for change in the future,\u201d Tarpey said when discussing the value of getting youth of all income levels on healthy lifestyle tracks. \u201cI knew I wanted to end up in the nonprofit world at some point. Every stepping stone has been toward this opportunity. Even growing up, that\u2019s what I saw my parents do. They had a heart for people less fortunate. I\u2019ve never felt so blessed, honestly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CO", "DC.format": "text/html", "geo.placename": "Grand Junction", "description": "Grand Junction - Malakai Nelson just woke up from a nap.
