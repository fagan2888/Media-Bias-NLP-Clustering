But the effects of the law won\u2019t fall equally: African-Americans and Latinos are 305 percent and 195 percent less likely (respectively) to have the necessary forms of identification than whites. The Republican party is increasingly unpopular, and relies almost exclusively on white voters. The charts below show the 2008 if only white men voted and if only people of color voted (source).\n\nSince 2008, people of color become a growing share of the voting population while the GOP has, if anything, moved further to the right. It has further alienated voters of color with racist attacks and laws. But as they say: if you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, make sure they don\u2019t vote. Over the last four years the Republicans have gone through elaborate attempts to make sure populations that don\u2019t support them don\u2019t get a chance to vote.\n\nSince 2006, Republicans have pushed through voter ID laws in 34 states. Such laws did not exist before 2006, when Indiana passed the first voter ID law. The laws were ostensibly aimed at preventing voter fraud, but a News21 investigation finds only 2,068 instance of alleged fraud since 2000 (that is out of over 146 million voters). They estimate that there is one accusation of voter fraud for every 15 million voters. As Mother Jones notes, instances of voter fraud are more rare than UFO sightings. There have been only 13 instances of in-person voter fraud (the sorts that a voter ID law would reduce), while 47,000 people claim to have seen a UFO.\n\nOn the other hand, research by the Brennan Center for Justice finds that, \u201cas many as 11 percent of eligible voters do not have government-issued photo ID.\u201d Those who do not have ID are most likely to be \u201c seniors, people of color, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students\u201d \u2014 i.e.. people who vote Democratic (chart source).\n\nThere is now a large literature studying the effects of voter ID laws. James Avery and Mark Peffley find, \u201cstates with restrictive voter registration laws are much more likely to be biased toward upper-class turnout.\u201d The GAO finds that voter ID laws reduce turnout among those between ages 18-23 and African-Americans (two key Democratic constituencies). A 2013 study finds that the proposal and passage of voter ID laws are \u201chighly partisan, strategic, and racialized affairs.\u201d They write, \u201cOur findings confirm that Democrats are justified in their concern that restrictive voter legislation takes aim along racial lines with strategic partisan intent.\u201d [Italics in original] The authors also find that increases in low-income voter turnout triggered voter ID laws. A more recent study finds, \u201cwhere elections are competitive, the furtherance of restrictive voter ID laws is a means of maintaining Republican support while curtailing Democratic electoral gains.\u201d That is, not all Republican legislatures propose voter ID laws \u2014 only those that face strong competition from Democrats. If Republicans are concerned about election integrity, why do they only pass voter ID laws when they\u2019re about to lose an election? Because they\u2019re cheaters.\n\nVoter ID laws are also racially motivated. A recent study finds that voters are significantly more likely to support a voter ID law when they are shown pictures of black people voting than when shown white people voting. One voter ID group had a picture on their website showing a black inmate voting and a man wearing a mariachi outfit \u2014 clearly playing off racial stereotypes.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the only time Republicans have tried to leverage state-level advantages into federal gains. After the 2010 walloping, Republicans decided they would need to tilt the odds in their favor. Using their control of state legislatures, they gerrymandered districts to ensure their victory. In 2012, Democrats actually had a larger share of the popular vote for the House of Representatives, while Republicans gained their largest House majority in 60 years. Cook Political Report noted, \u201cHouse GOP Won 49 Percent of Votes, 54 Percent of Seats.\u201d How? They cheated. Karl Rove came out and said it in an Op-Ed, writing, \u201cHe who controls redistricting can control Congress.\u201d They won in districts that were drawn specifically to allow them to win. There were certainly other factors at play, but it\u2019s hard to image Republicans winning as many seats without their nifty swindle.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The explosion and enforcement of restrictive voter ID laws make this one thing very clear", "title": "The Republican Party\u2019s electoral philosophy: Cheating wins", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The explosion and enforcement of restrictive voter ID laws make this one thing very clear", "title": "The Republican Party\u2019s electoral philosophy: Cheating wins", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/25/the_republican_partys_electoral_philosophy_cheating_wins/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/scott_rove_perry.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The explosion and enforcement of restrictive voter ID laws make this one thing very clear", "title": "The Republican Party\u2019s electoral philosophy: Cheating wins", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/scott_rove_perry.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Elections 2014, GOP, Republican Party, Voter ID", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fa2\"", "article_summary": "There is now a large literature studying the effects of voter ID laws.\nVoter ID laws are also racially motivated.\nThere have been only 13 instances of in-person voter fraud (the sorts that a voter ID law would reduce), while 47,000 people claim to have seen a UFO.\nTopics: Elections 2014, GOP, Republican Party, Voter ID, News, Politics NewsLast week, the Supreme Court upheld a law that could disenfranchise 600,000 Texans.\nIf Republicans are concerned about election integrity, why do they only pass voter ID laws when they\u2019re about to lose an election?"}
