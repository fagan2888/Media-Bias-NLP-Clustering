That\u2019s not exactly an appealing message.\n\nProponents of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion like to talk about how expanding eligibility to able-bodied, childless adults will create jobs and relieve pressure on hospital emergency rooms and save everyone hundreds of millions of dollars. They\u2019re far less eager, understandably, to explain how Medicaid expansion incentivizes states to shift criminal offenders into a program originally meant to provide healthcare to infants, pregnant women, and the disabled.\n\nAnd that\u2019s precisely what expansion is doing, according to a report released this week from the Government Accountability Office: \u201cThe combination of expanded Medicaid eligibility and enhanced funding for those newly eligible as allowed under PPACA gives states additional incentives to enroll inmates in Medicaid and obtain federal matching funds, and increases the federal responsibility for financing allowable services for inmates.\u201d\n\nGenerally, the cost of treating inmates falls on state and local authorities. Federal law prohibits states from using Medicaid funds to pay for inmates\u2019 healthcare expenses, except when an inmate who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid is admitted to a hospital for at least 24 hours. Obamacare doesn\u2019t change this policy, but by expanding Medicaid to everyone who earns less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $15,000 a year for an individual, almost every state prison inmate in the country\u2014about 1.5 million people\u2014would qualify for Medicaid if they needed treatment outside prison.\n\nThis is also true of the entire correctional population of those on probation or parole, an estimated 4.5 million nationwide. All told, if every state expanded Medicaid, millions of inmates, probationers, and parolees nationwide could be placed on the Medicaid rolls as a result of Obamacare.\n\nThis news shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Last year, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton asked the GAO to review the effect of the ACA on former offenders and the current inmate population. Upton\u2019s concern was that limited Medicaid funds would be used to pay medical bills for inmates and parolees at a time when hundreds of thousands of Medicaid enrollees\u2014disabled children and the frail elderly\u2014are on Medicaid waiting lists for home care and other services.\n\nSome, like Jonathan Ingram at the Foundation for Government Accountability, have already pointed this out, warning that past attempts at Medicaid expansion have resulted in huge cost overruns that forced states to eliminate coverage for things like organ transplants and place thousands on waitlists for some services. To be fair, under current federal rules the waiting lists are for Medicaid waiver programs that go beyond the scope of Medicaid\u2019s core services, so it\u2019s not as though basic Medicaid coverage would be denied to the aged and disabled in favor of treatment for prison inmates.\n\nNevertheless, it raises the question of what kind of services we want Medicaid dollars to fund and whether inmates and probationers should have priority over the elderly and disabled (a question treated with a bit of humor in FGA\u2019s video, below).\n\nTo get a sense of whether states really are trying to shift inmate healthcare costs onto Medicaid via the expansion, the GAO reports looked at six states\u2014four that expanded Medicaid (California, Colorado, New York, and Washington) and did two that didn\u2019t (North Carolina and Pennsylvania). The report found that all six states were trying to shift inmates\u2019 healthcare costs into Medicaid through various efforts, like hiring staff to enroll inmates in Medicaid.\n\nWhile the percent of the inmate population eligible for Medicaid services appears to be relatively small, Medicaid expansion could change all that. For example, Colorado officials told the GAO that prior to 2014, the number of inmates eligible for Medicaid was very small and therefore federal funds used to pay for their care was limited. This year, however, the state received $2.5 million in federal matching Medicaid funds to pay for inmates\u2019 care. That figure might seem small, but it\u2019s the relative increase that matters. In a state like California, which received $38.5 million in federal Medicaid funds for inmates in 2013, expansion will mean a much larger increase in federal Medicaid spending.\n\nOn a national level, Americans could be paying billions more in the years ahead to cover healthcare costs for prison inmates as a direct result of Medicaid expansion, which 27 states have now adopted. Whether that\u2019s a good use of taxpayer dollars and something most Americans would support is an open question. Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 07 Oct 2014 07:09:55 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Americans could be paying billions more in the years ahead to cover healthcare costs for prison inmates as a direct result of Medicaid expansion.", "title": "How Medicaid Expansion Covers Health Care For Inmates Over The Disabled", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Capture.png", "updated_time": "2014-10-07T08:05:45+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/10/07/how-medicaid-expansion-covers-health-care-for-inmates-over-sick-people/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Americans could be paying billions more in the years ahead to cover healthcare costs for prison inmates as a direct result of Medicaid expansion.", "title": "How Medicaid Expansion Covers Health Care For Inmates Over The Disabled", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Capture.png"}, "creator": "@johnddavidson", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "federalism,Fred Upton,GAO,Inmates,Medicaid,Obamacare", "published_time": "2014-10-07T07:09:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-07T08:05:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Americans could be paying billions more in the years ahead to cover healthcare costs for prison inmates as a direct result of Medicaid expansion."}, "article_summary": "While the percent of the inmate population eligible for Medicaid services appears to be relatively small, Medicaid expansion could change all that.\nIn a state like California, which received $38.5 million in federal Medicaid funds for inmates in 2013, expansion will mean a much larger increase in federal Medicaid spending.\nThe report found that all six states were trying to shift inmates\u2019 healthcare costs into Medicaid through various efforts, like hiring staff to enroll inmates in Medicaid.\nOf all the arguments for Medicaid expansion, you won\u2019t hear the one about how expansion will cover more healthcare costs for inmates in state and county prisons.\nThis year, however, the state received $2.5 million in federal matching Medicaid funds to pay for inmates\u2019 care."}
