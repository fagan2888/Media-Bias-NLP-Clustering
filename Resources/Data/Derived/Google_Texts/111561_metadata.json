But they could only receive $220 per share now that Aetna's shares of stock closed at $113 Oct. 13.\n\nMr. Solak's suit also claimed the deal offers executives \u2014 like Humana CEO Bruce Broussard \u2014 multi-million dollar severance packages to get them to support the proposed acquisition.\n\nAnother suit, which cited similar concerns, was filed by Harold Litwin and merged in Jefferson Circuit Court with Mr. Solak's action.\n\nDue to the litigation, Humana and Aetna had to disclose financial information and details in an 8K document filed with the SEC.\n\nSimilar shareholder suits are not uncommon, according to The Courier-Journal. In July, shareholder Maureen Scott filed a lawsuit claiming the acquisition undervalues Humana and underestimates the antitrust hurdles ahead.\n\nMore articles on legal and regulatory issues:\n\nPhysician: Kaiser hoarded money by evading insurance taxes\n\nJeb Bush offers plan to repeal, replace ACA: 9 things to know\n\nUC Health, West Chester Hospital to pay $4.1M to resolve false claims allegations\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
