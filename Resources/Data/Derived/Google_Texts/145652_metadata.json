But Fitzgerald advised people to \u201capply as soon as possible so they can get that coverage.\u201d\n\nHealthy Michigan is available to residents, ages 19 to 64, who are not currently eligible for Medicaid and Medicare and who earn up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. That is about $16,000 for individuals and $33,000 for a family of four.\n\nInformation about eligibility and enrollment is available at healthymichiganplan.org or by calling 855-789-5610.\n\nHelp is also available from navigators by calling Cherry Street Health Services at 866-299-1339 or by visiting the center at 100 Cherry St. SE.\n\nAbout 477,000 Michigan residents are expected to qualify for the program, which includes incentives for healthy behaviors. Participants have premiums and co-pays, but costs can be reduced by completing an annual risk assessment and changing unhealthy behaviors such as smoking.\n\nIn some cases, Fitzgerald said residents who signed up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act will qualify for Healthy Michigan. In that case, she said they should notify their insurer and the health insurance marketplace once they are enrolled in the expanded Medicaid program.\n\nShe cautioned residents to get information about coverage based on their individual circumstances, rather than relying on the experience of others.\n\n\u201cI think, as always, there\u2019s a lot of information out there. It\u2019s important to keep your personal situation in mind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are resources to help you find your way.\n\n\n\nSue Thoms covers health care for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.
