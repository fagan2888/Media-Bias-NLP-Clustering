It\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t mean the term in a pejorative sense, either \u2013 he\u2019s even promised to staff a Trump administration with \u201cWall Street killers.\u201d\n\nAnd while he may not say it out loud very much, it\u2019s plain that Trump counts himself among the \u201ckillers\u201d of the world--he probably sees himself as chief among them. So far in his campaign, he\u2019s been right. When other candidates have come after him--think Rick Perry and Jeb Bush--he\u2019s quickly spotted their vulnerabilities and slapped them down.\n\nRelated: The Wheels Are (Finally) Coming Off the Trump Campaign\n\nBut Trump is facing a different challenge now, and it\u2019s not clear he\u2019s figured out how to handle it.\n\nThe billionaire and former reality television star has staked his campaign on his status as an outsider \u2013 someone with a non-Washington background who can come in and shake up a dysfunctional government. The problem is that his chief rival for the Republican nomination is working the same angle. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has no experience in government either, and though not as bombastic as Trump, Carson is also selling an \u201coverhaul Washington\u201d strategy.\n\nCarson is gaining in the polls, to the point where he and Trump are now neck and neck in national surveys of Republican primary voters. And Carson\u2019s gains have all come without going on the attack against Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s plainly caught the billionaire wrong-footed, and he\u2019s still trying to find his balance. For most of the campaign, Trump has characterized himself as a \u201ccounterpuncher\u201d \u2013 meaning that he doesn\u2019t turn his fire on his opponents until they attack him. It\u2019s not completely accurate, but as a general rule, Trump hasn\u2019t really gone on the attack except when provoked.\n\nRelated: Trump Stands Alone Calling for Mass Deportation of Illegal Immigrants\n\nLast week, Trump appeared to make the decision that he would try to be \u2013 for him at least \u2013 somewhat more presidential. After Carson endured several days of questioning the veracity of his statements about his childhood in his book, Gifted Hands, Trump appeared on most of the Sunday political shows suggesting concern for Carson\u2019s welfare, not whether the doctor could be trusted.\n\n\u201cI hope, frankly, it comes out great for him,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAt the fourth Republican debate on Tuesday, Trump was similarly subdued. He came across as peevish when he was challenged, but didn\u2019t spend much of his time on the attack.\n\nThat Trump had changed his strategy was obvious \u2013 and equally obvious was that it wasn\u2019t working. Carson came through the debate without suffering any significant damage, and Trump appeared to gain little from it.\n\nRelated: How Trump, Carson and Cruz Turned Voters Against the GOP\n\nBetween Tuesday\u2019s debate and Thursday, though, something changed, and Trump the killer reemerged.\n\nIn an interview with CNN Thursday, he attacked Carson\u2019s claims about being angry and violent as a child \u2013 with a temper the surgeon himself described as pathological. Trump, who uses the word \u201cpathological\u201d as a synonym for \u201cincurable,\u201d told interviewer Erin Burnett that Carson\u2019s condition was like that of a child molester \u2013 something that never goes away.\n\nHours later, in a rambling appearance in Iowa, Trump again repeated the child molester comparison.\n\n\u201cCarson is an enigma to me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe said that he's 'pathological' and that he's got, basically, pathological disease... I don't want a person that's got pathological disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you're a child molester \u2013 a sick puppy \u2013 a child molester, there's no cure for that,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere's only one cure; we don't want to talk about that cure. That's the ultimate cure. If you're a child molester, there's no cure. They can't stop you. Pathological? There's no cure.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, though, he suggested that at least one of Carson\u2019s stories, about attempting to stab a friend only to have a belt buckle block the attack, was false.\n\n\u201cHow stupid are the people of Iowa?\u201d he demanded. \u201cHow stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap?\"\n\nWashington Post columnist Eugene Robinson remarked on Trump\u2019s change of strategy during an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe Friday morning. \u201cThe last few weeks, Trump has actually dialed it down a notch. He\u2019s been \u2013 not a traditional candidate, certainly \u2013 but a bit quieter, a bit less bombastic. A bit less Trumpian. He switched it back on. He decided if he\u2019s going to deal with Ben Carson then only one outsider is going to survive, and he has to take down Ben Carson and go back to being Trump.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fact Checkers Working Overtime \u2013 Top Whoppers from the GOP Debate\n\nAmid howls that Trump had gone too far with the \u201cchild molester\u201d claim, the Carson campaign appeared to be employing the \u201cgive him enough rope\u201d strategy.\n\nInstead of pushing back against any particular thing Trump said, Carson advisor Armstrong Williams, on CNN, said, \u201cIt\u2019s so sad watching and listening to him. I mean, a man who is so accomplished, who has been so blessed, but yet cannot fathom why Dr. Carson or anyone else would be doing better than he in the presidential race right now.\u201d\n\nWilliams added, \u201cTo see him just imploding before our very eyes, it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s sad to watch.\u201d\n\nWhen he asked Carson how to respond to Trump, Williams said, the candidate advised, \u201cPray for him.\u201d\n\nTrump, however, showed no sign of dialing back the attacks. Late Friday morning, he posted a single Tweet that read \u201cHappy Friday the 13th\u201d and contained a link to his Instagram account.\n\nHappy Friday the 13th https://t.co/Br6AUzgGoi \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2015\n\nThe posting is a short video about Carson, set to music from the classic Horror Film Friday the 13th. After showing footage of someone who knew Carson as a child casting doubt on his story about the attempted stabbing, it flashes to a bright screen with white lettering.\n\n\u201cViolent criminal? Or pathological liar?\u201d it reads. \u201cWe don\u2019t need either as president\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump has staked his campaign on his status as an outsider \u2013 someone with a non-Washington background who can come in and shake up a dysfunctional government.
