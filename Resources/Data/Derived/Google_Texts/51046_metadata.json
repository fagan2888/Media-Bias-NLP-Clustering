No matter what you think about either of the Big Two, you most likely are affected by other medical issues or simply care about many more health matters. Natch, you probably would like to know whether any of the candidates line up with your personal perspective.\n\nThe best way to understand who is concerned about what issue is to simply go to their campaign sites and take a gander at their position pages. You will soon discover that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders outline policies on disability rights, while Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump does not. Clinton makes her views known on campus sexual assault, yet Sanders and Trump neglect to do so. By comparison, Sanders has a plan to fight for nurses that the other candidates lack. Meanwhile, Trump keeps his website trim with just two articulated plans for veterans administration reform and healthcare reform.\n\nNo matter. Medical Daily has scoured the Internet in order to give you the rough shape of each contender\u2019s views on these currently less contested health and medical issues.\n\nGenetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and Food Labeling\n\nCurrently, the FDA does not require biotechnology-produced foods to be labeled because it has found no health effects associated with them nor any material difference between GMO and non-GMO foods.\n\nSanders\u2019 website expresses a clear-cut position on GMO labeling. \u201cBernie supports allowing states to require labels on foods containing \u201cgenetically modified organisms\u201d based on the consumer\u2019s right-to-know, but does not believe that GMOs are necessarily bad.\u201d The site also notes that Sanders proposed a farm bill amendment supporting the labeling of GMO products, based on his belief that people \u201chave a right to know what\u2019s in their food so that they can make an informed decision on whether or not they want to consume it.\u201d He rounds out his support by noting the FDA already requires the labeling of over 3,000 ingredients, additives, and processes, so it only makes sense to include information about the use and extent of GMOs in food.\n\nSpeaking at the Biotechnology Industry Organization convention in 2014, Clinton spoke most clearly about her position on GMO crops. \u201cI stand in favor of using seeds and products that have a proven track record,\u201d she said as reported in AgWired, before further explaining, \u201cThere is a big gap between what the facts are and what the perceptions are.\u201d In a town hall meeting on the campaign trail, she also expressed opposition to preempting state decision-making regarding GMOs, according to a report in Politico.\n\nAsked a precise question, Trump gave a precise answer. Iowa Farm Bureau queried each of the candidates: \u201cDo you support the use of biotechnology in food products and oppose efforts to require mandatory labeling for foods simply because they contain ingredients derived from biotechnology?\u201d Trump\u2019s answer: Yes. It does not appear that he has made additional comments on the topic.\n\nVote Reuters\n\nAs outlined on her campaign site, Clinton proposes a commitment to prevent, treat, and cure Alzheimer\u2019s disease by 2025 by investing $2 billion per year in research; by ensuring a reliable stream of funding; and by establishing a plan of action with researchers and health experts. In addition, Clinton plans to cover comprehensive Alzheimer\u2019s care-planning services for citizens and wants to reauthorize the Missing Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Patient Alert Program, which finds patients reported missing.\n\nTrump\u2019s connection to this disease is personal in that his father suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s for six years before dying from pneumonia. The candidate has referred to the disease as a \u201ctotal top priority for me,\u201d according to U.S. News and World Report, though he has not issued a detailed policy.\n\nSanders also does not espouse a specific policy regarding Alzheimer\u2019s, though he was asked about the disease last year and responded in this way: \u201cI believe in prevention. I believe it makes sense to invest in trying to understand the causation of disease, in the long run it saves us money and it certainly eases human suffering.\u201d More widely, he said, \u201cAs a nation we should be investing in research and development.\u201d\n\nMedical Marijuana\n\nIn a February interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox News, Trump said he is \u201ca hundred percent\u201d in favor of medical marijuana. When it comes to recreational pot, Trump straddles the proverbial fence, commenting in the same interview, \u201cI would, I would really want to think about that one, Bill, because in some ways, I think it\u2019s good and in other ways, it\u2019s bad.\u201d Overall, he believes the health consequences of legal marijuana use remains uncertain, and this is why he does not take a stand.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders has spoken about his own experiences. \u201cI\u2019ve done marijuana twice in my life,\u201d The Cannabist reports Sanders saying to a campaign crowd. \u201cAnd what it did for me, is it made me cough a lot \u2014 that was my response, but I gather other people have had different experiences.\u201d Sanders believes marijuana should be removed from the federal government\u2019s list of controlled substances. While this would not automatically make it legal throughout the 50 states, it would allow individual states to legalize the drug without federal impediment. He also believes the medicinal purposes of marijuana should be legal.\n\nClinton said she hopes to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule 1 drug, defined as having a \"high potential for abuse\" and \"no currently accepted medical use\" to a Schedule 2 drug, according to an MSNBC report. This downgrading would allow medical research to progress, which she favors. In terms of recreational legalization of the drug, Clinton\u2019s approach is to see how the experiment plays out in Colorado and Washington.\n\nVote Reuters\n\nPrescription Drug Prices\n\nAccording to the Briefing, Clinton proposed a plan to lower drug costs. She would stop excessive profiteering and marketing by denying tax breaks for direct-to-consumer advertising and demanding that drug makers invest in research and development. She also hopes to create a federal backstop for excessively high-priced drugs that face no competition. She plans as well to encourage competition in the generics arena. Finally, she wants to cap the amount insurers can charge consumers in out-of-pocket costs.\n\nTrump, Associated Press reports, wants Medicare to save billions of dollars in drug costs by negotiating prices with pharmaceutical companies. In January, he told a crowd in New Hampshire that the federal agency, which is the biggest buyer of prescription drugs, could save $300 billion a year by getting discounts. His position paper on Healthcare reform also supports consumers gaining access to imported, safe, and dependable drugs from overseas in order to offer them more options.\n\nSanders outlines a plan of six policies intended to lower prescription drug prices. As president he will require Medicare negotiate with prescription drug companies for better prices while also allowing the importation of prescription drugs from Canada. He hopes to close the Medicare Part D donut hole for brand and generic drugs by 2017 and restore discounts for low-income seniors. He favors the prohibition of anti-competitive deals between brand and generic drug makers and stronger penalties for drug company fraud. Finally, he requires pricing and cost transparency among pharmaceutical companies.\n\nMental Health Care\n\nAs part of his plan to overhaul health care, Trump suggests reforming mental health programs and institutions in this country. In particular, he says that many families lack the necessary information and tools to help their loved ones. \u201cThere are promising reforms being developed in Congress that should receive bipartisan support,\u201d he adds. With regard to substance abuse, Trump has not outlined a plan, though he told supporters along the campaign trail that he has known several people who have had substance abuse issues and he is going to try and help those who are addicted while trying to convince teens to not take drugs.\n\nClinton champions treating mental health on the same footing as physical health. Her website outlines her plans for treating addiction, which includes implementing preventive programs for teens at the community level; treating substance use disorders as chronic diseases; putting naloxone, the opioid overdose drug, into the hands of first responders; requiring licensed prescribers to consult a prescription drug monitoring program before writing scripts for controlled medications; and instituting criminal justice reform for non-violent drug offenses.\n\nSanders\u2019 website states, \u201cWe must make sure that mental health services are available to all Americans regardless of income.\u201d Generally, he supports treating mental health disorders on par with physical health disorders. His Obamacare provision increased support for community health centers, which provide affordable mental health counseling, while he also introduced the American Health Security Act of 2013, which seeks to provide inpatient services, long-term care, and a broad range of services for mental illness.\n\nVote Reuters\n\nRight To Die\n\nCalifornia\u2019s End of Life Option Act, which takes effect on June 9, allows physicians to administer life-ending drugs without risking prosecution. California joins Oregon, Washington, Vermont, Montana, and New Mexico, as the sixth state permitting physician-assisted suicide. This issue may be poised for national examination.\n\nIn 2008, TalkLeft reported Clinton saying, \u201cI believe it\u2019s within the province of the states to make that decision\u2026 with appropriate safeguards and informed decision-making, I think it\u2019s an appropriate right to have.\u201d More recently, in CNN\u2019s Democratic town hall debate in New Hampshire, Clinton was asked a question by an advocate for physician-assisted suicide, who referred to a \u201cpersonal choice that people may make\u201d to \u201chelp enhance their end of life with dignity,\u201d reports STAT. The medical publication summarized Clinton\u2019s response as she believes the topic to be important but she doesn\u2019t know enough yet to comment on it.\n\nSanders told a forum hosted by the Leadership Council of Aging Organization that terminally ill patients who are suffering and want to die \u201chave the right to make that decision for themselves.\u201d Noting that it\u2019s important to be extremely careful in how these decisions are made, Sanders said a suffering person who is going to die shortly has the right to make that decision for themselves.\n\nScanning the net, it appears Trump has not yet made any statements on euthanasia.\n\nVeterans\n\nAll three candidates specifically outline plans for veterans, addressing health and other needs in detail, on their campaign sites.\n\nTrump favors caring for \u201cthe whole veteran, not just their physical health.\u201d He supports increased funding for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury, and suicide prevention services. He also hopes to transform the Veterans Administration (VA) to meet the needs of 21st century service members, which includes better services for women veterans. Trump wants to equip every VA hospital in the country with OB-GYN and other women\u2019s health services.\n\nSanders believes the nation has a \u201cmoral obligation to provide the best quality care to those who have put their lives on the line to defend us.\u201d In honoring that obligation, Sanders says he will fully fund and expand the VA while simultaneously improving, substantially, the processing of Veterans\u2019 claims for compensation. He hopes to also expand the VA\u2019s Caregivers Program and mental health services, while making available comprehensive dental care to all veterans.\n\nFinally, Clinton\u2019s presidential agenda includes fundamentally reforming veterans\u2019 health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care. While blocking any efforts to privatize the VA, she hopes to modernize veterans\u2019 benefits by streamlining and simplifying the process of applying and gaining benefits. She also hopes to create a veteran-centric model of excellence at the VA. Clinton states \u201c\"I believe in making sure that people who sacrifice for us are given all the care and the benefits and support that they need.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hillary clinton, donald trump, bernie sanders, alzheimer's disease, gmos, mental health, marijuana, veterans, euthanasia, prescription drug prices, 2016 election", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This is what Clinton, Sanders, and Trump have said about veterans' benefits, Alzheimer's disease, mental health, marijuana, and other health issues.", "title": "One Of These Health Issues Could Decide The 2016 Election", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/2016-election-health-issues-presidential-candidates-386141", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/05/13/vote.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This is what Clinton, Sanders, and Trump have said about veterans' benefits, Alzheimer's disease, mental health, marijuana, and other health issues.", "title": "One Of These Health Issues Could Decide The 2016 Election", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/2016-election-health-issues-presidential-candidates-386141", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/05/13/vote.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/05/13/vote.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2016-05-16T09:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-17T13:45:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This is what Clinton, Sanders, and Trump have said about veterans' benefits, Alzheimer's disease, mental health, marijuana, and other health issues."}, "article_summary": "Mental Health CareAs part of his plan to overhaul health care, Trump suggests reforming mental health programs and institutions in this country.\nFinally, Clinton\u2019s presidential agenda includes fundamentally reforming veterans\u2019 health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care.\nSanders\u2019 website states, \u201cWe must make sure that mental health services are available to all Americans regardless of income.\u201d Generally, he supports treating mental health disorders on par with physical health disorders.\nClinton champions treating mental health on the same footing as physical health.\nHe hopes to also expand the VA\u2019s Caregivers Program and mental health services, while making available comprehensive dental care to all veterans."}
