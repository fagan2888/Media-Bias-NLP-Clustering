But it won\u2019t be for the better everywhere.\n\nThe warming, called an El Ni\u00f1o, is expected to lead to fewer Atlantic hurricanes and more rain next winter for drought-stricken California and Southern states, and even a milder winter for the nation\u2019s frigid northern tier next year, meteorologists say.\n\nAlthough it could be good news to lessen the southwestern U.S. drought and shrink heating bills next winter in the far north, \u201cworldwide it can be quite a different story,\u201d said North Carolina State University atmospheric sciences professor Ken Kunkel. \u201cSome areas benefit. Some don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nGlobally, it can mean an even hotter year coming up and billions of dollars in losses for food crops.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday issued an official El Ni\u00f1o watch.\n\nMike Halpert, acting director of NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center, said the El Ni\u00f1o warming should develop by this summer, but there are no guarantees. Although early signs are appearing a few hundred feet below the ocean surface, meteorologists say an El Ni\u00f1o started to brew in 2012 and then shut down suddenly and unexpectedly.\n\nKevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who wasn\u2019t part of NOAA\u2019s forecast, agreed that an El Ni\u00f1o is brewing.\n\n\u201cThis could be a substantial event, and I think we\u2019re due,\u201d Trenberth said. \u201cAnd I think it could have major consequences.\u201d\n\nHalpert said it is too early to say how strong this El Ni\u00f1o will be. The last four have been weak or moderate, and those have fewer effects on weather.\n\nScientific studies have tied El Ni\u00f1os to farming and fishing problems and to upticks in insect-born disease, such as malaria. Commodity traders even track El Ni\u00f1o cycles. A study by Texas A&M University economics professor Bruce McCarl found the last big El Ni\u00f1o of 1997-98 cost about $3 billion in agricultural damage.\n\nTrenberth said this El Ni\u00f1o might even push the globe out of a decade-long slowdown in temperature increase, \u201cso suddenly global warming kicks into a whole new level.\u201d\n\nExplaining El Ni\u00f1o\n\nAn El Ni\u00f1o is a warming of the central Pacific once every few years, from a combination of wind and waves in the tropics. It shakes up climate around the world, changing rain and temperature patterns. The flip side of El Ni\u00f1o is La Ni\u00f1a, which has a general cooling effect. It has been much more frequent than El Ni\u00f1os lately, with five La Ni\u00f1as and two small-to-moderate El Ni\u00f1os in the past nine years. The last big El Ni\u00f1o was 1997-98.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "El Nino may be on way for summer, meteorologists say", "title": "El Nino may be on way for summer, meteorologists say", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/06/el-nino-may-be-on-way-for-summer-meteorologists-say/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140307_033827_USA-Weather.jpg", "height": 520}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140307_033827_USA-Weather.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-06T19:29:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:09:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5b0\"", "article_summary": "It has been much more frequent than El Ni\u00f1os lately, with five La Ni\u00f1as and two small-to-moderate El Ni\u00f1os in the past nine years.\nMike Halpert, acting director of NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center, said the El Ni\u00f1o warming should develop by this summer, but there are no guarantees.\nScientific studies have tied El Ni\u00f1os to farming and fishing problems and to upticks in insect-born disease, such as malaria.\nThe flip side of El Ni\u00f1o is La Ni\u00f1a, which has a general cooling effect.\nAlthough early signs are appearing a few hundred feet below the ocean surface, meteorologists say an El Ni\u00f1o started to brew in 2012 and then shut down suddenly and unexpectedly."}
