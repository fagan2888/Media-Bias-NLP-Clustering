Dan Coats (R-IN) took to the Senate floor to give his weekly speech on government waste, lambasting the National Science Foundation for dishing out a $331,000 grant to study \u201changer.\u201d\n\n\"Now I am told by my younger staff that there's a new word around called 'hangry.' I didn't know what that was. But hangry, as we've looked into this, means that if you are hungry, you tend to get a little bit disjointed and you're more angry than you were if you're not hungry,\u201d said Coats, chair of the U.S. Joint Economic Committee.\n\nHow did the NSF-funded study look at the issue? Well, in 2014 researchers at Ohio State gave voodoo dolls to married couples and recorded how many times they stuck the figures with pins relative to their blood sugar levels.\n\nRelated: Solar-Powered Beer? 8 Ridiculous Ways the Government Wastes Your Money\n\n\"After three years study and $331,000 spent, yup, we proved it.

And the rabbits that received the massages were eventually euthanized.\n\nWhile the examples Coats used are amusing, they lose a little of their humor when you remember that the national debt is creeping past $19 trillion.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "We\u2019ve all been there.
