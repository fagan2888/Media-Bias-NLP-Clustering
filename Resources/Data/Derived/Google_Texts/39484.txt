Louisiana residents have until Dec. 15 to enroll for health insurance through the federal Affordable Care Act. That's the last day to sign up for coverage that begins Jan. 1.

Much like last year, there is a surge of interest in the final days before the enrollment period ends. Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told The News-Star on Monroe that the agency's call center received more than 1 million calls in the past week.

In Louisiana, plan selection numbers have surpassed those of last year. As of Dec. 5, there were 60,902 selections made before the last week of open enrollment. In 2014, 56,651 consumers chose a plan on the Dec. 15 deadline.
