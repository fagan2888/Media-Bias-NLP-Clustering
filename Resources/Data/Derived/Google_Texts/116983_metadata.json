In Montana, Intermountain Planned Parenthood, Inc., DBA Planned Parenthood, received $337,555.\n\nIn response to the award to affiliates of Planned Parenthood, which is currently in the midst of several congressional investigations for its organ harvesting practices, Rep. Diane Black, author of the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015, said that granting further funds to the abortion business is \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cA growing body of evidence suggests that Planned Parenthood broke federal law and now the Obama Administration is thumbing its nose at Congress and taxpayers by using this backdoor maneuver to boost funding for the scandal-ridden abortion giant,\u201d Black said in a press statement. \u201cThis is all the more reason for the House to immediately pass my legislation, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, which would freeze all federal funding to the organization \u2013 including navigator grants.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said in the past, the best time to act on this bill was before the start of the August district work period, but better late than never,\u201d she added. \u201cThe American people expect a bold response to the atrocities at Planned Parenthood and it\u2019s time Congress delivered.\u201d\n\nAwards totaling $67 million have been granted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2014to various organizations and groups, reports the agency.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of choices when it comes to signing up for health insurance and we want to help make sure consumers feel confident that they\u2019ve picked the right plan,\u201d said Kevin Counihan, CEO of the Health Insurance Marketplaces. \u201cIn person assistance from Navigators and assisters has proven to be an incredibly important avenue for consumers to get the right coverage. I\u2019m pleased that Navigators and assisters will be available in even more geographic areas this year.\u201d\n\nThe navigator grants are awarded for a three-year period, and CMS states this year\u2019s grantees \u201cwill expand access to local help in many states.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than $1 million in \u201cnavigator\u201dgrants were awarded to Planned Parenthood affiliates for efforts to help sign people up for Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "More than $1 million in \u201cnavigator\u201dgrants were awarded to Planned Parenthood affiliates for efforts to help sign people up for Obamacare.", "title": "Obamacare \u2018Navigator\u2019 Grants Awarded to Planned Parenthood", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Obamacare-Supreme-Court-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/02/obama-administration-awards-obamacare-navigator-grants-to-planned-parenthood/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than $1 million in \u201cnavigator\u201dgrants were awarded to Planned Parenthood affiliates for efforts to help sign people up for Obamacare.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Obamacare-Supreme-Court-AP.jpg", "title": "Obamacare \u2018Navigator\u2019 Grants Awarded to Planned Parenthood", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, criminal investigation of Planned Parenthood, defund Planned Parenthood, Department of Health and Human Services, Human Organ Trafficking, Navigator grants, Obama administration, Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood videos, Rep.
