He has no set ideological principles (he was once a labor-friendly, pro-choice moderate, for example) and despite having been in Congress for some three decades, no legislation of real significance bears his name. To all appearances, he is exactly the kind of nakedly ambitious cipher that our society rewards but that we the people claim to hate. I would, generally speaking, rather write about someone else.\n\nBut the depressing-yet-undeniable truth is that, besides President Barack Obama and Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, no individual has made a greater mark on the U.S. government over the last six years than Sen. Mitch McConnell. He is the godfather of the obstruction \u00fcber alles strategy that the Republican Party implemented \u2014 mostly successfully \u2014 from 2009 to 2015; and he is the party leader most responsible for the GOP retaking control of the Senate despite refusing to moderate even a tiny bit. And did I mention that he\u2019s a leader of the war on campaign finance regulation, too?\n\nSo when the Hill reports, as it did this week, that McConnell\u2019s next goal is to persuade the media and the American people that Congress has been more productive with him running the Senate than it was under the Democrats and Sen. Harry Reid, you should pay attention. And when mainstream, influential and ostensibly left-of-center outlets like Vox report that, after years of dysfunction and gridlock, Washington is finally \u201cworking,\u201d you should be concerned. Because there\u2019s an important lesson here \u2014 one learned through painful experience \u2014 and it\u2019s not the one McConnell (or Vox) thinks.\n\nThat lesson, simply put, is as follows: The wheels of government are not once again spinning because McConnell has qualities of leadership and vision that his Democratic predecessor Reid lacked. On the contrary, Washington is working \u2014 relatively speaking \u2014 because McConnell and his party, which now controls Congress as well as the Supreme Court, is no longer forcing it to stop. And it\u2019s vital we recognize the difference, or the next Democratic administration will be incapacitated by the McConnell strategy just as the current president was.\n\nIn fairness, that\u2019s not entirely the truth. There is a scenario wherein the conventional wisdom in Washington, and within the political class more generally, could ignore the true nature of McConnell\u2019s maneuvers without disallowing an effective Democratic president. But it\u2019s one in which that president would have to govern with an agenda much like the one Obama\u2019s pushing today with his focus on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, a tax holiday for corporations who \u201conshore\u201d their \u201coffshore\u201d profits, the reauthorization of the failed No Child Left Behind act, and the Medicare \u201cdoc fix\u201d that made sure America\u2019s doctors would never have to worry about a pay cut again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Now that the GOP's in control, Mitch McConnell is letting some things pass \u2014 and taking all the credit", "title": "\u201cA corrupt, unresponsive and plutocratic disaster\u201d: How Mitch McConnell and the GOP remade Washington in their image", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Now that the GOP's in control, Mitch McConnell is letting some things pass \u2014 and taking all the credit", "title": "\u201cA corrupt, unresponsive and plutocratic disaster\u201d: How Mitch McConnell and the GOP remade Washington in their image", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/25/a_corrupt_unresponsive_and_plutocratic_disaster_how_mitch_mcconnell_and_the_gop_remade_washington_in_their_image/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/cruz_mcconnell2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Now that the GOP's in control, Mitch McConnell is letting some things pass \u2014 and taking all the credit", "title": "\u201cA corrupt, unresponsive and plutocratic disaster\u201d: How Mitch McConnell and the GOP remade Washington in their image", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/cruz_mcconnell2.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1 percent, Affordable Care Act, Anthony Kennedy, Barack Obama, constitution, Editor's Picks, Inequality, Mitch McConnell, No Child Left Behind, parental leave, Ted Cruz, Trans-Pacific Partnership", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4c5\"", "article_summary": "There is a scenario wherein the conventional wisdom in Washington, and within the political class more generally, could ignore the true nature of McConnell\u2019s maneuvers without disallowing an effective Democratic president.\nBecause there\u2019s an important lesson here \u2014 one learned through painful experience \u2014 and it\u2019s not the one McConnell (or Vox) thinks.\nBut the depressing-yet-undeniable truth is that, besides President Barack Obama and Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, no individual has made a greater mark on the U.S. government over the last six years than Sen.
