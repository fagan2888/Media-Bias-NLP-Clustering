Only 8 percent of the small stop-loss plans with individual coverage had attachment points under $50,000.

Consultants at PricewaterhouseCoopers have found no evidence of small and midsize employers using stop-loss coverage as high-deductible major medical coverage. The consultants surveyed more than 1,000 U.S. employers of all sizes for a report on health benefits trends.

About 60 percent of the participating employers are self-insuring this year. Some health policymakers have predicted that small employers will try to use self-insured plans and stop-loss arrangements with low "attachment points," or deductibles, to get around the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) mandates that apply to insured group plans but not to self-insured plans.
