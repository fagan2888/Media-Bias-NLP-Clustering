The majority of his customers get equipment delivered.\n\nThe company, which works mostly through people\u2019s medical insurance, is pulled both by the cost of its medical supplies and by the reimbursements it receives from insurance companies for supplying them to people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fixed to what Medicare pays, if we want to be what\u2019s called a \u2018participating provider,\u2019\u201d said Stutznegger, who estimates that a third of his customer base is Medicare recipients. Another third comes from Medicaid, which can provide even lower reimbursements, and the remainder comes through private insurance and on-the-spot payment.\n\nStutznegger says there are both good and bad results for his business from the Affordable Care Act, which allowed millions more Americans access healthcare but has sharply divided the country. More insured people can mean more customers, but Stutznegger said the law has also meant lower reimbursements. As a result, he\u2019s had to stop carrying certain items.\n\nJoint Commission\n\nPacific Coast Medical Supply recently earned The Joint Commission\u2019s Gold Seal of Approval for accreditation by demonstrating compliance with its national standards for health care quality and safety in home care.\n\nIt underwent a rigorous, unannounced, on-site survey Aug. 26 and 27. A team of Joint Commission surveyors evaluated Pacific Coast for compliance with standards of care specific to the needs of patients, including infection prevention and control, leadership and medication management pertaining to oxygen and medical gases.\n\n\u201cWith Joint Commission accreditation, we are making a significant investment in quality on a day-to-day basis from the top down,\u201d said Stutznegger. \u201cJoint Commission accreditation provides us a framework to take our organization to the next level and helps create a culture of excellence.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Pacific Coast Medical Supply, visit www.pacificcoastmedical.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Astorian", "description": "After 17 years at the corner of 12th Street and Marine Drive, Pacific Coast Medical Supply moves early next month ... 1 1/2 blocks west.President and CEO Norm Stutznegger, a former paramedic and employee of a larger medical supply company, said he saw a chance to stay downtown and save money with a", "title": "Medical supply store moves, just barely", "url": "http://www.dailyastorian.com/local_biz/20141120/medical-supply-store-moves-just-barely", "image": "http://www.dailyastorian.com/storyimage/DA/20141120/ARTICLE/141129999/AR/0/AR-141129999.jpg&MaxW=600", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyAstorian"}, "description": "Read Medical supply store moves, just barely from The Daily Astorian", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ee4\"", "article_summary": "Pacific Coast Medical Supply soon moves ... a block and a half down Marine Drive.\nBuy this photoAfter 17 years at the corner of 12th Street and Marine Drive, Pacific Coast Medical Supply moves early next month ... 1 1/2 blocks west.\nBuy this photo EDWARD STRATTON \u2014 The Daily Astorian Pacific Coast Medical Supply moves into the former Astoria Hemp Works at 1062 Marine Drive early next month.\nBuy this photo Submitted photos Pacific Coast Medical Supply opened in January 1998 at the corner of 12th Street and Marine Drive.\nEDWARD STRATTON \u2014 The Daily Astorian Norm Stutznegger owns Pacific Coast Medical Supply, which moves from 12th Street and Marine Drive 1 1/2 blocks west early next month."}
