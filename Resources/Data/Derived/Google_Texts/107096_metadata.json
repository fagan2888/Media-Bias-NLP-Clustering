What health coverage is available for me?\u201d \u2014 is \u201cWill patients be able to keep their same doctor when they purchase health insurance through Covered California?\u201c\n\nThe question may be last on Covered California\u2019s list, but it\u2019s top-of-mind for many consumers. About one million Californians, and millions of other Americans, are losing their health plans through the individual market and turning to Obamacare\u2019s new insurance exchanges to shop for replacement coverage. And in many cases, it\u2019s still unclear if the family doctor will be coming with them.\n\nThe Mechanics Behind Narrow Networks\n\nThis issue began to emerge back in May when Covered California announced its low premiums to some fanfare \u2014 a \u201chome run\u201d for the state, officials said at the time.\n\nBut some critics seized on news that participating insurers had achieved those lower costs, in part, by relying on narrow networks that excluded UCLA Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center \u2014 two of the state\u2019s most prominent, if expensive, hospitals.\n\nSimilar stories followed in other states, as exchanges released their rates and participating health care providers.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be narrow,\u201d one Missouri insurance broker told Kaiser Health News after one local briefing. But the actual list of participating hospitals \u201cwas kind of eye-opening.\u201d\n\nThe issue plays directly to one of the biggest fears sparked by the Affordable Care Act: The law will limit patient choice. But supporters say that\u2019s not the case.\n\n\u201cNarrow networks may seem like a bad idea,\u201d David Dranove and Craig Garthwaite blogged last month. The two Northwestern University professors acknowledged that excluding some providers from health plans offered through the exchanges runs the risk of disrupting care patterns.\n\nBut the model is \u201cnot some cruel attempt to limit patient choice foisted upon us by the insurance industry,\u201d the professors added. \u201cInstead, these plans may provide our best opportunity for harnessing market forces to lower prices.\u201d\n\nThe simple equation: Insurers say that limiting the size of the network allows them to steer patients to high-quality facilities and doctors; participating providers, meanwhile, may agree to price cuts in exchange for new volumes. (A previous edition of \u201cRoad to Reform\u201d took a closer look at the narrow network model.)\n\nAnd narrow networks aren\u2019t necessarily a new idea, Darius Tahir points out at National Journal. In some ways, it\u2019s the same concept behind payers\u2019 attempts in the 1980s and 1990s to limit their network size, which met with criticism and helped create Any Willing Provider laws.\n\nCould narrow networks be better perceived \u2014 and received \u2014 with better phrasing? Industry consultant Vince Kuraitis thinks so.\n\n\u201cThe very term \u2018narrow network\u2019 creates a negative connotation and doesn\u2019t speak to potential benefits,\u201d Kuraitis comments at The Health Care Blog. But choosing to describe \u201cthe same networks as \u2018high-performance networks\u2019 or \u2018intelligent networks\u2019\u2026 [t]he connotations here are much more positive.\u201d\n\nDo Providers Want In? It\u2019s Complicated.\n\nSome hospitals \u2014 initially left out of exchange plans \u2014 are fighting to be included.\n\nSeattle Children\u2019s Hospital sued the state insurance commissioner, which helped begin a battle with a local insurer over whether the facility\u2019s rates are too high.\n\nEleven Kentucky hospitals have filed complaints; so far, the department has ordered Anthem to accept applications from three of those hospitals.\n\n(At Kaiser Health News, Jay Hancock has an in-depth look at the battles between state officials, providers and payers over the emerging networks.)\n\nBut not all providers want to be a part of the exchange plans. Some doctors are sitting out, citing low reimbursement.\n\nPresented with contracts that paid up to 30% less than traditional rates, \u201cwe said, this doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense for us,\u201d Richard Thorp, president of the California Medical Association told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd hospitals also are wary of participating, with many top facilities choosing to opt out of exchange plans.\n\nWhy? In part, prominent providers\u2019 doubts echo the concerns of Aetna, Cigna and other insurers that pulled out of the exchanges: The startup uncertainty and potential patient population aren\u2019t worth the risk in year one.\n\nBut hospital executives also are fearful that agreeing to price concessions to play on the exchanges will hamper their efforts to bargain in the future.\n\n\u201c[O]nce you\u2019ve agreed to low rates for one company, how do you ever negotiate for more with that company or any other company?\u201d Michael Green, CEO of Concord Hospital, wrote in an op-ed explaining why his hospital wouldn\u2019t participate in New Hampshire\u2019s exchange.\n\n\u201cIf the insurers decide to move small groups along with individual to the exchange, you could find that you\u2019ve put your organization in financial peril,\u201d Green wrote.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nEvery indication is that the narrow network model will become the standard.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything about this trend that is limited to the exchange market,\u201d Sara Rosenbaum, a health policy professor at George Washington University, told Modern Healthcare.\n\nBut in the meantime, the provider fights \u2014 and still-troubled websites \u2014 mean that there\u2019s considerable confusion over which doctors and hospitals will be included in which plans next year.\n\nOn Covered California\u2019s website, the FAQ encourages consumers to check directories available on the site to see if their doctor is listed. But one practical challenge: That provider directory has been glitchy. Another: Providers may end up negotiating \u201cright up to the Jan. 1, 2014 starting date,\u201d Phil Daigle of California Health Benefit Advisers writes.\n\nMeanwhile, the dust-up over Covered California\u2019s hospitals is a sign of how quickly things can change \u2014 and perhaps the lingering resistance to narrow networks, too.\n\nAfter this summer\u2019s fuss, officials eventually ensured that Cedars-Sinai is now available through a few plans on the state\u2019s exchange. And so is UCLA, which announced the news with a banner ad: \u201cCovered California now offers a choice U know.\u201d\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what else is making news as the nation continues to race down the road to reform.\n\nIt will take both parties to save Obamacare: Austin Frakt writes at Bloomberg View about how bipartisan cooperation could allow Republicans to tweak the ACA to achieve their own policy goals.\n\nCovered California\u2019s hidden costs: ProPublica\u2019s Charles Ornstein calls attention to the rate hikes awaiting many customers who won\u2019t receive subsidies when shopping through the exchange.\n\nHow will we know the Obamacare site is fixed? National Journal\u2018s Sam Baker reviews the indicators to watch this week and in the days to come.\n\nAnother look at the technical challenges, and failures, behind the ACA\u2019s websites: New York University professor Clay Shirky details the challenges in trying to make an ambitious web goal, like healthcare.gov, into a reality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many health plans on Covered California and other insurance exchanges exclude some prominent doctors and hospitals.
