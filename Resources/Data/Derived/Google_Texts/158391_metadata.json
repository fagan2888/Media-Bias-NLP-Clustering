We\u2019re in the downhill slide of the session with only two weeks remaining, and possibly less depending on how the budget negotiations develop.\n\nThe annual budget consists of numerous bills that will create new revenue or savings. We\u2019ve approved several bills on the floor and in the Senate Joint Committee on Appropriations and Budget. I\u2019d like to mention some of those.\n\nLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us. So far we have not found one.

These will reform various tax credits and incentive programs.\n\nSB 1579 instructs the Oklahoma Tax Commission to step up enforcement efforts through the use of technologies to audit sales and use tax reporting. This is expected to generate approximately $35.8 million for the GRF and $2 million for the HB 1017 Fund for education.\n\nSB 1580 modifies the amount of credits allocated annually for investment in affordable housing projects. It\u2019s estimated to generate $900,000.\n\nSB 1581 limits the amount of tax credits for investment in clean-burning motor fuel equipment. The reform is expected to generate $5.773 million.\n\nSB 1582 is estimated to create $14.049 million by limiting tax credits for investment in depreciable property or net increase in employees.\n\nHB 3204 will reduce a tax credit for railroad construction to generate $136,000.\n\nHB 3205 would reduce the time period for filing a sales tax refund claim from three years to one year total generating $8.781 million.\n\nHB 3206 would authorize OMES to certify any funds remaining in the Cash Flow Reserve Fund in December as available for transfer and appropriation. This measure would yield $125 million for the GRF.\n\nOn Thursday, we also approved SB 1577, which will save the state $133 million next year. The bill will eliminate a tax rebate for economically at-risk wells for any oil and gas production that took place after 2014. The cost of the tax rebate has increased significantly as oil prices have plunged in the last year.\n\nSometimes the legislature passes bills that were originally created for a good purpose but then as time goes by and circumstances change unexpectedly that same bill can have negative unforeseen affects. This rebate is a prime example. The rebate was originally created to help smaller producers continue to operate older, unprofitable wells but as the energy sector has tumbled, several newer, more expensive horizontal wells have become unprofitable and eligible for the tax credit. This wasn\u2019t the legislature\u2019s original intent.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is a volatile industry with extreme swings and companies need to plan for those difficult lows. It\u2019s not the legislature\u2019s responsibility to bail out companies during hard times especially when, as a state, we\u2019re facing the worst budget shortfall in state history.\n\nGetting rid of this tax credit will provide desperately-needed funds for our education, public safety, transportation and health care among others.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said before, the Senate is considering every responsible option to address the revenue shortfall. We\u2019re having to make some tough decisions but we have to do what\u2019s necessary to protect vital state services.\n\nIn closing, I was pleased that the Governor signed HB 2616, of which I\u2019m the principal Senate author for, on Monday. The new law went into effect upon her signature. It modifies the Oklahoma Telecommunications Act to reflect advances in technology and modernizes how schools, hospitals, career techs and libraries apply for money for high speed internet services through the Oklahoma Universal Service Fund (OUSF).", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Skiatook Journal", "description": "Another week in the books.
