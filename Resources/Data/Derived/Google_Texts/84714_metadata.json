Someday. But not today.\n\nThe plot involves illegals crossing the border and being met by a group known as the \u201cSons of the Serpent,\u201d who read like a cross between the Minutemen, a militia, and the Klan. Here\u2019s the \u201cSupreme Serpent\u201d addressing the immigrants. Gotta hand it to Marvel: Their writers have really mastered what natural, everyday speech sounds like.\n\n\u201cUntil the mighty wall is built, you come here for employment that is rightfully ours! And if denied it, you seek welfare paid for by our tax dollars!\u201d he bellows. \u201cAlso, you know how you make me press one for English at the beginning of every call to my satellite provider? That is something I cannot abide!\u201d he says in the next frame. Wilson, now dressed as Captain America, enters the scene, telling the Supreme Commander, \u201cif you\u2019re done threatening a bunch of unarmed folks, mostly women and children\u2026I\u2019d pack up the pickup and head home if I were you, gentlemen.\u201d Accompanied by his bird-of-prey partner, Captain America springs to action, attacking the Sons of the Serpent.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to make of that line about having to press one for English. Presumably it\u2019s a goof on how supposedly petty the grievances of border hawks are, but the effect here (without having seen the full context) is to make the Serpents seem ridiculous and less threatening. That\u2019s something you\u2019d hear in a Key & Peele sketch on this subject, not from an archvillain whom Captain America\u2019s about to smash in the face. It would have made for better, more morally ambiguous drama to have Cap caught between illegals and garden-variety strong-borders protesters, like laid-off workers, rather than a white-supremacist outfit like the Serpents, but I suppose the needs of this particular form of propaganda require the least sympathetic villain possible. If the point is to get the reader cheering as Cap cracks heads, making his nemesis a violent racist is an obvious move. Or am I assuming too much in thinking the people who wrote this see a meaningful difference between the Klan and amnesty opponents to begin with? Either way, it\u2019s a nice bit of trolling to make a racist group the face of resistance to open borders, knowing that not only will this create a media controversy but that some righties will inevitably take a \u201cgo Serpents!\u201d line in their reaction. Heightening the contradictions by making all criticism of illegal immigration racist is a shrewd way to lead undecideds towards siding with the open-borders crowd. But then, the left\u2019s known that for decades.\n\nAs for Cap, he remains the go-to superhero in recent years for tedious liberal propaganda, for obvious reasons. During the Bush era, when the left was still pretending to care deeply about government surveillance and civil liberties, he led the resistance to a new law that would require superheroes to register their true identities with the government. A few years later, after dawn had broken and America had elected a new progressive president, Captain America turned his attention to the scourge of tea partiers. Now he\u2019s got border hawks in the crosshairs. I wonder how many anti-government storylines Marvel has on the shelf from last decade that are all set to be dusted off in 2017 if Hillary can\u2019t seal the deal next fall.\n\nAnd if she can, presumably Captain America will be recast as a woman to celebrate Our New Leader\u2019s ascension. You know, like Thor was. Exit question: When is Superman finally going to be deported, anyway?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Captain Mexico?", "title": "Good news: Captain America supports amnesty", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/10/16/confirmed-captain-america-supports-amnesty/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-16T18:41:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-16T18:00:20+00:00"}, "keywords": "amnesty, captain america, illegal, immigrants, Marvel, open borders, serpent,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "And if she can, presumably Captain America will be recast as a woman to celebrate Our New Leader\u2019s ascension.\nA few years later, after dawn had broken and America had elected a new progressive president, Captain America turned his attention to the scourge of tea partiers.\nWilson, now dressed as Captain America, enters the scene, telling the Supreme Commander, \u201cif you\u2019re done threatening a bunch of unarmed folks, mostly women and children\u2026I\u2019d pack up the pickup and head home if I were you, gentlemen.\u201d Accompanied by his bird-of-prey partner, Captain America springs to action, attacking the Sons of the Serpent.\n\u201cAlso, you know how you make me press one for English at the beginning of every call to my satellite provider?\nGotta hand it to Marvel: Their writers have really mastered what natural, everyday speech sounds like."}
