What\u2019s striking is how similar these well-rehearsed lines are to the entrenched positions each side adopted in the U.S. debate over Obamacare.\n\nIf there is a lesson to apply to our CPP debate, it\u2019s that the Affordable Care Act \u2013 Obamacare \u2013 worked better on paper than it\u2019s proving to work in practice. While it may achieve some of its goals by covering a portion of the uninsured, it will come with major disruptions and costs in the health insurance market.\n\nA CPP expansion may not match Obamacare in scale, but it would constitute a massive realignment of Canada\u2019s pension system in both the public and private sectors. It would reshape employee compensation and create winners and losers.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to clarify what a CPP expansion would not do. It would not, as Mr. Sousa seems to think, reduce poverty among seniors. Failure to expand the CPP, the Ontario Finance Minister said last month, would \u201ccost the system \u2013 in this case the provinces \u2013 a lot more money on social assistance programs to support these people in need at retirement.\u201d\n\nReducing the 7.2-per-cent poverty rate among seniors would likely require an increase in federal Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplement benefits. Poor seniors who qualify for the GIS are not eligible for CPP benefits at all because they never contributed to the plan. None of the current proposals to expand the CPP would change this.\n\nIf a CPP expansion is on the table at all, it is to address the apparent failure of middle-class Canadians without workplace pension plans to save enough to maintain their current standard of living when they retire. They don\u2019t face poverty, as Mr. Sousa and others suggest, but a sharp drop in income that would reverberate throughout the economy by reducing consumer spending.\n\nA mandatory expansion of the CPP might help this group. But what would it mean for Canadians who already have employer-sponsored pension plans? Would it hasten the demise of such plans? And would that result in such workers having to contribute a lot more than they do now?\n\nProvincial governments might be big winners since benefits from a Big CPP (funded equally by employers and employees) would partially replace those that are now disproportionately funded by employer contributions to provincial public-service pension plans. (This might partly explain cash-strapped Ontario\u2019s enthusiasm for a Big CPP.)\n\nAn expanded CPP would also result in a massive transfer of wealth from private pension plans to a mega-sized public one. Is that kind of concentration what we want? This newspaper has called the CPP \u201cone of the country\u2019s great public policy successes.\u201d But it was not always thus. The current 9.9-per-cent contribution rate is the inflated price post-baby-boomer Canadians are paying for the CPP\u2019s gross mismanagement until 1997. Can we risk that again?\n\nThe only way to avoid further burdening future generations is to ensure that contribution rates for a Big CPP are high enough from the outset to fund benefits that won\u2019t start kicking in for at least two decades. The sticker shock will likely be much higher than proponents of a Big CPP suggest, given demographic trends and declining real rates of return on pension investments.\n\nLike Obamacare, a Big CPP might look good on paper. It might not be so pretty in practice.\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.333", "description": "The sticker shock will likely be much higher than proponents suggest", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "The sticker shock will likely be much higher than proponents suggest", "title": "Is CPP becoming Canada\u2019s Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/is-cpp-becoming-canadas-obamacare/article15804281/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/c77/incoming/article8985125.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/web-yakabuski.JPG", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/15804281", "iphone": "tgam://article/15804281"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "description": "The sticker shock will likely be much higher than proponents suggest", "account_id": 1512948019, "card": "app", "site": "@globeandmail"}, "robots": "noarchive", "last-modified": "2013-12-09 06:00:00 EST", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "Kathleen Wynne;Charles Sousa;Canada Pension Plan;cpp;pension plans;public-service pension plans;Ontario;Canada;United States of America;senior citizens;retirement savings;ceconomy;Konrad Yakabuski;politics column", "article": {"engagement": "true", "type": "column", "id": 15804281, "comments": "false", "pages": 1}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd43df\"", "article_summary": "A CPP expansion may not match Obamacare in scale, but it would constitute a massive realignment of Canada\u2019s pension system in both the public and private sectors.\nLike Obamacare, a Big CPP might look good on paper.\nPoor seniors who qualify for the GIS are not eligible for CPP benefits at all because they never contributed to the plan.\nFirst, it\u2019s important to clarify what a CPP expansion would not do.\n(This might partly explain cash-strapped Ontario\u2019s enthusiasm for a Big CPP.)"}
