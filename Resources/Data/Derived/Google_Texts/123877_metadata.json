The festival, which drew about 15,000 in its first year, has grown more diverse. She said it has met her goal of bringing attention to Colorado\u2019s robust Asian communities.\n\n\u201cI just felt like this is a dream come true,\u201d she said of the swelling crowds each year. \u201cI want to do this and I want to do it well.\u201d\n\nAside from the main event \u2014 the races \u2014 crowds were treated to performances, cultural exhibits and plenty of food. Cuisine ranged from an extremely popular Korean barbecue stand to more traditional American favorites such as hot dogs and deep-fried Oreos.\n\nFor a young couple from China, the Denver festival was their first time seeing dragon boat racing live. Yongbin Zhuang and his wife, Yue Jing, both 29, sat in the shade of a tree overlooking the lake. Originally from a province in northern China, they had seen the sport only on television until Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe performances are really good,\u201d said Zhuang, who is earning his Ph.D. in biology in South Dakota but living in Denver this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nJack Greene, 21, and Scott Yanagihara, 48, were competing at the festival for CH2M, an Englewood-based engineering firm.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, racing in the boats is fun,\u201d said Yanagihara, the team captain who was participating for the seventh time.\n\nBut the benefits of the festival go well beyond fun, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very inclusive, promoting not just Asian culture,\u201d he said. \u201cIt promotes an understanding and develops relationships\u201d between the co-workers-turned-boatmates.\n\n\u201cIt was like something I\u2019ve never done before,\u201d said Greene, an intern with the firm. \u201cIt is a great experience. I\u2019m happy to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nThe festival also drew about 100 participants on teams with Adaptive Adventures, a nonprofit that organizes outdoor activities for children, adults and veterans with physical and other disabilities. The group first sent a team of 22 in 2014 and ended up on the medal stand, according to Chris Wiegand of Adaptive Adventures.\n\nThe festival concludes at 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nMatthew Nussbaum: 303-954-1666, mnussbaum@denverpost.com or twitter.com/MatthewNussbaum", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "15th annual Colorado Dragon Boat Festival thrills big crowds", "title": "15th annual Colorado Dragon Boat Festival thrills big crowds", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/18/15th-annual-colorado-dragon-boat-festival-thrills-big-crowds/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150718_020328_colorado-dragon-boat-festival.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150718_020328_colorado-dragon-boat-festival.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-18T14:02:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T22:53:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4009\"", "article_summary": "The two-day festival at Sloan\u2019s Lake is expected to draw 150,000 guests with more than 70 dragon boat teams competing.\nThe Colorado Dragon Boat Festival, an annual celebration of the state\u2019s Asian communities, kicked off Saturday with big crowds, colorful performances and food from around the world.\nFor a young couple from China, the Denver festival was their first time seeing dragon boat racing live.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting.\u201dJack Greene, 21, and Scott Yanagihara, 48, were competing at the festival for CH2M, an Englewood-based engineering firm.\n\u201cI just felt like this is a dream come true,\u201d she said of the swelling crowds each year."}
