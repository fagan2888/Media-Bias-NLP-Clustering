Whitney Westerfield (Photo: File Photo)\n\nFRANKFORT, Ky. - At least 62,000 convicted felons in Kentucky will have the opportunity to wipe their records clean in part because a 45-year-old man convicted of stealing car radios 27 years ago convinced a powerful Republican lawmaker to change his mind.\n\nWest Powell was just 18 years old when he decided his Chevrolet Cavalier deserved a better radio. He could not afford to buy one, so he convinced his older brother, Marvin, to help him steal some from an auto salvage yard in Campbell County, Kentucky, just south of Cincinnati.\n\nThey were caught, and Powell wound up with a felony conviction. He\u2019s had trouble getting and keeping a job ever since. He told his story to a committee of state lawmakers in October who were considering a bill that would let some felons erase their criminal records. It was the kind of hearing that typically features carefully crafted testimony that rarely, if ever, budges lawmakers off of entrenched partisan views.\n\nBut Powell\u2019s testimony was different. It had such an impact on Whitney Westerfield, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee, that he reversed his long-held opposition on the spot. Before the meeting was over, he was sending messages to his Republican colleagues telling them they had to pass the bill.\n\n\u201cThis guy has done what we ask everybody in the justice system to do: correct the behavior and don\u2019t do it again,\u201d Westerfield said. \u201cWe ought to be able to help that guy.\u201d\n\nPowell spent a year in prison for violating his probation, where he said guards and fellow inmates told him he would be back.\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d Powell said.\n\nHe kept his word. For the next 27 years, Powell lived a clean life with no arrests. But he\u2019s struggled to get by.\n\n\u201cI have this mark on me, it\u2019s like the mark of the beast or something,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time you apply for a job they ask you have you been convicted. \u2026 So you lie, you work two or three weeks, four weeks, then they find out and fire you. But three or four weeks of work beats no work. So I did it. I did it for years. Just hopping from job to job.\u201d\n\nNow living in Ohio, he has a family and has gone back to school to become a physical therapist. He is scheduled to start his clinical rotations next year. But before he can do that, he has to pass a background check.\n\nOne night in October, he asked his brother, Marvin, for a different kind of favor: drive him to Kentucky to testify before Westerfield\u2019s committee on a proposal to allow certain convicted felons to erase their criminal records.\n\nBut the odds were long. For years, advocates had pushed for similar legislation, only to see it die in the Republican-controlled Senate. Westerfield was running for attorney general at the time, making it even more difficult for him to change his political positions. Westerfield lost the November 2015 race.\n\nTwo months later, Westerfield began working on the bill. The final version lists 61 specific felonies that may be vacated. Felons would have to wait five years after completing their sentences before asking a judge to vacate their judgments, and anyone with multiple convictions would be ineligible.\n\nThe bill passed the House and the Senate. Gov. Matt Bevin is scheduled to sign it into law Tuesday.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Daryl Owens, the bill\u2019s chief sponsor who has been trying to pass it for at least six years, said Westerfield\u2019s change of heart was \u201ccritical\u201d to its passage.\n\nPowell said he did not know of Westerfield\u2019s full role until a reporter told him about it.\n\n\u201cThis has been a cross to bear for many years for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that, you know, someone finally listened.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1N2LJ12", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "At least 62,000 convicted felons in Kentucky will have the opportunity to wipe their records clean in part because a 45-year-old man convicted of stealing car radios 27 years ago convinced a powerful Republican lawmaker to change his mind.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "At least 62,000 convicted felons in Kentucky will have the opportunity to wipe their records clean in part because a 45-year-old man convicted of stealing car radios 27 years ago convinced a powerful Republican lawmaker to change his mind.", "title": "Convict\u2019s testimony changes Republican minds in Ky", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/10/convicts-testimony-changes-republican-minds-ky/82869568/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At least 62,000 convicted felons in Kentucky will have the opportunity to wipe their records clean in part because a 45-year-old man convicted of stealing car radios 27 years ago convinced a powerful Republican lawmaker to change his mind.", "title": "Convict\u2019s testimony changes Kentucky Republican minds on felony expungement", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/571aa5186bba3612aaa97ff16056fc1d543bf430/c=66-0-333-267&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/04/B9316463086Z.1_20150304110212_000_GCBA4APPE.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Kentucky General Assembly", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Kentucky General Assembly", "title": "Convict\u2019s testimony changes Republican minds in Ky", "author": "Adam Beam", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04a2b1a7b08317845c291b56bb35cf287e5cf1c5/c=100-0-300-267/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/04/B9316463086Z.1_20150304110212_000_GCBA4APPE.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc9c58be302643d21988446f5cf25d7c62520eef/c=66-0-333-267/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/04/B9316463086Z.1_20150304110212_000_GCBA4APPE.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c2289b233873da946db8835f54ce4a015cd54643/c=22-0-378-267/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/04/B9316463086Z.1_20150304110212_000_GCBA4APPE.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/57f29f2451feb58480d550a8dd783397cfd79cad/c=0-21-400-246&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/04/B9316463086Z.1_20150304110212_000_GCBA4APPE.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-10T15:49:11.210000-04:00", "shorthed": "Convict\u2019s testimony changes Republican minds", "articleid": 82869568, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abd7122f623f2360e90fbef4570b3d7f841b8d8b/c=0-21-400-246/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/04/B9316463086Z.1_20150304110212_000_GCBA4APPE.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/02ae144f701289c3c48441605bf816267c6a1fcd/c=125-0-275-267/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/04/B9316463086Z.1_20150304110212_000_GCBA4APPE.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "felony, expungement, bills, Kentucky Republicans,"}, "article_summary": "\u2026 So you lie, you work two or three weeks, four weeks, then they find out and fire you.\nIt had such an impact on Whitney Westerfield, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee, that he reversed his long-held opposition on the spot.\nBefore the meeting was over, he was sending messages to his Republican colleagues telling them they had to pass the bill.\nIt was the kind of hearing that typically features carefully crafted testimony that rarely, if ever, budges lawmakers off of entrenched partisan views.\nPowell said he did not know of Westerfield\u2019s full role until a reporter told him about it."}
