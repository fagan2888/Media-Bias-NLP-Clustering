It had sued the Obama administration, claiming it did not have the right to appropriate tax subsidies to help consumers purchase insurance without Congressional approval.\n\nIf the decision stands, it could force millions of Americans off their insurance plans. As a result, hospitals could wind up treating more uninsured patients, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\"The hospitals are the ones that really stand to lose the most from any potential repeal of Obamacare,\" Jason McGorman, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, told the wire service. \"They have to treat the patients no matter what.\"\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has been a boon regarding reducing the amount of uncompensated care: It dropped by nearly $6 billion in 2014, although much of that occurred in states that also expanded Medicaid eligibility.\n\nBloomberg noted that the decision, which is on hold for now pending an appeal, caused the stocks of the major for-profit hospital chains to fall. Community Health Systems dropped 11 percent in value, while Tenet Healthcare Corp. dropped nearly 10 percent, and HCA holdings Inc., declined by more than 3 percent.\n\nEven if the lawsuit drags on for a period, there is also a possibility that if a Republican is elected president, that the new administration could elect to quash the subsidies as well.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Bloomberg article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRepublican president could quash cost-sharing subsidies for ACA plans\n\nReport: Hospitals will save $5.7B on uncompensated care\n\nHospitals provided majority of uncompensated care in 2013\n\nSupreme Court upholds ACA's federal subsidies 6-3", "article_metadata": {"description": "A\u00a0U.S. District Court\u00a0judge's\u00a0decision that may strike down the Obama administration's ability to set money aside for insurance subsidies on the exchange\u00a0could wind up hurting hospitals the most.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthFinance", "description": "A\u00a0U.S. District Court\u00a0judge's\u00a0decision that may strike down the Obama administration's ability to set money aside for insurance subsidies on the exchange\u00a0could wind up hurting hospitals the most.", "title": "Ruling against subsidies could hurt hospitals", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthfinance.com/story/ruling-against-subsidies-could-hurt-hospitals/2016-05-16", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthfinance.jpg", "type": "website"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Reimbursement and Payer Contracts,subsidies,Uncompensated Care,uninsured patients", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Reimbursement and Payer Contracts"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the Bloomberg articleRelated Articles:Republican president could quash cost-sharing subsidies for ACA plansReport: Hospitals will save $5.7B on uncompensated careHospitals provided majority of uncompensated care in 2013Supreme Court upholds ACA's federal subsidies 6-3\nA U.S. District Court judge's decision that may strike down the Obama administration's ability to set money aside for insurance subsidies on the exchange could wind up hurting hospitals the most.\nAs a result, hospitals could wind up treating more uninsured patients, according to Bloomberg.\nIt had sued the Obama administration, claiming it did not have the right to appropriate tax subsidies to help consumers purchase insurance without Congressional approval.\nThe decision, made by U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer, was a victory for the House of Representatives."}
