The shift will take effect Feb. 1.\n\nIn announcing termination of the agreements on out-of-state on permits, Herring said it ensures that individuals disqualified under Virginia law from obtaining a concealed weapons permit can\u2019t use the reciprocity agreement to carry firearms in the state.\n\n\u201cWhile you are here, you are subject to the commonwealth\u2019s gun laws,\u201d Herring said during a press conference.\n\nVirginia bars anyone with a record for stalking, assault, drug use, or drunk driving from carrying a handgun. Individuals with a legal history of mental health treatment or those dishonorably discharged from the military also are disqualified.\n\nHerring said ending the reciprocity agreements is a \u201ccommonsense\u201d step that blocks potentially dangerous or irresponsible persons from lawfully carrying a weapon in Virginia.\n\nGun rights advocates slammed the change as politically motivated.\n\nVirginia Del. Rob Bell, a Republican looking to unseat Herring in 2017, called the new policy \u201canother Washington-style overreach from a nakedly partisan attorney general.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of doing the job he was elected to do, Mark Herring continues to put the political goals of his liberal supporters ahead of sound legal judgment,\u201d Bell said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe National Rifle Association criticized the attorney general for placing \u201cpolitics above public safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis decision is both dangerous and shameful,\u201d said Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action. \u201cThe attorney general knows that permit holders are among the safest groups of citizens in the commonwealth and the country.\u201d\n\nVirginia will sever concealed carry agreements with these states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\nSix of the states\u2014Florida, Louisiana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Wyoming\u2014will stop accepting Virginia concealed carry permits because their laws \u201crequire mutual recognition of permits.\u201d\n\nHerring said concealed carry permits from Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia will remain valid in Virginia.\n\nVirginia\u2019s gun laws \u201cshould not be undermined by wrongly recognizing permits from other states with more permissive standards,\u201d he said.\n\nThe change marks the latest move by Virginia Democrats seeking to enact stricter gun control measures by circumventing the Republican-led General Assembly.\n\nGov. Terry McAuliffe, also a Democrat, signed an executive order in October prohibiting open carrying of firearms in some state buildings. In April, McAuliffe vetoed three bills aimed at easing gun laws.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A state audit determined that guns laws in 25 states failed to meet Virginia\u2019s requirements for concealed handguns, Attorney General Mark Herring says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A state audit determined that guns laws in 25 states failed to meet Virginia\u2019s requirements for concealed handguns, Attorney General Mark Herring says.", "title": "Virginia Severs Concealed Carry Agreements With 25 States", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151222_VaGuns_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-05T23:11:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1YBB90V"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A state audit determined that guns laws in 25 states failed to meet Virginia\u2019s requirements for concealed handguns, Attorney General Mark Herring says.", "title": "Virginia Severs Concealed Carry Agreements With 25 States", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151222_VaGuns_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "firearms", "published_time": "2015-12-23T15:07:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-05T23:11:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Virginia concealed carry, Mark Herring, Terry McAuliffe, gun laws, gun control, National Rifle Association, NRA, Rob Bell"}, "article_summary": "Virginia will stop honoring concealed carry permits from more than two dozen other states that currently have reciprocity privileges with the commonwealth.\nSix of the states\u2014Florida, Louisiana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Wyoming\u2014will stop accepting Virginia concealed carry permits because their laws \u201crequire mutual recognition of permits.\u201dHerring said concealed carry permits from Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia will remain valid in Virginia.\n\u201cWhile you are here, you are subject to the commonwealth\u2019s gun laws,\u201d Herring said during a press conference.\nAttorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, announced the change Tuesday after a state audit determined that gun laws in 25 states failed to meet Virginia\u2019s requirements for concealed handguns.\nVirginia\u2019s gun laws \u201cshould not be undermined by wrongly recognizing permits from other states with more permissive standards,\u201d he said."}
