Burwell, on Dec. 17. A three-judge panel of that court in July dealt a major blow to the Affordable Care Act by ruling 2-1 that the subsidies can be available only in state-run exchanges, not through the federal HealthCare.gov, which serves 36 states that couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t set up their own Obamacare marketplaces, Kenen wrote.\n\nA few hours later that same day, a separate US appeals court in Virginia ruled precisely the opposite: that the subsidies should be available to anybody who is eligible, no matter which kind of exchange their state relies on. The plaintiffs in that case, King v. Burwell, have already asked the US Supreme Court to take it up without waiting for further action in the lower courts.\n\nMillions of people are getting subsidies, which come in the form of a tax credit, to make health insurance more affordable. None of the credits was cut off, though, pending more legal battles over one of the key provisions of the healthcare law\u2019s massive coverage expansion, Kenen wrote.\n\nThe decision to have a full, or en banc, hearing vacates the earlier ruling by the DC court, according to the article.\n\nThe top 20 most annoying buzzwords and phrases in the workplace\n\nAccording to a recent Accountemps survey of human resources (HR) managers, \u201cdynamic,\u201d \u201cdeep dive,\u201d and \u201cleverage\u201d were among the most overused and annoying business buzzwords being used today.\n\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}\n\n\u201cClarity is still king when communicating in the workplace,\u201d Bill Driscoll, New England district president of Accountemps, said in a written statement. \u201cJargon tends to confuse, not clarify. It\u2019s generally best to avoid the tired cliches and trendy buzzwords in favor of clear, straightforward language.\u201d\n\nMore than 600 HR managers at US and Canadian companies with 20 or more employees were interviewed for the survey. They were asked, \u201cWhat is the most annoying or overused phrase or buzzword in the workplace today?\u201d Here are the top 20 based on their responses:\n\n\u201cOut of pocket\u201d \u201cDeep dive\u201d \u201cForward-thinking\u201d \u201cDynamic\u201d \u201cLet me get back to you.\u201d \u201cPick your brain\u201d \u201cEmployee engagement\u201d \u201cLOL\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not my job.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s above my pay grade.\u201d \u201cWhen am I going to get a raise?\u201d \u201cI am overwhelmed.\u201d \u201cCrunch time\u201d \u201cWin-win\u201d \u201cValue-added\u201d \u201cThink outside the box.\u201d \u201cLeverage\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day\u201d \u201cCircle back\u201d \u201cSynergy\u201d\n\nTIGTA: The IRS needs to improve its processing of complaints against tax preparers\n\nThe IRS is not processing complaints against tax return preparers in a timely manner, according to a report released publicly by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) on Thursday.\n\nTIGTA\u2019s review of the 8,354 complaints against preparers received by the IRS between Oct. 1, 2012, and Sept. 11, 2013, identified 3,953 (47 percent) for which work on the complaints had yet to be initiated. Of the 3,953 complaints, 1,920 (49 percent) had been in the agency\u2019s inventory for at least 60 business days with no work initiated.\n\nIn addition, IRS processes did not ensure the complaints were accurately and consistently processed. TIGTA also found that processes were not established to effectively track complaint referrals to IRS business functions to ensure that the complaints are received for evaluation and track how the referred complaints are resolved, according to the report.\n\n\u201cTax return preparers play an increasingly important role in helping taxpayers to comply with the tax laws,\u201d Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George said in a written statement. \u201cUnqualified or unethical tax return preparers can negatively impact taxpayers, as well as tax revenue, if the tax returns they prepare are incorrect and/or fraudulent.\u201d\n\nTIGTA made eight recommendations to the IRS, including that it establish goals and procedures to ensure that complaints are timely processed; develop a process to ensure that complaints are recorded in inventory records; ensure that criteria for referring complaints to business functions are appropriately applied and that the business functions\u2019 resolution of complaint referrals is tracked; and establish procedures to contact taxpayers for missing information.\n\nIRS management agreed with six of TIGTA\u2019s recommendations and plans to take corrective action.\n\nClick here to download the report.\n\nHouse GOP to push tax bills this month\n\nBernie Becker of The Hill reported on Thursday that the Republican-led House of Representatives will take up a string of tax bills during lawmakers' brief stint in Washington this month, according to a memo from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).\n\nHouse Republicans will take up a series of new proposals dealing with the IRS\u2019s improper scrutiny of Tea Party groups. Those measures include proposals that would let the US Treasury Department give more information to taxpayers who have had confidential information leaked, bar any IRS employee from doing government work on a personal email account, and codify a group\u2019s right to appeal a denial of tax-exempt status, Becker wrote.\n\nAlso expected to be discussed is a broad repackaging of more than a dozen bills related to the economy that the House has already passed, including extensions of tax breaks for corporate research and business expensing. The measure also includes a permanent reauthorization of a bill barring states from taxing online access, according to the article.\n\nChamber to intensify tax reform efforts\n\nBecker also wrote an article for The Hill on Thursday about how the US Chamber of Commerce is using a new ad campaign to intensify its efforts to push policymakers toward tax reform.\n\nThe Chamber said on Thursday that the Fair Reform for Growth will be a multimillion-dollar campaign that will urge both voters and elected officials to back a rewrite of the tax code.\n\n\u201cFaced with the highest statutory tax rate of any major country, American employers must do everything they can to stay competitive in the global marketplace and keep their employees working,\u201d said Bruce Josten, the Chamber\u2019s executive vice president for government affairs, according to the article. \u201cComprehensive tax reform is essential to ensure continued success for middle-class families and businesses across the country, and this campaign will keep this issue top of mind for policymakers and voters.\u201d\n\nThe Chamber\u2019s announcement gave few details about the campaign, which includes a petition for those wanting to lobby the White House and Congress on tax reform, Becker wrote. The campaign also hasn\u2019t spelled out many details about what it would like to see in an overhauled tax code, though Thursday\u2019s announcement did bash attempts by Democrats to retroactively target companies that shift their legal address abroad.\n\nUS tax revenue to rise if Obama legalizes some immigrants: report\n\nRichard Cowan of Reuters wrote on Thursday that US government tax collections would get a multibillion-dollar boost if President Obama issued an executive order giving temporary legal status to millions of undocumented residents, the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress said in a new report.\n\nThe group, which has close ties to the Obama administration, estimated $21.2 billion in additional payroll taxes would be collected over five years under one scenario available to President Obama, who has made immigration reform a priority of his second term.\n\nThat revenue increase is based on a scenario where 4.7 million undocumented immigrants receive temporary legal status, allowing them to get work permits. These immigrants live with at least one child who is either a US citizen or undocumented, Cowan wrote.\n\n\u201cMany workers and employers will be able to emerge from the underground economy and pay payroll taxes for the first time,\u201d the report said, according to the article.\n\nThe report also looked at the revenue impact if President Obama included broader groups of people in an executive action. If he aimed the program at undocumented residents who had been in the United States for at least 10 years, for example, it would effect 7.4 million people and raise $33.4 billion in payroll tax revenues over five years.\n\nClick here to download the report.\n\nArthur ashes\n\nFrancine McKenna wrote a guest article for Reuters Breakingviews on Thursday about Arthur Andersen\u2019s rise from the ashes. It was announced earlier this week that Wealth Tax & Advisory Services, an independent tax consultancy in San Francisco led by former Andersen partner Mark Vorsatz, bought the rights to the Andersen name and renamed the firm Andersen Tax.\n\nMcKenna wrote that reviving the brand a dozen years after its demise is a \u201cdisplay of hubris that attempts to give credence to some revisionist history about Andersen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFormer colleagues say if anyone can make a go of a new Andersen, it\u2019s probably Vorsatz. He made partner at the old version in record time,\u201d she continued. \u201cEven so, it is unrealistic to think the Andersen banner can reliably promise accountability again. Only an echo chamber full of bruised egos would truly believe that\u2019s possible. Rather than rise to some semblance of former glory, the Andersen name is more likely to haunt clients again.\u201d\n\nIs Tesla\u2019s decision to park \u2018gigafactory\u2019 in Nevada good or bad for taxpayers?\n\nJoe Harpaz, managing director of the corporate market for the Tax & Accounting business of Thomson Reuters, offered his thoughts on Tesla Motors\u2019 selection of Nevada as the site for its planned $5 billion \u201cgigafactory.\u201d\n\nThe new solar-powered factory, which will be responsible for producing batteries for Tesla\u2019s vehicles, will cover approximately 10 million square feet, spread out across 500 to 1,000 acres, and will allow the company to produce 500,000 vehicles per year by 2020. The company estimates that it will employ 6,500 people and will produce more batteries by 2020 than were produced worldwide in 2013.\n\nHarpaz said: \u201cIn exchange for this promised boost to the local economy, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval has offered an unprecedented $1.25 billion tax incentive to the company. He has convened a special section of the Nevada Legislature next week to vote on the package, which will allow Tesla to operate in the state tax-free for 10 years.\n\n\u201cThis has already started to stir major controversy on both sides of the political aisle. As USA Today reports, both the right-leaning Nevada Policy Research Institute (NPRI) and the left-leaning Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada (PLAN) have come out against the factory plan with some scathing comments.\n\n\u201cPopulist sentiment aside, a more apt question might be what kind of long-term impact the development of this factory might have on the region. Rich state tax incentives \u2013 if executed well \u2013 can have a tremendous impact on a local economy.\n\n\u201cThe enormity of Tesla\u2019s project cannot be ignored. As part of its deal with Nevada, Tesla must invest a minimum of $3.5 billion in manufacturing equipment and real property in the state. Based on current estimates, Nevada officials expect the Tesla project to generate a $100 billion economic impact over 20 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to consider the knock-on effects of a deal like this. Panasonic, currently a partner with Tesla on battery production, will surely be involved with the new plant, and untold startups and ancillary technology companies will likely be pulled into the orbit around Tesla\u2019s new center of gravity. AT&T, for example, has already gone on record in support of the deal.\n\n\u201cThe precise impact of the Tesla factory on the Nevada economy is subject to many variables, and the project is sure to hit its fair share of bumps along the way, but Nevada\u2019s bold move has the potential to rewrite the rules of local tax incentives as we have known them.\u201d\n\nQuick Links:", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Jason Bramwell"}, "dcterms.title": "Bramwell\u2019s Lunch Beat: The Most Annoying Business Buzzwords", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "IRS"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "Bramwell\u2019s Lunch Beat: The Most Annoying Business Buzzwords", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/bramwells-lunch-beat-the-most-annoying-business-buzzwords", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/default-16x9.jpg?itok=FWa8WdE3", "updated_time": "2014-09-05T15:33:28+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/bramwells-lunch-beat-the-most-annoying-business-buzzwords", "card": "summary", "title": "Bramwell\u2019s Lunch Beat: The Most Annoying Business Buzzwords"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/bramwells-lunch-beat-the-most-annoying-business-buzzwords", "dcterms.creator": "Jason Bramwell", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-05T15:33+00:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"IRS\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"IRS\",\"Tax\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_18724\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-05T17:33:28+01:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-05T18:11:07+01:00"}, "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "IRS", "sft-date": "Sep 5th 2014", "sft-type": "Article", "sft-topic": "Tax", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-18724", "publishtime": "2014-09-05T17:33:28:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Jason Bramwell", "sft-title": "Bramwell\u2019s Lunch Beat: The Most Annoying..."}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The decision to have a full, or en banc, hearing vacates the earlier ruling by the DC court, according to the article.\nAs part of its deal with Nevada, Tesla must invest a minimum of $3.5 billion in manufacturing equipment and real property in the state.\nThe top 20 most annoying buzzwords and phrases in the workplaceAccording to a recent Accountemps survey of human resources (HR) managers, \u201cdynamic,\u201d \u201cdeep dive,\u201d and \u201cleverage\u201d were among the most overused and annoying business buzzwords being used today.\nBased on current estimates, Nevada officials expect the Tesla project to generate a $100 billion economic impact over 20 years.\nOf the 3,953 complaints, 1,920 (49 percent) had been in the agency\u2019s inventory for at least 60 business days with no work initiated."}
