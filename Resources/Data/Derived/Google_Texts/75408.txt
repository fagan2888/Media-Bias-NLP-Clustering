“Flash Boys,” the new book by Michael Lewis, hit bookstores Monday after a surge of anticipation as powerful as a stock market rally. In his new release, Lewis, the bestselling author of “The Blind Side,” Moneyball” and “Liar’s Poker,” writes about what the book describes as “a small group of Wall Street guys who figure out that the U.S. stock market has been rigged for the benefit of insiders and that, post-financial crisis, the markets have become not more free but less, and more controlled by the big Wall Street banks.”

Here’s what the reviews are saying about “Flash Boys.”

–”Because Mr. Lewis is at the helm finding clear, simple metaphors for even the most impenetrable financial minutiae, this tawdry tale should make sense to anyone. And so should its shock value. “Flash Boys” is guaranteed to make blood boil,” The New York Times.

–””Flash Boys” is not as larky as “Liar’s Poker” (1989), Mr. Lewis’s memoir of working at Salomon Brothers during the lead-up to the 1987 crash, or as accessible as “The Big Short” (2010), his jaw-dropping take on the subprime meltdown. It may end up more important to public debate about Wall Street than either, however, in exposing what one of his central characters calls the “Pandora’s box of ridiculousness” that financial exchanges have become,” The Wall Street Journal.

–”HFT [High-Frequency Trading] is dangerous, I’d like to see less of it, and I hope that Michael Lewis will help to bring it to wider attention. But my tentative verdict on Flash Boys (I’ll write something longer once I’ve finished the book) is that it actually misses the big problem with HFT, in the service of pushing a false narrative that it’s bad for the little guy,” Reuters.
