A few of the farmed varieties that are produced responsibly are also relatively high in omega-3 fatty acids, the polyunsaturated fats that promote cardiovascular health. They include arctic char, rainbow trout and oysters, he said.\n\nHe recommends eating a mix of farmed and wild seafood.\n\n\u201cYou paint yourself into a corner if you say you don\u2019t want to eat any farmed fish ever,\u201d he said. \u201cIt automatically removes 50 percent of the U.S. seafood supply from your choices.\u201d\n\nSome good wild options are Alaskan salmon, Atlantic mackerel and sardines.\n\nFrom a health perspective, farmed salmon is a good choice, said Roxanne Karimi, a research scientist at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University. Karimi has found that farmed and wild salmon are high in omega-3\u2019s compared with shrimp, tuna and other fish, and they are generally very low in mercury, a particular concern for pregnant women and young children.\n\nWhen buying fish, keep your smartphone handy. You can find very helpful seafood guides on the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Environmental Defense Fund websites.\n\n\u2013 Anahad O\u2019Connor, New York Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/01/hfnutribrief27.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Q: Is eating farm-raised fish better than eating no fish?\n\u201cYou paint yourself into a corner if you say you don\u2019t want to eat any farmed fish ever,\u201d he said.\nA: Experts have raised concerns about farm-raised fish.\n\u201cIt automatically removes 50 percent of the U.S. seafood supply from your choices.\u201dSome good wild options are Alaskan salmon, Atlantic mackerel and sardines.\nHe recommends eating a mix of farmed and wild seafood."}
