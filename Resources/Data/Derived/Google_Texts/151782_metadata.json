So, when CNN\u2019s three hour GOP debate aired on Wednesday night, people the internet over strapped themselves in for a marathon session of political critiques and comedy, all under 140 characters.\n\nAmong those who helped tweeting, however, was none other than Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, himself. The progressive senator from Vermont, whose dark horse candidacy for the White House has steadily been gaining ground on presumptive Democratic nominee Hilary Clinton, spent the better part of Wednesday evening addressing, challenging, and acerbically skewering the GOP\u2019s debate participants, all in real time. He did so reportedly with the help of his 24 year old digital director, who transcribed Sanders\u2019 observations as he watched the debate on TV.\n\nAnd what did Sanders actually think of the 11 Republicans assembled on stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library? See for yourself.\n\nFirst, he set the tone for the evening:\n\nOnce the debate was underway, Sanders wasted no time lacing into the GOP candidates for their statements on issues such as President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act:\n\nWoman\u2019s reproductive rights:\n\nTaxation of the nation\u2019s wealthiest citizens:\n\nAnd the ongoing violence in the Middle East, as well as former President George W. Bush\u2019s role therein:\n\nFor as much as he appeared happy to play off the conversations happening on the debate stage, it was often what was left unsaid which seemed to energize Sanders the most. Much of his tweetstorm was spent either admonishing GOP candidates for shying away from topics, or asking whether certain issues would even be brought up at all.\n\nNPR reports that Sanders\u2019 messages were among the most retweeted posts of the entire evening. Not that he seemed to care. As the debate stretched into its third hour, Sen. Sanders reached his limit, deciding to call it quits well before the proceedings were scheduled to finish.\n\nSanders has yet to participate in a Presidential debate himself this election, but if last night was any indication, he\u2019s more than ready.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The Presidential candidate's #DebateWithBernie commentary became one of the most popular hashtags of the night.", "og": {"site_name": "GOOD Magazine", "description": "The Presidential candidate's #DebateWithBernie commentary became one of the most popular hashtags of the night.", "title": "Here\u2019s What Bernie Sanders Thought About CNN\u2019s GOP Debate", "url": "https://www.good.is/articles/bernie-sanders-live-tweet-gop-debate", "image": "https://assets.goodstatic.com/s3/magazine/assets/550278/original/bernieman.jpg=s1200x1200", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Presidential candidate's #DebateWithBernie commentary became one of the most popular hashtags of the night.", "title": "Here\u2019s What Bernie Sanders Thought About CNN\u2019s GOP Debate", "url": "https://www.good.is/articles/bernie-sanders-live-tweet-gop-debate", "image": "https://assets.goodstatic.com/s3/magazine/assets/550278/original/bernieman.jpg=s1200x1200", "site": "@good", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#009cff", "robots": "noodp, noydir", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "csrf-token": "y+xvyZ8ecJmV+Y/EC4o0jFjNO1NBPFO1Jw/6r7pStG0H0zX/xFkZMiZIuuCp6t342dnxbVw55fxrxFOxoPc9AQ==", "fb": {"admins": 100004372031382, "app_id": 590727534352624, "pages": 13152108058}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/GOODHQ", "section": "Communities", "tag": "hashtag causes", "published_time": "2015-09-17T13:15:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-09-18T06:11:29Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "article_summary": "Sanders has yet to participate in a Presidential debate himself this election, but if last night was any indication, he\u2019s more than ready.\nSo, when CNN\u2019s three hour GOP debate aired on Wednesday night, people the internet over strapped themselves in for a marathon session of political critiques and comedy, all under 140 characters.\nAmong those who helped tweeting, however, was none other than Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, himself.\nAnd what did Sanders actually think of the 11 Republicans assembled on stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library?\nAs the debate stretched into its third hour, Sen.
