After being picked up unconscious, EMT\u2019s followed procedure and rushed her to St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Madison \u2013 the nearest hospital to their location.\n\nMegan Rothbauer received the very best care at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital as doctors and nurses saved her life. She immediately praised the EMT\u2019s (Emergency Medical Technicians) and hospital that saved her life. It seems like a happy ending. She nearly died, but the instant health care facility saved her.\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t end here. Megan was hit with $300K in medical bills, even with the health insurance. Afterwards, St. Mary\u2019s officials revealed that our hospital is out-of-network for her health insurance plan, directed by Blue Cross Blue Shield. Like other hospitals, St. Mary also treats the patients without knowing their insurance status or the patient\u2019s ability to pay.\n\nAlso, the St. Mary hospital was only 3 blocks away and if you will estimate the cost of her arrival at the hospital, it might be $1500. Instead, the hospital\u2019s bill was amounting $300k. Blue Cross did agree to pay what they would have paid the in-network hospital, which was $150,000.\n\nSt. Mary\u2019s walked to the plate and covered 90 % of the hospital expenses, taking the bill down to $40,000 compensated to the doctors involved with her care. Which has her close to bankruptcy, because of her lack of preference within the matter.\n\nUsing the Affordable Care Act, individuals are discovering that choice continues to be sacrificed to what was said to be affordable prices. For everyone that saves money under the plan, another will get socked with costs.\n\nIn the case of Megan Rothbauer, it\u2019s the frustration of getting no choice. She\u2019s fortunate that the hospital and the insurance provider will work together with her, but ultimately, it exposes a harmful flaw that continues to be within our medical health insurance industry. Option is being restricted.\n\nYou are able to blame the ACA, profit chasing after by companies or whatever. Despite, the concept behind the ACA ended up being to prevent precisely what happened above. If you\u2019re covered under a good health insurance plan, this will never happen. If it means the ACA needs a change, then so whether it is.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "$300k, aca, affordable care act, blue cross blue shield, health insurance plan, megan rothbauer, st. mary hospital", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "Capital Wired", "description": "Follow Megan Rothbauer nearly died from a heart attack last September.
