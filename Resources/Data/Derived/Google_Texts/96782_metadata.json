In fact, for many former supporters of the president, it\u2019s the alleged continuities between the anti-terror policies of Obama and Bush that first caused them to rescind their support for the former. Charges that Obama is worse than Bush, because he legitimized and gave bipartisan cover to that which was once seen as radical and divisive, are not uncommon.\n\nSo now that Obama is about to entire his final year in the White House, and now that attention is increasingly turning away from him and toward his would-be successors, it seems like an opportune moment to reassess the past seven years and figure out why, exactly, Obama\u2019s record on counter-terrorism issues has been so controversial \u2014 and mixed. Which is where \u201cPower Wars: Inside Obama\u2019s Post-9/11 Presidency,\u201d the new book from the New York Times\u2019 Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Charlie Savage, comes in.\n\nRecently, Salon spoke over the phone with Savage about his book, which is both a deeply reported history of the Obama administration and a look at how bureaucracy, chance, politics and technology have so profoundly shaped its legacy. Alongside discussing what Obama really promised on the campaign trail in 2008, we also talk about the outsized influence of late-2009\u2019s failed \u201cunderwear bomber,\u201d and why the president has less control over the prosecution of leaks from his administration than you may suspect.\n\nOur conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nBefore we get into the \u201cunderwear bomber\u201d incident, which you argue was a much, much greater influence on the Obama administration than most people appreciate, I wanted to ask you to set the stage for the first year or so of Obama\u2019s presidency. How did he conceive of these post-9/11 issues before Christmas, 2009?\n\nObama had been a big critic of the Bush administration reaction to the 9/11 attacks, of course, like a lot of Democrats. However, he was primarily criticizing those things like warranted surveillance and military commissions and torture and so forth from a certain vantage point. And kind of what we see now, which was harder to discern at the time of the Bush years, was that there were two very different strands of criticism among Democrats \u2014 and even among libertarians \u2014 of what the Bush administration did.\n\nWhat were they?\n\nThere was the rule of law criticism, which said, \u201cThe president has to obey statutes. He can\u2019t just blow through things like the FISA [warrant] requirements because he thinks it\u2019s necessary and because he\u2019s the Commander-in-Chief.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was the civil liberties critique, which was less interested in the legal process by which the policy was put in place and more interested in what is the relative role of the state in the \u201cstate power vs. individuals\u201d [issue]. And these two strands kind of work together during the Bush years.\n\nBut they eventually start to diverge because the Congress in Bush\u2019s second term started to adjust federal law to bring it into alignment with what [the government] was already doing under Bush\u2019s direction. That at least dramatically reduces the rule of law problem; but the sort of individual [liberties] problem \u2014 if there is one \u2014 remains undisturbed by those changes.\n\nAnd where does Obama land in the midst of all of this?\n\nWhat you see when you go back and really parse Obama\u2019s [campaign] speeches, and hear what the people he gathered around him once he went into the White House were saying, [it\u2019s] almost all primarily in the \u201crule of law\u201d faction. So other than torture, his mindset and that of the people he was gathering around him, coming into office, was: A lot of the stuff had been fixed. We had the [telecom immunity bill], which Obama voted for, which authorized a warrantless surveillance program; we had the Military Commission Act, and so forth.\n\nThere were a few more things that needed to be fixed or wound down or put on firmer legal grounding \u2014 and that was their task; to sort of finish the job of normalizing, regularizing and maybe even \u201crightsizing\u201d the government\u2019s response to the ongoing threat of terrorism. This was one of the things that he was going to do.\n\nAll right. So then Christmas Day, 2009, happens; the so-called underwear bomber. You argue that this was a big, big deal within the White House \u2014 bigger than many outsiders appreciate. Why was this failed attack so important?\n\nThat was a turning point for Obama. He\u2019d already had some compromises and encountered things that were sort of harder in the real world than they seemed on the campaign trail, but he was basically on track to be doing what he wanted to do \u2014 or what he thought he wanted to be doing \u2014 coming out of that first year.\n\nAnd then, on Christmas, 2009, an al Qaeda terrorist operative from Yemen \u2014 well, east of Nigeria, but fed by IEC, the mini-affiliate of al Qaeda \u2014 nearly brings down a jetliner above Detroit. It would have killed almost 300 people on American soil, on [Obama\u2019s] watch. And so, number one, that\u2019s a gut-wrenching moment; it was only sheer luck that the bomb didn\u2019t go off. It was not that the system they put in place worked.\n\nAnd then, the fallout from that was also tremendously important. Republican critiques that he was dismantling some of the things that Bush had put into place suddenly got a lot sharper; and the sense was, if there was another attack, and if it succeeded, the blood would be on his hands. And then underscoring all that is that Scott Brown, a Republican, wins Ted Kennedy\u2019s Senate seat in deep-blue Massachusetts.\n\nRight. That usually doesn\u2019t get mentioned in this story. It\u2019s usually seen as a major development in the story of the Affordable Care Act; not counter-terrorism policy. Why did it matter in that latter context, though?\n\nThe media at that time was portraying [Brown\u2019s victory] as a reaction to Obamacare, but inside the Scott Brown campaign, the polls showed that it was really the terrorism issue that he got the most traction on. He was pounding on Obama and on his Democratic opponent for treating terrorists as criminals, for the fact that the underwear bomber had been read his Miranda warning and was being interrogated by the FBI and charged [in civil court] because Obama and Eric Holder wanted to bring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other 9/11 suspects from Guantanamo to New York and give them a civilian trial.\n\nBrown kept pounding on the idea that these are terrorists and we shouldn\u2019t give them these rights; and even in Massachusetts, at that moment, there was a certain wave of fear from the underwear bomber rolling across the country. It really resonated \u2014 and, suddenly, a Republican had won a Senate seat in Massachusetts. So inside the Obama administration, [it came to be believed that if] there is another attack, and it actually succeeds, Obama will be a failed, one-term president. He\u2019ll lose, just like Jimmy Carter; and everything he came in there to do, including things that have nothing to do with national security, would fail.\n\nThe way events \u2014 the near-miss human disaster on Christmas Day, the political disaster of Scott Brown\u2019s victory \u2014 dictated Obama\u2019s actions, it raises one of the central questions of his presidency, which you talk about in the book. Namely, did he normalize the post-9/11 national security state? Or was he swept along with it?\n\nIt can\u2019t be reduced to a single bumper sticker [answer]; and there were things that he did before the underwear attack that did have the effect of entrenching aspects of [the Bush response to 9/11]. But there was a kind of an ambivalence, or an imbalance, [in the White House] between the reformers and those who more or less represented the security state interests. And after the Christmas attack, the balance between those voices shifted dramatically, and the administration starts taking a much harder line as these debates continue to play out in the months and years to come.\n\nThe voices that are saying, \u201cWe need this surveillance tool\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019d better not let this person out of Guantanamo\u201d \u2014 they have much more sway in the internal meetings. And the people who are saying, \u201cWe can dismantle this; we can be less secretive; we can do this; we can do that\u201d in a reform perspective, they have less sway. Because the political context has changed dramatically.\n\nSo then Obama ends up locked into the dynamic we\u2019ve seen for much of the rest of his presidency; civil liberties groups are mad at him from one end of the spectrum, while the neoconservative, unreconstructed Cheneyites rail against him from the other. I think most people at this point are familiar with the civil liberties folks\u2019 criticism, as well as that of the Cheneyites. And they know Obama\u2019s usual responses to the neoconservatives; but what was his pushback to civil liberties groups usually like?\n\nI think that to an extent [he felt that] some of his critics on the left were in the business of criticizing whatever the government is doing from an individual rights perspective; so even when things got adjusted [to their liking] they just sort of moved the goal post. I know that a lot of officials in his government feel that way.\n\nBut also I think he generally had this lawyerly mindset that held that the main problem with Bush was that Bush put policies in place unilaterally. He said that, as Commander-in-Chief, he could violate statutes; and that\u2019s what Obama thought was especially overreaching and out of hand. He felt that when you have a president who is not doing that, but is acting pursuant to Congressional authority, he shouldn\u2019t be considered Bush-like. And that actually raises a broader theme of the book, which is that the Bush and Obama presidencies were very different in a lot of ways, despite these policy continuities between them, and one of their greatest differences concerned the metric of lawyerism.\n\nUnpack that for me. What were Bush and Cheney like, if not lawyerly?\n\nBush and Cheney were CEOs by background. They did not put a lot of lawyers in policymaking roles around them. The lawyers they did pick, especially in their first term, tended to have these pretty idiosyncratic views of executive power; and, as a result, they\u2019re able to put in these wide-ranging changes, to have the the government run like a business. Overnight, it\u2019s like, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have military commissions\u201d; no further ado; no second-guessing.\n\nObama and his administration are quite the opposite. Obama and Joe Biden, of course, are both lawyers and showed a clear tendency to put lawyers into policymaking roles around them. And this has consequences, having government-by-lawyer and not government-by-CEO. Lawyers are very incremental; lawyers have to really engage with the other side, because they have to prepare for everybody\u2019s argument; they have to value process. That means they are going to be cautious about changing the status quo. They\u2019re going to be cautious about dislodging what Bush has equipped to them.\n\nDoes that explain why the Department of Justice under Obama has been so aggressive in prosecuting leakers (or whistleblowers, depending on your perspective)? Because they feel like, well, the law is the law; the process is the process?\n\nObama has, by this point, overseen nine criminal cases against leakers. That\u2019s compared with three under previous presidents \u2014 combined. There was one under Bush. I spent a lot of time going through each case, and I talked to a lot of people on the scene about where [this wave] came from. It had some bureaucratic origin in the second term of the Bush administration.\n\nBut, more fundamentally, I think it had to do with changes in technology, and how metadata can make it much easier now to see who is talking to a reporter, who also had access to the information. [Previously, during a leak investigation,] the CIA would hand over most of the files on [potential leakers], but the FBI wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything with those. Now, they can narrow it down to which people have been in contact with the reporter who wrote the story and had access to the information.\n\nSo it\u2019s not necessarily a conscious change in policy?\n\nThat\u2019s right. I was looking for a meeting or a memo in which Obama himself or even [former Attorney General] Eric Holder actually and deliberately tried to set into motion this track-down [of leakers]. When there\u2019s such a dramatic change \u2014 from three cases to nine cases \u2014 we all want there to be a central narrative, to believe that it happened on purpose. But I came to the conclusion that that didn\u2019t exist, that it wasn\u2019t a deliberate decision. It wasn\u2019t something Bush did; it wasn\u2019t something Obama did. It\u2019s just the way the world is. It\u2019s part of what we as investigative journalists are now dealing with in the 21st-century environment.\n\nBefore I let you go, I wanted to ask you for your thoughts about the so-called deep state, and whether or how it has influenced the president\u2019s decision-making.\n\nI definitely think it\u2019s an interesting factor that people who are out in the world don\u2019t fully understand.\n\nI think there\u2019s a very [mistaken] understanding of how the government works \u2014 which is that the president just does these things. Obama just does it. Once you work [in D.C.] for a while, you understand that that\u2019s widely oversimplified. Most of the time, the president never knows about what\u2019s going on. It could appear [so] at the most superficial level, but it\u2019s really the 150 or so senior and mid-level executive branch officials that he\u2019s appointed who are making these decisions and grappling with these dilemmas.\n\nWhat you\u2019re adding to that when you bring up [the deep state] is that, underneath, there\u2019s this permanent state of security officials who have their own sort of world and expertise and turf and bureaucratic interests. All these forces encounter each other in ways that don\u2019t reduce to \u201cBush did this\u201d and \u201cObama did that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NYT reporter Charlie Savage tells Salon the real reason why Obama has broken less from Bush than many hoped.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "NYT reporter Charlie Savage tells Salon the real reason why Obama has broken less from Bush than many hoped.", "title": "\u201cA Turning Point for Obama\u201d: How the President Learned to Love the National Security State", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/world/turning-point-obama-how-president-learned-love-national-security-state", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/shutterstock_218485882-edited.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "\u201cA Turning Point for Obama\u201d: How the President Learned to Love the National Security State"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-08T16:09:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "So inside the Obama administration, [it came to be believed that if] there is another attack, and it actually succeeds, Obama will be a failed, one-term president.\nObama had been a big critic of the Bush administration reaction to the 9/11 attacks, of course, like a lot of Democrats.\nIt had some bureaucratic origin in the second term of the Bush administration.\nI think there\u2019s a very [mistaken] understanding of how the government works \u2014 which is that the president just does these things.\nAll these forces encounter each other in ways that don\u2019t reduce to \u201cBush did this\u201d and \u201cObama did that.\u201d"}
