But that\u2019s not why millions of retirees may be denied the fruits of their Social Security benefits.\n\nThe reason Social Security may not be around is that much of the program\u2019s benefits will be eaten away by health care costs.\n\nThat\u2019s the projection from the consulting firm HeatlhView Services, which helps financial advisors with health care retirement planning.\n\nHealthView introduced its Retirement Health Care Cost Index, which pulls data from as many as 50 million individual health care cases and other sources.\n\nRon Mastrogiovanni, founder and CEO of HealthView, said in a news release that although the costs are high, they are manageable for people who consult an advisor and incorporate health care costs in their retirement plans.\n\n\u201cThe takeaway from this work is that while total lifetime health care costs will be higher than many expect, if planned for early enough, these costs are manageable,\u201d he said. \u201cBy incorporating them in planning during working years, we believe retirees will be better positioned to make informed planning decisions and realize the retirement security they seek.\u201d\n\nMastrogiovanni said the question isn\u2019t whether Americans can afford to save for health care costs. The question is whether clients and advisors can afford not to build health care costs into their retirement plans.\n\nHealth care retirement spending projections look daunting. An aging population, an increase in chronic diseases, a fragile Social Security infrastructure, insufficient cost of living adjustments and the limited scope of coverage under Medicare are likely to force health costs in retirement ever higher.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Social Security income will not be enough to counter these rising costs,\u201d according to HealthView\u2019s 2015 Retirement Health Care Costs Data Report released in March.\n\nThe math, though not overly complicated, varies widely and relies on numerous assumptions including retirement age, income and Medicare benefits and surcharges, among other factors.\n\nBut with data from 50 million individual cases, HealthView\u2019s projections leave no doubt that for millions of retirees looking forward to a little supplementary income from Social Security, much of that revenue will disappear to pay for health care costs.\n\nIn 2015, a 66-year-old couple, the age at which people become eligible for full retirement benefits, will experience a gradual decrease in annual Social Security income as the Social Security benefit shifts to cover rising health care costs.\n\nHere\u2019s how the math works out, according to the report.\n\nAt age 70, annual health care costs (in future dollars) will amount to $14,148. Social Security will come in at $32,799, for an annual difference of $18,651. The percent of Social Security dedicated to health care costs amounts to 43 percent.\n\nBy age 87, annual health care costs will have gone up to $40,909, and Social Security income will also have gone up \u2014 to $45,927, for an annual difference of only $5,018. The percent of Social Security income dedicated to health care costs amounts to 89 percent, the report said.\n\nHealthView\u2019s projections don\u2019t include long-term care and assume that Social Security benefits have been optimized \u2014 which is seldom the case.\n\nThe average lifetime retirement health care premiums for a healthy 65-year-old couple retiring this year and covered by Medicare Parts B, D, as well as a supplemental insurance policy will be $266,589, the report found.\n\nToss in that same 65-year-old couple\u2019s dental, vision, copays and out-of-pocket expenses, and average lifetime retirement health care costs would rise to $394,954, the report also found.\n\nFor a 55-year-old couple retiring in 10 years, total lifetime health care costs would come to $463,849, the report also found.\n\nThe paper concludes that as medical costs rise and Social Security cost-of-living adjustments fail to keep pace, \u201chealth care will be among the most significant expenses for Americans in retirement.\u201d\n\nMany people know that health care costs are expected to eat a big part of their income in retirement as surveys of preretirees indicate that their No. 1 challenge in retirement will be to pay for health care expenses.\n\nInsuranceNewsNet Senior Writer Cyril Tuohy has covered the financial services industry for more than 15 years.
