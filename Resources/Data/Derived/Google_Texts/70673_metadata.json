(AP) - Hailed at its opening in January by Richmond Mayor Dwight C. Jones as \u201cthe Taj Mahal of high schools in the state of Virginia,\u201d officials say Huguenot High School has experienced some \u201chiccups\u201d since students returned last month.\n\nStuck elevators, a water leak that bowed part of the gymnasium floor, and an air-conditioning unit that gave out last week all have drawn workers back to the $63 million school.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some hiccups,\u201d said Tommy Kranz, the district\u2019s assistant superintendent for support services. \u201cAny time you have a new state-of-the-art facility that large, there\u2019s going to be some issues.\u201d\n\nThe 250,000-square-foot building was the first new public high school built in Richmond since what is now Armstrong opened in 1968.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Richmond School Board member Kristen Larson, whose 4th District includes Huguenot. \u201cClearly we continue to be overwhelmed by facilities issues; we have to get out of this reactive mode.\u201d\n\nThe challenges come at a time when Richmond Public Schools has had to rent an air-conditioning unit for Armstrong at a monthly rate of $10,000 following a mechanical failure that forced the school to close for a day.\n\nHuguenot\u2019s issues fall under a warranty and will not generate costs for the district, said Michael F. McIntyre, vice president for program management at AECOM, the company that oversaw construction of Huguenot and three other schools for the city.\n\nThe city recently built Huguenot, Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, and Broad Rock and Oak Grove-Bellemeade elementary schools, then handed the facilities over to the school district.\n\nAs a result, \u201cthere\u2019s been a little more red tape than necessary,\u201d Larson said of responding to facilities issues.\n\nHess Construction built the 1,400-student-capacity building, which was the fourth and last school constructed to date under Jones\u2019 \u201cBuilding the Best Richmond\u201d campaign.\n\nThe damage done to one of Huguenot\u2019s two auxiliary basketball courts appears to have occurred during the recent downpour and should not affect school operations, McIntyre said.\n\nKranz said a school worker brought the problem to his attention over the weekend after noticing that the floor appeared to be buckling.\n\nA follow-up inspection revealed that water had seeped into duct work through a mechanical unit and dripped onto the floor, said Donald Summers, senior capital projects manager for the city.\n\n\u201cThe contractor has accepted ownership,\u201d Summers said.\n\nOnce work is finished on the unit that took in water, the contractor will have the affected sections of the floor replaced, he said.\n\n\u201cThe prognosis that came out of the inspection yesterday is that they\u2019re moving very quickly,\u201d McIntyre said on Oct. 6. \u201cThis really was driven by an unusual rainstorm.\u201d\n\nKranz said students stuck in the elevators at Huguenot were able \u201cto get out very quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of elevators stick,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working diligently on that one.\u201d\n\nThe problem may have been caused when elevator doors were held open too long, which interferes with the machines\u2019 self-regulation, Summers said. A contractor already has replaced a part that may have been to blame, he said.\n\nAn air-conditioning unit on the school\u2019s second floor that gave out last week is fully operational again, Kranz said.\n\n\u201cOne of the units was giving us fits,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would run and then it would shut off, but we took care of it. It\u2019s been a team effort.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Richmond Times-Dispatch, http://www.timesdispatch.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hailed at its opening in January by Richmond Mayor Dwight C.
