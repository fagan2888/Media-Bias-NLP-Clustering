Erin Brockovich, the famed consumer advocate and environment activist, will tour the Navajo Nation next week to see the effects of last month’s Colorado mine spill.

Tribal officials said Brockovich, who was the subject of a 2000 film bearing her name, is slated for a tour Tuesday of the San Juan River with the nation’s president, Russell Begaye.

“The Navajo Nation has been culturally and economically devastated by the impact of the Gold King Mine Spill and we need help to address this crisis,” Begaye said in a statement released Thursday night. “We appreciate Ms. Brockovich’s willingness to visit our Nation to witness the damage first-hand and help raise awareness about the plight of our people.”

Navajo officials have chastised the EPA since the Aug. 5 EPA-caused spill at Gold King Mine above Silverton. Leaders say the aftermath of the spill left their people on the brink of economic disaster and threatened their culture.

The spill sent wastewater cascading into a tributary of the Animas River in Colorado before it emptied into the San Juan in New Mexico. The San Juan runs for 215 miles through the Navajo Nation.

Begaye petitioned this week for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Brockovich stepped into the spotlight in the 1990s after she investigated groundwater contamination in a California town while working as a legal clerk. Her work led to a major lawsuit.
