One of the nation’s largest providers of medical flight services is facing a hefty fine for allegedly using an unsafe aircraft.

The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday proposed a $91,500 civil penalty against Englewood-based Air Methods Corp. for operating a Bell 407 helicopter allegedly “not in an airworthy condition.”

“Air Methods operated the aircraft on four flights in October … when a required torque check inspection on its tail rotor drive shaft components was overdue,” a statement from the FAA reads.

The flights cited by the FAA were not in Colorado, said Air Methods spokeswoman Christina Brodsly.

Air Methods president Mike Allen emphasized that the company is fully cooperating with the FAA investigation, adding that the helicopter was in compliance.

“We take safety seriously, and the safe return of our crews and the patients we serve is and always will be our highest priority at Air Methods,” Allen said in a statement. “In 2013, Air Methods became the first air medical provider and helicopter operator to achieve the highest level within the FAA’s voluntary Safety Management System program.”

Air Methods, which is based out of the Centennial Airport, has been in business since 1980.

The company provides medical flight services for three health care organizations in Colorado — St. Mary’s Hospital in Grand Junction, Centura Health and HealthOne — and has more than 300 bases serving 48 states, Brodsly said.

On May 7, the company released promising first-quarter 2015 results. Revenue increased to $238.3 million from $221.1 million, or about 8 percent, and net income was $12.9 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared with $11.6 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, over the same time last year.

Air Methods stock closed Friday at $42.16 after opening at $42. The stock’s 52-week high was $60.74 in August 2014, and the low was $40.31 in early February.
