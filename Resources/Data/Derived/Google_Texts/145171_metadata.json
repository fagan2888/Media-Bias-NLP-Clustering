Coats held state permission to use marijuana for medical purposes. Colorado voted to approve recreational use of marijuana in 2012 and medicinal use in 2000.\n\nThe ruling said Coats \u201cdoes not dispute that the federal Controlled Substances Act prohibits medical marijuana use.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CSA lists marijuana as a Schedule I substance, meaning federal law designates it as having no medical accepted use, a high risk of abuse, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision,\u201d the court said.\n\n\u201cThis makes the use, possession or manufacture of marijuana a federal criminal offense, except where used for federally approved research projects. There is no exception for marijuana use for medicinal purposes, or for marijuana use conducted in accordance with state law.\u201d\n\nWhat is medical care these days? Drug use? Drug abuse? Read about it in \u201cMedical Murder: Architects of Madness.\u201d\n\nThe case is the latest in a burgeoning conflict between state and federal laws on issues ranging from the manufacture of guns to Obamacare to medical marijuana.\n\nCoats is a quadriplegic who says marijuana helps him manage muscle spasms. So he obtained a medical marijuana license from the state, which is one of only two states, along with Washington, to allow recreational use.\n\nHe tested positive in a work-related test and was dismissed in 2010. He sued, claiming that because the state made marijuana use legal, his use was protected by the law.\n\nAs other states consider proposals to make marijuana legal, the case could be seen as a roadblock.\n\nCoats had claimed medical marijuana was legally allowed under the state\u2019s Lawful Off-Duty Activities statute, which protects workers from employer discipline for activities they undertake off-duty that are legal.\n\nJustice Allison Eid wrote the opinion and found, \u201cEmployees who engage in an activity such as medical marijuana use that is permitted by state law but unlawful under federal law are not protected by the statute.\u201d\n\nThe decision essentially clears the way for Colorado employers to set their own standard for employee marijuana use.\n\n\u201cHaving decided this case on the basis of the prohibition under federal law, we decline to address the issue of whether Colorado\u2019s Medical Marijuana Amendment deems medical marijuana use \u2018lawful\u2019 by conferring a right to such use,\u201d the court said.\n\nThe court found that \u201clawful\u201d means legal under both state and federal laws.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Colorado\u2019s Supreme Court on Monday approved the idea of employers dismissing workers for using marijuana off-duty, even if the state says it\u2019s all right, because it remains a crime under federal law.
