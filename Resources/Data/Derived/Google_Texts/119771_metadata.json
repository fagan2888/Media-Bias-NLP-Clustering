America is at war and he\u2019s America\u2019s commander in chief. For the soldier being shot at in the field, it makes no difference under whose administration the fighting began. In fact, three out of four Americans killed in Afghanistan have died under Barack Obama\u2019s command. That\u2019s ownership enough.\n\nMoreover, Gates\u2019s doubts about Obama had begun long before. A year earlier, trying to understand how two senior officials could be openly working against expressed policy, Gates concluded that \u201cthe most likely explanation was that the president himself did not really believe the strategy he had approved would work.\u201d This, just four months after Obama ordered his 30,000 troop \u201csurge\u201d into Afghanistan, warning the nation that \u201cour security is at stake . . . the security of our allies, and the common security of the world.\u201d\n\nThe odd thing about Gates\u2019s insider revelation of Obama\u2019s lack of faith in his own policy is that we knew it all along. Obama was emitting discordant notes from the very beginning. In the West Point \u201csurge\u201d speech itself, the very sentence after that announcement consisted of the further announcement that the additional troops would be withdrawn in 18 months.\n\nHow can any commander be so precise so far in advance about an enterprise as inherently contingent and unpredictable? It was a signal to friend and foe that he wasn\u2019t serious. And as if to amplify that signal, Obama added that \u201cthe nation that I\u2019m most interested in building is our own,\u201d thus immediately undermining the very importance of the war to which he was committing new troops.\n\n1 of 8 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 What Obama didn\u2019t know View Photos The many controversies that the White House says the president was kept in the dark about.

Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers. The president said he wasn\u2019t aware his promise before the rollout would result in cancellations, and Obama had repeatedly stated that, although new health-care insurance would be available through the Affordable Care Act, those willing to stay on their plan would be able to do so.In fact, that wasn\u2019t the case.

One could sense that Obama\u2019s heart was never in it.\n\nAnd now we know. Indeed, this became hauntingly clear to Obama\u2019s own defense secretary within just a few months \u2014 before the majority of the troops had arrived in the field, before the new strategy had even been tested.\n\nHow can a commander in good conscience send troops on a mission he doesn\u2019t believe in, a mission from which he knows some will never return? Even worse, Obama ordered a major escalation, expending much blood but not an ounce of his own political capital. Over the next four years, notes Gates with chagrin, Obama ignored the obligation of any commander to explain, support and try to rally the nation to the cause.\n\nAnd when he finally terminated the surge, he did so in the middle of the 2012 fighting season. Militarily incoherent \u2014 but politically convenient. It allowed Obama to campaign for reelection proclaiming that \u201cthe tide of war is receding.\u201d\n\nOne question remains, however. If he wasn\u2019t committed to the mission, if he didn\u2019t care about winning, why did Obama throw these soldiers into battle in the first place?\n\nBecause for years the Democrats had used Afghanistan as a talking point to rail against the Iraq War \u2014 while avoiding the politically suicidal appearance of McGovernite pacifism. As consultant Bob Shrum later admitted, \u201cI was part of the 2004 Kerry campaign, which elevated the idea of Afghanistan as \u2018the right war\u2019 to conventional Democratic wisdom. This was accurate as criticism of the Bush Administration, but it was also reflexive and perhaps by now even misleading as policy.\u201d\n\nTranslation: They were never really serious about Afghanistan. (Nor apparently about Iraq either. Gates recounts with some shock that Hillary Clinton admitted she opposed the Iraq surge for political reasons, and Obama conceded that much of the opposition had indeed been political.) The Democratic mantra \u2014 Iraq War, bad; Afghan War, good \u2014 was simply a partisan device to ride anti-Bush, anti-Iraq War feeling without appearing squishy.\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The Right\u2019s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site\u2019s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

It\u2019s a war of choice. Afghanistan is a war of necessity, the central front in the war on terror. Having run on that, Obama had a need to at least make a show of trying to win the good war, the smart war.\n\n\u201cIf I had ever come to believe the military part of the strategy would not lead to success as I defined it,\u201d writes Gates. \u201cI could not have continued signing the deployment orders.\u201d The commander in chief, Gates\u2019s book makes clear, had no such scruples.\n\nRead more from Charles Krauthammer\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama never was serious about the war in Afghanistan.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Obama never was serious about the war in Afghanistan.", "title": "Charles Krauthammer: How in good conscience?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-how-in-good-conscience/2014/01/16/138901d4-7ee3-11e3-9556-4a4bf7bcbd84_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/14/Editorial-Opinion/Advance/Images/g%2013_1308779101.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@krauthammer"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-how-in-good-conscience/2014/01/16/138901d4-7ee3-11e3-9556-4a4bf7bcbd84_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "charles krauthammer, afghanistan war, obama war, obama gates, gates duty, afghan surge, robert gates, bob gates, secretary gates, duty gates,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589"}, "eomportal-uuid": "138901d4-7ee3-11e3-9556-4a4bf7bcbd84", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "charles krauthammer, afghanistan war, obama war, obama gates, gates duty, afghan surge, robert gates, bob gates, secretary gates, duty gates,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf4c6\"", "article_summary": "The Democratic mantra \u2014 Iraq War, bad; Afghan War, good \u2014 was simply a partisan device to ride anti-Bush, anti-Iraq War feeling without appearing squishy.\nHaving run on that, Obama had a need to at least make a show of trying to win the good war, the smart war.\nHow can a commander in good conscience send troops on a mission he doesn\u2019t believe in, a mission from which he knows some will never return?\nRead more from Charles Krauthammer\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\nBy early 2011, writes former defense secretary Robert Gates, he had concluded that President Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in his own [Afghanistan] strategy, and doesn\u2019t consider the war to be his.\u201dNot his?"}
