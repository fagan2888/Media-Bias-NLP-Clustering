Sarah Palin clearly feels vindicated. In a video posted online Tuesday, the former vice presidential candidate suggests she was right when she predicted that the Affordable Care Act would lead to “death panels” of bureaucrats deciding who’s worthy of health care and who’s not.

Set to electric guitar riffs and featuring granny being pushed off a clip and a roaring grizzly bear apparently just as outraged as the former Alaska governor, the video includes short news clips sewn together to prove that the “death panels” lie has turned out to be true.

The problem, of course, is that it’s not. As has been explained here, here, here, here, here and here, the new health care law contains no death panels. The Independent Payment Advisory Board, a government panel that may determine some Medicare payments rates, is expressly banned from rationing care. End-of-life counseling, a provision in an early version of a health reform bill that would pay doctors to talk to Medicare patients about living wills, was stripped from the final version.
