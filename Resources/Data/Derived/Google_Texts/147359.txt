House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said major glitches in the Obamacare rollout are "unacceptable," but despite the website's problems, the program is still going to work.



“As far as the Affordable Care Act, as I call it, the fact is, that yes what has happened is unacceptable in terms of the glitches,” Pelosi said on ABC's “This Week." “This has to be fixed, but what doesn’t have to be fixed is the fact that tens of millions of more people will have access to affordable, quality health care. That no longer having a preexisting medical condition will bar you from getting affordable care."

Pelosi made similar comments to reporters on Thursday, saying the website “has to be improved."

“I hope that we would have some answers soon and that the answer would be: OK, we’ve found the glitch or whatever it is, it’s been corrected and here’s a demonstration of how people, when they approach it now, will be received,” Pelosi said.

The White House has been working to fix the glitches since Oct. 1, the first day people were allowed to enroll in the new coverage provided by the Affordable Care Act.

Pelosi's not the only one to express frustration over the website's issues. President Barack Obama, who is expected to address the problems Monday during an event at the White House, told his team they had to own up to the fact that there were no excuses for not having the health care website ready on Oct. 1.
