How bad is the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchange website? Bad enough that the Obama administration won’t say whether things will be fixed in time for everyone to use it to get insurance by the Jan. 1 deadline.

Appearing on Bloomberg TV’s “Political Capital,” White House Office of Management and Budget Director Sylvia Burwell would not say whether HealthCare.gov would be fixed by December 15.

“If people can’t sign up, they can’t get affordable care,” said the show’s host Al Hunt. “And can you guarantee the public that by December 15, say, which is a little over 2 weeks before they can really join, that these problems will be largely rectified?”

Burwell refused to answer. She danced around the question without answering it. When hunt asked again, she still danced.
