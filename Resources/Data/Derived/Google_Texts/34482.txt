Two people were arrested on Thursday in connection with a string of heroin overdoses regarding a batch of opioids called “Predator,” which officials say led to two deaths earlier this week. From WPXI:

According to police paperwork, when officers pulled over Raeann Gonzalez and Justin Robinson they found heroin underneath the bristles of a brush. When they executed a search warrant inside a home on Leolyn Street in Carrick, investigators said they found 31 bundles of heroin labeled “Night Owl” and ten bundles labeled “Predator” inside a stove.

Both suspects were taken to the Allegheny County Jail and face charges of conspiracy, possession and possession with intent to deliver.
