Gallagher & Co. \u201cThat doesn't mean they won't be able to meet their compliance obligations; it's just that there's a fair amount of regulatory fatigue out there.\u201d\n\nMost employers already meet the mental health parity rules, experts say. A study by the Health and Human Services Department published alongside the final rules found that as of 2011, the vast majority of employers providing mental health benefits do treat them on par with the medical benefits they provide.\n\n%%BREAK%%\n\n\u201cEmployers have already adopted most of these standards since they were published in the interim regulations in 2010,\u201d said Amy Gordon, a Chicago-based partner in McDermott Will & Emery L.L.P.'s benefits compliance practice. \u201cFinancially, it doesn't seem to have become something that's too onerous from a compliance standpoint, so I don't anticipate that these new final regulations will have too much of an impact.\u201d\n\nThe final rules contain numerous provisions addressing the law's cross-applicability with the health care reform law.\n\nMost significantly, small employers were exempted from the parity requirements under the 2010 interim rules. That exemption is nullified for fully insured employers under the final rules, due to the essential health benefits coverage mandate for small-group health plans under the health reform law.\n\n\u201cThe regulations do still include that exception for small employers, but because of the essential health benefit regulations under the ACA, fully insured small employers aren't going to be able to go to an insurer and purchase coverage for their employees that doesn't contain mental health benefits,\u201d Ms. Gordon said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Employers providing mental health benefits must offer cost-sharing and treatment options equal to other medical benefits they offer their employees, under the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act.The Labor, Treasury and Health and Human Services departments handed down final rules this...", "title": "Federal rules clarify mental health parity law - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20131117/NEWS03/311179975", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20131117/NEWS03/311179975/AR/0/mental-health-parity-law.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "Employers providing mental health benefits must offer cost-sharing and treatment options equal to other medical benefits they offer their employees, under the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act.The Labor, Treasury and Health and Human Services departments handed down final rules this...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Federal rules clarify mental health parity law - Business Insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea6c\"", "article_summary": "Employers providing mental health benefits must offer cost-sharing and treatment options equal to other medical benefits they offer their employees, under the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act.\nThat exemption is nullified for fully insured employers under the final rules, due to the essential health benefits coverage mandate for small-group health plans under the health reform law.\n%%BREAK%%While large employers defined under the mental health parity law as firms with more than 50 full-time workers are not required to provide mental health benefits under federal law, the final regulations require those that do provide mental health and addiction treatment to apply co-payments, deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, utilization caps and other limitations equally with other medical benefits.\nHowever, mental health benefits provided through an employee assistance program are not subject to the parity requirements, as long as those benefits do not include clinical care or treatment.\nA study by the Health and Human Services Department published alongside the final rules found that as of 2011, the vast majority of employers providing mental health benefits do treat them on par with the medical benefits they provide."}
