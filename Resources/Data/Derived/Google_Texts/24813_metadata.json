Then he gives me 200 virtual \u201cdate points\u201d that I\u2019m to distribute among the four traits. The more I allocate to each attribute, the more highly I supposedly value that quality in a mate. \"Using some complex algorithm to assess whether the partner is as kind as Mother Teresa or as smart as Einstein is a fool\u2019s errand.\" This experiment, which Royzman sometimes runs with his college classes, is meant to inject scarcity into hypothetical dating decisions in order to force people to prioritize. I think for a second, and then I write equal amounts (70) next to both hotness and kindness, then 40 next to income and 20 next to fidelity.\n\n\u201cOh wow,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYour response is somewhat atypical for a female. Usually women allocate more to fidelity and less to physical attractiveness. Maybe you think fidelity is something people can cultivate over time?\u201d (Sure, but I mean, who would want an ugly, broke jerk sticking faithfully by their side?) Royzman said that among his students (not in a clinical condition), men tend to spend much more on physical attractiveness, and women spend more on social attractiveness traits like kindness and intelligence. This trait game, along with Royzman\u2019s review of the literature on attraction, hints at some of the endless quirks of the online dating marketplace. You might like someone online, but they put 100 on income, and unfortunately you\u2019re about a 10. Men and women make mating decisions very differently, he speculates. Men tend to act like single-issue voters: If a prospect is not attractive enough, he or she usually doesn\u2019t qualify for a first date, period. For women, however, \"It's a more complex choice,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat tends to matter for females is that the overall package is good,\" meaning that women might accept a less-attractive mate if he was outstanding in some other way. \"Online, this might result in males restricting their potential mates.\u201d Related Story Online Dating, on the Autism Spectrum Match.com is two decades old, but new, fast-growing apps such as Tinder have shifted the online-matching emphasis back to looks. Tinder dispenses with the idea that it takes a mutual love of pho or Fleet Foxes to create a spark; instead, users of the phone app swipe through the photos of potential mates and message the ones they like. As one columnist who used the service put it, \u201cThere\u2019s a short bio, age, and mutual friends listed, but who\u2019s really paying attention to that stuff when your Tinder flame is wearing next to nothing on the beach?\u201d Then there\u2019s Hinge, which uses a similar interface, but is backed by recommendations from the user\u2019s \u201csocial graph,\u201d such as their school or career field. Grindr serves up a mosaic of gay bachelors\u2019 head and body shots. There are also a raft of appearance-based spin-off sites, such as Facemate, a service that aims to match people who look physically similar and thus, the company\u2019s founder claims, are more likely to have chemistry.\n\nThis more superficial breed of dating sites is capitalizing on a clear trend. Only 36 percent of adults say marriage is one of the most important things in life, according to a 2010 Pew study, and only 28 percent say there is one true love for every person (men are more likely to say so than women). Rather than attempting to hitch people for life based on a complex array of intrinsic qualities, why not just offer daters a gaggle of visually appealing admirers? Recent research has examined what makes people desire each other digitally, as well as whether our first impressions of online photos ultimately matter. Here, then, is how to date online like a social scientist. Does the photo matter? Tinder offers a one-sentence tagline and a selection of five photos, including the all-important first photo, or \u201ccalling card,\u201d as the writer Amanda Lewis put it. She points out a few other tips in her \u201cTinder glossary:\u201d \u201cMost players reflexively swipe left [reject] at the sight of a toddler or baby,\u201d but posing with your adorable Lab can be an \u201ceffective misdirection.\u201d And then there\u2019s the iron law that \u201c95 percent of players who choose a calling card that does not include a clear shot of their face are unattractive.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time in history that a face plays such an important role in one\u2019s fate. Physiognomy, or the bogus theory that we can predict a person\u2019s character from their features, was once a widespread doctrine. Charles Darwin first began to develop his theory of natural selection while journeying on the HMS Beagle as a \u201cgentleman companion\u201d to its captain, Robert Fitzroy, but only after nearly being turned down from the job because Fitzroy thought \u201cno man with such a nose could have the energy\" required for an arduous voyage. There has been some evidence that strangers can accurately predict qualities like extraversion, emotional stability, and self-esteem based on photos. Hockey players with wider faces, considered a sign of aggression, spend more time in the penalty box. Tinder It takes longer, more meaningful interactions, however, to pinpoint other traits, like if the prospective mate is open, agreeable, or neurotic. It seems people might only be able to determine the extremes of a personality from a photo, rather than its nuances. (One study found that the owner of an \"honest\" face is not any more likely to be trustworthy, for example.) It\u2019s true that attractive people generally are treated more nicely by others, and they might have better-adjusted personalities as a result. But Royzman said looks can deceive. In relationships, personality eventually overtakes attractiveness\u2014or at the very least, we tend to find people more attractive when we think they have good personalities. So perhaps you should make that Tinder tagline all about how you volunteer at an animal shelter every weekend.\n\nSwiping through endless Tinder photos in search of the most alluring possible one might not be fruitful, either. Most people end up with someone who\u2019s about as good-looking as they are. \u201cPeople might prefer attractive people, but they often end up pairing off with people who are similar in attractiveness,\u201d Leslie Zebrowitz, a psychology professor at Brandeis University and an expert on face perception, said. \u201cYou might shoot for the moon, but you take what you can get.\u201d Should I date someone who looks like me? Twenty years ago, Christina Bloom was in a committed relationship when she met someone who \u201cknocked me off my heels.\u201d The two embarked on a fiery romance, during which she noticed that friends and strangers were always telling them they looked alike. She launched FaceMate in 2011, drawing on her opinion that people in happy relationships tend to resemble each other. The site matches the photos of its users based on their faces\u2019 bone structure using face-scanning techniques and a computer algorithm. The service is free, for now, and currently has 100,000 users. \u201cIt all starts with the face,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople say, \u2018From the first time I met him, I knew.\u2019 There\u2019s a sense of recognition. That's what they're seeing, is their own image. That's what we call chemistry.\u201d Psychologists tend to disagree with that theory. In another experimental mock speed-dating event, subjects who thought they were similar to one another were more likely to be attracted to each other, but that wasn\u2019t the case for those who were actually similar to one another. \u201cPeople are not romantically attracted to people who look like them,\u201d Zebrowitz said. \u201cThat has to do with the disadvantages of mating with your brother, for example.\u201d Indeed, Lisa DeBruine, a psychologist at the University of Glasgow in the U.K., has found that people find self-resembling, opposite-sex faces to be trustworthy, but not sexy, and they can even be repulsive for a short-term relationship. But George Michael and Maeby might be relieved to know that while excessive genetic overlap between two people results in poor reproductive prospects, a small amount can be acceptable. That might be why 20 young Norwegian couples rated their partner\u2019s photograph as more attractive when it was digitally \u201cmorphed\u201d to look ever so slightly more like themselves. The magic number was a 22 percent resemblance\u2014any more similar was deemed gross.\n\nAnd, by the way, you really should call the whole thing off if one of you says potato and the other \u201cpo-tah-to\u201d (because after all, who says it like that?). Couples with similar speech styles were more likely to stay together than those who speak differently. DeBruine points out that though we\u2019re programmed to avoid dating our relatives, we also have a certain, subconscious affinity for our own parents. \u201cThe scientific evidence reflects complexity and suggests that there may be a \u2018happy medium,\u2019\u201d DeBruine told me. \u201cBut, ultimately, other factors are much more important in successful relationships.\u201d Will my online dating attempts lead to a relationship? We may have more options for potential mates than ever before, but unfortunately people have trouble determining what they really want in their lovers. One 2008 study by Eli Finkel and Paul Eastwick at Northwestern University found, for example, that though men and women tend to say they prioritize different things in their mates (men are more likely to emphasize looks and women money), there\u2019s no difference in the types of mates the two sexes actually choose in a real-life setting\u2014which the authors gauged using a speed-dating exercise. An Atlantic Special Report\n\nRead More What\u2019s more, there was little association between the traits participants said they wanted in a partner on paper and what they actually liked about the mates at the speed dating event. In other words, you may flaunt your Rolex in your Tinder photo, but that might not stop your date from heading home with a scruffy artist once you\u2019re at the bar. This is in part because the way people pair with one another on dating sites is different from the way they will then later evaluate the relationship, according to Finkel and Eastwick. People browse online profiles in what\u2019s known as \u201cjoint evaluation mode,\u201d comparing multiple suitors against one another on the basis of attractiveness, income, and other factors. But they make relationship decisions in what\u2019s called \u201cseparate evaluation mode,\u201d judging just that person and thinking, \u201cIs this person right for me?\u201d Even if you pick out the prospect with the most striking jawline, and you may overlook the one who will willingly spend hours watching Cake Boss with you, sans judgement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Can we predict romantic prospects just from looking at a face?", "author": "Olga Khazan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Can we predict romantic prospects just from looking at a face?", "title": "A Psychologist's Guide to Online Dating", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/couple/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/a-psychologists-guide-to-online-dating/282225/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/olgakhazan"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut, ultimately, other factors are much more important in successful relationships.\u201d Will my online dating attempts lead to a relationship?\nThis trait game, along with Royzman\u2019s review of the literature on attraction, hints at some of the endless quirks of the online dating marketplace.\nRecent research has examined what makes people desire each other digitally, as well as whether our first impressions of online photos ultimately matter.\nSwiping through endless Tinder photos in search of the most alluring possible one might not be fruitful, either.\n\"Online, this might result in males restricting their potential mates.\u201d Related Story Online Dating, on the Autism Spectrum Match.com is two decades old, but new, fast-growing apps such as Tinder have shifted the online-matching emphasis back to looks."}
