Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood, is shown on the second-to-last day of the first-called special session during the 82nd Legislature on June 27, 2011. Taylor was elected to the Texas Senate in 2012.\n\nHealth insurers would be prohibited from covering abortion in all cases save for medical emergencies under a bill the Texas Senate gave preliminary approval to on Tuesday.\n\nSenate Bill 575 by Republican state Sen. Larry Taylor of Friendswood passed on a 21-10 vote. One Democrat joined the chamber's Republicans to approve the measure.\n\n\u201cThis is not a ban on elective abortions,\u201d Taylor told the chamber, repeating a line he used when presenting his bill in committee last month. He added that the legislation would give Texans the \u201cchoice\u201d to not pay for others\u2019 abortions by way of buying into health plans.\n\nUnder SB 575, private health insurance plans and those offered through the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace could only provide coverage for abortions in cases of medical emergencies. Women seeking coverage for what Taylor calls \u201celective\u201d abortions would be required to purchase supplemental health insurance plans.\n\nTen states now prohibit all health plans from covering abortion, and 15 prohibit abortion coverage on federal marketplace plans, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nTaylor\u2019s proposal was met with opposition from most Democrats, including state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, who presented several hypothetical cases \u2014 including rape and fetal abnormalities \u2014 in which women could be negatively affected by SB 575.\n\n\u201cThese bills have real-world consequences,\u201d Watson said.\n\nTaylor responded that \u201cin the worst-case scenarios,\u201d women could still access abortion under his bill, adding that abortion providers often offer payment plans to cover the costs of an abortion. He then downplayed the hypothetical situations Watson was presenting, calling them \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t mean anything by the use of the word 'extreme,' but I think one of the things we need to do is to be sensitive to how the decisions we're making might impact people\u2019s lives,\u201d Watson said. \u201cA person who finds themselves in any of three scenarios I just talked about might consider our actions to be extreme if we make a very difficult situation more difficult by denying insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nTaylor then said he meant those cases were rare, not extreme.\n\nState Sen. Sylvia Garcia, D-Houston, criticized Taylor for not knowing how much supplemental insurance for abortion coverage would cost and questioned why the bill did not include an exception for abortions in cases of rape or incest.\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t address it,\u201d Taylor said, adding he\u2019d consider an amendment to include the exception. An amendment was not ultimately attached.\n\nGarcia also raised concerns about the state singling out abortion under insurance plans and not other elective procedures.\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t believe in vasectomies?\u201d Garcia asked Taylor.\n\n\u201cThat's another bill for another day,\u201d he responded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Texas Senate on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to a measure that would prohibit health insurers from covering abortion.", "parsely-title": "Senate Gives First OK to Bill Banning Insurers From Covering Abortion", "twitter": {"description": "The Texas Senate on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to a measure that would prohibit health insurers from covering abortion.", "title": "Senate Gives First OK to Bill Banning Insurers From Covering Abortion", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/05/05/senate-approves-abortion-ban-health-plans/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/Taylor12CMS_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "creator": "@alexazura", "site": "@TexasTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 154122474650943, "pages": 124434790836}, "og": {"site_name": "The Texas Tribune", "description": "The Texas Senate on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to a measure that would prohibit health insurers from covering abortion.", "title": "Senate Gives First OK to Bill Banning Insurers From Covering Abortion", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/05/05/senate-approves-abortion-ban-health-plans/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/Taylor12CMS_jpg_800x1000_q100.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "Reproductive Health,Abortion,Health", "parsely-author": "Alexa Ura", "parsely-section": "front-page", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/"}, "parsely-pub-date": "May 5, 2015, 1:04 p.m.", "parsely-image-url": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/Taylor12CMS_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-link": "http://www.texastribune.org/2015/05/05/senate-approves-abortion-ban-health-plans/"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9983\"", "article_summary": "Ten states now prohibit all health plans from covering abortion, and 15 prohibit abortion coverage on federal marketplace plans, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\nHealth insurers would be prohibited from covering abortion in all cases save for medical emergencies under a bill the Texas Senate gave preliminary approval to on Tuesday.\nGarcia also raised concerns about the state singling out abortion under insurance plans and not other elective procedures.\n\u201cThis is not a ban on elective abortions,\u201d Taylor told the chamber, repeating a line he used when presenting his bill in committee last month.\nTaylor responded that \u201cin the worst-case scenarios,\u201d women could still access abortion under his bill, adding that abortion providers often offer payment plans to cover the costs of an abortion."}
