“This holiday season, I decided to send a gift that would also help combat the latest effort by Israel’s enemies to destroy the one and only Jewish state,” Dermer wrote in his holiday letter, referring to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel. (snip)

“The main forces behind this movement are fanatics who actively seek to eliminate Israel. Unfortunately, they are occasionally joined by fools who naively believe that in promoting BDS, they are advancing peace between Israelis and Palestinians,” he wrote.

“[T]he fanatics and the fools are simply promoting a new anti-Semitism….

The latest example of this, he said, was the EU’s recent move to specially label products made by Jews in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. Despite the more than 200 other international territorial disputes, the EU decided to label only Jewish-made products, the ambassador wrote. (snip)

Dermer called the EU singling out of Israel “all the more shameful” because “Israel upholds the highest democratic values in the darkest region on earth and while facing threats faced by no other nation.”

“In response to this effort to cast a beacon of freedom, tolerance and decency as a pariah state, I have decided this holiday season to send you products that were made in Judea, Samaria and the Golan Heights. I hope you will enjoy them,” the ambassador wrote.
