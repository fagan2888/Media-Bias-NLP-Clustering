Marco Rubio, R-Fla., outlined his ideas about the challenges facing America\u2019s next president. He wouldn\u2019t say if he\u2019ll be among the field of 2016 presidential contenders.\n\nAppearing on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d this morning, Rubio said that regardless of who enters the race for president, the No. 1 issue facing the candidates will be U.S. national security:\n\nAt a time when we\u2019re facing threats from rising powers like China, that want to rewrite the global order, like Russia, that want to ignore the global order, to rogue states like Iran and North Korea, who want nuclear weapons to be immune from the global order, and radical Islamists, that want to have a brand new global order in which everyone lives under the flag of radical Islam. That\u2019s the first threat we face, and we need a commander in chief who understands the nature of the threat, and has real ideas about how to address it.\n\nRubio said \u201cthe radical transformation of our economy\u201d remains an important issue as well.\n\n\u201cWe need new, modern policies to give everyone an opportunity to succeed,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI believe the next president of the United States needs to be someone who understands the 21st century, and the opportunities of this century, so that everyone can make it to the middle class and beyond.\u201d\n\nRubio criticized President Obama\u2019s plan to provide free community college by increasing taxes on the wealthy as an \u201coutdated\u201d product of the last century and called the notion that \u201cin order for someone to do better, someone else must do worse\u201d false.\n\nRubio made clear that he has not yet made up his mind about running for president.\n\n\u201cIf I decide to run for president,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m very seriously thinking about it because of where our country is today, I\u2019m going to go out and run a campaign where I\u2019m going to explain to people not only do I understand the national security threats that we face, but that I believe that we need to turn the page and fully embrace all the opportunities and confront the challenges of a new century.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
