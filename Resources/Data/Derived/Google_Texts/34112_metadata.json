YNHH acquired the Hospital of St. Raphael in 2012, making it one of the country\u2019s largest hospitals. And YNHH a not-for-profit, moved to join forces with a large hospital management company that\u2019s looking to buy four hospitals in Connecticut and convert them to for-profit institutions.\n\nProponents of this kind of consolidation say it leads to more efficient and better care, at a time when older institutions are having trouble making ends meet. Critics warn that the trend leads toward \u201csegregation\u201d of care between private and publicly supported patients, along with higher fees and less convenience.\n\nPublic officials are increasingly weighing in on the discussion. The state legislature recently passed bills requiring more oversight of hospital takeovers and mandating the disclosure of new fees. Ted Kennedy Jr., candidate for senator, launched his campaign with a critique of so-called \u201cfacility fees.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Mayor Toni Harp stepped into the fray, criticizing the increased patient costs associated with hospital takeovers, and raising concern about what it might mean for the city\u2019s bottom line. The mayor has asked city human resources chief Stephen Librandi for an estimate of what the impact of new \u201cfacility fees\u201d might be on the budget, according to city spokesman Laurence Grotheer.\n\n\u201cThis is one more example of a major, overall policy concern in the health care field,\u201d Harp testified. \u201cEven as insurers and employers are asking workers to take on a greater share of healthcare costs, and even as patients are encouraged to seek treatment in more cost-effective settings, hospitals are absorbing these facilities and imposing inflated hospital rates for services provided there.\n\nHarp\u2019s testimony came amid similar sentiments expressed by numerous members of Yale University\u2019s UNITE HERE Local 34, which represents blue- and pink-collar workers, including 900 clinical staff in the Yale medical system.\n\nLocal 34, which has been granted \u201cintervenor status\u201d in the matter, called on OHCA to look at the Gaylord sleep center closure more broadly, including YNHH\u2019s role in the transaction, and as an expanding force in the region\u2019s health care system.\n\nHarp Weighs In\n\nOHCA\u2019s Kevin Hansted and Kaila Riggott (pictured), who presided over the hearing, did not make a decision on Gaylord\u2019s request to close its sleep center. Hansted, the hearing officer, said he will make a recommendation within 60 days from the last filing on the matter. He said the final decision will be up to Jewel Mullen, state commissioner of the Department of Public Health.\n\nMayor Harp raised three concerns about the sleep center closure.\n\nFirst, she said, Gaylord isn\u2019t simply closing its sleep center; it\u2019s transferring it to YNHH. Without more information about the details of that transaction, \u201cit is difficult for me to imagine how OHCA can effectively render judgment in the best interest of the public.\u201d\n\nSecond, changes will have a disproportionate impact on \u201clow-income residents of New Haven,\u201d particularly with regard to transportation, Harp said. A bus trip from YNHH to the North Haven sleep center takes an hour, and transportation assistance is \u201cno substitute for the ready access to services on Temple Street at the old university sleep center.\u201d\n\n\u201cSevere sleep disorders such as narcolepsy often result in medical restrictions or prohibitions on driving to ensure the safety of the patient and the public. These restrictions force patients to rely upon public transportation,\u201d Harp noted.\n\nShe note how the state\u2019s notorious bus system worsens the situation.\n\n\u201cThe state Department of Transportation says a trip from Yale-New Haven Hospital to the 6 Devine St. location takes at least an hour, using buses that run only once every half hour in the middle of the day. The fastest route requires significant walks at either end of the ride. Since sleep medicine patients often have significant co-morbidities including pulmonary conditions, these transportation obstacles pose real barriers to access.\n\n\u201cYes, as the Applicant notes, there are public programs to help low-income patients pay for taxis or rides. But these programs are no substitute for the ready access to services on Temple Street at the old University sleep center. Navigating public transportation all the way up to Devine Street poses challenges, especially for people on low-wage jobs who often don\u2019t have time off. Approval of this application without taking this into account would result in a hardship for these patients. ..\n\n\u201cEven for those able to deal with transportation, I am also very concerned about the possibility that patients and insurers will face much higher costs if this application goes through. As you know, the University\u2019s sleep lab was not hospital-based. Patients who used to receive care at the Temple Street site could well face much higher out-of-pocket costs than they did previously, depending on specifics of their health insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nThird, Harp argued patients may face higher costs if the deal goes through. The New Haven sleep center was not hospital-based; the North Haven sleep center under YNHH would be. \u201cPatients who used to receive care at the Temple Street site could well face much higher out-of-pocket costs than they did previously,\u201c Harp said. \u201cI do not want New Haven residents to have to pay unreasonable fees for service.\u201d\n\nThis last reason is part of a larger area of concern, one that could hit the city budget hard, Harp said.\n\n\u201cNew Haven is self-insured with regard to healthcare coverage for its employees and still, these costs comprise the city\u2019s largest single line item in the budget. We cannot control these costs if hospitals are suddenly allowed to impose higher prices each time they absorb the next doctor\u2019s practice.\u201d\n\nDangers\n\nWednesday\u2019s meeting drew over 100 people to Gateway Community College on Church Street downtown, where the hearing took place at the request of Yale University\u2019s Local 34.\n\nThe union has taken up the hospital-expansion issue in the wake of the university\u2019s closing of New Haven\u2019s sleep center. That closure, the union argues, is related to the proposed closure of the North Haven sleep center. Here\u2019s how, according to the union:\n\nIn January, Yale closed its sleep center, where a number of Local 34 members were employed, along with doctors who are part of Yale Medical Group, the practice of Yale medical school doctors who comprise many of the physicians working at YNHH.\n\nThe New Haven sleep center closure is part of a complex three-way transaction involving Gaylord Hospital, YNHH, and the university. YNHH is essentially transferring Yale\u2019s New Haven sleep center to North Haven by taking over Gaylord\u2019s operation there, the union contends.\n\nThe two hospitals disagree with that characterization. Vin Petrini, YNHH senior vice-president of public affairs, has said that the New Haven closure and the North Haven deal are two distinct transactions. Gaylord Specialty Healthcare CEO George Kyriacou described it the same way at Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\n\nKyriacou sat a table at the front of the meeting room, along with John Blair, Gaylord\u2019s attorney in the proceedings. Also at the table was Henry Murray, attorney for Local 34, who was joined by three union members.\n\nThe sleep center transaction presents a number of dangers, said John Canham-Clyne (pictured), a Local 34 researcher. \u201cThe consolidation presents challenges for at-risk populations,\u201d he said. \u201cFormer and potential patients from New Haven\u2019s low-income communities of color may struggle with the proposed geographic changes.\u201d\n\nIn addition to transportation difficulties, Canham-Clyne warned of higher fees and fewer trained employees, since union workers would have to choose between keeping the benefits they have in the union, or leaving the organization in order to continue working in the field of sleep medicine.\n\nCanham-Clyne said OHCA should deny Gaylord\u2019s request for approval and require YNHH to file a similar request for approval.\n\nGaylord Responds\n\nKyriacou (pictured), the Gaylord CEO, said the hospital is choosing to close its sleep center because business has been declining in the last several years. He said Gaylord is working with YNHH to ensure a \u201cseamless transition\u201d with no changes to patient care.\n\nAsked about transportation, Kyriacou said YNHH has agreed to provide the same level as currently exists: A hospital taxi service, free transport for Medicaid patients, and public bus service.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be any changes,\u201d Kyriacou said. He promised to submit a written agreement with YNHH to that effect.\n\nKyriacou said he does not know if any of the doctors who worked at New Haven\u2019s sleep center will be hired to work in the North Haven center.\n\n\u201cThe issues raised are valid,\u201d said Blair, the Gaylord attorney. But the transportation needs of New Haven patients going to a center in North Haven are \u201coutside of the jurisdiction\u201d of the OHCA, he said. The matter before OHCA is simply the closure of the North Haven center.\n\nThe recently passed Senate Bill 35, which gives OHCA the power to review hospital purchasers of physician practices, has not yet gone into effect.\n\nAsked about the argument that OHCA should consider YNHH\u2019s acquisition as part of Gaylord\u2019s closure of its sleep center, Kyriacou said, \u201cI think that is totally incorrect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is going to be no change in access in North Haven,\u201d he said.\n\nThe underlying issue, Kyriacou said, is simply that the union is upset with Yale\u2019s decision to close the New Haven sleep center.\n\n\u201cThe union has an issue with Yale University, and somehow we\u2019re being dragged into this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Paul Bass, New Haven, Connecticut, New Haven Connecticut, CT, New Haven news, news about New Haven, Toni Harp", "og": {"site_name": "New Haven Independent", "description": "A proposal to close a sleep center in North Haven drew fire from New Haveners, including the mayor, who made her first foray into a growing debate over expanding hospitals...", "title": "Harp Blasts \"Facility Fees,\" Sleep Center Deal  |  New Haven Independent", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 550, "identifier": "http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/upload/2014/06/TM/TRM_20140618_0009.jpg", "height": 367}, "url": "http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/harp_weighs_in_on_sleep-center_deal/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "index,nofollow,archive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-19T12:58:50-0400", "modified_time": "2014-06-19T17:20:51-0400"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd54\"", "article_summary": "The New Haven sleep center was not hospital-based; the North Haven sleep center under YNHH would be.\nThe underlying issue, Kyriacou said, is simply that the union is upset with Yale\u2019s decision to close the New Haven sleep center.\nThat closure, the union argues, is related to the proposed closure of the North Haven sleep center.\nYNHH is essentially transferring Yale\u2019s New Haven sleep center to North Haven by taking over Gaylord\u2019s operation there, the union contends.\nThe New Haven sleep center closure is part of a complex three-way transaction involving Gaylord Hospital, YNHH, and the university."}
