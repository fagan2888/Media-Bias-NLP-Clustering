However, the startup may have a fighting chance against streaming heavyweights like Spotify (and Apple\u2019s upcoming new service) if it can hammer out a key partnership.\n\nSprint, the third-largest wireless carrier in the U.S. with 56 million subscribers, is working on a deal with Tidal to distribute the service to its customers. \u201cWe are working together in partnership for the vision of the common cause of reestablishing the value of music,\u201d Sprint said in a statement to USA Today to dispel rumors that the company had already bought a stake in Tidal. \u201cIt is NOT a financial investment or exclusive partnership.\u201d\n\nDetails are murky, but there is plenty of precedent for deals between music streaming services and wireless carriers. When Beats Music launched in January, it offered a discounted family plan to AT&T subscribers that let up five people to use Beats accounts for a combined $15 per month (five subscriptions would cost $50 per month normally). Sprint itself is currently offering six months of Spotify Premium for free to customers on certain wireless plans.\n\n\u201cEvery major digital music service that you might care to name have dedicated senior executives whose mission is to do nothing but bundling deals with mobile operators,\u201d Larry Miller, a music business professor at New York University, told TIME when the Beats-AT&T deal was rolling out.\n\nA bundle deal would be especially helpful for Tidal, which lacks the name recognition of Spotify or the Apple-owned Beats Music. And the more tightly packaged the service is into customers\u2019 wireless plans, the better for Tidal \u2014 Spotify has found that customers who sign up for so-called \u201chard bundles,\u201d in which its music service is included in the standard monthly rate instead of as an add-on, end up keeping Spotify 80% of the time even after the discount period ends.\n\nTidal will need a lot of other things to go right to gain a toehold in the streaming space. Carrier partnerships can be lucrative, but also fleeting\u2014the heavily promoted AT&T-Beats tie-up ended in October. Eventually, the service will simply have to stand as a better user experience to overcome its competitors.\n\nRead more: How Jay Z\u2019s Tidal Press Conference Showed He\u2019s Out of Touch", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "A deal that brings Jay-Z's Tidal music streaming service to Sprint customers could give the fledgling startup a big boost.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "A bundle deal of cell phone service and music streaming could help Tidal gain a foothold", "title": "How Sprint Could Help Tidal Actually Succeed", "url": "http://time.com/3770593/tidal-sprint/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/468159920.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/468159920.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "How Sprint Could Help Tidal Actually Succeed", "description": "A bundle deal of cell phone service and music streaming could help Tidal gain a foothold", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "jay-z, spotify, tidal, beats music, streaming", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "Jay-Z, Spotify, Tidal, Beats Music, Streaming"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04ab\"", "article_summary": "Jay-Z\u2019s new music streaming service Tidal is facing a healthy dose of skepticism despite the high-profile list of artists that have invested in the company.\nA bundle deal would be especially helpful for Tidal, which lacks the name recognition of Spotify or the Apple-owned Beats Music.\nSprint, the third-largest wireless carrier in the U.S. with 56 million subscribers, is working on a deal with Tidal to distribute the service to its customers.\nSprint itself is currently offering six months of Spotify Premium for free to customers on certain wireless plans.\n\u201cIt is NOT a financial investment or exclusive partnership.\u201dDetails are murky, but there is plenty of precedent for deals between music streaming services and wireless carriers."}
