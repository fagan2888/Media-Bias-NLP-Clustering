But with the problem of too many prescriptions receding in the rear-view mirror, the problem now is too few.\n\nThe Florida Board of Pharmacy is reworking its rules for prescribing controlled substances. The concern among members is that Florida\u2019s efforts combating pill mills has left some pharmacists hesitant to fill valid prescriptions.\n\n\u201cThere were a number of enforcement actions taken against several pharmacies and it was well known,\u201d Michael Jackson of the Florida Pharmacy Association says. \u201cMany pharmacies began to have fear over just fulfilling their standard duties, and taking care of patients with pain, and created the situation where now, these pain patients are having difficulty finding pharmacies to dispense to them. \u201c\n\nUnder the current rule pharmacists are directed to question the legitimacy of a prescription in a number of different circumstances\u2014things like patients regularly losing medications or filling similar prescriptions from multiple doctors.\n\nBut Dr. Jesse Lipnick says the focus needs to shift toward reasons to fill a prescription rather than reasons not to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really, you know, the cup is half full,\u201d Lipnick says. \u201cThe cup is not half empty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to take an understanding that valid prescriptions should be filled,\u201d Lipnick goes on. \u201cRight now my impression is that pharmacists are responding to many pressures other than the validity of a prescription.\u201d\n\nThe board is still fairly early in the rulemaking process. Any proposed changes still have a number of steps to follow, including time for public comment, before adoption.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Florida is still grappling with the pill mill crisis of four years ago.\u00a0 But with the problem of too many prescriptions receding in the rear-view mirror,", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/state-pharmacy-board-revising-rules-pain-meds", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201509/442330713.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Florida is still grappling with the pill mill crisis of four years ago.\u00a0 But with the problem of too many prescriptions receding in the rear-view mirror,", "title": "State Pharmacy Board Revising Rules For Pain Meds"}, "story_id": 442330690, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Nick Evans", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "State Pharmacy Board Revising Rules For Pain Meds"}, "nid": 12043, "datePublished": "2015-09-22", "keywords": "prescription, pill mills", "wordCount": 372, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd19e\"", "article_summary": "The concern among members is that Florida\u2019s efforts combating pill mills has left some pharmacists hesitant to fill valid prescriptions.\n\u201cThe cup is not half empty.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s going to take an understanding that valid prescriptions should be filled,\u201d Lipnick goes on.\nThe Florida Board of Pharmacy is reworking its rules for prescribing controlled substances.\nBut with the problem of too many prescriptions receding in the rear-view mirror, the problem now is too few.\n\u201cThere were a number of enforcement actions taken against several pharmacies and it was well known,\u201d Michael Jackson of the Florida Pharmacy Association says."}
