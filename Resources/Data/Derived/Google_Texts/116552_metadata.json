You have to pay completely out of pocket to get that medicine, and the money you spend doesn't count against your deductible, and it doesn't count against your out of pocket limits, so you're basically on your own.\"\n\nThe plan had claimed it would rescue those with serious pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"So it could be that a MS patient could be expected to pay $62,000 just for one medication,\" says Dr. Daniel Kantor, who treats MS patients and others with neurological conditions near Jacksonville, Florida. \"That\u2019s a possiblity under the new ObamaCare going on right now.\"\n\nIn fact, one conservative group, Americans for Prosperity, is running an ad on exactly this subject, featuring a woman with lupus, an auto-immune disease.\n\nShe starts by saying, \"I voted for Barack Obama for president. I thought ObamaCare was going to be a good thing.\"\n\nBut Emilie Lamb says she later got a letter saying her insurance was canceled because of ObamaCare, pushing her premiums from $52 to $373 a month.\n\n\"I'm having to work a second job, to pay for ObamaCare,\u201d she adds. \u201cFor somebody with lupus, that's not an easy thing. If I can't afford to continue to pay for ObamaCare, I don't get my medicine. I don't get to see my doctors.\"\n\nOne of the problems is that drugs for some diseases such as MS do not have generic versions. So without cheaper alternatives and no help from ObamaCare, patients could face huge personal out-of-pocket bills, forcing some to skimp on their medications.\n\nKantor worries that \"this may drive more patients\" to not buy their medicines, \"which we know is dangerous,\" he says. \"We know MS can be a bad disease when you\u2019re not treating it. When you\u2019re treating it, for most people they handle it pretty well, but we know when you don\u2019t treat (it), it\u2019s the kind of disease where people end up in wheel chairs potentially.\"\n\nIn the commercial market, of course, drugs not on a preferred list would also be more expensive, but with a major difference, according to Gottlieb.\n\n\"You go outside that list, you have to pay out of pocket for it, but you do get some co-insurance, meaning the plans will pay some of the cost of that.\"\n\nSome say ObamaCare hoped to do better on that problem but ran out of time. Matthew Eyles of Avalare Health, a consulting firm, says although officials wanted \"to be able to make sure that all the systems were operational in 2014, they realized that they needed to give an extra year to get those systems changes in place.\"\n\nOfficials intend to try again next year.\n\nAdditional benefits cost more, though, meaning premiums would have to rise, or the networks of providers would shrink even further.\n\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
