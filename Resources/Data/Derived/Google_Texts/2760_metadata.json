Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2015\n\nTo Republicans on 2016\n\nWhere\u2019s the electability? Jeb is losing to HRC by 13 points. A Bush will never beat a Clinton. Wake up @GOP! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2014\n\nJeb Bush (and the Bushes)\n\nDo we really need another Bush in the White House\u2014- we have had enough of them. https://t.co/sbUVyBG6KE \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2015\n\nJeb Bush - \u201cI am a conservative\u201d = Barack Obama -\u201cIf you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your plan.\u201d \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2015\n\nJeb Bush gave five different answers in four days on whether or not we should have invaded Iraq.He is so confused.Not presidential material! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2015\n\nI cannot believe how bad Jeb Bush looks with his insane answer on Iraq, and then his numerous corrections which made him look even worse. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2015\n\nBush and Clinton\n\nRemember when Jeb gave Hillary a medal on the 1 year anniversary of Benghazi?! http://t.co/9b4goLdxTO Guess he would have invaded Libya too! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 19, 2015\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nMarco Rubio was a complete disaster today in an interview with Chris Wallace @FoxNews concerning our invading Iraq.He was as clueless as Jeb \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2015\n\nCritiquing Rubio\u2019s post-State of the Union water gaffe in 2013\n\nMarco Rubio is being crucified by the media for drinking water during speech! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13, 2013\n\nNext time Marco Rubio should drink his water from a glass as opposed to a bottle\u2014would have much less negative impact. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13, 2013\n\nBush and Rubio\n\nPoliticians are all talk and no action. Bush and Rubio couldn't answer simple question on Iraq. They will NEVER make America great again! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2015\n\nI laugh when I see Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush pretending to \"love\" each other, with each talking of their great friendship. Typical phony pols \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2015\n\nMike Huckabee\n\nI was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2015\n\nHuckabee is a nice guy but will never be able to bring in the funds so as not to cut Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. I will. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2015\n\nScott Walker\n\nGov. Scott Walker just left my office\u2014we had a really wonderful talk. Very interesting! @GovWalker \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2015\n\nRick Santorum (in 2012)\n\nWhen confronted, @RickSantorum can't defend his ridiculous attacks on @MittRomney http://t.co/PJ5tssfL \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2012\n\nOn Romney\u2019s decision to pass on 2016\n\nNow that Mitt is gone, all we have to do is get Bush to drop out and Trump to run\u2014and we will win! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2015\n\nHis recommendations to Romney for 2012 running mate\n\n@MittRomney should consider Gov McDonnell of VA, Gov Christie of NJ and Senator Rubio of FL for VP. Really good men doing a really good job. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2012\n\nThe time he quoted Ben Carson\n\n\u201cSuccessful people don't have fewer problems.They have determined that nothing will stop them from going forward.\u201d Dr. Benjamin Carson \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2013\n\nOn Hillary, Tom Brady and Deflategate punishment\n\nThey had no definitive proof against Tom Brady or #patriots. If Hillary doesn't have to produce Emails, why should Tom? Very unfair! \u2014 Donald J.
