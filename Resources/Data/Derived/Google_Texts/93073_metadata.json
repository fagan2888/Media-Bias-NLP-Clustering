But right at the heart of his success has been public opinion polling.\n\nNow, he will proudly \u2014 and loudly \u2014 tell you that he doesn\u2019t rely on polls \u2026 even getting into a very public spat with my own boss, pollster Frank Luntz, on the subject. Trump doesn\u2019t survey on issues. He won\u2019t hold focus groups. He has not poll-tested his strengths and weaknesses (as if, perish the thought, he even has weaknesses).\n\nHe wears the absence of political spinners and professional polling as a badge of honor to show his absolute authenticity: \u201cI don\u2019t have pollsters. I don\u2019t want to waste money on pollsters. I don\u2019t want to be unreal.\u201d\n\nBut public opinion polling is central to his success, even if his campaign doesn\u2019t actually do polling. Why? Because he uses outside polls to show not only his strength today but to prove his success tomorrow.\n\nHe cites them as Exhibit A of his narrative that he\u2019s a winner and the other candidates are \u201closers.\u201d And no one likes supporting a loser, right? So according to Trump, \u201cIf the polls say I\u2019ll win, then you, Joe Six Pack, should join me on the winning team.\u201d\n\nA sophisticated strategy this is not, but an effective one it surely is. He has led the field since July, except for the approximately four minutes in November when Ben Carson led.\n\nSo Trump\u2019s position as frontrunner is fortified by the polls, but he\u2019s not there because of them.\n\nHe\u2019s the clear frontrunner because he has effectively channeled the simmering rage and resentment of the 2016 electorate. From corrupt politicians in Washington, to being \u201cripped off\u201d by China, to America being overrun by illegal immigrants, he\u2019s tapped into a deep-seated fear and frustration that the American Dream is dead \u2026 and only You-Know-Who can \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nVoters see the politicians squabble endlessly on the nightly news \u2026 while the debt mountain grows \u2026 bureaucrats push pens with zero accountability \u2026 and the problems perpetually persist and multiply.\n\nIs it any wonder why voters are so angry?\n\nTrump didn\u2019t need an opinion poll to tell him that. He could have seen it in virtually any survey.\n\nAnd that\u2019s precisely why public opinion polls are so vital to American politics: Properly constructed and conducted, polls are the most effective means of gauging what the American people think \u2026 what they believe \u2026 and what they want from their representatives.\n\nPolls educate and inform, enlighten and instruct on what citizens truly believe should be the policies and priorities pursued in Washington.\n\nBut remember this: Surveys are navigational tools for campaigns and candidates \u2014 they cannot tell you what to think or do. For instance \u2026\n\nDo voters support or oppose sending ground troops to fight ISIS? Surveys show that more than half support, but only a leader can judge whether it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nWhat do citizens want most above all else? To make government \u201cefficient, effective and accountable\u201d \u2026 but it takes a statesman to figure out how to put those principles into practice.\n\nWhat kind of tax code do they want? \u201cFair and consistent,\u201d \u201csimple and straight-forward\u201d \u2026 but it\u2019s the job of a representative to translate that into meaningful policy.\n\nGeorge Gallup, the founder of modern-day polling, put it best when he said, \u201cWhen a president or any other leader pays attention to poll results, he is, in effect, paying attention to the views of the people.\u201d\n\nAnd there are consequences when they don\u2019t. Remember that President Obama and huge Democratic majorities in Congress pushed through the Affordable Care Act when polls showed a clear and commanding majority opposed to the plan.\n\nWhat was the result? A historic Republican sweep in the 2010 midterm elections \u2014 and the birth of the Tea Party \u2014 all because politicians rejected the polls and didn\u2019t listen to their constituents.\n\nIn so many ways \u2014 whether it be our version of the Great Wall, or the \u201ctotal shutdown\u201d on Muslims \u2014 Donald Trump is turning the laws of American politics upside down. And his Flat Earth approach to modern campaigning, voter targeting, message-testing just might work.\n\nBut for the other mere mortal candidates who lack Trump\u2019s clairvoyance, public opinion polling gives them a better understanding of the American people \u2014 and gives the people the strong voice they deserve.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Editor's Note: For an alternative viewpoint, see: Point: Is Polling Good for Democracy?
