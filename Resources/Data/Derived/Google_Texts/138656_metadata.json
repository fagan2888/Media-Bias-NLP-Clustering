Once it is incurred, it is better to pay it off. America, we have a problem.\n\nWe owe more than we can easily repay. We spend too much and borrow too much. Worse, we promise too much. We conjure dollar bills by the trillions\u2013pull them right out of thin air. I won\u2019t insist that this can\u2019t go on, because it has. I only say that it will eventually stop.\n\nI don\u2019t know the date, but I believe that I know the reason. It will stop when the world loses confidence in the dollars we owe. Come that moment of truth, the nation will resemble Chicago, a once prosperous polity now trying to persuade its once trusting creditors that it is actually solvent.\n\nTo understand our financial fix, put yourself in the position of the government. Say you earn the typical American family income, and you spend and borrow as the government does. So assuming, you would earn $54,000 a year, spend $64,000 a year and charge $10,000 to your already slightly overburdened credit card. I say slightly overburdened\u2013your outstanding balance is about $223,000.\n\nOf course, MasterCard wouldn\u2019t allow you to run up that kind of tab. At an annual percentage rate of 15%, the cost to service a $223,000 balance would absorb 62% of your pretax income. But the government is different from you and me (and Chicago). It has a central bank.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is the government\u2019s Monopoly-money machine. It sets some interest rates and influences many others. It materializes dollars. It regulates\u2013now regiments\u2013the nation\u2019s banks. It pulls levers to make the stock market go up.\n\nCongress is the source of the Fed\u2019s power. The Constitution is the source of Congress\u2019s power. The parchment enjoins Congress to coin money and regulate the value thereof. The founders viewed money as a scale or yardstick, something that measures value. The Fed views money as a magic wand, something that creates value.\n\nDollars aren\u2019t so much minted these days. Rather, they issue from the Fed\u2019s computers in billowing digital clouds. The cost of producing them is only the energy expended on tapping the keys. The Fed emits these electronic greenbacks to attempt to control the course of economic events. It\u2019s a heaven-sent monetary system for a big-spending government.\n\nYou may struggle to pay that midteens rate on your outstanding credit-card balance. The Treasury gets by paying an average of just 1.8% on that portion of the debt, held by savers and investors both here and abroad. Defined in this way, we owe $13.9 trillion. The $19 trillion figure ticking upward on the famous National Debt Clock adds the debts the government owes itself. (How does this pseudo bookkeeping work? The Social Security Administration takes in\u2013temporarily\u2013more than it pays out. With the surplus it buys Treasury bonds. The bonds enlarge the debt clock\u2019s debt.) It\u2019s not so important that the government pays itself on time. What is important is that the government pay its public creditors on time. So cast your eyes on the exact numerical rendering of that slightly smaller sum: $13,903,107,629,266. It is unmanageable.\n\nOne can assume that the creditors trust the currency in which they expect to be repaid. I wonder why, and for how much longer. The Fed once fought inflation. Now it actually sets out to cause it\u2013about 2% a year is the target. Striving to inflate, it presses down interest rates and rustles up new dollars.\n\nFrom the nation\u2019s 18th century founding until 1971, the dollar was defined as a weight of gold or silver. Americans did business with paper, of course. But these commercial bills and banknotes were convertible into monetary bedrock, the precious metals. The expression sound as a dollar derives from the ring of a gold piece when you plunked it on a counter.\n\nSound money coincided with balanced budgets. Government borrowings climbed in wartime and subsided in peacetime. The pattern was disarranged by depression in the 1930s and war in the 1940s. It was broken by the Johnson Administration\u2019s guns and butter and entitlements programs in the 1960s. Richard Nixon administered the coup de gr\u00e2ce on Aug. 15, 1971, when he announced that the dollar would derive its value from the say-so of the government. The Fed could print as many green bills as the traffic would bear.\n\nMany applauded that sea change, then and later. Easy money rarely fails to please\u2013at first. It buoys stocks, bonds and commercial real estate. House prices jump, and car sales zoom. (Average auto-lending rates, now 4%, have been nearly sawed in half since 2007.) Politicians, noticing how a bull market fattens public pension funds, ratchet up the benefits they promise to retirees (a fact that state and federal pensioners are encouraged to remember on Election Day).\n\nPeriodically, the buzz wears off. What remains is a hangover of debts and promises. The proliferating dollars facilitate heavy borrowing. Ultra-low interest rates mask the cost.\n\nI don\u2019t ask that we return to some long-lost fiscal and monetary Eden. None has ever existed, even in America. Crises and business cycles are always with us. I merely observe that sound money and a balanced budget were two sides of the coin of American prosperity.\n\nThen came magical thinking. Maybe you had a taste of modern economics in school. If so, you probably learned that the federal budget needn\u2019t be balanced\u2013it\u2019s nothing like a family budget, the teacher would say\u2013and that gold is a barbarous relic. To manage the business cycle, the argument went, a government must have the flexibility to print money, to muscle around interest rates and to spend more than it takes in\u2013in short, to \u201cstimulate.\u201d\n\nOh, we have stimulated. Between the fiscal years 2008 and 2012 alone, federal deficits totaled $5.6 trillion. The public debt nearly doubled in the same span of years, to $11.2 trillion. The Federal Reserve tickled $1.6 trillion in new digital dollars into existence. True, our Great Recession proved no Great Depression, but the post-2008 recovery is the limpest on record.\n\nA thin cheer went up in January when the deficit (calculated over the 12 preceding months) weighed in at a mere $405 billion, the lowest over any 12-month period since 2008. Only $405 billion. It\u2019s not so much, as Washington strums its calculators.\n\nLet us pause to reflect that a billion is a thousand million, and that a trillion is a thousand billion\u2013or, alternatively, a million millions. It\u2019s a measure of the fix we\u2019re in that the billions hardly seem worth talking about.\n\nIt\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s trillions\u2013the ones we\u2019ve grandly promised to pay ourselves\u2013that lie at the heart of the problem. The granddaddy of far-off commitments was Social Security, which dates from the 1930s. Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s and the Affordable Care Act in 2010 duly followed. The debt, as big as it is, is the measure of past spending in excess of tax receipts, a pattern of bad fiscal habits that traces its intellectual roots to John Maynard Keynes and has its dollars-and-cents origins with Lyndon Johnson and his Great Society. What awaits us and our children and their children is the unpaid tab of the future.\n\n\u201cNobody knows anything,\u201d screenwriter William Goldman wisely observed about the accuracy of Hollywood box-office forecasts. The economists, in general, are no better than the studio executives.\n\nYou can\u2019t blame people for not paying attention. America has forever defied the doomsdayers. The very language of government debt is calculated to tranquilize the critical mind. We speak of the Department of the Treasury rather than the Department of the Debt. (There\u2019s no net treasure in the Treasury.) We say entitlement instead of taxing Peter to pay Paul and Social Security trust fund when we mean just another ordinary government account at the Department of Debt. (There is no trust fund because there is no division of assets, no accounts containing funds earmarked for you, the citizen, who so faithfully \u201ccontributed\u201d your payroll taxes.)\n\nToday\u2019s miniature interest rates constitute another form of public sedation. You\u2019d suppose the doubling of the debt would jack up the cost of servicing the debt. Nothing of the kind. As the debt has doubled, the rate of interest has halved.\n\nIn 2007, we owed $5 trillion and paid an average interest rate of 4.8%. Net interest expense: $237 billion. In 2016 we\u2019ll owe $14.1 trillion and pay the average interest rate I already mentioned: 1.8%. Net interest expense: $240 billion. It\u2019s a wonder we didn\u2019t think of this financial perpetual-motion machine about a thousand years ago.\n\nDebt per se is neither good nor bad, though less is usually better than more. How it\u2019s priced and how it\u2019s used are what tips the scales. If chocolate cake cost a penny a slice, the best of us would be tempted to break our diets. Well, government debt is priced at less than 2%, and Washington fell off the wagon years ago.\n\nThe public debt will fall due someday. (Some of it falls due just about every day.) It will have to be repaid or refinanced. If repaid, where would the money come from? It would come from you, naturally. The debt is ultimately a deferred tax. You can calculate your pro rata obligation on your smartphone. Just visit the Treasury website, which posts the debt to the penny, then the Census Bureau\u2019s website, which reports the up-to-the-minute size of the population. Divide the latter by the former and you have the scary truth: $42,998.12 for every man, woman and child, as I write this.\n\nIn the short term, the debt would no doubt be refinanced, but at which interest rate? At 4.8%, the rate prevailing as recently as 2007, the government would pay more in interest expense\u2013$654 billion\u2013than it does for national defense. At a blended rate of 6.7%, the average prevailing in the 1990s, the net federal-interest bill would reach $913 billion, which very nearly equals this year\u2019s projected outlay on Social Security.\n\nWe always need protection against cockeyed economic experimentation. Once a national consensus on money and debt furnished this protective armor. Money was gold and debt was bad, Americans assumed. Most credentialed economists today will smile at these ancient prejudices. Allow me to suggest that our forebears knew something.\n\nKeynes himself would recoil at 0% bank-deposit rates, chronically low economic growth and the towering trillions that we have so generously pledged to one another. (All we have to do now is earn the money to pay them.)\n\nHow do we escape from our self-constructed fiscal jail? According to the Government Accountability Office, unpaid taxes add up to more than $450 billion a year. Even so, according to the Tax Foundation, Americans spend 6.1 billion hours and $233.8 billion each tax season complying with a federal tax code that runs to 10 million words. Are we quite sure we want no part of the flat-tax idea? An identical low rate on most incomes. No deductions, no H&R Block. Impractical? So is the debt.\n\nSo is the spending (and the promises to spend more down the road). We need to stop the squandermania. How? By resuming the principled fight that Vivien Kellems waged against the IRS during the Truman Administration. It enraged Kellems, a doughty Connecticut entrepreneur, that she was forced to withhold federal taxes from her employees\u2019 wages. She called it involuntary servitude, and she itched to make her constitutional argument in court. She never got that chance, but she published her plan for a peaceful revolution.\n\nShe asked her readers\u2013I ask mine\u2013to really examine the stub of their paycheck. Observe how much your employer pays you and how much less you take home. Notice the dollars withheld for Medicare, Social Security and so forth. If you are like most of us, you stopped looking long ago. You don\u2019t miss the income that you never get to touch.\n\nPicking up where Kellems left off, I propose a slight alteration in payday policy. Let each wage-earning citizen hold the whole of his or her untaxed earnings\u2013actually touch them. Then let the government pluck its taxes.\n\n\u201cSuch a payroll policy,\u201d wrote Kellems in her memoir, Taxes, Toil and Trouble, \u201cis entirely legal and if it were universally adopted, in six months we would have either a tax revolution or a startling contraction of the budget!\u201d\n\nBlack ink, sound money and the spirit of Vivien Kellems are the way forward. \u201cMake America solvent again\u201d is my credo and battle cry. You can fit it on a cap.\n\nGrant is the editor of Grant\u2019s Interest Rate Observer.
