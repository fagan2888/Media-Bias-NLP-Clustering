In a Facebook post gone viral, the child is seen crying because Barack Obama has been President of the United States all her life, and as all presidents must do, he is stepping down after his second term.\n\nMany on social media have shown the girl support, especially knowing that she shares a birthday with the current Commander-in-Chief, August 4. While many of us have been focusing on the politics involving front runners Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders, this heartbreaking moment reminds us that not everybody feels the same way about who\u2019s coming next to the White House.\n\nRELATED STORIES ON INQUISITR:\n\nLittle Girl Learns Breaking Up Is Hard To Do \u2014 \u2018I Don\u2019t Want To Break His Heart\u2019 [Viral Video]\n\nStraight Lost In Compton: Little Girl Found Wandering Streets In California, Police Investigate Toddler\u2019s Parents\n\nObama Is Going To Cuba, First U.S. President To Visit The Latin Nation In Almost A Century\n\nThe Facebook video gone viral not only has the now famous \u201cDranbaby\u201d crying, but comes with an explanation reported by the Independent. \u201cOn Saturday morning just before Gymnastics, [my] Dranbaby found out that our President Barack Obama was no longer going to be our President! He has been her President all of her life and [yes], her birthday is also on August 4! My poor baby!\u201d\n\nPossibly President Barack Obama\u2019s biggest fan is upset that he has to leave the White House.\n\nIn the video above, Caprina D. Harris attempts to tell her granddaughter that it\u2019s part of the process, he can only serve two terms, and his \u201ctime is up.\u201d The still distraught little girl responds with a heartbreaking \u201cNo!\u201d\n\nCaprina tells her that \u201cit\u2019s okay,\u201d and \u201cwe gotta vote for another President,\u201d and her granddaughter replies with a cry of \u201cI\u2019m not ready for a new one!\u201d She suggests writing President Barack Obama a letter, and continues to comfort her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, boo. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d Caprina then suggests calling someone and \u201cDranbaby\u201d asks for her mom, to which her grandmother tells her to calm down, so her mom can understand what she\u2019s saying.\n\nThe video hit social media with a wave of support, attempting to help the girl understand that she doesn\u2019t need to be upset. Among those showing support was President Barack Obama himself, whose response might help her cope with him leaving the White House in January, says the Root.\n\n\u201cCaprina, tell her to dry her tears, because I\u2019m not going anywhere. Once I leave the White House, I\u2019ll still be a citizen just like her. And when she grows up, she can get involved right alongside me. In the meantime, I\u2019ll keep an eye out for her letter, and we\u2019ll always get to celebrate our birthdays together!\u201d\n\nThis could easily be a launching point to help \u201cDranbaby\u201d get into politics from a young age, and possibly help bring positive change to our nation. Some day we might actually end up voting for what used to be this crying little girl and make history once more with our first female black President. Barack Obama\u2019s response may just be what she needed to hear.\n\nObama sends message to distraught little girl:https://t.co/bln3IqD6vj pic.twitter.com/KlULxRzPW6 \u2014 TheBlaze (@theblaze) February 21, 2016\n\nOur President for the last seven years has certainly brought change to the White House, introducing the Affordable Care Act which provides healthcare options to all citizens. He also fought for net neutrality, and has helped keep the internet free from control by corporations, meaning we don\u2019t have to pay extra to access Facebook and YouTube at the same time.\n\nWhat do you think of President Obama\u2019s reaction to the little girl in this video?\n\n[Image via Mike Theiler-Pool/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama has garnered plenty of support over his seven years in office, but a little girl has shown more support than most.
