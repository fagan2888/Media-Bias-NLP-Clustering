In early-2015, the company completed its acquisition of ARI Mutual Insurance Co. Later that year, AmTrust also agreed to acquire Republic Cos Group Inc, a Dallas-based insurance agency, from Delek Finance US Inc.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch is acting as financial adviser to ANV for the transaction. The acquisition is slated to close during the third or fourth quarter of 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, this adds to recent M&A activity in the insurance sector. In April, private equity firm Apax Partners announced plans to acquire 60 percent of insurance software company Duck Creek Technologies; and in March, The Carlyle Group (Nasdaq: CG) took a majority stake in insurance brokers JenCap Holdings and acquired the assets of Wholesale Trading Co-Op Insurance Services.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"status": "open", "domain": "Mergers & Acquisitions", "sailthru.author": "Jakema Lewis", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-05-19 12:24:00", "og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/business_services/amtrust-financial-purchases-underwriter-anv-from-ontario-teachers-pension-260379-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/insurancekeyboard.jpeg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "AmTrust Adds to Insurance Portfolio with ANV"}, "type": "Article", "brand": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-19 12:24:00", "wordcount": 268, "sailthru.title": "AmTrust Adds to Insurance Portfolio with ANV", "featured": 0, "sailthru.tags": "News, Business Services, Business Services, AmTrust Adds to Insurance Portfolio with ANV, ARI Mutual Insurance, Delek Finance, Republic Cos Group, Duck Creek, Article", "sailthru.description": "Earlier purchases for the insurance holding company include ARI Mutual Insurance and Republic Cos", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/insurancekeyboard.jpeg"}, "article_summary": "AmTrust Adds to Insurance Portfolio with ANVEarlier purchases for the insurance holding company include ARI Mutual Insurance and Republic CosInsurance holding company AmTrust Financial Services (Nasdaq: AFSI) is acquiring insurance underwriter ANV Holdings B.V. from the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan (OTPP).\nMeanwhile, this adds to recent M&A activity in the insurance sector.\n\u201cWe view the proposed acquisition of ANV as a transformative transaction for AmTrust\u2019s Lloyd\u2019s operation,\u201d says Barry Zyskind, CEO at AmTrust.\nANV underwrites commercial property/casualty insurance products through its three Lloyd\u2019s of London\u2019s syndicates, which it acquired from Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings SA in 2012 for $49.7 million in cash.\nUnder the agreement, AmTrust is also supporting the ANV\u2019s funds at Lloyd\u2019s and replacing the OTPP\u2019s participation."}
