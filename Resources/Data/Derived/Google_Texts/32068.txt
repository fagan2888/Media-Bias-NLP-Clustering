With the steady chop of blades slicing through the crisp air, every 20 minutes a helicopter lifted off on a sunny Saturday morning from Bowman Field for the short four-minute flight to a helipad at the Kentucky Exposition Center.

About a half dozen helicopters flew to the Expo Center for the world’s largest civil helicopter industry trade show.

Helicopter Association International’s Heli-Expo opens March 1 and features what HAI spokesman Chris Dancy described as “some of the coolest flying things in the world.”

Around 58 helicopters will be on display from March 1-3 in the Expo’s South Wing, with 700 exhibitors from the civil helicopter industry as well.

“Helicopters are just darn cool,” Dancy said with a laugh.

It's Louisville's first year hosting the event, which in years past has produced around $2 billion in transactions during the three-day expo, he said. Between 18,000 and 20,000 people are expected to attend.

The event is open to the public. Tickets are $235 for one day for non-HAI members, according to the HAI website. Students with proof of status can attend for $30.
