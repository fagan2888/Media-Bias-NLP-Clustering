As LifeNews previously reported, there has been debate among pro-life Republicans regarding strategy to de-fund Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion business and some have agreed to shut down the government in order to get their mission accomplished.\n\nSIGN THE PETITION! Congress Must De-Fund Planned Parenthood Immediately\n\nHowever, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and other leaders in Congress have indicated that this might not be the best course of action.\n\nThe Hill reported that Boehner did not rule out targeting Planned Parenthood through a continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government, but he did tell Republicans that even if that was successful it would not stop the abortion company from collecting aborted babies\u2019 body parts. Also, a report in Politico revealed that shutting down the government might not have any impact on the majority of Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding since a lot of it comes from programs like Medicaid and Obamacare.\n\nThis week, the U.S. House of Representatives is planning to vote on The Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 (H.R. 3134), which would halt Planned Parenthood funding for a year until Congressional investigations are complete. Then, on September 17, a Subcommittee on Health chaired by pro-life Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA), is scheduled a conduct a hearing entitled, \u201c Protecting Infants: Ending Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Providers Who Violate the Law.\u201d\n\nACTION: Help LifeNews raise $15,000 to expose and defund Planned Parenthood\n\nLast week, a House committee conducted their first Congressional hearing looking into Planned Parenthood\u2019s organ harvesting practices, and pro-life attorney\u2019s testified that the abortion company may be breaking multiple federal laws. James Bopp, the general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee, told the House Judiciary Committee that, \u201cRecorded conversations, released by the Center for Medical Progress reveal many legal issues with Planned Parenthood\u2019s procedures and practices regarding fetal tissue procurement.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThese procedures and practices of Planned Parenthood, and their tissue procurement partners, show that federal laws when applicable, have been and are continuing to be violated during the procurement and sale of human fetal tissue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Poll: 78% of Americans Say Don\u2019t Fund Organizations That Sell Parts From Aborted Babies", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The Daily Signal reports that a new Heritage Foundation poll found that 78\u00a0percent\u00a0of Americans agree that our country should not be funding organizations tha", "title": "Poll: 78% of Americans Say Don\u2019t Fund Organizations That Sell Parts From Aborted Babies", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/09/15/poll-78-of-americans-say-dont-fund-organizations-that-sell-parts-from-aborted-babies/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/defundplannedparenthood19.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "poll: 78% of americans say don\u2019t fund organizations that sell parts from aborted babies", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca9d\"", "article_summary": "This week, the U.S. House of Representatives is planning to vote on The Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 (H.R.\n3134), which would halt Planned Parenthood funding for a year until Congressional investigations are complete.\nCongress Must De-Fund Planned Parenthood ImmediatelyHowever, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and other leaders in Congress have indicated that this might not be the best course of action.\nThe Daily Signal reports that a new Heritage Foundation poll found that 78 percent of Americans agree that our country should not be funding organizations that sell aborted babies for research.\nAlso, a report in Politico revealed that shutting down the government might not have any impact on the majority of Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding since a lot of it comes from programs like Medicaid and Obamacare."}
