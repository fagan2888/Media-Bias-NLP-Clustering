The film is a satire about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nHowever, security researchers are questioning whether North Korea was really behind the hack and, alternately, are saying it looks like a possible \u201cinside job.\u201d\n\nCiting numerous experts, New York Times reporter Nicole Perlroth details why these claims against North Korea are so dubious, despite accusations by both President Obama and the FBI. Perlroth reports:\n\nFor one, skeptics note that the few malware samples they have studied indicate the hackers routed their attack through computers all over the world. One of those computers, in Bolivia, had been used by the same group to hack targets in South Korea. But that computer, as well as others in Poland, Italy, Thailand, Singapore, Cyprus and the United States, were all freely available to anyone to use, which opens the list of suspects to anyone with an Internet connection and basic hacking skills. For another, Sony\u2019s attackers constructed their malware on computers configured with Korean language settings, but skeptics note that those settings could have been reset to deflect blame. They also note the attackers used commercial software wiping tools that could have been purchased by anyone. They also point out that whoever attacked Sony had a keen understanding of its computer systems \u2014 the names of company servers and passwords were all hard-coded into the malware \u2014 suggesting the hackers were inside Sony before they launched their attack. Or it could even have been an inside job.\n\nBecause of the flimsy evidence presented, skeptics of the North Korea\u2019s claim are attacking President Obama for vowing a \u201cproportional response\u201d against the rogue nation.\n\n\u201c[I]n the post-Watergate/post-Snowden world the U.S. government can no longer simply say \u2018trust us,'\u201d writes conservative columnist and former national security official Paul Rosenzweig at the Lawfare blog.\n\nRosenzweig argues that if the government is \u201cgoing to speak to the issue at all it has to release information that persuades.\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cOtherwise it should stand silent and act (or not) as it sees fit without trying to justify it\u2019s actions. That silence will come at a significant cost, of course \u2014 in even greater skepticism. But if the judgement is to disclose, then it must be more fulsome, with all the attendant costs of that as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"In the post-Watergate/post-Snowden world the U.S. government can no longer simply say 'trust us.'\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Lauren McCauley | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "\"In the post-Watergate/post-Snowden world the U.S. government can no longer simply say 'trust us.'\"", "title": "Despite Box Office Patriotism, Experts Question North Korea Hacker Claims", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/despite-box-office-patriotism-experts-question-north-korea-hacker-claims/200215/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the_interview.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"In the post-Watergate/post-Snowden world the U.S. government can no longer simply say 'trust us.'\"", "title": "Despite Box Office Patriotism, Experts Question North Korea Hacker Claims", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the_interview.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "The Interview", "published_time": "2014-12-26T11:40:59-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1035\"", "article_summary": "\u201c[I]n the post-Watergate/post-Snowden world the U.S. government can no longer simply say \u2018trust us,'\u201d writes conservative columnist and former national security official Paul Rosenzweig at the Lawfare blog.\nPerlroth reports:For one, skeptics note that the few malware samples they have studied indicate the hackers routed their attack through computers all over the world.\nSecurity experts are claiming that, despite official rhetoric, North Korea was likely not behind the Sony hack that spurred patriotic zeal and widespread rallying around the Christmas Day release of the comedy film The Interview.\nFor another, Sony\u2019s attackers constructed their malware on computers configured with Korean language settings, but skeptics note that those settings could have been reset to deflect blame.\nMoviegoers cited \u201cpatriotism\u201d and defense of the First Amendment as reasons for watching the film, which was reportedly the motive behind the recent security breach."}
