He recently testified before Congress on Obama\u2019s extensive use of executive orders and administrative actions to make unilateral changes in Obamacare, immigration policy, minimum wage and the IRS qualifying standards for non-profit status.\n\nAs to Obamacare, Obama, so far, changed it in at least a dozen major ways, including, but not limited to, postponing the employer mandate, allowing insurance carriers to let their insured keep an old policy, and, more recently, redefining the Obamacare \u201chardship\u201d exemption so broadly as to nullify the individual mandate for at least two more years.\n\nWas this legal?\n\nTurley said: \u201cPresident Obama has repeatedly violated this (separation of powers) doctrine in the circumvention of Congress in areas ranging from health care to immigration law to environmental law. We are in the midst of a constitutional crisis with sweeping implications for our system of government. \u2026 \u201d We are now at the constitutional tipping point for our system.\u201d\n\nTurley challenged Congress to re-assert its authority. \u201cIf balance is to be reestablished,\u201d he said, \u201cit must begin before this President leaves office, and that will likely require every possible means to reassert legislative authority. No one in our system can \u2018go it alone\u2019 \u2014 not Congress, not the courts, and not the President.\u201d\n\nObama sold Obamacare with many now-broken promises. Saving costs was a big one. In 2009, the Congressional Budget Office set the net cost of Obamacare at $599 billion over 10 years \u2014 citing a gross cost of $848 billion less $249 billion in tax revenues and other cost savings. But recently the CBO revised the 10-year price tag to more than $2 trillion.\n\nEconomist Jonathan Gruber, the father of Romneycare \u2014 which was the template for Obamacare \u2014 recently admitted that well, no, costs will not be going down. \u201cCovering people with health insurance doesn\u2019t save money,\u201d said Gruber. \u201cThat was sometimes a misleading motivator for the Affordable Care Act. The law isn\u2019t designed to save money. It\u2019s designed to improve health, and that\u2019s going to cost money.\u201d\n\nSo, Obamacare won\u2019t save money, but at least those too poor to afford health insurance will now lead healthier lives, right? Not necessarily.\n\nOregon expanded its Medicaid program years ago \u2014 the way Obamacare does now \u2014 to include some of Oregon\u2019s low-income uninsured. Because of costs, Oregon did this on a random lottery basis. Some got it, some, unfortunately, wanted to but couldn\u2019t. But this allows comparisons. Oregon, for example, can now compare the health outcomes of the now-insured Oregonians against those who wanted to get insurance, but couldn\u2019t. Surely, the now-insured are healthier compared to those without health insurance.\n\nBut there were no significant differences in their health care outcomes. While the newly insured did increase their doctor visits for preventative and primary-care services, some could not get appointments with doctors, many of whom wouldn\u2019t take new Medicaid patients. Emergency room use went up 40 percent among the new Medicaid patients, not down \u2014 all for non-emergency medical needs. Forbes health care researcher Avik Roy writes, \u201cThe result calls into question the $450 billion a year we spend on Medicaid, and the fact that Obamacare throws 11 million more Americans into this broken program.\u201d\n\nWorse, the uninsured dislike Obamacare even more than do those with health insurance. A recent Kaiser Health poll found that among the uninsured, only 22 percent have a favorable attitude toward Obamacare, a far-lower percentage than the 56 percent of uninsured who are unfavorable toward Obamacare.\n\nBefore Obama became president, he said if he were \u201cstarting from scratch,\u201d he\u2019d go with a single-payer system. A few months ago, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid was asked whether Obamacare would lead us to single-payer. Reid said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d This is the real plan.\n\nSingle-payer is universal healthcare system used in Canada. It remains popular. But in 2009, the incoming president of the Canadian Medical Association said: \u201c(Canadian doctors) all agree that the system is imploding. We all agree that things are more precarious than perhaps Canadians realize.\u201d What did the outgoing CMA president propose? He said: \u201cA health care revolution has passed us by\u201d and \u201ccompetition should be welcomed, not feared.\u201d So while the Canadian Medical Association urges more competition and privatization, America moves toward even more government involvement in health care.\n\nIn the annual index of countries rated on \u201ceconomic freedom,\u201d the United States \u2014 since 2008 \u2014 has slipped from the No. 5 position to No. 12. Canada \u2014 at No. 6 \u2014 is now more \u201ceconomically free\u201d than the United States! Economic freedom and prosperity go hand in hand.\n\nYet this administration makes it clear it is more interested in wealth re-distribution and less interested in wealth creation. President Obama is quite adept at the former \u2014 clueless about how to achieve the latter.\n\nLarry Elder is a best-selling author and radio talk-show host.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "This administration makes it clear it is more interested in wealth re-distribution and less interested in wealth creation.", "title": "Obamacare: Abuse of power endangers the nation's health", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/4769837471-480x319.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/03/20/obamacare-abuse-of-power-endangers-the-nations-health/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "This administration makes it clear it is more interested in wealth re-distribution and less interested in wealth creation.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/4769837471-480x319.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "This administration makes it clear it is more interested in wealth re-distribution and less interested in wealth creation."}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7c4\"", "article_summary": "He said: \u201cA health care revolution has passed us by\u201d and \u201ccompetition should be welcomed, not feared.\u201d So while the Canadian Medical Association urges more competition and privatization, America moves toward even more government involvement in health care.\n\u201cCovering people with health insurance doesn\u2019t save money,\u201d said Gruber.\nBut there were no significant differences in their health care outcomes.\nSurely, the now-insured are healthier compared to those without health insurance.\nPresident Obama is quite adept at the former \u2014 clueless about how to achieve the latter."}
