Trump told host Breitbart Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon he won\u2019t stop at ISIS. He also promised to terminate Obamacare.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBannon asked Trump what his first actions would be as commander-in-chief in the first 90 to 100 days.\n\n\u201cOverall, I\u2019d start we\u2019re going to get new health care, we\u2019re going to terminate ISIS . . . we\u2019re going to terminate the order along the border, there\u2019s so many things within that first hour there\u2019s so many things that I can do,\u201d Trump told Bannon.\n\n\u201cNumber one, we\u2019re going to terminate Obamacare\u2026we\u2019re going to repeal it, we\u2019re going to replace it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go after ISIS like you\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Trump added.\n\nTrump also said that, unlike President Obama, he would focus on creating large and effective international coalitions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to form a group, [an international coalition of countries in the free world]. You know the one thing we\u2019re not doing properly, because Obama doesn\u2019t form coalitions, he just doesn\u2019t form coalitions. It\u2019s hard to form a coalition. We already have NATO, we\u2019re going to get bigger than NATO, we\u2019re going to add additional [countries to the coalition],\u201d he told Bannon.\n\n\u201cWe have to terminate ISIS. We have to get them out,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cI would hit ISIS so hard, and a couple of things we have to do. We have to demean them. I started to telling you about calling them \u2018the mastermind behind an attack.\u2019 What\u2019s a mastermind? Guys go into a theater and they start shooting people. That\u2019s not a mastermind. That\u2019s not like what I would say is a mastermind. These people are animals. You can\u2019t call them masterminds,\u201d Trump emphasized.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m watching these things on television. They\u2019re building these people up so much. We have to tear them down from that stand point. Psychologically and otherwise,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe added that the so-called \u201cmaster-mind\u201d of the Paris attacks was actually just \u201ca punk.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP Presidential front runner Donald Trump is vowing to \u201cterminate ISIS.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "GOP Presidential front runner Donald Trump is vowing to \u201cterminate ISIS.\u201d", "title": "Breitbart News Daily: Donald Trump Will Be \u2018The Terminator\u2019 of ISIS - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/GettyImages-493142634.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/19/breitbart-news-daily-donald-trump-will-terminator-isis/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP Presidential front runner Donald Trump is vowing to \u201cterminate ISIS.\u201d", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/GettyImages-493142634.jpg", "title": "Breitbart News Daily: Donald Trump Will Be \u2018The Terminator\u2019 of ISIS - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 GOP Presidential Primaries, Breitbart News Daily, Donald Trump, ISIS, Stephen K Bannon,Big Government,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Stephen K Bannon", "published_time": "2015-11-19T07:12:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Trump told host Breitbart Executive Chairman Stephen K.
