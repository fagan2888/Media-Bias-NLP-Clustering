Politicians who once had to cope with debacles like Boston\u2019s Big Dig are now faced with a whole new set of potential infrastructure fiascos as governments rush to build websites and try to keep pace with the Internet age. The murkiness of cyberspace, moreover, presents a huge challenge to oversight and new risks to those in charge. It\u2019s a lot harder for officials to to keep tabs on code-writers or would-be hackers than to monitor whether a tunnel has been dug or track has been laid. And yet, as the disastrous Oct. 1 debut of Healthcare.gov illustrated definitively, there can be political hell to pay if they're out of the loop.\n\n\n\nThough hardly the first technology project to end up embarrassing, infuriating and terrifying those responsible for making it work, HealthCare.gov has transformed technology into a tool in every strategist\u2019s arsenal. In its scale and visibility, its long build of anticipation, its potential to fundamentally affect lives and its role in fueling the caustic rhetoric of the past few years, it is sending a message politicians can\u2019t ignore: Failure is all too possible, and they really don\u2019t want to have to deal with the consequences of that.\n\nIn its final month of open enrollment, signups on the Obamacare insurance site are brisk and memories of its ignominious birth are fading. But the legacy of its chaotic launch is already evident in campaigns across the country. It\u2019s a rare day that Florida Democrats aren\u2019t blasting Republican Gov. Rick Scott for a \u201cbungled\u201d unemployment compensation website. Web troubles are also prominent in campaigns against the governors of Oregon and South Carolina. And in Maryland, the governor\u2019s presidential prospects and the lieutenant governor\u2019s hopes to rise to governor could be undercut by a health insurance site that\u2019s so flawed it\u2019s under investigation and may have to be scrapped.\n\n\n\n\u201cCampaigns have always gone after incumbents when there\u2019s a perception that they\u2019ve misused public funds or abused public trust. Technology now becomes part of that story line,\u201d says Republican strategist Michael Turk, a technology expert.\n\nCompetence is another battlefront for leaders trapped in tech nightmares, as they struggle with the original problem and then have to cope with the aftermath. \u201cThe perception is that if you can\u2019t get that right, can you get anything right?\u201d says a veteran Democratic strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s so visible and so fraught with peril. Everyone can wrap their heads around a computer glitch.\u201d\n\nTech failures are a standard feature of today\u2019s public and private sectors, from a mail outage at Yahoo to security breaches at Target, Michaels craft stores, the South Carolina Department of Revenue and a community college in Arizona. The Pentagon has pursued multiple tech projects that haven\u2019t panned out. The Internal Revenue Service conceded in 1997 that it had spent $4 billion to develop a modern computer system that would not work. Turk says he learned within days of joining the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 2003 that the agency had spent $800,000 on a technology study that concluded OMB already had the system it needed. \u201cI watched the government squander a ridiculous amount of money on technology,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat happens in the bowels of the bureaucracy is one thing; a high-profile website designed for consumers, however, is quite another. The political dangers mount along with the number of people affected and the level of controversy involved . It can be especially dangerous for politicians who have sold themselves to voters as technocrats able to oversee these types of projects, or who have special expertise in the policies involved. President Obama\u2019s high-tech campaigns identified him as a leader for the information age, for instance. Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley has a national reputation as a data-based manager. And Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber is a doctor who should know health care. The result in all three cases is a chasm between image and performance that magnifies the narrative of dashed expectations.\n\nO\u2019Malley delegated oversight of the Maryland exchange to Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, his political heir, no doubt counting on it to be a stellar resume entry for Brown. Instead it has provided an endless supply of ammunition to Brown\u2019s Democratic primary opponent, Doug Gansler, as leaders and contractors step down or are forced out, lawsuits are filed and investigations commence. \u201cStill No Sign of Lt. Governor Brown\u2019s Self-Professed Leadership on Maryland\u2019s Health Exchange\u201d was a recent and typical headline on a Gansler press release. No sign of O\u2019Malley\u2019s vaunted management skills, either. The governor, who cannot run for a third term due to term limits, says \u201cyou can\u2019t define an administration by one or two shortcomings.\u201d But the issue will certainly come up if he runs for president.\n\nThe Oregon health insurance website remains unfinished and beset by so many problems that people still can\u2019t sign up online on their own. State Rep. Dennis Richardson, a Republican candidate for governor, blames Kitzhaber\u2019s \u201cgross lack of oversight\u201d for the dysfunction. Last month he launched a petition drive to collect signatures for a federal audit.\n\nTech snafus are also part of Democratic offensives against two Republicans running for reelection this year. In South Carolina, Gov. Nikki Haley is defending her handling of a 2012 data breach that exposed records of 6.4 million taxpayers against the claim of Democratic challenger Vince Sheheen\u2019s that it reflects \u201ca pattern of incompetence and a culture of secrecy\u201d in her administration. In Florida, Democratic challenger Charlie Crist has accused Scott of \u201coutright deception\u201d in how he handled a troubled $63 million website that delayed many unemployment checks for weeks. Democrats are now going after Scott for his administration\u2019s hiring of Deloitte, the contractor that built the problematic jobless site, to create a Medicaid eligibility site.\n\nSen. Bill Nelson, D-FL., asked the Department of Labor this month to investigate \u201cpossible waste, fraud or abuse\u201d in the unemployment compensation site. Other lawmakers have asked federal authorities to investigate the Oregon and Maryland health insurance websites. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., says he wants to know more about why Maryland\u2019s exchange failed before the federal government throws good money after bad. Weak oversight, inadequate contractors and flawed procurement procedures are potential trouble spots, he said in an interview. Whatever the findings, he added, there will be political ramifications. \u201cYou have to take the blame when something fails,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI think that people were willing to prematurely take credit for success because they didn\u2019t understand the complexity of these problems.\u201d\n\nPolitics is not geared toward long-term thinking\u2014far from it\u2014but that is what complicated tech projects require. Consultant Victoria Grady, who teaches in the technology management masters program at Georgetown University, says people at her talks often ask what they should do if they have the money they need for information technology but they don\u2019t have the money for managing it. \u201cMy response is that you don\u2019t have the money NOT to manage these projects. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to be looking at a massive failure in the long run,\u201d she says. And whatever you do, she adds, don\u2019t rush. From the standpoint of both perception and performance, \u201cit\u2019s more important to get it right than to get it out there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "JillDLawrence"}, "keywords": "Obamacare, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201403050500, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Obamacare is just one example of the risks facing politicians who oversee major tech projects.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Even the Most Powerful Man in the World Is at the Mercy of the IT Guy", "tags": "Obamacare:Industryterm,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Even the Most Powerful Man in the World Is at the Mercy of the IT Guy\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/05/the-lessons-of-obamacare-s-fail.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/05/the-lessons-of-obamacare-s-fail/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46467213.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/05/the-lessons-of-obamacare-s-fail\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-05T05:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Jill Lawrence\",\"tags\":[\"Industryterm\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jill Lawrence", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-03-05T05:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jill-lawrencehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/05/the-lessons-of-obamacare-s-fail", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Obamacare is just one example of the risks facing politicians who oversee major tech projects.", "title": "Even the Most Powerful Man in the World Is at the Mercy of the IT Guy", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/05/the-lessons-of-obamacare-s-fail.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/05/the-lessons-of-obamacare-s-fail/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1394016403427.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jill-lawrence", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5d7\"", "article_summary": "Error MessageObamacare is just one example of the risks facing politicians who oversee major tech projects.\nThe Pentagon has pursued multiple tech projects that haven\u2019t panned out.\n\u201cI think that people were willing to prematurely take credit for success because they didn\u2019t understand the complexity of these problems.\u201dPolitics is not geared toward long-term thinking\u2014far from it\u2014but that is what complicated tech projects require.\nThe Oregon health insurance website remains unfinished and beset by so many problems that people still can\u2019t sign up online on their own.\n\u201cThe perception is that if you can\u2019t get that right, can you get anything right?\u201d says a veteran Democratic strategist."}
