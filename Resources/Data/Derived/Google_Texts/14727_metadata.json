She told her parents that a cousin had offered to give her a ride home.\n\nThree of Margo\u2019s cousins were supposed to take her home at 1:30 a.m. on Sept. 25. But when it came time to go home they couldn\u2019t find Margo and believed she had found another way to get home.\n\nThey drove home without her. The next morning, their mother asked where Margo was.
