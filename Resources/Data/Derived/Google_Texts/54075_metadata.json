Each one of them was given a box that had three separate sections, each with a hole in the top. A ball was introduced, which could be dropped into any of the three sections; but only one option produced a treat. If the ball dropped into the correct hole, the monkeys received peanuts, and the children chocolate. The researchers gave the participants time to play with their box and train themselves, in a way, to see which hole would produce the reward.\n\nAfterwards, three familiar peers who had been trained to prefer a certain section of the box, which was different from the participants\u2019 preference, dropped the ball into the box while the children or apes watched. The participants then had to choose which hole to throw the ball into. While the children threw away their original plan and followed the actions of their peers, the apes disregarded peer pressure and instead stuck to their guns, returning to the option they initially found to be rewarding. In a nut shell, human children were more likely to adjust their behavior based on matching their peers than the apes, who almost always stuck to their original plan. A previous study on conformity found similar results: that preschoolers gave into peer pressure early on.\n\nBut Haun believes that conformity isn\u2019t always a bad thing; in fact, it can help us. The fact is, there are positives and negatives in both conforming and not conforming, but perhaps what we don\u2019t realize is that conformity happens as a result of human nature, sometimes subconsciously, starting at a very young age. And it appears to differentiate us from primates.\n\n\"This does not mean that conforming is the right thing to do under all circumstances \u2014 conformity can be good or bad, helpful or unhelpful, appropriate or inappropriate both for individuals and the groups they live in,\u201d Haun said. \u201cBut the fact is that we conform often and that human sociality would look very differently without it. Our research shows that children as young as two years of age conform to others, while chimpanzees and orangutans instead prefer to stick with what they know.\u201d\n\nSource: Haun D, Rekers Y, Tomasello M.
