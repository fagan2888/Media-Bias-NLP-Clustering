But the Minnesota Court of Appeals ultimately tossed the regulations because of an \u201carbitrary\u201d threshold written into the rules.\n\nThe rule, adopted by the state Department of Labor and Industry last year, required sprinkler systems in all new homes of at least 4,500 square feet.\n\n\u201cWe conclude that the 4,500-square-foot threshold for one-family dwellings is arbitrary and not supported by substantial evidence in the record,\u201d wrote Judge Francis Connolly in the unanimous ruling by the three-judge panel that reviewed the case.\n\nLegal precedent says there must be a \u201creasoned determination\u201d for why administrative regulations like the sprinkler requirement, or any other aspect of a building code, would apply to some homes and structures but not to others, Connolly wrote.\n\n\u201cBecause the record does not include evidence of any reasoned determination to indefinitely exempt new one-family dwellings under 4,500 square feet, the sprinkler rule must be declared invalid,\u201d he concluded.\n\nSprinkler requirements have become more common across the country in recent years, usually the result of lobbying efforts by organizations representing firefighters.\n\nIn Minnesota, firefighters pushed for mandatory sprinkler systems during the 2014 legislative session, but the bill failed in the state legislature. After that failure, the Department of Labor and Industry took up the issue and approved the sprinkler mandate as part of an annual update to the state\u2019s building code.\n\nThe Builders Association of the Twin Cities, one of several construction and real estate organizations behind the legal challenge to the sprinkler mandate, says the requirement adds about $10,000 to the cost of a new house and argues it\u2019s unnecessary, since the vast majority of fire deaths happen in older homes that wouldn\u2019t have sprinklers anyway.\n\n\u201cSafety is the highest priority of Minnesota builders, and we are proud that new homes in Minnesota are among the safest in the nation. The sprinkler mandate would not have changed that safety record, but it would have made homes more expensive for Minnesota families,\u201d said David Siegel, executive director of the BATC, in a statement. \u201cThe Court\u2019s decision to invalidate the sprinkler rule confirms what the public, legislature, and code experts have overwhelmingly stated all along, the sprinkler mandate is arbitrary and not supported.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Labor and Industry says it is reviewing the decision. The department has 30 days to appeal the ruling to the Minnesota Supreme Court.\n\nCalifornia; Maryland; and Washington, D.C., require sprinkler systems in all new family homes. Similar rules have been proposed in numerous other states, according to data from the National Fire Protection Association, which supports the mandates.\n\nThe NFPA says sprinklers can buy extra time to escape from a house fire and can help keep a fire contained until firefighters arrive on the scene.\n\nIn many others states, the sprinkler mandate has faced a backlash from politicians who are wary about driving up the cost of new homes as the nation is still recovering from the housing crash of the past decade.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 34 states have prohibited the passage of mandatory sprinkler requirements, either legislatively or through the adoption of code.\n\nBuilders associations have argued there is nothing to stop homeowners from voluntarily adding sprinkler systems to their homes, and paying the added cost, if they want the extra safety benefits. Making the systems mandatory, they say, is overreach.\n\nOriginally published in Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Minnesota court on Tuesday threw cold water on state regulations requiring sprinkler systems in many new homes.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Minnesota court on Tuesday threw cold water on state regulations requiring sprinkler systems in many new homes.", "title": "Court Strikes Down Sprinkler System Requirement in New Homes", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/sprinklers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Le3kif"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Minnesota court on Tuesday threw cold water on state regulations requiring sprinkler systems in many new homes.", "title": "Court Strikes Down Sprinkler System Requirement in New Homes", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/sprinklers.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "regulation", "published_time": "2015-10-16T18:04:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "minnesota,regulations,minnesota court of appeals,builders association,department of labor and industry"}, "article_summary": "A Minnesota court on Tuesday threw cold water on state regulations requiring sprinkler systems in many new homes.\nThe rule, adopted by the state Department of Labor and Industry last year, required sprinkler systems in all new homes of at least 4,500 square feet.\nIn Minnesota, firefighters pushed for mandatory sprinkler systems during the 2014 legislative session, but the bill failed in the state legislature.\nCalifornia; Maryland; and Washington, D.C., require sprinkler systems in all new family homes.\nBuilders associations have argued there is nothing to stop homeowners from voluntarily adding sprinkler systems to their homes, and paying the added cost, if they want the extra safety benefits."}
