BOCA RATON, Fla. –Maine GOP Gov. Paul LePage Wednesday reacted strongly, and with a personal note, to news that President Barack Obama was soon to announce his plan to take executive action to shield millions of immigrants from deportation.

“It’s very shameful,” said Mr. LePage, who said he had followed existing immigration procedures to spend 11 years and $80,000 to secure a green card for a young Jamaican, now 29 years old, who he calls his adopted son.

“I should have just told him to go to Mexico and jumped the fence,” said Mr. LePage, who was here attending the semiannual meeting of the Republican Governors Association.

Among the other Republicans there who criticized the impending Obama move was Gov-elect Larry Hogan of Maryland who said the White House should not be setting immigration policy unilaterally. “You should really get the input of Congress and the American people,” he said.

Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback also criticized the move, saying that Mr. Obama would be wiser to move piecemeal immigration law changes through Congress. “The way to do this is to go for narrow shots,’’ such as expanding agricultural worker or high technology worker visas, Mr. Brownback said. “You’ve got to work with Congress.”

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the president was demonstrating “arrogance,” and he should work with Congress on changes to immigration laws.

“I hope there will be Democrats of conscience who will stand up and say this is wrong,” Mr. Jindal said about unilateral action. “The president can’t simply choose to ignore the law. There is a separation of powers for a reason.”

Mr. Jindal said that more needs to be done to secure America’s borders, while efforts should also be made to assist those who want to come to the U.S. legally.
