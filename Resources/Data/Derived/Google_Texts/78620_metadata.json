John Cornyn. But grumbling isn\u2019t the same as spitting mad.\n\nAfter a dozen years in the Senate and his climb to become the party\u2019s deputy leader, he\u2019s the definition of the \u201cestablishment\u201d many of them despise. He\u2019s not aggressive enough, they say. He abandoned Sen. Ted Cruz in the fight to defund Obamacare, they say.\n\n\u201cYeah, I hold it against him. Doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t vote for him, but I hold it against him,\u201d said Wayne Pharries, 48, a commercial banker who came to hear Cornyn address the chamber of commerce over lunch Wednesday at Wichita Falls Country Club.\n\nAgainst a weak field of seven challengers, that\u2019s likely enough for Cornyn to survive. Unlike Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and some others, he doesn\u2019t face a stiff tea party assault, and no outside groups have swooped into his state to make life miserable.\n\nWith that maneuvering room, Cornyn is warning against a purity movement that threatens to take hold within the party. He laments the impulse among conservatives of varying temperaments to let tactical disputes boil over \u2014 making his primary something of a test case for the ideological struggle simmering in races across the country.\n\n\u201cI get the fact that people are scared and angry. I share that same feeling,\u201d Cornyn told a group of 15 Republican women, meeting privately in a wood-paneled salon at the country club after his chamber speech. \u201cSometimes you can\u2019t do everything you want to do at one time.\u201d\n\nHe faced pointed questions. Several of the women voiced concern about schisms within the GOP \u2014 in particular, the attacks leveled at Cruz during the government shutdown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all trying to fight Obamacare. We had some disagreements on tactics,\u201d Cornyn said, explaining for the umpteenth time that his resistance to using a government shutdown for leverage doesn\u2019t mean his heart is in the wrong place.\n\nOne of the women on hand, Lisa Talley, a candidate for county clerk, liked his focus on long-term victory through party-building and winning back the Senate, rather than turning each legislative fight into a death struggle.\n\n\u201cSometimes you do need changes but \u2026 some things are tried and true,\u201d she said of Cornyn. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of common sense there, and with experience comes wisdom.\u201d\n\nAmong active tea partiers, patience, cooperation and compromise aren\u2019t key goals, though. And Cornyn isn\u2019t their ideal.\n\nA former judge, he\u2019s more measured than blistering in his rhetoric.\n\nWhen he won the Senate seat in 2002, gentle sincerity was a huge asset. Now, the look and demeanor that made him a senator from central casting, as he was often described, is more of a mixed bag to GOP voters.\n\nTop conservative rankings and backing from groups such as the National Rifle Association don\u2019t necessarily help.\n\n\u201cI will walk till my feet bleed to defeat Cornyn,\u201d said Margaret Casiraghi, 48, an administrative assistant from Houston. \u201cHe talks out of both sides of his mouth. \u2026 It\u2019s beyond me how he\u2019s worked so hard to sabotage Cruz and still has a possibility to get re-elected.\u201d\n\nShe was among the several hundred members of the King Street Patriots gathered in northwest Houston last Monday night for a debate between Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and his three challengers.\n\nOne of the state\u2019s most active tea party groups, King Street gave Cruz a hero\u2019s welcome after the government shutdown.\n\nCornyn was hardly the only Senate Republican to resist Cruz\u2019s hardball tactics on Obamacare. On the key vote to prolong a filibuster, only 18 colleagues sided with Cruz. But Cornyn is the only one who shares the same 26 million-person constituency, which makes Cruz the de facto benchmark.\n\nKing Street founder Catherine Engelbrecht won\u2019t speak ill of the senior senator. When the group was targeted by the IRS, he pushed back. He\u2019s also strong on gun rights and promoting the military, she said, but it\u2019s no secret that some activists aren\u2019t thrilled with him.\n\n\u201cWhen Ted Cruz stepped away from the pack and did what he did on Obamacare \u2014 those moments aren\u2019t going to be easily forgotten: Who stood with him, who didn\u2019t,\u201d Engelbrecht said. \u201cThat said, John Cornyn has been extremely helpful to our organization, and he\u2019s been good for Texas.\u201d\n\nThis sort of blunted criticism bodes well for Cornyn in the primary, especially combined with her assessment of U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman \u2014 Cornyn\u2019s best-known challenger.\n\n\u201cTo be very honest, I don\u2019t know that much about him,\u201d she said.\n\nStockman\u2019s challenge\n\nCornyn, who turns 62 next Sunday, is seeking a third six-year term.\n\nStockman, R-Clear Lake, is the only challenger in the primary who has run statewide. Despite a huge fundraising gap \u2014 $32,000 in the bank at last report, compared with $7 million for Cornyn \u2014 the challenger has a knack for getting attention. His antics have included offering \u201cObama barf bags,\u201d and \u201cIf babies had guns, they wouldn\u2019t be aborted\u201d bumper stickers.\n\nStockman held a House seat for one term two decades ago. He made an improbable comeback in 2012. He\u2019s run a low-budget guerrilla campaign, blistering Cornyn via Twitter as a backstabber to Cruz and other conservatives.\n\nThe operation exists almost entirely in the virtual world. Stockman doesn\u2019t meet with voters or grant interviews. The address on his campaign website is a UPS store in Friendswood, near his old house.\n\nAt the Kroger a few doors down, a dozen patrons said they\u2019ve never heard of Stockman. One who had, Rebecca Herder, 61, said the congressman \u201cwas just obviously here from another planet or something.\u201d\n\nHusband Richard Herder, 65, a retired program manager for a NASA contractor, also can\u2019t fathom Stockman representing Texas in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIf you vote for an idiot, you\u2019re going to have an idiot there for a long time,\u201d he said.\n\nA longtime GOP voter, he said he\u2019s concerned about growing extremism in the party. He views Cornyn as plenty conservative, and a healthy counterweight.\n\n\u201cCornyn is more level-headed and reasonable than Cruz. Cruz is scary,\u201d he said.\n\nImplicitly, that\u2019s the sort of attitude Cornyn is counting on to get him through the primary.\n\n\u201cThere are some loud voices out there, but I haven\u2019t met anyone who\u2019s really, truly, honestly questioned his conservative record,\u201d said Cornyn campaign manager Brendan Steinhauser. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of tactics and demeanor.\u201d\n\nHis last employer, FreedomWorks, provided tea party ground troops for the Cruz insurgency of 2012. This time around, that and other groups such as the Senate Conservatives Fund are staying on the sidelines in Texas\u2019 Senate race.\n\nSteinhauser asserts that\u2019s because the grass roots simply haven\u2019t been clamoring for someone to take on Cornyn.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not that opportunity here. The senator\u2019s done a good job,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Impossible standard\u2019\n\nCornyn has used his maneuvering room in the primary to push back against demands for ideological purity.\n\nSomeone who agrees with you 98 percent of the time can\u2019t be a \u201c2 percent traitor. That\u2019s an impossible standard. That\u2019s really unhealthy,\u201d he said during an hourlong meeting with editors and reporters at The Dallas Morning News.\n\nHe echoed that message the next day in Wichita Falls, urging collaboration among the party\u2019s many factions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to that sort of solution-oriented thinking instead of saying it\u2019s got to be my way or the highway. That doesn\u2019t work in politics, it doesn\u2019t work in marriage,\u201d he told the GOP women. \u201cThat can\u2019t be the standard. That\u2019s part of the conversation we need to have during the primaries.\u201d\n\nAs a campaigner, Cornyn lacks Cruz\u2019s electrifying edge. But he hits themes that appeal to tea partiers and business Republicans alike.\n\nAt Wichita Falls Country Club, he called Obamacare \u201can epic failure\u201d and predicted a GOP takeover in the Senate in November, thanks to backlash against \u201cthis experiment in big government.\u201d He pitched tax reform and spoke with dismay of federal power grabs and the administration\u2019s refusal to green-light the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\nHe\u2019s careful not to beat up on the tea party and instead to call for inclusion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a whole lot of difference in terms of policy between the tea party and the rest of the Republican Party,\u201d he said in a brief interview. \u201cThere\u2019s room for debate and discussion over those tactics but those will be pretty much settled on March the 4th.\u201d\n\nFollow Todd J.
