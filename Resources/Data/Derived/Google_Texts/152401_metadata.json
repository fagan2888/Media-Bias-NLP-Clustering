The pow wow was held in South Hampton, New York.\n\nThe four-day pow wow attracted many of the country\u2019s top singers and dancers with some coming from as far away as California. Lance Gumbs, the former tribal chairman and current Vice President of the National Congress of the American Indian, attended the event.\n\n\u201cEven though our reserve is surrounded by some of the richest real estate in the country, our people have managed to hold on to our culture and traditions for over 400 years,\" Gumbs said. \"We hope they will come away with an understanding that we are still here still vibrant and still strong.\u201d\n\nFor dancers and singers, the pow wow displayed both southern and northern dance categories, drum contests, hand drum contests and various specials. If you plan on dancing at next year\u2019s event, be sure you bring your tent and sleeping bag because hotels in the Hamptons are not in the budget of most people on the pow wow trail.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vibrant Photos From the 68th Annual Labor Day Shinnecock Powwow", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/vibrant-photos-68th-annual-labor-day-shinnecock-powwow-156788", "type": "article", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Vibrant Photos From the 68th Annual Labor Day Shinnecock Powwow"}, "abstract": "Vibrant Photos From the 68th Annual Labor Day Shinnecock Powwow", "dc": {"title": "Vibrant Photos From the 68th Annual Labor Day Shinnecock Powwow"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/vibrant-photos-68th-annual-labor-day-shinnecock-powwow-156788", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-09-08T11:35-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Vibrant Photos From the 68th Annual Labor Day Shinnecock Powwow"}, "article_summary": "By: Cliff MatiasLarge Crowds and great weather made the 68th Annual Labor Day Shinnecock Powwow a perfect end of summer celebration.\nThe pow wow was held in South Hampton, New York.\nThe four-day pow wow attracted many of the country\u2019s top singers and dancers with some coming from as far away as California.\nIf you plan on dancing at next year\u2019s event, be sure you bring your tent and sleeping bag because hotels in the Hamptons are not in the budget of most people on the pow wow trail.\nLance Gumbs, the former tribal chairman and current Vice President of the National Congress of the American Indian, attended the event."}
