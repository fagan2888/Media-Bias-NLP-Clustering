When a neighbor found Gardell face down in a creek and unresponsive, her entire world was flipped upside down.\n\nAfter nearly two hours of non-stop CPR, the Martin family was treated to what they can only describe as a miracle. Doctors at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pa., on the other hand, say it\u2019s the result of good training.\n\n\u201cRight before we did one last pulse check and Dr. Lambert and I were checking pulse simultaneously and we looked at each other and said he\u2019s got a pulse,\u201d Dr. Frank Maffei, a pediatric critical care doctor at Geisinger, told WNEP16. \u201cIn my 23 years I have not seen an hour and 41 minutes come back to this degree of neurological recovery. That doesn\u2019t happen by accident. It happens because people are trained.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rose, the cold water Gardell was submerged in actually worked in his favor by preserving his organs and his brain. It took 101 minutes of CPR before doctors were able to locate a pulse, and doctors said the push to keep Gardell alive required the help of nearly 50 people. Even more miraculous than his survival is the seemingly little neurological damage caused by the incident.\n\n\u201cEvery day is progress. Yesterday he started smiling and talking more, and today he is walking on his own,\u201d Rose told WNEP16.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "101, minute, miracle, 22, month, old, gardell, martin, was, able, pull, through, after, not, having", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "It took 101 minutes and nearly 50 people to bring 22-month-old Gardell Martin back to life after he was without a pulse for almost two hours.", "title": "Toddler Survives After 101 Minutes Without A Pulse [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/101-minute-miracle-22-month-old-gardell-martin-was-able-pull-through-after-not-having-326468", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/03/20/101-minute-miracle-22-month-old-gardell-martin-was-able-pull-through-after-not-having.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It took 101 minutes and nearly 50 people to bring 22-month-old Gardell Martin back to life after he was without a pulse for almost two hours.", "title": "Toddler Survives After 101 Minutes Without A Pulse [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/101-minute-miracle-22-month-old-gardell-martin-was-able-pull-through-after-not-having-326468", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/03/20/101-minute-miracle-22-month-old-gardell-martin-was-able-pull-through-after-not-having.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/20/101-minute-miracle-22-month-old-gardell-martin-was-able-pull-through-after-not-having.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-20T17:01:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-20T17:01:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "It took 101 minutes and nearly 50 people to bring 22-month-old Gardell Martin back to life after he was without a pulse for almost two hours."}, "article_summary": "Yesterday he started smiling and talking more, and today he is walking on his own,\u201d Rose told WNEP16.\nRose Martin was forced to live out every parent\u2019s worst nightmare after her 22-month-old son Gardell went missing just outside of their home in Mifflinburg, Pa.\nAfter nearly two hours of non-stop CPR, the Martin family was treated to what they can only describe as a miracle.\nWhen a neighbor found Gardell face down in a creek and unresponsive, her entire world was flipped upside down.\nIt took 101 minutes of CPR before doctors were able to locate a pulse, and doctors said the push to keep Gardell alive required the help of nearly 50 people."}
