John McCain (R-AZ) and Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX) wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that the U.S. faces what Henry Kissinger called the most \u201cdiverse and complex array of crises since the end of the Second World War.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Would Violate Budget Control Act with $34B More for Defense\n\nUnless Congress agrees to approve President Obama\u2019s request to lift statutory caps and a $534 billion defense budget request for fiscal 2016, Republicans will \u201cshare the blame for the national security failures that will inevitably result,\u201d the two Republicans wrote.\n\nIn throwing down the gantlet to members of their own party, they also said, \u201cHow can Republicans \u2013 the party of Ronald Reagan and \u2018peace through strength\u2019\u2014possibly justify a lower defense budget than that of President Obama?\u201d\n\nTheir plea for unrestrained defense spending comes after a series of congressional hearings in which Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, and the chiefs of the military services argued strenuously for doing away with the spending caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, Carter said the American people were justified in being fed up with wasteful Pentagon spending. \u201cThe taxpayer cannot comprehend it, let alone support the defense budget [given] cost overruns, lack of accounting and accountability, needless overhead and the like,\u201d he said. \u201cThis must stop.\u201d\n\nCarter\u2019s comments were unusual for a department that has wasted or squandered untold billions and not once provided a complete independent accounting of where its money has gone. Long-past controversies over $600 toilet seats and multi-million-dollar cost overruns on weaponry seem quaint by today\u2019s standards, in light of cost overruns of $100 billion or more to develop the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and tens of billions more for the highly flawed Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).\n\nUnless the law is changed, the more restrictive spending caps would be forced by a sequester, or automatic across-the-board cuts.\n\nRelated: McCain Moves Center Stage on War and Foreign Policy\n\n\u201cWe would have to change the shape and not just the size of our military, significantly affecting parts of our defense strategy,\u201d Carter testified earlier this month. \u201cWe cannot meet sequester with further half-measures. If we\u2019re stuck with sequestration\u2019s budget cuts over the long term, our entire nation will have to live with the answers.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans disagree over calls for an end to the caps, with defense advocates like McCain and Thornberry worried about military readiness and morale. Many fiscal conservatives, on the other hand, are wary of returning to runaway defense spending that would raise the deficit.\n\nDuring a recent hearing of a House defense appropriations subcommittee, several influential lawmakers on both sides told Carter and other senior DOD officials that the caps are unlikely to be changed anytime soon.\n\nRep. Betty McCollum (D-MN) said that short of a miracle, the Budget Control Act funding levels will remain the law of the land. Rep. Ken Calvert (R-CA) echoed that, saying that until the budget law is changed, lawmakers must abide by it.\n\nRelated: ISIS Destroys Second Largest Museum in Iraq\n\nRep. Kay Granger (R-TX) told Carter, \u201cI would beg you to be the person that says, \u2018Tear up that president\u2019s budget because it assumes that there\u2019s no sequestration.\u2019\u201d\n\nPresident Obama set the stage for the budget conflict in late January when he submitted a fiscal 2016 budget plan calling for a 7 percent increase in overall spending for defense and domestic programs above the statutory limits. All told, Obama\u2019s blueprint includes about $74 billion more in \u201cdiscretionary investments\u201d than would be allowed under the caps and sequester.\n\nWith Obama\u2019s approach, Congress would spend $534 billion next year on military operations, salaries and contracts \u2013 up $34 billion from the current base budget. It would also spend $51 billion more for overseas military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other war zones.\n\nIn their op-ed, McCain and Thornberry argued there is no national security basis for sequestration, given the mounting terrorist threat posed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the Russian-backed invasion and annexation of portions of eastern Ukraine, and China\u2019s more aggressive and coercive behavior in Asia.\n\nRelated: This Lethal Laser Could Cripple ISIS and Other Enemies\n\nLeft unchecked, the budget caps would force the Pentagon to cut defense by nearly $1 trillion in the next decade, seriously undermining the capabilities, readiness, morale and modernization of the armed services, the two lawmakers argue.\n\nThey also said government spending on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs is far more responsible for deficits and debt than defense spending.\n\nGordon Adams, a military expert and professor at American University, said that the fight among defense spending advocates and fiscal conservatives will likely lead to a compromise to slightly loosen caps on defense and non-defense spending.\n\nAdams said despite the heated rhetoric of defense hawks, many lawmakers responsible for drafting budgets and spending bills are aware there is plenty of flexibility within the Pentagon to move funding around to avert serious cutbacks in operations \u2013 even with the caps in place.\n\n\u201cThis is like a drama we\u2019ve seen so many times before \u2013 everybody knows everybody else\u2019s lines,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt seems to me it\u2019s obvious we\u2019re headed toward some agreement on the hill where they agree on a level for defense and a level for domestic that are slightly up from what\u2019s in the ceiling right now.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The battle to eliminate a spending cap on future defense spending intensified on Tuesd", "title": "Battle Over $534 Billion Defense Budget Could Get Ugly", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/10/Battle-Over-534-Defense-Budget-Could-Get-Ugly", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092012_Defense_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/10/Battle-Over-534-Defense-Budget-Could-Get-Ugly", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092012_Defense_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The battle to eliminate a spending cap on future defense spending intensified on Tuesd", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1269\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe taxpayer cannot comprehend it, let alone support the defense budget [given] cost overruns, lack of accounting and accountability, needless overhead and the like,\u201d he said.\nUnless the law is changed, the more restrictive spending caps would be forced by a sequester, or automatic across-the-board cuts.\nMany fiscal conservatives, on the other hand, are wary of returning to runaway defense spending that would raise the deficit.\nThey also said government spending on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs is far more responsible for deficits and debt than defense spending.\nWith Obama\u2019s approach, Congress would spend $534 billion next year on military operations, salaries and contracts \u2013 up $34 billion from the current base budget."}
