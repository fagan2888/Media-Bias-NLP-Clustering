A man and woman worried about the weather conditions asked the Coast Guard to rescue them Saturday.

The two were in a sailboat about 50 miles east of Cape Hatteras.

The Coast Guard 5th District received the emergency alert and sent a helicopter crew from Air Station Elizabeth City.

The boaters were located around 7 p.m. and lifted safely into the helicopter.

No injuries were reported.
