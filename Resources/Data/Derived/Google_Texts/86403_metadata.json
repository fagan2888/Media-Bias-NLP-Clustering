For years, Cruz has relied on his wife's private insurance plan. His wife is taking an unpaid leave of absence from her job at Goldman Sachs to join him on the campaign trail so they are no longer eligible for her employer's health care plan.\n\nThat means the two of them are required to get health insurance somewhere else.\n\nSince Cruz is a federal government employee, he says they will seek an Obamacare plan.\n\n\"We will presumably go on the exchange and sign up for health care, and we're in the process of transitioning over to do that,\" Cruz told the Des Moines Register on Tuesday.\n\nThe White House wouldn't officially gloat when asked about the irony but President Obama, nonetheless, did a victory lap on Wednesday on the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"It's working despite countless attempts to repeal, undermine, defund, and defame this law,\" he told supporters at the White House without mentioning Cruz.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz says he will still work to repeal Obama's health care law.", "title": "Cruz hates 'Obamacare' but plans to join it anyway", "og": {"url": "http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/americas/2015/03/cruz-hates-obamacare-plans-join-150325174531030.html", "image": "http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2015/3/23/861cb8a0c8c44908ac88688a4bea81e8_18.jpg", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz says he will still work to repeal Obama's health care law.", "internalurl": "http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/americas/2015/03/cruz-hates-obamacare-plans-join-150325174531030.html", "title": "Cruz hates 'Obamacare' but plans to join it anyway"}, "LastModifiedDate": "Thu, 26 March 2015 23:20:24 GMT", "image": "http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2015/3/23/861cb8a0c8c44908ac88688a4bea81e8_18.jpg", "url": "http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/americas/2015/03/cruz-hates-obamacare-plans-join-150325174531030.html", "google-play-app": "app-id=net.aljazeera.english", "guid": 150325174531030, "twitter": {"site": "@AJENews", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz says he will still work to repeal Obama's health care law.", "account_id": 4970411, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cruz hates 'Obamacare' but plans to join it anyway"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0 maximum-scale=1.0, minimal-ui"}, "article_summary": "But now - in an ironic twist - he plans to join Obamacare.\nIt requires all Americans get health insurance whether through a private employer or through the US government or pay a fine.\nThat means the two of them are required to get health insurance somewhere else.\nThe Affordable Care Act or \"Obamacare\" as it's commonly referred to was signed into law by the president five years ago this week.\nSince Cruz is a federal government employee, he says they will seek an Obamacare plan."}
