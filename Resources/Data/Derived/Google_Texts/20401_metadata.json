While there have been multiple terrorist plots in New York City targeting synagogues, overall little has come of it due to timely NYPD and FBI intervention (usually over the protests of the ACLU and assorted liberal groups.)\n\nBut while the Muslim population of the US is still not that large, the internet makes remote attacks all too easy. And that is what's going on.\n\nWhen hackers from a group called Moroccan Islamic Union-Mail defaced the website of Congregation Beth Am Israel in Penn Valley, Pa., in July 2014, the synagogue chose to look forward rather than dwell on the result of the cyberattack. \u201cWe rebuilt our site and have worked with our domain provider to strengthen security, with an eye toward preventing future hacks,\u201d Rabbi David Ackerman, leader of the congregation, told JNS.org. ADL said that in 2014, anti-Semitic hackers from the Arab/Muslim world targeted a Jewish high school in Albany, N.Y.; four Jewish institutions belonging to the Union for Reform Judaism in Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Georgia; a synagogue in Plantation, Fla.; and universities in California, Oregon, Utah, Missouri, Massachusetts. Yet not all hacking attacks pan out as planned. The global hacking network known as Anonymous has had very limited success with #OpIsrael, an annual campaign to carry out a \u201ccyber-Holocaust\u201d and remove all traces of the Jewish state from the Internet.\n\nThis is a growing problem because a lot of the basic tools for doing this are easily accessible and there are obviously not going to be any legal penalties for hackers targeting Jewish sites in the Muslim world.\n\n#OpIsrael, involving a Muslim subgroup of Anonymous using Jihadist signage, didn't succeed, but this remains an ongoing problem as Muslim Supremacist attacks continue.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "This remains an ongoing problem as Muslim Supremacist attacks continue.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "This remains an ongoing problem as Muslim Supremacist attacks continue.", "title": "Jewish Schools and Synagogues Face Threat of Muslim Hackers", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/259583/jewish-schools-and-synagogues-face-threat-muslim-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2015/07/untitled.jpg?itok=4t2F_ayz", "updated_time": "2015-07-25T10:48:42-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/259583/jewish-schools-and-synagogues-face-threat-muslim-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2015/07/untitled.jpg?itok=4t2F_ayz", "description": "This remains an ongoing problem as Muslim Supremacist attacks continue.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jewish Schools and Synagogues Face Threat of Muslim Hackers"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-25T10:12:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-25T10:48:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca948\"", "article_summary": "The large Muslim population in Europe has forced Jewish schools and synagogues to turn into virtual armed bunkers with few signs, heavy doors and heavy security.\nBut while the Muslim population of the US is still not that large, the internet makes remote attacks all too easy.\n#OpIsrael, involving a Muslim subgroup of Anonymous using Jihadist signage, didn't succeed, but this remains an ongoing problem as Muslim Supremacist attacks continue.\nThis is a growing problem because a lot of the basic tools for doing this are easily accessible and there are obviously not going to be any legal penalties for hackers targeting Jewish sites in the Muslim world.\nWhile there have been multiple terrorist plots in New York City targeting synagogues, overall little has come of it due to timely NYPD and FBI intervention (usually over the protests of the ACLU and assorted liberal groups.)"}
