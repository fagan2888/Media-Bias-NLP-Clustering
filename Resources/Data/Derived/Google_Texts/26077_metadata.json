They also play a major role in condition management and educate and manage at-risk employees. With the expertise of motivational interviewing, coaches can help employees develop a long-term strategy with health goals, hold them accountable, and monitor progress. All health coaches receive specialized training and accredited certification. With health coaching, members benefit from continuous access to a health professional, minimizing doctor's visits and associated costs.\n\nRegistered Dietitians\n\nFood is an essential part of life, and a balanced diet is at the core of health and well-being. While registered dietitians are informed with physical aspects of food, they also understand personal and emotional attachments. On-site dietitians can provide individualized solutions to barriers for eating healthy. They also provide guidance on weight-management and diabetes-condition support. The experts at Viverae know that a much higher level of accountability is present when someone is onsite because deeper levels of relationships and trust are built.\n\n\"We know that each client's culture is unique, which drives our commitment to personalized service.
