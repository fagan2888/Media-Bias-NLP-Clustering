Interactive Entertainment, Rated E 10+, $99.99).\n\nThe concept demands that a player build real Lego mini-block characters, vehicles and items (roughly 2 inches tall) and place them on a glowing toy pad (aka a dimensional portal) to enter the adventure.\n\nLord Vortech seeks the elements of time and space and enlists the help of legendary villains while imprisoning heroes in a story fueling a pop-culture explosion\u2019s worth of fun.\n\nSEE ALSO: Gaming Gift Guide 2015: PS4 picks - Rock Band 4: Band-in-a Box with the Sound Blaster X7\n\nSpecifically, the characters come from such varied licenses as \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d \u201cDoctor Who,\u201d \u201cDC Comics,\u201d \u201cLord of the Rings,\u201d \u201cSimpsons,\u201d \u201cJurassic World\u201d and \u201cBack to the Future\u201d \u2014 leading to some pretty awesome teamups (Marty McFly working with Peter Venkman or, how about Batman driving the Mystery Machine?).\n\nThe onscreen action is vintage Lego video gaming as the players destroy and build items, collect an ever-available supply of studs to unlock new stuff, solve puzzles and fight off enemies.\n\nA co-op option allows another friend to jump into or out of the game at any time, and players can have up to seven pieces on the pad and in the action at any time.\n\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Zadzooks 2015 Holiday Gift Guide\n\nWhat really shines is the mixing of skill sets and strategies for the child. The starter pack offers 267 Lego pieces to first build Batman, Gandalf and Wyldstyle (from the \u201cLego Movie\u201d and voiced by Elizabeth Banks).\n\nPlace the completed mini-block figures (tethered to a special disc) on the bare toy pad (connected via USB to the Wii U), play the game and eventually gain onscreen instructions to construct the dimensional portal on the pad and the Batmobile.\n\nThe pad or portal glows multiple colors during gaming sessions and is used to solve puzzles and thwart attacks.\n\nFor example, when the Wicked Witch of the West attacks the team, a player must move figures around on the portal to stop the villain from bewitching them.\n\nPlayers taking a break from the main story can also enter any of the unlocked Adventure Worlds such as Oz and Middle-Earth to find a new set of challenges and acquire illusive Gold Bricks.\n\nOffering a clever and humorous take on real-toy creation melding with virtual action, Lego Dimensions is a great gift that not only empowers youngsters to use their brains but makes parents feel good about Junior playing a video game.\n\nAction-enhancing gadgets or extras: The Starter Pack only begins the adventure, as Team Packs ($24.99 each), Level Packs ($29.99) and Fun Packs ($14.99) each contain more characters and world adventures for the player.\n\nFor example, purchase the \u201cScooby Doo Team Pack\u201d (81 pieces) and build Shaggy and Scooby Doo. Place them on the dimensional portal, and they immediately enter the game. This move unlocks the Scooby world (a location featuring a haunted house, caverns and a carnival).\n\nA player can then build (using onscreen instructions) a Lego model of the Mystery Machine and a Scooby Snack. By the way, the multi-layered sandwich gets consumed by the pooch onscreen and causes him to double in size and exhibit super strength.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gift ideas for Wii U owner includes Lego Dimensions Starter Pack and the Scooby Doo Team Pack.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Gift ideas for Wii U owner includes Lego Dimensions Starter Pack and the Scooby Doo Team Pack.", "title": "Gaming Gift Guide 2015 : Wii U picks - Lego Dimensions", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/28/gaming-gift-guide-2015-wii-u-picks-lego-dimensions/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/28/gg15-vg-lego-dimensions.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/28/gg15-vg-lego-dimensions.jpg", "description": "Gift ideas for Wii U owner includes Lego Dimensions Starter Pack and the Scooby Doo Team Pack.", "card": "summary", "title": "Gaming Gift Guide 2015 : Wii U picks - Lego Dimensions"}, "Author": "Joseph Szadkowski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Marty Mcfly, Warner Bros"}, "article_summary": "This move unlocks the Scooby world (a location featuring a haunted house, caverns and a carnival).\nFor example, purchase the \u201cScooby Doo Team Pack\u201d (81 pieces) and build Shaggy and Scooby Doo.\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Zadzooks 2015 Holiday Gift GuideWhat really shines is the mixing of skill sets and strategies for the child.\nThe pad or portal glows multiple colors during gaming sessions and is used to solve puzzles and thwart attacks.\nThe starter pack offers 267 Lego pieces to first build Batman, Gandalf and Wyldstyle (from the \u201cLego Movie\u201d and voiced by Elizabeth Banks)."}
