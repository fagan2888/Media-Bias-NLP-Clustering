But when, and on what terms, are questions that promise to inject uncertainty as state lawmakers construct a two-year budget in the next few months.\n\n\n\nAdvocacy groups for children, and Gov. Rick Perry, had hoped Congress would get the job done by now. It hasn't, apparently leaving the task to a new set of federal lawmakers.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom the advocates\u2019 perspective, this is a no-brainer,\u201d said Laura Guerra-Cardus, associate director of the Children\u2019s Defense Fund-Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s no good intention to delay reauthorizing the funding. States need that flexibility of being able to plan their budget.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the bipartisan-backed CHIP was extended through 2019. But the federal dollars sent to states that operate the program are set to run out after Sept. 30, 2015. Texas gets about $70 in matching funds for every $30 it spends on CHIP, which covers health services for uninsured, low-income children.\n\nThe Children\u2019s Defense Fund-Texas was one of 34 Texas-based organizations that signed on to a national letter urging Congress to extend CHIP funding.\n\nThough both Republicans and Democrats in Washington have said they support extending funding for CHIP, Congress will likely not reauthorize funding before the start of legislative session in January, creating questions for the new slate of state leaders and lawmakers responsible for the state's budget.\n\nAdvocates count support from Perry, who wrote the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce in October that \u201cthe sooner action is taken, the more predictability and stability Congress will provide to state appropriators.\"\n\nIn fiscal year 2014, Texas CHIP provided a variety of health services to 524,658 children, according to Perry's letter. Because of income eligibility changes under the Affordable Care Act, Texas has seen shrinking enrollment in CHIP as some children are moved into the Medicaid program, the joint federal-state insurer of poor children and the disabled. But the program still serves a substantial number of Texas children.\n\nGov.-elect Greg Abbott's office did not respond to multiple requests for his position on CHIP funding.\n\n\n\nAdvocates are also concerned that the federal matching rate could change from the current 70-30 formula. If the match were to drop, the state would have to put up more of its own money to continue funding CHIP at its current level.\n\n\u201cIf we're going to budget for the 2016-2017 biennium, we\u2019ll need to have that reassurance that we\u2019ll have the federal match and that level of federal match is going to be there,\u201d said Clayton Travis, advocacy and health policy coordinator at the Texas Pediatric Society. \u201cIf we pass something early spring, I don\u2019t think that would cause too much heartache or heartburn at the state level, but any later than that we\u2019re getting a little too close to the budget being completed.\u201d\n\nIf Congress does not reauthorize CHIP funding before lawmakers finalize the state budget, the Legislature could construct one based on estimates for the federal dollars it expects to receive and the state\u2019s matching funds, said R.J. DeSilva, spokesman for the state\u2019s Legislative Budget Board.\n\nState lawmakers are not sounding the alarm on CHIP funding just yet. State Rep. Richard Pe\u00f1a Raymond, D-Laredo, said he expects the money will come through because of the bipartisan support to properly fund the program.\n\n\u201cYou always have to be concerned with that\u2019s going on in Washington,\u201d said Raymond, who chairs the House Human Services Committee. \u201cBut I certainly feel confident that by the time we get through the process, we\u2019ll figure it out and we\u2019ll get it right.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
