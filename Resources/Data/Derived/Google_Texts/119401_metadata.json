But when Vladimir Putin woke up on Tuesday morning, a day after delivering his first address to the United National General Assembly in 10 years, even he must have been pleasantly surprised by what he read.\n\n\u201cVladimir Putin Steals Barack Obama\u2019s Thunder on the World Stage,\u201d read one headline.\n\nRelated: Putin Claims Russia Is Cleaning Up Obama\u2019s Mess in Syria\n\n\u201cObama Has Turned Putin into the World\u2019s Most Powerful Leader,\u201d read another.\n\n\u201cAt the U.N., Putin Checkmates Obama on Ukraine, Syria, ISIS,\u201d went one more.\n\nNow, Putin can presumably order up whatever headline he wants from TASS, Sputnik or Russia Today \u2013 all of which are government-controlled and have English-language versions meant to spread the Kremlin\u2019s message abroad. What likely surprised him was that the headlines above, and others like them, were from U.S. news outlets. In order, they were published by CNN, the New York Post, and the Washington Examiner.\n\nThe Russian media outlets, in fact, were relatively restrained compared to some of the U.S. coverage of the clash between Obama and Putin on Monday. The U.S. president spoke harshly about Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and its support of Bashar al-Assad, the beleaguered Syrian dictator whom Obama characterized as a murderous despot who must be removed.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s UN Speech Masks an Off-Balance US Foreign Policy\n\nPutin blamed the U.S. policy of fomenting regime change for the unrest in the Mideast in general and Syria in particular, and said it would be an \u201cenormous mistake\u201d to fail to support Assad who, he said, leads one of the only armies \u201ctruly\u201d battling the terror group ISIS.\n\nHe also announced that in its capacity as current chair of the UN Security Council, Russia would convene a ministerial meeting aimed at creating a new coalition to fight ISIS \u2013 this in addition to the announcement that Iran, Iraq, Russia and Syria had all recently announced an intelligence-sharing agreement to coordinate the fight against ISIS.\n\nWhen the dust cleared, many U.S. outlets \u2013 particularly those of a conservative bent \u2013 adjudged Putin the winner.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page declared that Obama had been \u201ccornered\u201d by Putin and Iran on the Syria question and noted that \u201cMr. Putin publicly laughs at the feeble U.S. efforts to build a pro-Western anti-Islamic State coalition.\u201d\n\nRelated: With Xi and Putin, Obama Sets U.S. on a Course of Confusion\n\nPutin\u2019s apparent public relations victory on Monday was even more of a success than most in the West realize, because of the way it will play to a Russian audience.\n\nWhen Putin first came to power more than 15 years ago, he set about winning over the Russian people by extracting the Russian Federation from the economic morass left behind by decades of failed Communist rule. He was largely successful, and the Russian people loved him for it.\n\nPutin\u2019s trouble now is that the Russian economy is under pressure on various fronts. Overly dependent on the sale of oil and natural gas, the Russian economy is faltering because of plummeting energy prices. International sanctions related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula and continued support of armed insurgents in other parts of the country have also taken a toll. The ruble is worth about half of what it was a year and a half ago.\n\nFaced with a population experiencing greater and greater economic pain, Putin has made his new mission not to restore Russia\u2019s economy but to restore its image in the world. He has, almost explicitly, promised to turn Russia back into a superpower again.\n\nRelated: As Russian Weapons Stream in, How Far Will Putin Go in Syria?\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s increased military assertiveness, the Crimean invasion and now the presence of Russian troops in Syria combined with Putin\u2019s very public effort to take on a leadership role in the Middle East are all part of that effort.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s not at all clear that Russia has the capacity to project the kind of global power that the former Soviet Union did during the years of the Cold War. The Russian Federation is smaller, poorer and weaker than the Communist empire that eventually crumbled under its own weight at the end of the last century.\n\nFor Putin though, the issue may not be so much the long-term success of an effort to rebuild Russian global influence but the short-term gain that looking like a major world power again provides him in the domestic political arena. If nothing else, it might buy time to engineer a much-needed economic recovery.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When you run a heavy-handed government that has systematically beaten down most of the", "title": "Even in the U.S., Putin Is Crowned Winner in U.N.
