Republican leaders, however, hope to remove a key barrier to getting agreement among their ranks.\n\nDespite the desire of Speaker John A. Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to avoid government shutdown drama, they have yet to settle on a strategy for preventing one while satisfying hardline conservatives who say they will not vote for any spending bill that provides money for Planned Parenthood . Although the House will vote on two abortion bills this week, a nod to conservatives who insist Congress has to take action after the release of a series of undercover videos showing Planned Parenthood executives discussing the harvesting of fetal tissue, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise is putting a new option on the table.\n\nIn an interview with CQ Roll Call Tuesday afternoon, the Louisiana Republican said he was discussing with members the possibility of using the budget reconciliation process to cut off federal funding to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue meeting with our members when we get back Wednesday and through the weekend until we all come together on a full strategy to go after Planned Parenthood,\u201d Scalise said en route back to Washington, D.C., from his district. \u201cWe want to keep the pressure on them.\u201d\n\n\"There's no silver bullet,\" he continued, refusing to rule out defunding language in an appropriations vehicle. But he emphasized that \u201cif one of the objectives is to get a bill on President Obama\u2019s desk that defunds Planned Parenthood, then budget reconciliation is the one way to ensure that happens,\" adding, \u201cThis is the most surefire way.\u201d\n\nIn the Senate, most bills need a 60-vote threshold to move forward. Reconciliation measures only require a simple majority for passage.\n\nReconciliation bills, which are limited to measures that would result in changes in revenue and spending, can only be pursued once both chambers agree to a budget resolution.\n\nHaving passed the joint budget resolution earlier this year, GOP lawmakers faced the question of what to use the reconciliation process for. Many have advocating gutting the Affordable Care Act, for instance.\n\nScalise said defunding Planned Parenthood through reconciliation would not preclude that same bill from also repealing Obamacare. He would not say specifically whom he had briefed on his proposal, or whether other GOP leaders were looped in, but he did say he had spoken to members of three committees of jurisdiction: Education and the Workforce, Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce.\n\n\u201cObamacare repeal is still on the table and the primary objective of budget reconciliation,\u201d Scalise stressed. \u201cThe two can be combined if that\u2019s the route we choose.\u201d\n\nHe has not yet taken his idea to the Senate.\n\nThe big question is whether Republicans would be satisfied with a hypothetical reconciliation process or are willing to be firm and shut down the government over a CR that has Planned Parenthood money in it.\n\nDemocrats are already racing to tag Republicans as the party of government shutdown. On Tuesday, the Bridge Project, an affiliate of American Bridge 21st Century, released a 21-page report of quotes from Republican leadership swearing there won't be another government shutdown.\n\nAnd while Bridge Project will put most of its focus on Senate Republicans in competitive races in 2016, there are two notable additions to the list: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul , a GOP presidential candidate who is also up for re-election this cycle, and McConnell.\n\nIt's no surprise the effort includes a reminder of McConnell\u2019s declaration in Louisville, Ky., the day after last year\u2019s elections when he said, \u201cLet me make it clear: There will be no government shutdowns and no default on the national debt,\u201d under the new Republican majority he would preside over in the Senate.\n\nIn addition to Kentucky, Bridge Project is tailoring its message for Arizona, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAnd the Senate Majority PAC, the political action committee associated with Minority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev., is gearing up as well, sending an email blast to supporters Tuesday featuring a ticking clock animation with a dire warning about there being just 16 days until a shutdown.\n\n\u201cRight-wing extremists, led by Sen. Ted Cruz , are 16 DAYS away from forcing a total government shutdown unless Planned Parenthood is defunded,\u201d the email says.\n\nOn the political side, though, some Republicans argue that the electoral impact of the 2013 shutdown wasn't so bad for the GOP: The party picked up more than a dozen seats in the House and nine in the Senate.\n\nBut it's unclear how much of a factor the shutdown played. For one, the 2013 shutdown was followed by the botched rollout of Obamacare's website.\n\nThe Senate gains could have been the result of which seats were up for re-election. And as bad as the map was for Democrats in 2014, it's far worse for Republicans in 2016.\n\nNiels Lesniewski contributed to this report.\n\nRelated:\n\nSee photos, follies, HOH Hits and Misses and more at Roll Call's new video site.
