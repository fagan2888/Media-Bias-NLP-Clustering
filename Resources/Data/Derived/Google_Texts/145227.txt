Here’s another excellent how-to video from the University of Maine Cooperative Extension — this time, on planting strawberries.

Strawberries are usually planted in May or June, so now is a great time to start planning. It will take a year before you can actually pick them, says David Handley, the Cooperative Extension’s vegetable and small fruit specialist, who shows you step-by-step how and where to plant your first plants.

Handley’s really comprehensive guide has more videos — including how to prepare the soil (pH matters), what kinds of varieties to use, and how to use mulch to protect your plants in the winter.
