To celebrate, every synagogue in the area will be taking part in special Shabbat services June 20-22.\n\nThe theme: Jewish healing.\n\n\u201cIn Torah, there is a requirement that active participation in health is part of our tradition,\u201d said Donna Waldman, the clinic\u2019s director. \u201cNot sitting by and letting people die is part of our tradition. We have a long history of healing.\u201d\n\nParticipating in the special Shabbat services will be Congregations Shomrei Torah and Beth Ami of Santa Rosa, Ner Shalom of Cotati, B\u2019nai Israel of Petaluma and the Sonoma County Chabad Jewish Center.\n\nWaldman said rabbis will touch on aspects of the Jewish healing tradition in their sermons and Torah study groups over the weekend. JCFC officials will attend, in part to get word out about the free clinic and its vital work and in part to let people know about ways they can volunteer and offer support.\n\nThen on Sunday, June 22, one and all are invited for the hanging of a mezuzah at 50 Montgomery Drive, just a few blocks from the city\u2019s downtown.\n\nFor the clinic, which was founded by Dr. Robin Lowitz in 2001, it\u2019s a big moment. What started as a one-day-a-week operation in a converted, one-room Lion\u2019s Club clubhouse with a mission to pursue tzedakah (charity) and tikkun olam (repair of the world) has become an important part of Sonoma County\u2019s health care system.\n\nTreating the uninsured, the recently unemployed, the undocumented, the chronically ill and others, the clinic provides free drop-in medical care and social services.\n\nAfter its first year, the clinic increased its services to a few days a week, and then to seven days a week after it began renting a facility that was better equipped to provide services such as family medicine, vaccines, medications, lab tests, acupuncture and physicals, all paid for by donations.\n\nDoctors, nurses, nurse practitioners and medical assistants, more than 150 in all, serve on a voluntary basis and provide what Waldman estimated as more than $600,000 in services annually.\n\nOne thing the rented location in Rohnert Park did not have was adequate office space for the clinic\u2019s staff of six, so when a call came seven months ago about a new building in Santa Rosa\u2019s medical district, the board jumped on the donation offer. Escrow closed quickly, and after a little paint and repair work brought the facility up to speed, it is ready for its debut. During the transition, the clinic has been shut for a month.\n\n\u201cUp until now, the clinic has had a low profile in the Jewish community,\u201d said Rabbi George Gittleman of Congregation Shomrei Torah. \u201cMany Jews volunteer there and those who know of the clinic\u2019s work are proud of what they do. What we are trying to do now is raise the profile of the clinic in the Jewish community \u2014 for more support, but also to expand people\u2019s sense of what it means to be Jewish in Sonoma County.\u201d\n\nWaldman said the clinic is a godsend to the people who need it, although she has noticed a marked decrease in uninsured clients since the advent of the Affordable Care Act. Now the clinic is helping people sign up for Covered California, she said.\n\nFull health care coverage for all Californians may still be years away, but for a free clinic, it\u2019s a prized future goal.\n\n\u201cWe would love to put ourselves out of business,\u201d Waldman said.\n\n\n\nJewish Community Free Clinic mezuzah hanging, 11 a.m. Sunday, June 22, 50 Montgomery Drive, Santa Rosa.
