Just in time, the DNC has put up a website to help you talk sense with your Republican family members.\n\nChange the conversation, change the world\n\nShare this\n\nAre you headed to your parents' or grandparents' home for the holidays? Do you have one or more family members who you just know will be so excited about voting for Donald Trump, or want to bash Obamacare?\n\nFear not!\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has you covered.\n\nTheir new website, Your Republican Uncle, offers \"the most common myths spouted by your family members who spend too much time listening to Rush Limbaugh and the perfect response to each of them.\"\n\nFor instance, if your faced with a family member who says, \"Donald Trump is a successful businessman \u2014 he\u2019ll be great for the economy,\" you now have a great response:\n\n\"Multiple declarations of bankruptcy aside, a President Trump would help the economy as much as any other Republican (which is to say, not at all). Trump\u2019s plan would add trillions \u2014 with a 't' \u2014 to the deficit over the next decade. That\u2019s bad leadership in the board room and the Oval Office.\"\n\nOr, if your less-than supportive relative, or invited family friend spouts off, saying, \"I just don\u2019t think gay couples should be able to get married. This is the end of the American family as we know it,\" you can tell them:\n\n\"We\u2019re still gathered together, aren\u2019t we? History will remember this summer\u2019s marriage equality decision as a huge victory for equality, but there\u2019s still more work to do for LGBT Americans. We need to make sure they aren\u2019t discriminated against at work, for one.\"\n\nPerfect!\n\nNot heading home for the holidays, or not \"Republican uncle\" to deal with?
