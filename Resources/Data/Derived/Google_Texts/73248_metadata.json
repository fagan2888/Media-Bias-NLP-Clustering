(Such head-to-head battles, like great inter-urban sporting events, fuel the illusion that cities are singular, indivisible, cultural entities.) In this case, it was a race to the bottom: Observers noticed, during the five-day air quality crisis in Paris last week, that there was more particulate matter in the Parisian atmosphere than in Beijing.\n\nThis was true, for a moment, but the comparison soon backfired on certain gleeful Chinese media outlets. When the proper way to explain the hazardousness of the air is by saying it\u2019s \u201cworse than Beijing,\u201d nobody has anything to brag about. Last weekend marked the worst air quality crisis in Paris in two decades, during which the air quality index (AQI) \u2013 which measures ozone, several poisonous gases, and particle pollution \u2013 reached the 180s, more than twice the recommended limits for human health. Yet it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to the 500+ readings recorded in Beijing in January 2013.\n\nParisians say they are coughing and wheezing; and Beijing has been described by a government think tank as \u201cunfit for human habitation.\u201d But both cities can breathe easy, at least metaphorically speaking. According to the Urban Outdoor Air Pollution Database, published by the World Health Organization, all but two of the 20 worst cities for coarse-particle pollution are in India, Pakistan and Iran. Rounding out the list are Ulaanbataar, in Mongolia, and Gaborone, Botswana. Beijing, with an average PM10 content of 121, is barely in the top 50. Paris\u2019 average annual coarse particle pollution is measured at 38, hundreds of spots below.\n\nIt isn\u2019t very instructive to compare individual cities in this regard. But a quick glance at the list reveals how thoroughly urban air pollution \u2013 which once darkened the skies in London, Pittsburgh and the Soviet Union \u2013 has become a third-world epidemic. A new study estimates that Africa could account for half the world\u2019s particle pollution by 2030.\n\nOn Monday, when Paris limited traffic to cars with plates ending in odd numbers, and bicycle commuters wrapped their faces in scarves, the capital\u2019s PM2.5 index (measuring the smallest and most harmful elements of particular pollution) was lower than that of New Delhi. That a once-in-a-generation smog crisis in Paris is equivalent to everyday life in the Indian capital \u2014 and makes more news \u2014 is a lesson in the distortions of empathy.\n\nBut then, too, the crisis in Paris brought an emphatic public response from the French government. Transport was free in cities from Caen (on the English Channel) to Bordeaux (on the Atlantic coast) all weekend. For the first time since 1997, French road traffic was eased with alternate driving days, a move that AirParif, which monitors air pollution in the Paris region, says has had a noticeable effect. In Paris, the crisis has coincided with a mayoral election, in which the favored candidate seeks to phase out diesel fuel entirely. (Diesel, noxious compared to gasoline, is heavily subsidized and used by more than half of all vehicles in France.)\n\nThe concentration of smog in Paris is due to an unusually mild European winter, which has had even more destructive effects on the other side of the Channel. It may be an exceptional event; more likely it will reoccur as climate change scrambles historical environmental patterns. Last Thursday, London\u2019s air quality index had quietly risen to 160, not far below that of Paris.\n\nIf such pollution crises recur in the West \u2013 and as they become an issue in the developing world \u2013 cities will have to choose between dangerously dirty air and extreme restrictions on industry and transportation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We're fast approaching a future where Paris is no longer the \"city of light\" \u2014 and breathing has becomes a hazard", "title": "Welcome to the dead zone: Our planet\u2019s greatest cities are facing a major pollution crisis", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "We're fast approaching a future where Paris is no longer the \"city of light\" \u2014 and breathing has becomes a hazard", "title": "Welcome to the dead zone: Our planet\u2019s greatest cities are facing a major pollution crisis", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/23/welcome_to_the_dead_zone_our_planets_greatest_cities_are_facing_a_major_pollution_crisis/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/paris_smog_dream_city.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We're fast approaching a future where Paris is no longer the \"city of light\" \u2014 and breathing has becomes a hazard", "title": "Welcome to the dead zone: Our planet\u2019s greatest cities are facing a major pollution crisis", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/paris_smog_dream_city.jpg", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Henry Grabar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Beijing, Dream City, Paris, Pollution, Smog, urban planning", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe24e1\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Beijing, Dream City, Paris, Pollution, Smog, urban planning, Sustainability NewsLast week, Paris and Beijing had one of those feuds that city-watchers love so much.\nA new study estimates that Africa could account for half the world\u2019s particle pollution by 2030.\nBut a quick glance at the list reveals how thoroughly urban air pollution \u2013 which once darkened the skies in London, Pittsburgh and the Soviet Union \u2013 has become a third-world epidemic.\nLast Thursday, London\u2019s air quality index had quietly risen to 160, not far below that of Paris.\nParis\u2019 average annual coarse particle pollution is measured at 38, hundreds of spots below."}
