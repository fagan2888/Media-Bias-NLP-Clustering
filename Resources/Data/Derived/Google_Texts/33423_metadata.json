In the past month alone, they\u2019ve let it leak that he would be fired, only to meet with him and not fire him, only to then come back and suddenly fire one of his assistant coaches in what, from the outside, appears to be the most juvenile form of forcing someone to just throw his hands up and quit.\n\nIf Karl quits, the Kings wouldn\u2019t have to pay him the rest of his $10 million contract. Karl won\u2019t let that happen.\n\nSacramento is at the top of the heap in NBA soap operas this season. And that\u2019s saying something when you have:\n\n\u2022 The Rockets firing head coach Kevin McHale 11 games into the season. Then reports of James Harden and Dwight Howard not getting along. Then the team trying as hard as any team could try to trade a player (Howard), only to fail and now have to learn to live together in the aftermath of that the remainder of the season.\n\n\u2022 The Phoenix Suns firing two assistant coaches under then-coach Jeff Hornacek, then firing Hornacek, then getting incidents such as Markieff Morris going after teammate Archie Goodwin, pushing him on the bench during a game. Then, the Suns traded Morris.\n\n\u2022 The L.A. Clippers\u2019 Blake Griffin saga in which the big man punched equipment staffer Matias Testi, touching off a series of trade rumors and angst from management. Finally, two days before the trade deadline, Clippers coach and president of basketball operations Doc Rivers, put the trade rumors to rest.\n\nKarl\u2019s situation tops all of that. Which is amazing.\n\nHe has his own hand in things going wrong. He has openly apologized about how he started his relationship with star center DeMarcus Cousins. There were the \u201cNo player is untradeable\u201d comments. Then there was the locker-room blowup earlier this season in which Cousins had some choice words for Karl. That relationship has always been on thin ice. Karl rubbing star players \u2014 or players, in general \u2014 the wrong way isn\u2019t a new phenomenon.\n\nStill, Sacramento doesn\u2019t exactly bring out the best in the individuals charged with coaching or playing. There\u2019s friction between majority owner Vivek Ranadive and the minority owners of the team. There has been a revolving door of head coaches. Communication \u2014 which their former coach, Michael Malone, can attest to \u2014 isn\u2019t anywhere near what it should be for a franchise to thrive.\n\n\u201cIf you want to have an organizational belief and identity and vision, all parties must be involved and all parties must be together in that,\u201d Malone said. \u201cYou\u2019re not always going to agree \u2014 it would be naive to think that. But as long as you walk out that door unified and having each other\u2019s back, good things are going to happen.\u201d\n\nMalone didn\u2019t have that when he was in Sacramento. Karl doesn\u2019t have it now. The irony of Malone\u2019s return to Sacramento on Friday with the Nuggets was the frustration so many have had with the Kings defensively of late. Defense wasn\u2019t an issue under Malone.\n\nNow it\u2019s Karl\u2019s turn to fully understand why Sacramento has been just a shell of the team that used to thrill its fan base with winning teams in the early 2000s. There\u2019s no organization in the organization. This is no way for a coach with over 1,000 victories to have to work. Karl will make them get rid of him, and he should.\n\nAnd then he\u2019ll celebrate being gone.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey @denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nDamian Lillard, G, Portland\n\nIt was a short week coming off the all-star break, but it was still long enough to celebrate Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard, who is The Post\u2019s player of the week on the back of one Herculean performance against Golden State.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In the first game back after the break, Lillard went completely bonkers against Golden State, scoring a career-high 51 points in a win. But that wasn\u2019t all. Lillard added seven assists, six steals and no turnovers in one of the best single-game individual performances by any player in the NBA this season.\n\nBackground: Lillard controlled everything on the court. He was so good, he overshadowed the hardest-to-top player in the league \u2014 Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry, who had a strong game, scoring 31 points, but all that got him was a shocking minus-20 against his opposite number. Lillard hit 18-of-28 shots from the field, including nine 3-pointers.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: Even though Lillard\u2019s newest Adidas commercial advances the ridiculous notion that he continues to have \u201chaters\u201d out there, he has found himself on the outside looking in on some accolades because of playing a position that is stacked. But the fact is he remains one of the elite point guards \u2014 everyone recognizes that \u2014 and he\u2019ll be the reason the Blazers qualify for the playoffs if they get there. Going into Saturday\u2019s games, he ranked fifth in the NBA in scoring (24.9) and sixth in assists (7.3).", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: Hardly royal time for Kings\u2019 George Karl", "title": "Dempsey: Hardly royal time for Kings\u2019 George Karl", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/20/dempsey-hardly-royal-time-for-kings-george-karl/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-20T17:24:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:37:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christopher Dempsey"}, "article_summary": "If Karl quits, the Kings wouldn\u2019t have to pay him the rest of his $10 million contract.\nAnd that\u2019s saying something when you have:\u2022 The Rockets firing head coach Kevin McHale 11 games into the season.\nThen there was the locker-room blowup earlier this season in which Cousins had some choice words for Karl.\nIt could be that he\u2019s coaching the final 27 games of his tenure with the Sacramento Kings, the most dysfunctional organization in the NBA.\nFinally, two days before the trade deadline, Clippers coach and president of basketball operations Doc Rivers, put the trade rumors to rest."}
