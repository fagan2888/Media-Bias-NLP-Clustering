The 169-year-old mutual was granted a licence under what is known as \u2018Alternative Business Structures\u2019 last year. This is commonly called \u2018Tesco Law\u2019, although the supermarket giant does not currently offer legal services.\n\nThe effects of this reform are only just starting to be felt as people become aware of the greater legal choice on offer.\n\n\n\nHelen Box, 41, of Lancing, West Sussex, was surprised to find that she could rely on the Co-op for more than her daily essentials when she spotted an advert for its legal services at one of its cashpoint machines.\n\n\n\nAfter paying \u00a3180 for a jargon-ridden consultation with a local solicitor for advice on divorce, she gave the Co-op a try.\n\n\n\nOnline barristers can be cheaper than solicitors Anothe change in the legal marketplace that is gathering momentum is \u2018Direct Access\u2019, which allows customers to bypass the services of a solicitor and use a barrister instead.\n\nCustomers have been able to do this since the law changed in 2004 but few do.\n\nNew online companies, such as myBarrister and Absolute Barrister, are now highlighting the service.\n\nHenri Petignat, 54, a father-of-two and an IT analyst for a financial services company in London, has enlisted the help of a professional from myBarrister for his divorce.\n\nHe says: \u2018What I really like is that I am in full control.\n\n\u2018I know exactly what is going on, can ask questions via email and also stay in control of cost.\u2019\n\nJonathan Maskew, director of myBarrister, says: \u2018Direct Access barristers are able to do many of the things a solicitor does, but often more quickly and expertly thanks to their specialism in a specific field.\n\n\u2018Clear pricing is also appealing with many barristers happy to agree fixed fees in advance so you can avoid unexpected costs.\u2019\n\nUsing Direct Access can nearly halve the costs of a divorce, from more than \u00a313,000 to \u00a37,000 for a fully contested divorce, according to figures from Absolute Barrister, with administration fees for emails and phone calls stripped down from more than \u00a3200 an hour to zero.\n\nHowever, there are demands on the customer, who will have to be prepared to do a lot of the paperwork themselves under the guidance of a barrister.\n\nHenri adds: \u2018It does require a bit of time and you have to be on the ball.\u2019\n\nHelen, who works as a personal assistant and payroll manager for a firm of accountants and is a mother to Sam, 14, says: \u2018I was bewildered when I walked away from the solicitors and all I had was an invoice and some leaflets that made no sense.\n\n\n\n\u2018I checked out the Co-op\u2019s website, which said it offered a fixed-fee service. This was important because I needed to be sure I wasn\u2019t going to spend more than a certain limit.\n\n\n\n\u2018I learned more about the divorce process after 45 minutes on the phone during a free consultation than I did after a paid-for hour face-to-face meeting with the firm of solicitors.\u2019\n\n\n\nShe paid about \u00a3900 \u2013 including fixed court fees which can total more than \u00a3300 \u2013 and she was guided through the procedure from start to finish.\n\n\n\n\u2018Everything was straightforward and done via email and over the phone,\u2019 she says.\n\n\n\nOther companies given the green light to launch legal services include telecoms giant BT, insurer Admiral and life and protection insurer Ageas. Insurance group Direct Line is also keen to get in on the act.\n\n\n\nThe Solicitors Regulation Authority has so far issued 182 licences and hundreds more are at application stage.\n\n\n\nMany of the applications are from solicitors\u2019 firms that want to take advantage of the new rules because it means they can change the management structure of their businesses.\n\n\n\nIn some cases these firms want to promote non-lawyer employees who have worked hard to build up the company.\n\n\n\nOther company bosses are seeking to merge their business acumen with the professional skills of solicitors in order to bring affordable legal services to customers in a more modern way.\n\n\n\nOne firm hoping to tap into this market is Google-backed Rocket Lawyer, which originated in San Francisco and launched in the UK late last year.\n\n\n\nIt creates legal documents \u2013 such as for writing a will or an agreement for homeowners taking in a lodger.\n\n\n\nThis is complemented by free online guides and access to \u2018on-call\u2019 solicitors for those who need more help \u2013 setting the company apart from maverick websites offering basic templates in the do-it-yourself market at rock- bottom prices, which experts do not recommend.\n\n\n\nIn control: Henri Petignat saved thousands\n\nMark Edwards, vice president of Rocket Lawyer, says: \u2018The Legal Services Act came into force last year with the aim of encouraging competition.\n\n\n\n\u2018Retailers, banks and insurers could come into this sphere to provide more choice and make the market more competitive.\n\n\n\n\u2018This has happened in other walks of life, so why not with law? People need easier access to the law.\u2019\n\n\n\nFor \u00a325 a month customers can access the legal documents they need \u2013 with many targeted at entrepreneurs starting a business.\n\n\n\nThey get one free 30-minute consultation with a solicitor per month and discounts on additional legal fees.\n\n\n\nSome online companies offering legal help have caught the attention of regulators, who warn that customers relying on self-help and bog-standard template documents put themselves at risk.\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for The Law Society says: \u2018The outcome may not be as good for the client if a solicitor is not there to ask the right questions.\n\n\n\n\u2018Users may think they are getting the right product, but it may not achieve what they want and in some circumstances it could be invalid.\u2019\n\n\n\nAs with any shopping done online, customers should check that the firm is reputable and regulated.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "I,shopped,Co,op,got,quickie,divorce,900,Cut,price,legal,services,offered,high,street,brands,shake,up", "original-source": "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2414907/I-shopped-Co-op-got-quickie-divorce-900-Cut-price-legal-services-offered-high-street-brands-shake-up.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "After a pricey local solicitor left her baffled, Helen Box (pictured) turned to the Co-op, which is now permitted to offer legal services.", "title": "Cut-price legal services are being offered by high street brands", "url": "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2414907/I-shopped-Co-op-got-quickie-divorce-900-Cut-price-legal-services-offered-high-street-brands-shake-up.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/07/article-0-1B9EAE82000005DC-535_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp, noydir", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2414907, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "I,shopped,Co,op,got,quickie,divorce,900,Cut,price,legal,services,offered,high,street,brands,shake,up", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2013-09-07T21:15:05.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Laura+Shannon,+Financial+Mail+on+Sunday", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-09-09T09:09:51.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "I shopped Co op got quickie divorce 900 Cut price legal services offered high street brands shake up"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "This is Money", "description": "After a pricey local solicitor left her baffled, Helen Box (pictured) turned to the Co-op, which is now permitted to offer legal services.", "title": "Cut-price legal services are being offered by high street brands", "url": "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2414907/I-shopped-Co-op-got-quickie-divorce-900-Cut-price-legal-services-offered-high-street-brands-shake-up.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/07/article-0-1B9EAE82000005DC-535_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "description": "After a pricey local solicitor left her baffled, Helen Box (pictured) turned to the Co-op, which is now permitted to offer legal services."}, "article_summary": "Other companies given the green light to launch legal services include telecoms giant BT, insurer Admiral and life and protection insurer Ageas.\nI shopped at the Co-op and got a quickie divorce for \u00a3900: Cut-price legal services are being offered by high street brandsPricey solicitors are being snubbed in favour of online start-ups and trusted high street brands by people who want straightforward legal services \u2013 such as a quickie divorce or the writing of a will.\nThis is commonly called \u2018Tesco Law\u2019, although the supermarket giant does not currently offer legal services.\nIn control: Henri Petignat saved thousandsMark Edwards, vice president of Rocket Lawyer, says: \u2018The Legal Services Act came into force last year with the aim of encouraging competition.\nAfter paying \u00a3180 for a jargon-ridden consultation with a local solicitor for advice on divorce, she gave the Co-op a try."}
