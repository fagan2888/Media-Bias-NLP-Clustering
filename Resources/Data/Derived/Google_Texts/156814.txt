GAINESVILLE, Fla. - A Gainesville police officer said a 23-year-old man solicited oral sex from three women in the ladies bathroom at the Alachua County Library on Tuesday, once time barricading the door to keep the woman from leaving.

According to police, Justin Harris entered the women's room three times, approaching different victims asking for oral sex. During one entry, he shut and blocked the door. That victim defended herself with a large umbrella and escaped.



While that victim reported it to library staff, Harris repeated his efforts with another adult female victim in the same bathroom, according to police. The third woman corroborated the other two stories.



Harris told officers that he had been Facebooking a willing female who agreed to meet him and perform oral sex on him in the bathroom. Harris simply mistook the victims, who looked nothing alike, as his date.



Harris was charged with false imprisonment, a third-degree felony, and booked into the Alachua County jail.
