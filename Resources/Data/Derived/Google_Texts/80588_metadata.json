More than 500 people dined Wednesday.\n\nSanta Claus was on hand, posing for pictures and sharing a jolly laugh with attendees.\n\nMore toys than imaginable cover the walls of a side room, enough for each child to take two, and the very last children to have a selection.\n\nBut take away Santa, take away the toys, and Wednesday was a regular day at the mission.\n\n\u201cWe do this every day, not once a year,\u201d said executive director Barry Feaker.\n\nThe Topeka Rescue Mission served 541 people Wednesday \u2014 that actually is lower than other days during a regular week, Feaker said. Although the mission has been averaging about 300 people a night recently, he said, between 400 and 700 people eat a meal at the mission every day.\n\nAnother constant, he said, is the overwhelming appreciation shown by those who eat. The Christmas meal, like all meals at the mission, was open to the entire community. That means about 200 diners aren\u2019t staying at the mission.\n\n\u201cChristmas can be real joyous for some people, but for others, without family or a place to go, it can be really heartbreaking,\u201d Feaker said. \u201cWe try to make this day a little lighter and brighter for those families.\u201d\n\nSuzanne Ortega has been living at the Hope Center with her two children, Skyler, 4, and Ariella, seven months, for about one month. She was genuinely touched that mission would bring Santa and toys for the children.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re appreciative,\u201d she said, fighting back tears. \u201cIf not for the mission, I don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be.\u201d\n\nThe more than 70 volunteers Wednesday were told to be kind and to smile, Feaker said. The mission, and, more importantly, the mission\u2019s residents, appreciate their time, he said.\n\nLori Ellis certainly followed that admonition as she helped people through the line, wishing each one Merry Christmas with a friendly smile. But when asked about why she was there and what it meant to her, she was brushing away tears.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really emotional for me,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone is just so thankful. These are amazing people that just need a little bit of help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Aly Van Dyke", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Christmas lunch at the Topeka Rescue Mission was the same as it always is. \r\nA delicious meal - this year featured tenderloin in natural gravy and a smorgasbord of pies - prepared by dedicated staff and volunteers.
