Many even go so far as to use focus groups to figure out which words and phrases are most effective. It\u2019s grueling work, to be sure. There could be a fix on the horizon: political science may have found a way to streamline the process, thanks to a sophisticated computer algorithm and a mix of online polls.\n\nTraditionally, speechwriters have tested out ideas on either colleagues or in-person focus groups, who would listen to a part of a speech and report on how much they liked it, and whether it improved their opinions of the politician giving the address.\n\nSpeeches often cover many ideas and topics, and are interpreted by members of the audience through their own, equally complex lenses.\n\nIt is, according to Northeastern University political scientist Nicholas Beauchamp, pretty much trial and error. As if that\u2019s not tricky enough, speeches often cover many ideas and topics, and are interpreted by members of the audience through their own, equally complex lenses.\n\nWhat to do? Beauchamp chose to merge conventional focus groups with methods drawn from a relatively new field in political science, called text-as-data. Beauchamp started by gathering statements from obamacarefacts.com, and measuring how much each one reflected topics including costs, government, or employer mandates. A computer algorithm then generated trios of statements, which it fed to real people via crowdsourcing website Mechanical Turk. Each individual read a trio and responded by rating Obamacare on a nine-point approval scale.\n\nHere\u2019s the key step: Once the algorithm had presented one set of statements and collected each person\u2019s Obamacare approval rating, it tried another set of statements and got another set of approval ratings. If the new ratings were higher, then in a sense the algorithm was moving in the right direction \u2014 that is, moving toward a blend of topics that would garner higher approval ratings, and it should keep going in that direction. If not, the algorithm tried a set of statements that moved in a different direction.\n\nAfter 22 iterations of that process, Beauchamp\u2019s algorithm managed to find a mix of topics, represented in a particular trio of statements, that improved Obamacare approval ratings 30 percent, from neutral (five points) to 6.5. Topics related to laws, rights, and government tended to turn people off Obamacare, while sentences related to employer mandates or pre-existing conditions boosted approval.\n\nThe method could be used in a variety of settings, \u201cwhether it\u2019s political ads, whether it\u2019s political speechwriting \u2026 it could be used in any marketing,\u201d Beauchamp says. The tool itself is neutral, he says, though it might help shed light on another of his interests: whether persuasion, \u201cusually considered to be a devious hobby,\u201d can be used for good as well as something less positive.\n\nQuick Studies is an award-winning series that sheds light on new research and discoveries that change the way we look at the world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "by Nathan Collins \u00b6\n\nSpeechwriters spend a lot of time tweaking politicians\u2019 statements in an effort to sway voters.
