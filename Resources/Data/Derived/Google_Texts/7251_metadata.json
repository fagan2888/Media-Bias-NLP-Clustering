More than 13 inches of snow fell in the city, breaking the May record.\n\nDonivan Marchen always uses this ATV to clean the snow off his neighbors sidewalks, he just normally isn't doing that at this time of the year.\n\n\n\n\"My neighbor, he always lets me, it's his four wheeler I use. He always lets me use it. Ever since I've just kind of plowed his sidewalks, plowed everybody's sidewalk, plowed everybody's around here. Just helping out the neighborhood,\" Marchen\n\n\n\nHe had plenty to plow today. It was a heavy, wet snow. It's suppose to be spring, but instead the snow knocked down a basketball hoop, and covered motorcycles. Marchen says it's something to expect in South Dakota.\n\n\n\n\"I grew up here in Rapid City and yeah we've got weird weather here, and I've never actually seen it in May,\" Marchen said.\n\n\n\nWith the snowfall setting records for the month of May, it's something no one in the city has ever seen.\n\nThe previous May record was 2008, when 12 inches of snow fell on Rapid City.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
