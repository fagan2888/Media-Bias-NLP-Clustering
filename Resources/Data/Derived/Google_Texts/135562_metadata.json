But outside of the political arena, there\u2019s much less debate.\n\nA mountain of evidence confirms the law\u2019s effectiveness \u2014 particularly in its primary goal of expanding health care coverage to some of America\u2019s neediest populations. Several recent studies have confirmed that Obamacare is positively affecting Americans, particularly those who previously couldn\u2019t obtain health insurance or who struggled to pay their medical bills.\n\nHere\u2019s how Obamacare is making a real difference in Americans\u2019 lives:\n\nAmerica\u2019s most vulnerable now have health insurance\n\nA man with crutches signs up for health coverage at Access Health CT, Monday, March 31, 2014, in New Britain, Conn.

According to an analysis by the New York Times. Now, 7.2 more Hispanics, 6.1 percent more Native Americans, 5.1 percent more blacks and 5.4 percent more Asians have health insurance.\n\nLegal immigrants and naturalized citizens also saw large increases in coverage, as did groups that are more likely to be working low-wage jobs, such as high-school graduates and Americans living in non-traditional households, which can be a sign of economic distress.\n\nIndeed, the law was so successful in lifting up undeserved populations that it stopped a decades-long expansion of the health-insurance gap between low-income and wealthier Americans.\n\nAnd the people gaining coverage under the Affordable Care Act are among America\u2019s sickest, according to a different report from Blue Cross and Blue Shield that analyzed the claims for 4.7 million Americans newly enrolled in insurance plans. New policy holders are more likely to have significant health problems, such as diabetes or HIV, which previously would have locked them out of coverage that they desperately needed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that people who newly gained access to coverage under the Affordable Care Act needed health care. That\u2019s why they were locked out of coverage before,\u201d said Ben Wakana, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nPeople with new health insurance are better off\n\nIn this photo,, applicants are given instructions how to check in for a health care enrollment event at the Oakland Asian Cultural Center in Oakland, Calif CREDIT: AP Photo/Eric Risberg\n\nAccording to a report from the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Center, Americans who have new health insurance through Obamacare \u2014 either through its state-level insurance marketplaces or through its expansion of Medicaid \u2014 are better off than the uninsured and in many areas comparable to those with employer-sponsored insurance plans.\n\nLow and moderate-income Americans with marketplace and Medicaid coverage are more likely than the uninsured to have a source of medical care and to have had a checkup in the past year. They are also less likely than the uninsured to report unmet health needs, such as visits to specialists they haven\u2019t been able to make it to.\n\nThe research also found that in most cases, marketplace plans were comparable to the employer-sponsored plans that existed before health reform. People insured through Obamacare didn\u2019t struggle more to find new doctors or get timely appointments compared to people insured through their employers. Those with Obamacare\u2019s marketplace plans were also no more likely to report problems paying medical bills or having high out-of-pocket expenses, and were just as satisfied with their premiums.\n\nThose with employer plans were, however, more likely to be satisfied with their choice of providers and their protection against high deductibles, likely because employer plans usually resemble the highest level of marketplace plan.\n\nAnd while those with Medicaid did report more difficulty getting doctors appointments than those with other types of plans, all groups with insurance were significantly better off than the uninsured \u2014 and were likely to have both regular care and lower levels of unmet need due to costs.\n\nPoor Americans are more financially secure\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M.

The report also shows that the people who benefited from Medicaid expansion then used that extra money to pay down other debts.\n\n\u201cHealth insurance, like any type of insurance, is first and foremost a form of financial protection,\u201d economist Robert Kaestner, one of the study\u2019s authors, told The Washington Post. \u201cIt is a real benefit.\u201d\n\nAccording to federal data, medical bills count for more than half of Americans\u2019 unpaid bills, which can drag down people\u2019s credit scores and in the long run, cost them both money and opportunity. Reducing debt can thus have a ripple effect on financial well-being for years into the future.\n\n***\n\nOf course, the effect of health reform varies widely across the country. The most marked improvements are evident in states that fully implemented Obamacare, including its expansion of Medicaid to cover more low-income people.\n\nNineteen states opted not to expand their Medicaid programs \u2014 even though the majority of the cost would be covered by the federal government \u2014 after a 2012 Supreme Court case made the expansion optional. States that fully implemented the health care reform law saw an increase in residents with health insurance at nearly double the rate of the GOP-controlled states that didn\u2019t.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Several new studies confirm: Obamacare has lifted up some of America's neediest populations.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Several new studies confirm: Obamacare has lifted up some of America's neediest populations.", "title": "Obamacare Has Been Incredibly Effective, According To These Studies", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/04/26/3772535/obamacare-recent-research/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/26133203/AP_154907003721-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Several new studies confirm: Obamacare has lifted up some of America's neediest populations.", "creator": "@RayOfLaurel", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/26133203/AP_154907003721-321x214.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Has Been Incredibly Effective, According To These Studies", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/26133203/AP_154907003721-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/26133203/AP_154907003721-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-26T13:41:45+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/laurelAraymond"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "A mountain of evidence confirms the law\u2019s effectiveness \u2014 particularly in its primary goal of expanding health care coverage to some of America\u2019s neediest populations.\nSeveral recent studies have confirmed that Obamacare is positively affecting Americans, particularly those who previously couldn\u2019t obtain health insurance or who struggled to pay their medical bills.\nStates that fully implemented the health care reform law saw an increase in residents with health insurance at nearly double the rate of the GOP-controlled states that didn\u2019t.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that people who newly gained access to coverage under the Affordable Care Act needed health care.\nNow, 7.2 more Hispanics, 6.1 percent more Native Americans, 5.1 percent more blacks and 5.4 percent more Asians have health insurance."}
