(Photo: Steve Sanchez / The Star file photo)\n\nScores on thousands of student exams could be incorrect because of a computer malfunction that inadvertently changed grades on Indiana\u2019s high-stakes ISTEP test, according to scoring supervisors familiar with the glitch.\n\nBut the company that scored the exam on behalf of the state \u2014 testing giant CTB McGraw Hill \u2014 decided to leave those potentially faulty scores in place, even after the problem was brought to management\u2019s attention, the supervisors said.\n\nCompany executives would not speak with The Indianapolis Star, but in a letter Tuesday to the Indiana Department of Education, Executive Vice President Ellen Haley downplayed the problem. She said the issue \u201cwas very rare\u201d and \u201cdid not affect student scores.\u201d\n\nSeven supervisors who spoke with The Star disagreed. All said they believed the problem was more widespread. Two estimated that tens of thousands of test questions were likely given incorrect scores. Others said it is difficult to put a number on the problem, but it was pervasive enough to merit rescoring the potentially impacted tests.\n\nThe integrity of ISTEP scores is critical because they are used to evaluate teacher and school performance. False results could affect teacher pay and lead to state takeovers of low-performing schools.\n\nCTB is currently finishing the last step in grading last spring\u2019s ISTEP ahead of the scores\u2019 public release next month. The company is in the final month of a $23.9 million state contract to administer last school year\u2019s test.\n\nThe potentially inaccurate grades are just the latest \u2014 though perhaps the most serious \u2014 issue to plague ISTEP, which is administered annually to more than 500,000 Indiana students in grades 3-8. Computer disruptions, grading delays and apolitical fight over the length of the test have made ISTEP a major source of contention in recent years.\n\nState Superintendent of Public Instruction Glenda Ritz would not agree to an interview with The Star about the grading problems. But her spokesman, Daniel Altman, said he did not want to speculate on the accuracy of the test scores given what supervisors told The Star.\n\n\u201cWe are going to obviously work with CTB to ensure that every single student gets the score that they earned on the test,\u201d Altman said.\n\nThe Department of Education asked CTB to investigate the problem after receiving an anonymous letter on Nov. 25, Altman said. In response, CTB sent Haley\u2019s Dec. 8 letter to the department assuring that student scores were unaffected.\n\nFollowing questions from The Star, the Department of Education sent an email to CTB on Thursday, asking for the number of test items and schools that could have been affected by the computer malfunction.\n\nThe malfunction\n\nThe seven scoring supervisors who spoke with The Star \u2014 including some who worked on ISTEP \u2014 are temporary employees, but work full-time shifts and often oversee more than 100 evaluators who grade tests. They spoke on condition of anonymity, either because they signed confidentiality agreements regarding their work or feared losing their jobs.\n\nThey said they were shocked and dismayed by what happened at CTB\u2019s Michigan Road scoring center earlier this year.\n\nCTB/McGraw-Hill President Ellen Haley explains how overload on the company's computer servers led to glitches and interruptions in April's ISTEP+ testing at the Indiana General Assembly's public hearing in the Indiana Statehouse on Friday, June 21, 2013.

The glitch affected open-ended questions that are each assigned two scores during the grading process, supervisors told The Star.\n\nWhen the evaluator used the computer\u2019s keypad to enter the two scores in quick succession, the second score would replace the first score. So a test question that should have received a score of 6 and 3 could end up with a score of 3 and 3.\n\nAfter the glitch was discovered, managers told supervisors to have their evaluators use the mouse instead of the keypad to enter scores. But supervisors said they continued to see evaluators use the keypad.\n\nMore than a week after the problem was discovered, Mike Conarroe, the company\u2019s director of hand scoring, held a meeting with supervisors.\n\nAt that April 30 meeting, Conarroe informed them that a fix was in progress and that evaluators should continue using the mouse instead of the keypad.\n\nBut when questions were raised about the integrity of the exams already scored, Conarroe became agitated and said the company was not going to redo eight days of work, according to the seven supervisors who spoke with The Star and were present at the meeting.\n\nConarroe promised future meetings about the issue \u2014 but that never happened, the supervisors said.\n\nNot until early May was the keypad disabled in an effort to prevent incorrect scores, according to Haley\u2019s letter to the department.\n\nThe decision not to rescore the tests prior to that deeply troubled the supervisors who spoke to The Star. One said 1.2 million individual responses were graded during the eight days before the malfunction was discovered. Redoing that work, some supervisors estimated, would have cost the company at least $500,000. The decision not to rescore came less than two months after the state dropped CTB as its ISTEP vendor for 2016, some supervisors noted.\n\nIn explaining why they agreed to speak with The Star, they said the company\u2019s actions violated a basic tenet of standardized testing \u2014 that every student\u2019s score should accurately reflect academic achievement. They also expressed concerns about the effect on teacher pay and schools.\n\nSome said the decision weighed on them personally. One said he had trouble sleeping at night.\n\nAn elementary-school student works out a math problem.

Corporate spokespeople for CTB McGraw Hill and the company that purchased its assessment scoring business earlier this year, Data Recognition Corp., did not respond to phone calls from The Star.\n\nBut in the company\u2019s letter to the Department of Education, Haley said the company\u2019s data monitoring and double-checks of some individually scored questions did not indicate an impact on student scores.\n\n\u201cThe issue was not a common occurrence, was actually difficult to create in live scoring, and was fixed quickly \u2014 both in on-the-floor instructions and then technically in the PEMS software,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBased on CTB\u2019s quality control tests, there was no need to rescore any tests as a result of the keypad issue.\u201d\n\nShe also said most evaluators use the mouse instead of the keypad and don\u2019t enter scores in rapid succession because they are trained to reread answers to questions before entering the second score. As a result, \u201cvery rapid entry was highly unusual,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBut supervisors said the keypad is the tool of choice among evaluators because it allows rapid entry of scores, which is a top priority for the company. They also said most evaluators only read a student response once, then assign both scores, one immediately after the other.\n\nIn this Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2014 photo, fifth grade students at Custer Baker Intermediate School take an ISTEP pre-test in Franklin, Ind.

In recent weeks they have described the ISTEP process as a \u201ccomplete fiasco\u201d and a \u201cbotched system.\u201d\n\nAnd that was before the legitimacy of the scores was in question.\n\nWhat role, if any, the computer malfunction may have played in the lower outcomes is unclear. But some school administrators say what is evident is that the system is flawed.\n\n\u201cWe are just assuming that CTB is giving us the correct information,\u201d Warren Township Schools Superintendent Dena Cushenberry said. \u201cThere is no checks and balances to the system.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time scoring problems have caused concerns.\n\nIn August, CTB said it was facing a delay in the scoring of new technology-enhanced items. Then in November, the state decided to award some students bonus pointsbecause of differences in difficulty in the paper/pencil and online versions of the test.\n\nAnd that was just this year.\n\nThe state recovered $3.3 million in credits and in-kind services from CTB after testing disruptions during the 2013 ISTEP. Altman said the Department of Education is also pursuing damages for other problems.\n\nThe state announced in March that it would drop CTB for the 2016 ISTEP and use Pearson Education instead, even though that company has had problems of its ownin other states.\n\nCTB is now in the process of rescoring tests \u2014 a normal part of the process where parents whose students failed can request a second look. Such requests doubled this year. The window for parents to make such requests closed Nov. 13.\n\nEven if just one student\u2019s score was wrong, that is too many, they said. It\u2019s a position the company should agree with, given the poster that hangs on the scoring center\u2019s wall.\n\n\u201cAccuracy is always our number one priority,\u201d it reads. \u201cRemember that each book you score represents an individual student.\u201d\n\nCall Star reporter Chelsea Schneider at (317) 444-6077.
