Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania pitched himself as a battle-tested conservative who stands for \u201cthe little guy\u201d at the Conservative Political Action Conference Friday, saying foreign experience is key for someone to square off against former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe need someone who can unite this country around a vision, an economic vision that can pull us together,\u201d he said. \u201cA vision that\u2019s focused on working men and women who are struggling in America today. A vision that says we can restore our manufacturing base, we can improve our infrastructure, we can increase our energy development - all to help the people in this country who are lagging behind and feeling like neither party really cares about them or talks about them.\u201d\n\nHe said he won 11 states in the 2012 GOP presidential contest, despite being vastly outspent, because he \u201cstood for someone \u2014 the little guy. The American worker.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if we\u2019re gonna win in 2016, we need to stand for the little guy, too,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also knocked the \u201cObama-Clinton\u201d foreign policy team, saying \u201cthe world is a dangerous place\u201d and \u201cmore complex.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need someone with real experience to be able to rebuild our military,\u201d he said. \u201cThe likelihood that we\u2019re gonna face a former secretary of state means that we need someone who has a long and deep understanding of the threats that confront us, particularly the threat of radical Islam.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Obama\u2019s \u201cliberal outlook,\u201d but his \u201cprofound lack of experience\u201d that has created problems for the country, Mr. Santorum said, touting his eight years of experience on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n\u201cCommander in chief is not an entry-level position,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Oval Office is no place for on-the-job training \u2014 not in times like this.\u201d\n\nTo combat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, he proposed arming the Kurds and increasing aid to Jordan, and also called for boots on the ground.\n\n\u201cIf ISIS wants to establish a 7th century caliphate, well let\u2019s oblige them by bombing them back to the 7th century,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if the world bands together to defeat the group, he said, \u201cif Iran gains a nuclear weapon, we will have failed our time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Sen.
