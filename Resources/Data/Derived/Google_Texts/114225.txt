Hey, and if that's not enough, Vox has even more.

But the underlying dispute between them is actually quite important, and has long term ramifications for how we think about polling and elections.

Today Silver kicked things up a notch with a broadside aimed at Wang, and in a conversation with me today, Wang responded.

Wang gives Democrats good odds of holding the Senate, while Silver still marginally favors Republicans.

In a nutshell, the dispute turns on the difference between their two models. Wang’s model is a “polls only” model that bases predictions on a median of all available public polling data. Silver’s model is premised on the idea that polls alone aren’t enough, and adds in a number of “state fundamentals” to his model, including the generic ballot, Congressional approval ratings, fundraising totals, the background and ideology of the candidates, and so forth.
