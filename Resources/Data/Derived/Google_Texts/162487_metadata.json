The result of tax errors, after all, is at best overpaying and missing out on money you\u2019re owed \u2013 and at worst getting audited (and then audited again one year later).\n\nRelated: 26 Most Overlooked Tax Deductions\n\nAvoid those fates by making sure you steer clear of these common tax mistakes.\n\n1. Choosing the wrong filing status\n\nMost tax pros recommend you start filing this year\u2019s taxes by reviewing your returns from last year. If you\u2019ve had a major life change, like getting married or divorced or having a child, be sure to update your status before preparing your returns.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure which status to choose, check with a professional tax preparer. In some cases, it makes sense for married couples to file separately, for example, while single parents should generally file as \u2018head of household.\u2019\n\n2. Overlooking deductions\n\nYou probably already know you can itemize your property taxes and student loan interest, but there are dozens of other deductions that individuals don\u2019t know about or forget to take.\n\nRelated: How Obamacare Will Impact Your 2014 Taxes\n\nEven if you don\u2019t have a mortgage, you may have enough other deductions to make itemizing worthwhile, especially if you live in a high-tax state. \u201cJust one big itemized deduction can push you over the line, and then you get all the smaller deductions, too,\u201d says Jackie Perlman, a principal tax researcher with H&R Block.\n\n3. Waiting until the last minute\n\nGiven how much fun it is to file taxes, it\u2019s no wonder many taxpayers procrastinate for as long as they can. \u201cIf you\u2019re scrambling to get everything together the weekend before April 15 and just shoving things through, you\u2019re more apt to make a mistake,\u201d says Troy Lewis, a CPA in Draper, Utah, and chair of the tax executive committee at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\n\nErrors aside, those who file later in the season will have to wait longer to get a refund, and they\u2019re more likely to be victims of identity theft. Plus, it\u2019s best to leave yourself some wiggle room in case you need to gather additional paperwork or documentation.\n\nIf you\u2019re not able to file by the April 15 deadline, you\u2019ll need to file for an extension and pay an estimate of the taxes you owe. Failing to file can result in fees and accrued interest that can push your tax obligation higher.\n\nRelated: 4 Tax Deductions That Can Save You Big Bucks\n\n4. Keeping poor records\n\nIf you don\u2019t have receipts for things like charitable contributions and business expenses, they might as well not have happened, as far as the IRS is concerned. Keep a record of such items to be sure you can easily calculate your deductions \u2013 and provide proof if the IRS does come checking.\n\nIf paper files aren\u2019t your thing, apps like Expensify and Shoeboxed can help you keep such records in the cloud.\n\nAfter you file, be sure to hold onto your returns. You\u2019ll need them for at least three years and as much as seven years in case of an audit, and having them handy will make tax prep easier next year. You\u2019ll also need to show recent returns if you refinance your mortgage or apply for college financial aid.\n\n5. Doing it the old-fashioned way\n\nWhile more than 90 percent of filers send their taxes in electronically, some 23 million taxpayers still use pen and paper to calculate returns. Filing online is safer, faster, and more secure. Plus, you\u2019re less likely to introduce a basic math error or forget to sign and date the returns.\n\nRelated: The IRS Tax Scam that Can Rob You Blind\n\n6. Not updating Obamacare income estimates\n\nIf you received a subsidy for health insurance purchased through the Obamacare exchanges, you estimated your 2014 income to determine the amount of that subsidy. Now it\u2019s time to reconcile that estimate with the actual income you received last year.\n\nMore than half of marketplace-enrolled filers underestimated their income, according to a recent analysis by H&R Block \u2013 and have to pay back or reduce their tax refund by an average of more than $500.\n\nBe sure to check the box indicating that you had health insurance this year, or you\u2019ll owe a penalty or have to fill out an exemption form.\n\n7. Forgetting to triple-check all your numbers\n\nYour accountant or tax software will automatically check your math, but neither one can flag an incorrect Social Security number of bank routing digits used for direct deposit or automatic withdrawal. \u201cOne wrong digit there will foul everything up and you won\u2019t get your refund,\u201d says Bob Charron, a partner at New York accounting firm Friedman LLP.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It may still feel like the dead of winter in much of the country, but it\u2019s prime time", "title": "7 Mistakes Not to Make When Filing Your Taxes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/06/7-Mistakes-Not-Make-When-Filing-Your-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01312012_1040_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/06/7-Mistakes-Not-Make-When-Filing-Your-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01312012_1040_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It may still feel like the dead of winter in much of the country, but it\u2019s prime time", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Choosing the wrong filing statusMost tax pros recommend you start filing this year\u2019s taxes by reviewing your returns from last year.\nWaiting until the last minuteGiven how much fun it is to file taxes, it\u2019s no wonder many taxpayers procrastinate for as long as they can.\nThe only thing worse than sitting down and filing your taxes is doing it wrong.\nRelated: 26 Most Overlooked Tax DeductionsAvoid those fates by making sure you steer clear of these common tax mistakes.\nIf you\u2019re not able to file by the April 15 deadline, you\u2019ll need to file for an extension and pay an estimate of the taxes you owe."}
