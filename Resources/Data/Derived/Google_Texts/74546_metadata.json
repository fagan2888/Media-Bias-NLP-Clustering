Well, it\u2019s not exactly new, but it\u2019s likely new to you.\n\nAnd a group that focuses on helping women achieve their educational goals is a group that everybody should know about.\n\nIf you ask what P.E.O. stands for, you\u2019re likely to receive a blank stare. And that\u2019s something that chapter President Nancy Silva Sutton and Vice President Liz Snyder hope to change.\n\nP.E.O. is a philanthropic educational organization with a mission to celebrate the advancement of women.\n\nAs part of that goal, the organization is involved in educating women through scholarships, grants, awards and loans, and offering both two- and four-year degrees at Cottey College, a school fully funded by P.E.O. in Nevada, Missouri.\n\nP.E.O. was born on the campus of the Iowa Wesleyan College by a group of women in 1869. The seven founders enjoyed a strong bond after studying together throughout college and, and with a promise to strengthen their bond, they formed a college sorority.\n\nP.E.O. ultimately morphed from sorority to a community group for women.\n\nToday P.E.O. has 250,000 women, and chapters in all 50 states and Canada.\n\nThe original members were passionate about education, and today the organization helps women by offering loans, scholarships and awards, as well as need-based grants to women whose education has been interrupted and who find it necessary to return to school to support themselves and their families.\n\nSilva Sutton and Snyder were members of a Roseville P.E.O. chapter for decades, and they decided that a new chapter was needed to share the message and to involve more women.\n\nLike a sorority, a chapter\u2019s letters aren\u2019t recycled, so when a chapter in Santa Clara found their aging membership dwindling, they were thrilled for Silva Sutton, Snyder and a group of Granite Bay and Roseville women, who volunteered to relocate the chapter.\n\nChapter GM, as the group is known, was established in 1929.\n\n\u201cThus began the expansion of the chapter by friends and family members over the course of the next 85 years,\u201d said Karen M. Blair, past president of the Santa Clara Chapter.\n\nBlair talked about the chapter\u2019s involvement with the sick and the needy during the Great Depression. She also shared stories of knitting, sewing and baking for \u201cour boys\u201d during World War II.\n\n\u201cWe now pass our letters and history on to you \u2013 the \u2018girls of Granite Bay,\u201d Blair told a room full of women at a recent relocation ceremony.\n\nToday the newly formed chapter has 23 members, who range in age from 30 to 90, generations of women sharing life lessons and skills.\n\nThe women of Chapter GM can\u2019t wait to get started.\n\n\u201cP.E.O. helps women, from graduating seniors through PhD programs, and we do it through local, state and international scholarships,\u201d Silva Sutton said. \u201cWe give funds to the broader P.E.O. group, who select scholarship recipients.\u201d\n\nIn addition, members of the local chapter will recommend qualified scholarship candidates to the national organization and help those candidates through the application process.\n\n\u201cOften times, individual chapters help assist local students with funding as well,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nIt feels great to give back to the community, but P.E.O. sisters get from the organization as much as they give.\n\n\u201cSo many of the women who are in the organization were ahead of their time,\u201d Silva Sutton said. \u201cThey were attending college when it was uncommon for women to do so. The experiences they\u2019ve shared with us, like their military service, is just incredible.\u201d\n\nChapter GM members attend monthly meetings, social events, book groups and outdoor adventures.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
