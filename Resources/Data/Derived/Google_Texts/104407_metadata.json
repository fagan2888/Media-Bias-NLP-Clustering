That would be me,\u201d Cruz told a Manchester, New Hampshire, audience. \u201cI don\u2019t have health care right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo our health care got canceled, we got a notice in the mail, Blue Cross Blue Shield was leaving the market. And so we\u2019re in the process of finding another policy,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI hope by the end of the month we\u2019ll have a policy for our family. But our premiums \u2014 we just got a quote, our premiums are going up 50 percent. That\u2019s happening all over the country. That\u2019s happening in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nSo many questions\n\nI, along with several other writers/reporters, quickly noted that:\n\nBCBSTX had actually announced that they were discontinuing individual PPO policies throughout Texas way back in July. If they missed the original announcement (unlikely, given that Cruz was already running for President and is quick to pounce on any negative healthcare news which can even remotely blamed on the ACA), the official termination notices would have been sent out to affected BCBSTX enrollees in October, giving the Cruz family ample time to enroll in a new policy in time for January coverage. Health insurance carriers have discontinued products (ie, different policy offerings) for decades, just like any other retailer. After all, it\u2019s not like Apple is still offering the iPhone 3GS for sale these days; they discontinued it, replaced it with a new model and so forth. This is a normal thing in the free enterprise market which Sen. Cruz loves so much. The Cruz family has plenty of other options for coverage, including enrolling in a policy using the District of Columbia\u2019s SHOP exchange \u2026 where, as a government employee, he and his family would be entitled to up to a 75 percent employer-subsidized policy:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act does not compel members of Congress to enroll in DC\u2019s health care exchange; it simply cuts off the government contribution to their insurance plans if they buy their policies elsewhere. \u201cThe final rule extends a Government contribution towards health benefits plans for Members of Congress and designated congressional staff so long as the health benefits plans are purchased via the appropriate SHOP as determined by the Director,\u201d a summary of the final rule says. \u201cNothing in the final rule or the law prevents a Member of Congress or designated congressional staff from declining a Government contribution for him or herself by choosing a different option for their health insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nIn any event, Cruz had plenty of time, from as early as late July (when the PPO drop was first announced) or mid-October (when the termination notices were sent out) until as late as December 17th to figure out which alternate type of coverage they were gonna move to. Finally, his claim about their premiums going up \u201c50 percent\u201d sounded rather peculiar, since none of BCBSTX\u2019s policies went up more than 19 percent and a report from the HHS Dept. was just released yesterday stating that Texas\u2019s average full-price premiums have only gone up 6.2 percent for anyone enrolled in an ACA exchange policy.\n\nI should note at this point that over at Balloon Juice, Richard Mayhew noted that:\n\nBCBS of Texas offered to map its policy holders to different coverage. There is a federal regulation describing how this mapping can occur. I am trying to figure out why the Cruz family was not passively mapped to a new policy during the autorenewal process.\n\nOops. Ted does have coverage after all.\n\nWell, according to Wall Street Journal reporter Louise Radnofsky, the story just took another rather eye-rolling turn:\n\nTed Cruz has health insurance, and he had it all along, his campaign said Friday night, reversing what the presidential candidate said a day earlier.\n\nCruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Friday that Mr. Cruz\u2019s insurance broker had told him that he lost his health coverage when his Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas preferred provider organization, or PPO, policy terminated on Dec. 31.\n\nBut Mr. Cruz had in fact been automatically enrolled by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas in another, narrower-network \u201chealth maintenance organization\u201d plan that kept him covered in January. As we reported earlier, when we explained the headache on Friday, that\u2019s what the insurer said it did for all customers in his situation \u2014 even if Mr. Cruz didn\u2019t know it.\n\nBased on the information from his insurance broker, \u201cSen. Cruz believed the family was uninsured and asked the broker to pull quotes immediately for a new policy,\u201d Ms. Frazier said. \u201cThe Cruz family is currently covered by a Blue Cross HMO.\u201d\n\nNot for long, though. Mr. Cruz recently arranged to get a new policy that is closer to the kind of coverage he had before, and will be a Humana enrollee effective March 1 in one of their wider-network PPO plans. That\u2019s what will cost him around 50% more than he was paying in 2015, Ms. Frazier said.\n\nAnd now \u2026 some new questions\n\nWell, now. This certainly answers a few questions \u2026 while raising a few others:\n\nFirst of all, it turns out that BCBS did map the Cruz family over to a different policy after all, just as they promised they would. This means that the Cruz family was never without coverage in the first place. If Cruz knew about this, he was lying to the audience. If he didn\u2019t know, it could be seen as either an honest oversight .. .or sheer sloppiness. Remember, the man is a former State Solicitor and current U.S. Senator, running for President, with a large staff and well-funded campaign, and who has a major fixation on the Affordable Care Act. You\u2019re gonna seriously tell me that he paid no attention to his own family\u2019s insurance coverage situation? OK, then \u2026\n\nit turns out that BCBS did map the Cruz family over to a different policy after all, just as they promised they would.

You\u2019re gonna seriously tell me that he paid no attention to his own family\u2019s insurance coverage situation? OK, then \u2026 Second: Since his campaign now confirms that his family was \u201ccross-walked\u201d over to a BCBSTX HMO, they should have received an invoice for their January premium sometime in December, since carriers generally prefer that their enrollees, you know, pay their first premium before the policy starts coverage. Did the Cruz family somehow never receive their invoice? Did they somehow pay it without realizing it (remember, they\u2019re paying full price for a family of four, so it would likely be in the $1,000/month range)? Is the past-due invoice sitting on the kitchen table somewhere, buried in a pile of junk mail?\n\nSince his campaign now confirms that his family was \u201ccross-walked\u201d over to a BCBSTX HMO, they should have received an invoice for their January premium sometime in December, since carriers generally prefer that their enrollees, you know, pay their first premium before the policy starts coverage.

Third: OK, I\u2019m willing to give Cruz a \u201chalf apology\u201d for the \u201c50 percent hike\u201d thing. It\u2019s entirely possible that the Humana PPO which his family \u201cgot a quote for\u201d does indeed have premiums 50 percent higher than the BCBSTX PPO they were previously enrolled in. In that sense, yes, I suppose he could argue that his premiums \u201care going up 50 percent.\u201d There\u2019s three important caveats here, however: First, I\u2019d need to know exactly which BCBS PPO plan his family was on last year (and how much they were paying, including the deductible if any). Was it Platinum? Gold? Silver? Dental included? Etc. Second, I\u2019d need to know exactly which Humana PPO they moved to instead. Is it truly a close equivalent? If the premium really is 50 percent higher, what about the deductible? Has that shrunk proportionately? Third: Even if the Humana PPO really is 50 percent higher \u2026 \u201capples to apples\u201d\u2026 as noted above, he could also get a hefty discount on private policy coverage by using the DC SHOP exchange.\n\nOK, I\u2019m willing to give Cruz a \u201chalf apology\u201d for the \u201c50 percent hike\u201d thing. It\u2019s entirely possible that the Humana PPO which his family \u201cgot a quote for\u201d does indeed have premiums 50 percent higher than the BCBSTX PPO they were previously enrolled in. In that sense, yes, I suppose he could argue that his premiums \u201care going up 50 percent.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the list of DC SHOP exchange offerings. If the Cruz family must have a PPO instead of an HMO (which isn\u2019t unreasonable \u2026 some people really do prefer them), they have 14 of them to choose from, which include nationwide coverage including Texas at the Silver, Gold or Platinum levels.\n\nUnfortunately, I have no way of knowing what the actual premium cost would be for any of these. (The DC SHOP exchange requires you to create a verified user account in order to window shop.) But whatever it is, I\u2019m willing to bet that it would cost Sen. Cruz the same or less than his old PPO, given that he\u2019d receive a hefty government employee subsidy \u2026 except that he refuses to do so due to his \u201cprincipled stance\u201d against \u201cgovernment handouts\u201d (not that this has prevented him from literally living off of taxpayer funds for the past 12 years, of course, but I digress).\n\nNow, I will say one thing in Cruz\u2019s defense here: It is unfortunate that BCBSTX chose to discontinue PPOs completely, and the whole \u201cplan mapping\u201d thing under the ACA is a bit of a surprise to many people. On the other hand, it\u2019s a hell of a lot better than being kicked to the curb completely (as Cruz allegedly thought had been). In addition, assuming his family had found themselves sans coverage prior to the ACA, they might have found themselves SOL if anyone had been diagnosed with a pre-existing condition.\n\nGood for you, Senator\n\nOne final note: Once Sen. Cruz has started his new policy, thanks to the ACA\u2019s laws against the ugly practice of \u201crescission,\u201d neither BCBSTX nor Humana can legally drop them from their coverage mid-year simply because he, say, forgot to fill out a form properly.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m glad to hear that Sen. Cruz has continuous, comprehensive healthcare coverage after all. It\u2019s a shame that it required so much fuss, bother and confusion, though \u2026 sure would be nice if the U.S. had guaranteed, universal healthcare coverage someday like, oh, say, Canada \u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Health Insurance Resource Center", "description": "Turns out Sen.
