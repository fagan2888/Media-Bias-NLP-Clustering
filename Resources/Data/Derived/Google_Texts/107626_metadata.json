Remember, any tax money spent on illegals is cash taken from Americans who may need it, particularly when it\u2019s healthcare dollars.\n\nWhen Obamacare was rolled out, the Democrats swore up and down that illegals wouldn\u2019t get it. Now we learn that many do, even though the money is strained through county governments. And just this week, candidate Hillary Clinton said that illegals should get government healthcare, suggesting that her administration would supply it,\n\nNow liberals argue that it\u2019s cheaper to pay for normal delivery of healthcare than to have illegals running to the emergency room for every little problem, which they are allowed to do by law. But that idea ignores what a huge magnet American medicine is, and people come from all over (but particularly Mexico) to get very expensive treatment for seriously ill relatives. It was reported in 2006 that \u201chundreds\u201d of illegals had arrived in Colorado for \u201cfree medical care they say they can\u2019t get back home.\u201d The cost for all this unaccountable do-goodery must be a fortune, and America is unimaginably broke.\n\nThis generosity even extends to organ transplants for illegals, where the rarity of available organs means that any given to a lawbreaking foreigner takes one from a citizen on a wait list. For example, illegal Mexican Ana Puente received three liver transplants from the state of California at a cost of well over a million dollars. Another transplant receiver was Jesica Santillan whose family paid a coyote $5000 to smuggle the girl for the express purpose of getting free American treatment for her life-threatening illness.\n\nSo any news that the healthcare door is wide open again may well prompt healthcare seekers to add to the crush of illegals headed for stupid-generous America.\n\nThe current free healthcare situation was discussed on Fox News between Tucker Carlson and Stuart Varney on Friday.
