Judd doesn\u2019t mind stoking the speculation, which she did this weekend during an interview on Larry King Now!\n\nJudd, a well-known Democrat and political activist, once she seriously considered challenging Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in last year\u2019s Senate midterms but chose not to run (her mother hinted that Judd did not like Washington insiders).\n\nHowever, during her appearance, Judd suggested to King that she could get behind being governor:\n\nGovernor seems like an interesting position too, particularly in Kentucky, where we have a mono-economy, really abusive mineral extraction, pervasive poverty, low educational attainment. We\u2019re really low on all the different social indices and because of my work in developing economies, I actually \u2014 both as a Kentuckian and someone who\u2019s traveled around the world a lot \u2014 have a deep bench on that stuff. \u201d\n\nIt would be a fascinating candidacy, in that it would be fun to imagine what this would be like\u2026in 2019:\n\nAshley Judd told Larry King she's intrigued by a Kentucky Gov run. Who wants to tell her major party filing deadline passed last week? \u2014 Reid Wilson (@PostReid) February 2, 2015\n\nAccording to the state of Kentucky, Judd must file her intention to run before the last Tuesday of January if running in a party requiring a primary election. If she wanted to run as an independent, she still could file by April 1st, but seeing as she\u2019s a longtime Democrat (and actually a former delegate!), that\u2019s not really an option.\n\nWatch Judd talk about a thing she can\u2019t do below, via Ora TV:\n\n[h/t Newsbusters]\n\n[Image via screenshot]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Tina Nguyen (@Tina_Nguyen) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ashley Judd's name comes up often whenever people give political forecasts, specifically for higher office in the state of Kentucky.
