Nikki Haley, R-S.C., said the state\u2019s income tax puts it at a competitive \u201cdisadvantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to keep the ball rolling in our economy, we must bring down our income tax,\u201d Haley said.\n\nShe acknowledged that despite her desire to cut the income tax rate, South Carolina needs to invest in its infrastructure. Greenville Online reports that the South Carolina Department of Transportation \u201chas rated almost half the state\u2019s primary and secondary roads in poor condition.\u201d\n\nHaley proposed doing \u201cthree things at once that will be a win-win-win for South Carolina.\u201d\n\nThe first would be lowering the income tax over the next decade, which amounts to a 30 percent reduction. The lower 5 percent rate would take South Carolina\u2019s nationwide income tax ranking from 38th to 13th.\n\nWhile the income tax rate would go down, the gas tax would increase by 10 cents over the next three years. Haley said that the revenue generated from this tax will go \u201centirely toward improving our roads.\u201d\n\nThe governor said that \u201cwhen coupled with the 30 percent income tax cut, it still represents one of the largest tax cuts in South Carolina history.\u201d\n\nHaley also proposed doing away with the \u201clegislatively elected transportation commission\u201d to stop \u201cshort-sighted\u201d wasteful spending.\n\n\u201cSimply shipping more money into the current bureaucracy would be like blasting water through a leaky hose,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of it would reach the right destination, but too much of it would end up in a mess on the ground. I won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThe plan drew praise from South Carolina\u2019s former senator, Jim DeMint, president of The Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cGov. Haley continues to show why she\u2019s a national conservative leader,\u201d DeMint told The Daily Signal. \u201cShe deserves credit for promoting tax reform that provides opportunity for all South Carolinians, and rejecting favoritism by taking on the transportation bureaucracy. Reforms like this make our state more economically competitive with our neighbors. It\u2019s a great step forward for South Carolina.\u201d\n\nIn order for the plan to become law, Haley laid out this stipulation:\n\nThis is a three-part package deal. In order to get my signature on any gas tax increase, we need to restructure the DOT, and we need to cut our state income tax. If we do all of those things, we will have better roads and a stronger economic engine for our people.\n\nState Sen. Gerald Malloy, D-Darlington, told The State that Haley\u2019s conditional willingness to raise gas taxes is \u201cvery challenging.\u201d He said, \u201cAt least we have part of a plan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The governor of South Carolina has proposed lowering the state\u2019s income tax rate from seven to five percent and hiking the gas tax.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The governor of South Carolina has proposed lowering the state\u2019s income tax rate from seven to five percent and hiking the gas tax.", "title": "How Nikki Haley Plans to Make South Carolina More Competitive", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10319740594_e5a04d7a13_h.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-25T22:33:18+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1uq1gtn"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The governor of South Carolina has proposed lowering the state\u2019s income tax rate from seven to five percent and hiking the gas tax.", "title": "How Nikki Haley Plans to Make South Carolina More Competitive", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10319740594_e5a04d7a13_h.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2015-01-23T23:05:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-25T22:33:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Taxes, tax rate, South Carolina, Gov.
