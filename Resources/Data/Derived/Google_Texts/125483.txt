Dr. Seth Oquist will open his chiropractic practice Tuesday at 612 Yale Place.

Chiropractors emphasize manual therapy including joint adjustment and manipulation with particular focus on joint dysfunction and subluxations, said the online Wikipedia.

As part of Oquist's practice, he also will offer new technology known as Sigma Instruments Ultralight, which is a computerized adjusting system as well as cold laser therapy.

"It takes the fear factor out for people who don't like the hands on manual adjustments," he said.

Born and raised in La Junta, Oquist attended Otero Junior College, where he played baseball. He then transferred to chiropractor school in Dallas, Texas, where he graduated in December 2011.

From there, Oquist worked with Dr. Gary Willis in Alpharetta, Ga., for a year. Then he and his wife, Melissa, decided to return to Colorado to be closer to family.

"I'm ready to set roots and become part of the community," he said. "We both always loved Ca√±on City (because it) has a lot to offer."

Melissa currently is a Pueblo West High School math teacher.

Oquist's office is open from 8 a.m. to noon and from 1 to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday, from 8 a.m. to noon Fridays, and closed Saturday and Sunday. The telephone number is 275-0100.
