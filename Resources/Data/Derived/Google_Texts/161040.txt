Beginning early Saturday, a series of events will mark the 150th anniversary of the Sand Creek Massacre.

Nearly 200 Cheyenne and Arapaho — most of them women and children — were killed in the massacre Nov. 29, 1864, by the Colorado Territory militia.

Beginning at dawn Saturday, descendents of the survivors will gather on Monument Hill at the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site in southeastern Colorado for a private ceremony. The hill will be closed to the public until 1 p.m., but public events and lectures will be held at the visitors’ contact station and the lower parking lot.

The national historic site is 23 miles east of Eads.

At 1 p.m., Monument Hill will reopen to the public. According to a news release, visitors can explore the park on their own or join speakers in the picnic area for a brief discussion on the importance of the day and background for establishing the park.

Later, at 3 p.m. and 5 p.m, park staffers will be at the Crow Luther Cultural Events Center in Eads for a preview of two new film documentaries on the massacre. The films will be free to the public.

The 15th annual Healing Run will begin at 7 a.m. Sunday at the historic site. The runners are to reach Denver in time for a candlelight vigil at the Denver Art Museum at 6 p.m. Tuesday.

The Health Run will conclude with a ceremony beginning at 11 a.m. Wednesday on the west steps of the Capitol.
