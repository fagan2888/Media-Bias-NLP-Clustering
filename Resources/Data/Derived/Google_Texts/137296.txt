UNDATED (WHBL) -- There's some new paperwork this year when it comes to your taxes and your health insurance.

The forms are the 1095 forms, and IRS spokesman Christopher Miller says they all have to do with the type of health insurance you have. "The new forms many of us will see this year are the 1095-B and C, and if you had health care coverage through the Marketplace, you'll be getting a 1095-A."

The 1095-A forms first went out last year to those people who got coverage under the Health Care Marketplace. Miller says you will need to have that file on hand as you file your taxes. "You will still not send in that form, you're going to just keep it for your records, but you will want to have the Form 1905-A when you do your taxes." The information on that form will be used to get to handle any tax credits or payments you got while using the Affordable Care Act.

Miller says the B and C forms are going out to those who got coverage through the government or through their employer. You'll want to keep those forms on hand as well, but the information on them will only be used to verify that you did have insurance.

The IRS does not provide these forms, and if you haven't gotten one yet, you should contact your insurance provider. If you have any questions, you can find out more about the 1095 forms online at the IRS website.
