Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, meanwhile, are three times more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.\n\nPrevention is key in reducing health disparities, the HHS argues. But first it\u2019s important to see exactly what some of these disparities look like. Disparities exist when there are different health outcomes in different groups or populations. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that \u201cthe social determinants of health are mostly responsible for health inequities \u2014 the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries.\u201d These \u201csocial determinants\u201d of health include race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, as well as age.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been examining this issue in its annual \u201cHealth Disparities and Inequalities Report.\u201d In 2013, the CDC report lists social and economic factors like education and income, access to healthy food retail, unemployment, and of course, health care access, as the main determinants of health inequalities.\n\nSebelius touts Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, as a major step forward in closing these health gaps between different minority groups in the U.S. Some seven million African Americans, four million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and eight million Latinos will now have access to more preventive services.\n\n\u201cThanks to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Seblius writes, \u201chealth coverage is now more affordable and accessible for millions of Americans, including minority groups. For minority populations, the law addresses inequities in access to quality and affordable coverage.\u201d\n\nPreventive health care, like its name suggests, focuses on preventing diseases before they happen. Currently, much of the health care system relies on treating chronic diseases like diabetes, obesity, and health disease, after they've been diagnosed and progressed far enough to cause serious damage. Preventive health care focuses on lifestyle changes that could curb the high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease in the states. Preventive services provided by the ACA include flu shots for children and adults, well-child visits, Pap smears and mammograms for women, as well as colon cancer screenings.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kathleen sebelius, minority health month, minority health, health care, health disparities among minorities,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In a statement about National Minority Health Month, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius notes that we still have a long way to go in reducing health disparities among different groups of people.", "title": "Sebelius: National Minority Health Month Aims To Dispel \u2018Disparities In Health Care\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hhs-secretary-kathleen-sebelius-announces-national-minority-health-month-aims-achieve-nation-free", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/05/minority-health-care.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a statement about National Minority Health Month, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius notes that we still have a long way to go in reducing health disparities among different groups of people.", "title": "Sebelius: National Minority Health Month Aims To Dispel \u2018Disparities In Health Care\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hhs-secretary-kathleen-sebelius-announces-national-minority-health-month-aims-achieve-nation-free", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/05/minority-health-care.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/05/minority-health-care.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-05T15:52:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-05T15:52:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In a statement about National Minority Health Month, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius notes that we still have a long way to go in reducing health disparities among different groups of people."}, "article_summary": "In a statement about National Minority Health Month, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius notes that we still have a long way to go in reducing health disparities among different groups of people.\nPreventive health care focuses on lifestyle changes that could curb the high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease in the states.\nDisparities exist when there are different health outcomes in different groups or populations.\nSebelius touts Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, as a major step forward in closing these health gaps between different minority groups in the U.S.\nThough we\u2019ve made major strides in health care equity among minorities, we still have a long way to go, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement recently."}
