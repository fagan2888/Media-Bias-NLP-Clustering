A spokeswoman said none were French but would not discuss their nationality. Britain\u2019sForeign Office said three Britons were among those arrested.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s interior minister, Miguel Rodriguez, said that two National Guard sergeants and one lieutenant were arrested Sunday and that airline workers were suspected of involvement.\n\n\u201cWe presume there is complicity at the airline,\u201d he said on state TV.\n\nRodriguez said the Sept. 11 seizure at Charles de Gaulle Airport came after several weeks of investigation by French, Spanish, British and Dutch police. The drugs were placed on Flight 368, which departed Caracas on Sept. 10, he said.\n\nAir France said in a statement that it is working with police and conducting an internal investigation, and increasing baggage checks at some \u201csensitive\u201d locations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Authorities found 1.4 tons of cocaine on a flight from Caracas", "title": "Air France cocaine bust yields nine arrests", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Authorities found 1.4 tons of cocaine on a flight from Caracas", "title": "Air France cocaine bust yields nine arrests", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/23/air_france_cocaine_bust_yields_nine_arrests/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/airfrance.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Authorities found 1.4 tons of cocaine on a flight from Caracas", "title": "Air France cocaine bust yields nine arrests", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/airfrance.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Frank Bajak and Fabiola Sanchez", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Associated Press, Cocaine, Drug busts, Drugs, Europe, From the Wires, Law enforcement, Legal issues, South America", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8f4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s not normal that you can carry more than a ton of cocaine on an Air France plane,\u201d he said on Europe-1 radio.\nFrance\u2019s interior minister, Manuel Valls, on Monday praised the investigation that resulted in six arrests in France and the arrest Sunday of three National Guardsmen in Venezuela.\nAir France said in a statement that it is working with police and conducting an internal investigation, and increasing baggage checks at some \u201csensitive\u201d locations.\nVenezuela\u2019s interior minister, Miguel Rodriguez, said that two National Guard sergeants and one lieutenant were arrested Sunday and that airline workers were suspected of involvement.\nThe drugs were placed on Flight 368, which departed Caracas on Sept. 10, he said."}
