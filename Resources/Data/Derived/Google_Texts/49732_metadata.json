You most likely refer to it as the morning-after pill or just \u201cPlan B,\u201d which is short for the leading brand Plan B One-Step. But how exactly does the pill work to prevent pregnancy? What sets it apart from routine birth control? And is it the same as having an abortion?\n\nHere\u2019s what we know.\n\nPregnancy Isn\u2019t Instantaneous\n\nGetting pregnant isn\u2019t something that happens during or right after sex \u2014 a necessary reminder provided the current state of sex education. Sperm can survive for several days in a woman\u2019s body, so depending on when the woman ovulates, it can actually take up to six days for the sperm and egg to meet after you have sex, Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), told Medical Daily in an email.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it's possible to prevent pregnancy even after you have sex,\u201d she said.\n\nIf women don't wish to get pregnant after having had, or being forced to have unprotected sex, there are three emergency methods to consider: levonorgestrel pills (Plan B and Next Choice One Dose), ulipristal acetate pills (Ella), and a copper ParaGard intrauterine device (IUD). Levonorgestrel is a progestin, which is a synthetic progestogen that mimics the hormone progesterone. Progesterone is the female hormone that works to prevent changes in a woman\u2019s uterus.\n\nIt\u2019s been used in birth control pills for several decades, Denise Bradley, senior vice president of Global Corporate Reputation at Teva Pharmaceuticals, told Medical Daily in an email; Teva is responsible for Plan B. Progestin pills work mainly by stopping the release of an egg from the ovary. Plan B in particular, Bradley said, has a higher dose of progestin, but it works similar to other pills taken to prevent pregnancy. Bradley added Plan B may also work by preventing fertilization of an egg or by preventing attachment to the uterus.\n\nThe IUD, on the other hand, works a little differently. It affects the way the sperm move so they can't join with an egg, Mosley explained. As you know, if sperm can\u2019t join with an egg, women can't get pregnant.\n\n'It's Worth Taking'\n\nThe image below charts how effective each method of emergency contraception is, courtesy of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe types of emergency contraception. Planned Parenthood\n\nAs you can see, the IUD ranks as the most effective with its 99.9 percent effective rate, followed by Plan B\u2019s 89 percent rate and Ella\u2019s 85 percent rate. Women who choose the IUD are then in a position to use this method as their routine form of birth control; it can effectively prevent pregnancy for up to 12 years.\n\nElla is the one method of emergency contraception not recommended for all women, namely for women who may be breastfeeding. Mosley said if women do take it, or perhaps have no other option, they should pump their breast milk and discard the milk for 36 hours after ingestion. Perhaps for this reason, Ella must be prescribed by a doctor or nurse, while most other brands, including Plan B, are now available over the counter without a prescription. IUDs must be inserted by your doctor or nurse.\n\nIt's important to know that these rates are contingent on both time and (possibly) a woman\u2019s body mass index (BMI). Plan B is most effective when taken within three days after having unprotected sex, while Ella and an IUD are effective up to five days after having sex.\n\nLess is known about ways in which weight influences contraceptions' efficacy rate. In 2013, the European company HRA Pharma actually changed the packaging of a pill similar to Plan B to say the product was ineffective for women who weighed more than 176 pounds. There are other experts who believe efficacy starts to wane at 165 pounds. Ella claims to be less effective for women with a BMI of 35, and Plan B claims to be less effective for women with a BMI over 25. To Aine Mac Grory, a pharmacist working in Northern Ireland, this is a \u201cbold statement to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big asterisk,\u201d she previously told Medical Daily. \u201cI\u2019ll give the morning-after pill to a heavier women, but I\u2019ll tell her it may not give you the same effects. Take someone who is 9 stone (126 pounds) and someone who\u2019s 15 stone (210 pounds). There is so much more body to get through. There\u2019s a risk. I would let them know that.\u201d\n\nMosley would agree with Mac Grory. \u201cIf the IUD or Ella aren\u2019t options for you, it\u2019s perfectly safe to take [Plan B] or [Next Choice]. It\u2019s still worth taking,\" she said.\n\nRegardless of which method women go with, they should take a pregnancy test two weeks after the fact to make sure they're not pregnant. If the test reads negative, but women are still worried they may be pregnant, Mosley suggests taking another test in a week. So, three weeks since initially taking emergency contraception, to be sure.\n\n'So Safe and Effective'\n\nThere have been no reports of serious complications among the millions of women who have used the emergency contraception pill, Mosley said. But, as with most forms of birth control, there could be side effects, such as changes to your normal period, headaches, and nausea.\n\n\"It\u2019s important to remember that if you vomit within three hours of taking [emergency contraceptive pills], you need to retake it, since it won\u2019t be effective,\u201d Mosley said. Women with preexisting medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and hypertension should not be scared of having to take emergency contraception. Each method is perfectly safe for women to utilize, Mosley added.\n\n\u201cI especially recommend that women with medical problems seeking to avoid pregnancy and in need of emergency contraception consider the copper IUD because it is so safe and effective \u2014 both as emergency contraception and routine form of [birth control],\u201d she said. One more thing women should not be worried about? Inducing an abortion.\n\nThe idea that emergency contraceptive pills equate to a medical abortion has persisted for years. The thing is, there's no scientifc proof of this. Susan Wood, the former assistant commissioner for women\u2019s health at the FDA, ruled the morning-after pill is not an abortifacient. At the same time, a study published in the journal Contraception declared Plan B does not have an effect after ovulation. Colorado lawmakers are trying argue IUDs are an abortifacient, but science has yet to find that it is.\n\nIt's probably the most confusing aspect of emergency contraception. She herself has yet to come across evidence that any form of emergency contraception affects an existing pregnancy or would cause an abortion. The drugs women can take to actually induce an abortion contain mifepristone and misoprostol, which blocks progesterone so the uterus lining breaks down and empties. \"Abortion pills\" work only when a woman is already pregnant, Mosley said.\n\n\"Emergency contraception will not work if a woman is already pregnant,\u201d she concluded. \"[It] only works to prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "understanding, plan, b, how, emergency, contraception, separates, itself, routine, birth", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Here's everything you need to know about emergency contraceptive pills and IUDs.", "title": "How It Works: The Morning-After Pill", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/understanding-plan-b-how-emergency-contraception-separates-itself-routine-birth-348398", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/18/plan-b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's everything you need to know about emergency contraceptive pills and IUDs.", "title": "How It Works: The Morning-After Pill", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/understanding-plan-b-how-emergency-contraception-separates-itself-routine-birth-348398", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/18/plan-b.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/18/plan-b.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-08-18T19:04:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-18T19:04:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Here's everything you need to know about emergency contraceptive pills and IUDs."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe150f\"", "article_summary": "You most likely refer to it as the morning-after pill or just \u201cPlan B,\u201d which is short for the leading brand Plan B One-Step.\nEmergency contraception is exactly how it sounds: it\u2019s a method of contraception women can take after having unprotected sex.\nElla is the one method of emergency contraception not recommended for all women, namely for women who may be breastfeeding.\nShe herself has yet to come across evidence that any form of emergency contraception affects an existing pregnancy or would cause an abortion.\n\u201cI especially recommend that women with medical problems seeking to avoid pregnancy and in need of emergency contraception consider the copper IUD because it is so safe and effective \u2014 both as emergency contraception and routine form of [birth control],\u201d she said."}
