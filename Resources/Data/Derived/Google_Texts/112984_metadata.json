His murder remains unsolved.\n\nClosing time in Denver\u2019s \u201cLoDo\u201d entertainment district can be dangerous. Brawls and sometimes shootings can happen.\n\nColorado state law dictates that bars serving liquor must shut their doors at 2 a.m.\n\nIn LoDo, huge crowds of people pack sidewalks in the minutes before and after that deadline.\n\nAccording to one Denver Post report, a person is more likely to be a crime victim between 1 and 3 a.m. in LoDo than in any other part of the city at that time.\n\nIt\u2019s been that way for a long time.\n\nFor example, in the early morning hours of Sunday, Nov. 6, 2007, 15th Street between Market and Blake streets in the heart of LoDo became a shooting gallery.\n\nRob McGowan, an audio engineer at Poor House Pub, 1435 Market St., told a Denver Post reporter at the time that he first heard tires squealing as a car raced down Market.\n\nThen a fusillade of bullets erupted and people began dropping on the street.\n\nEight people were shot including Theodore Padilla, a father of three, who was fatally injured outside Hush nightclub.\n\nIn 2008, there was a closing-time gunfight in a parking lot at 18th and Market, in which officers killed one man and wounded another who fired a shotgun at them.\n\nHargrove\u2019s murder happened at 2:04 a.m. on a Saturday. The morning at closing time several fights broke out at 15th and Market streets.\n\nIt was chaos.\n\nA gunshot was fired in a LoDo alley. In another incident, a man accidentally shot himself in the leg while pulling out a gun.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "460th Space Wing,airman,Buckley Air Force Base,Colorado law,denver,Denver Health Medical Center,East Carolina University,inebriated,LoDo,Market Street,melee,North Carolina,Poor House Pub,Shaquille Hargrove", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Cold Cases", "description": "Denver's LoDo: Closing time deadly for Buckley airman", "title": "Denver's LoDo: Closing time deadly for Buckley airman", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/2015/01/10/denver-17/9709/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/files/2015/01/hargrove-495x371.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Denver's LoDo: Closing time deadly for Buckley airman", "title": "Denver\u2019s LoDo: Closing time deadly for Buckley airman", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/2015/01/10/denver-17/9709/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/files/2015/01/hargrove-495x371.jpg", "creator": "@kmitchelldp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Denver's LoDo: Closing time deadly for Buckley airman"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1714\"", "article_summary": "Buckley Air Force Airman Shaquille Hargrove was trying to prevent violence when he was gunned down.\nIn another incident, a man accidentally shot himself in the leg while pulling out a gun.\nThe morning at closing time several fights broke out at 15th and Market streets.\nHe became one of the latest murder victims in a hot zone for violence early weekend mornings.\nClosing time in Denver\u2019s \u201cLoDo\u201d entertainment district can be dangerous."}
