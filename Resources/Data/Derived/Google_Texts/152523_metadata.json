When actress, comedian, and television host Rosie O\u2019Donnell had a major heart attack at the age of 50, she nearly lost her life. In a hybrid mix of humor and women\u2019s health information, O\u2019Donnell shares her story through an hour-long standup routine, which is set to premiere on HBO this Saturday night on Valentine\u2019s Day for February\u2019s American National Heart Month.\n\nShe weaves in and out of narrative for the first 40 minutes, discussing her child\u2019s circumcision with Steven Spielberg, her love for Barbara Streisand, being a mother to teenagers and a newborn, and life with her now ex-wife Michelle Rounds, who was just recovering from a rare cancer before O\u2019Donnell\u2019s heart attack. More than two years after her heart attack in 2012, she announced earlier this month she will be leaving ABC\u2019s morning show The View because of concerns over the stressful toll it\u2019s taking on her heart health.\n\nOne day while leaving from her wife\u2019s routine checkup at the hospital, a heavyset woman was stuck getting out of the car. \u201cI estimated she was over 400 pounds, and I know this because I understand the shame of being overweight in America,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said, adding it took them 20 minutes to help the woman up and bring her into the hospital.\n\n\u201cTwo hours later, my biceps were killing me, not a little bit and it wasn\u2019t radiating pain,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was as though a bear had grabbed both of my arms and ripped out the muscle. I thought this must have been from lifting her up, and then my son Blake, who was 12 at the time, said, \u2018Mommy, you look like a ghost.\u2019\u201d\n\nInstead of checking into a hospital herself, she went to her therapist for help. O\u2019Donnell jokingly recalled her advice, and said she told her she wasn\u2019t having a heart attack but was instead transforming her emotions into physical pain after seeing the heavyset woman. O\u2019Donnell has dealt with weight issues throughout her life, and at her heaviest weighed 230 pounds. She said the emotional turmoil of seeing a woman handicapped from her weight left her in physical pain.\n\nSo, she went home. She was hotter than she had ever been in her life, even more than when she went through menopause in her 40s. After experiencing a depleting exhaustion, she threw up and said, when you\u2019re having a heart attack, it\u2019s your body\u2019s last defense, so call for help. A quick Google search showed her she had five out of the five signs for a woman having a heart attack, and she became a statistic. When women have a heart attack, 75 to 80 percent don\u2019t seek medical attention. Meanwhile, 90 percent of men call 911 at the first signs of chest pain. More women die of heart disease than men.\n\n\u201c[Heart Disease] is the No.1 killer in women because they don\u2019t recognize the symptoms,\u201d Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said in a CNN interview about O\u2019Donnell\u2019s condition. \u201cThe symptoms then progress more, and they\u2019re less likely to survive.\u201d\n\nThe Widow Maker\n\nWhen she finally went to a cardiologist it was Wednesday evening. The doctor told her she had had a heart attack Monday morning, and there was an ambulance waiting for her outside. When she arrived, they discovered there was a blockage in her left descending artery (LAD), which supplies most of the blood to the rest of the body. The artery\u2019s nickname is \u201cthe widow maker\u201d of coronary disease, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nShe survived the surgery and was able to tell her story. She was the only patient the hospital had seen survive having 100 percent LAD blockage for more than 10 hours, and she was blocked more than 50 hours. Her survival was a medical mystery and O\u2019Donnell decided to share her story on a platform with a comedic twist of confession and critical information, in order to deliver this widely overlooked medical advice. Women often don\u2019t know their own gender-specific symptoms of a heart attack enough to seek help.\n\n\u201cWhen the doctor said I was having a heart attack I\u2019m like, \u2018Shouldn\u2019t that feel like Mike Tyson punched me in the tit? Isn\u2019t that what a heart attack is supposed to feel like?\u2019\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I had a heart attack, and I thought maybe the reason I didn\u2019t die was because I have a public voice and I can share the facts with everybody. Maybe that\u2019s the reason.\u201d\n\nEvery year, more women die of heart disease than from all forms of cancer combined. That\u2019s 300,000 American women, making it the leading cause of death among women, according to The Heart Foundation. To help understand the symptoms, which are unique to women, O\u2019Donnell suggests memorizing an acronym she created, HEPPP: Hot, Exhausted, Pain, Pale, and Puke. Her close call led her to close the standup, but she cautions her audience, \u201cPlease call 911. Know the signs and save yourself.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rosie, odonnell, discusses, heart, attack, valentines, day, hbo, comedy, special, heartfelt", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Heart attack symptoms take women unaware, and Rosie O'Donnell wants to help stop the ignorance.", "title": "Rosie O\u2019Donnell Stands Up For Heart Health On Valentine\u2019s Day", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rosie-odonnell-discusses-heart-attack-valentines-day-hbo-comedy-special-heartfelt-321426", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/09/rosie-odonnells-heart-health.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Heart attack symptoms take women unaware, and Rosie O'Donnell wants to help stop the ignorance.", "title": "Rosie O\u2019Donnell Stands Up For Heart Health On Valentine\u2019s Day", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rosie-odonnell-discusses-heart-attack-valentines-day-hbo-comedy-special-heartfelt-321426", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/09/rosie-odonnells-heart-health.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/09/rosie-odonnells-heart-health.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-09T14:08:37-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-09T14:08:36-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Heart attack symptoms take women unaware, and Rosie O'Donnell wants to help stop the ignorance."}, "article_summary": "The doctor told her she had had a heart attack Monday morning, and there was an ambulance waiting for her outside.\nWhen actress, comedian, and television host Rosie O\u2019Donnell had a major heart attack at the age of 50, she nearly lost her life.\nA quick Google search showed her she had five out of the five signs for a woman having a heart attack, and she became a statistic.\n\u201cWhen the doctor said I was having a heart attack I\u2019m like, \u2018Shouldn\u2019t that feel like Mike Tyson punched me in the tit?\nIsn\u2019t that what a heart attack is supposed to feel like?\u2019\u201d O\u2019Donnell said."}
