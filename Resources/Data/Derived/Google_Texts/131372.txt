With all the March madness going on, one can’t help but get sucked into the frenzieness of the nation’s biggest college basketball tournament -- especially not the fans in Indian country.

It has been a pretty exciting couple of weeks for several Native American college players. Jude Schimmel boosted Louisville to the Sweet 16 with a litany of key plays, Bronson Koenig has got Wisconsin fans on fire (and so has fellow teammate Nigel Hayes), and although Tesha Buck and Green Bay fell to Princeton, she still must have felt the love (even President Obama, who attended her final season game to root for Princeton wished Green Bay good luck) seeping from the fans' pores.

With all this excitement going around, here’s what fans in Indian country are saying on Twitter about the NCAA Tournament.

1. Former Ole Miss guard Marshall Henderson kicks things off.

2. Oklahoma State guard Lakota Beatty channels the blockbuster movie The Hunger Games:

3. ...And Beatty managed to congratulate a fellow March Madness player. Guess who.

4. Does it get any crazier for NCAA players when they find out that NBA stars are rooting for them?? Madness! Here's what Bronson Koenig (@BronsonK_24) retweeted after the team suited up in the Lakers locker room.

5. When players get to the NCAA tournament level, they find themselves in situations they've only, ahem, dreamed about?...

6. This fan got the haricut he's always dreamed about. It's called "The Bronson."

7. U of L's Jude Schimmel suffered a career-ending loss to Dayton, but Indian country's fans know that she will always be someone to root for...

8. Sisterly love.

9. Hmmm. We wonder what @Sherman_Alexie's bracket actually looks like.
