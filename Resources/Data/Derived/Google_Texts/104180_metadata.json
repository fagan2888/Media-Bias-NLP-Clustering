Friday's audience saw characters with depth, as well as complexity in their relationships with one another. They also saw a lively, engaged chorus.\n\nA couple of chorus scenes took the theater just a step too far, making the denizens of the town of Zenith look a little too much like those of River City, inviting comparisons to \"The Music Man.\"\n\nBaritone Craig Verm captured the charm and foibles of the opportunistic Gantry, singing with character and power. Mezzo-soprano Katherine Pracht created a mesmerizing Sharon Falconer, believably balancing the character's religious conviction and human frailties while singing with a rich, focused sound.\n\nTenor Jonathan Boyd sang with a big, ringing sound as Frank Shallard and was riveting as he sang about craving a faith he'd never felt. Tenor Matt Morgan made the character flaws and actions of Eddie Fislinger thoroughly believable, singing with complete control while conveying a crumbling mental state.\n\nSoprano Alisa Suzanne Jordheim gave a spot-on performance as Lulu Baines. She created a sympathetic character and sang with a voice that was pure, lovely, light in color and powerful.\n\nAmong the other performers, Jeffrey Beruan delivered a serious, paternal Reverend Baines, Kevin Burdette created tremendous energy with T.J. Rigg, and Vera Savage was a thoroughly intimidating Mrs. Baines.\n\nMembers of the Florentine Opera Chorus filled several ensemble roles with energy and great theatrical presence, if some uneven vocal power.\n\nThe Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, led by Christopher Larkin, gave a polished, but sometimes awkwardly restrained, performance of a densely orchestrated, colorful score full of cultural and religious references from klezmer clarinet to hymns tunes.\n\nSets by Kris Stone made good use of the large Uihlein Hall stage, creating intimate space when needed. Costumes, some with lovely period detail, supported both the time and place in which the story was set.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nThis Florentine Opera production of \"Elmer Gantry\" will be repeated at 2:30 p.m. Sunday in Uihlein Hall at the Marcus Center for the Performing Arts, 929 N.
