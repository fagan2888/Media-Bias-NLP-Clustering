In its funding proposal for the 2016 fiscal year, the House Appropriations Committee proposed to eliminate Title X funding for programs that don\u2019t meet certain ideological (abstinence-only) standards, which could effectively shut down critical family planning and reproductive health services for nearly 5 million low-income Americans. Naturally, those nearly 5 million Americans \u2014 and thousands of others who have benefited from access to contraception and other basic healthcare \u2014 are pissed.\n\nWhat the GOP doesn\u2019t seem to understand (in addition to simple math) is that birth control, in particular, affords women control not only over their bodies, but over their livelihood and their futures as well. It is a virtual necessity for economic freedom and social equality \u2014 which is why many advocates are speaking out about the role contraception has played in their lives.\n\nAs part of an ad campaign launched by Planned Parenthood this week, which has already picked up traction on social media, women from around the country \u2014 whether they consider themselves beneficiaries of Title X or not \u2014 are sharing their stories of how birth control helped them, illustrating the shameful potential consequences of congressional attacks on reproductive rights.\n\n\u201cBirth control is transformative, essential and irreplaceable, yet over the past few years it has become increasingly politicized \u2014 and these political attacks are only heating up, with Congress debating proposals to eliminate all funding for the nation\u2019s family planning program,\u201d Eric Ferrero, Planned Parenthood\u2019s vice president of communications, said. \u201cThis campaign is about empowering people to share their own stories about the very real ways birth control has improved their lives to keep our country moving ever forward \u2014 never backward \u2014 on birth control.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP is doing what it can to gut Title X funding -- but the Harvard grads who benefitted from it are firing back", "author": "Jenny Kutner", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The GOP is doing what it can to gut Title X funding -- but the Harvard grads who benefitted from it are firing back", "title": "Threaten family planning, raise hell: #BirthControlHelpedMe challenges congressional lunacy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/23/threaten_family_planning_raise_hell_birthcontrolhelpedme_challenges_congressional_lunacy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/shutterstock_193541405.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The GOP is doing what it can to gut Title X funding -- but the Harvard grads who benefitted from it are firing back", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/shutterstock_193541405.jpg", "title": "Threaten family planning, raise hell: #BirthControlHelpedMe challenges congressional lunacy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Threaten family planning, raise hell: #BirthControlHelpedMe challenges congressional lunacy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, #birthcontrolhelpedme, Birth Control, Contraception, family planning, GOP, Planned Parenthood, reproductive health, Reproductive Rights, Republicans, title x, War on women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis campaign is about empowering people to share their own stories about the very real ways birth control has improved their lives to keep our country moving ever forward \u2014 never backward \u2014 on birth control.\u201d\nWhat the GOP doesn\u2019t seem to understand (in addition to simple math) is that birth control, in particular, affords women control not only over their bodies, but over their livelihood and their futures as well.\nNaturally, those nearly 5 million Americans \u2014 and thousands of others who have benefited from access to contraception and other basic healthcare \u2014 are pissed.\nIn its funding proposal for the 2016 fiscal year, the House Appropriations Committee proposed to eliminate Title X funding for programs that don\u2019t meet certain ideological (abstinence-only) standards, which could effectively shut down critical family planning and reproductive health services for nearly 5 million low-income Americans.\nIt is a virtual necessity for economic freedom and social equality \u2014 which is why many advocates are speaking out about the role contraception has played in their lives."}
