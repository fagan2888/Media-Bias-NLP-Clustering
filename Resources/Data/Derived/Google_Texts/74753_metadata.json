Terry, 52, has won each congressional election since then, but his margin of winning in recent races has significantly narrowed. In 2006, Terry won by 10 points, in 2008 it was four and by the 2012 election Terry\u2019s margin of victory fell to just two points, when he defeated his Democratic challenger John Ewing.\n\nDuring the debate, Democratic challenger Brad Ashford repeatedly touted his 16 years representing District 20 in the Nebraska unicameral. Senator Ashford, 64, who has been both a registered Republican and Independent, is now aligned with the Democrats. He said his bipartisan and centrist approach to politics will be an advantage in Washington, if he is elected. He said the most important thing he can do for the Second District and the nation is to to work across the aisle with members of all political persuasions. An example, Sen. Ashford pointed to his work in the unicameral reforming Nebraska\u2019s juvenile justice system.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that I think was been plaguing Nebraska for so many years is the tough issue of juvenile justice and juvenile crime,\u201d Sen. Ashford said. \u201cOver the last three to four years in the legislature years we\u2019ve worked across party lines and unanimously passed major reform of our juvenile justice system.\u201d\n\nRep. Lee Terry said during in his tenure in Congress he has worked to pass many pieces of legislation that he is proud of. But he stated that his primary focus has been to promote energy independence for America.\n\n\u201cMaking our resources accessible, but also in the world of renewable fuels as well,\u201d Rep. Terry said. \u201cIt was me and a Democrat that was able to get a bill passed that allowed for research of hydrogen vehicles as well as others.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to foreign policy issues, Rep. Terry said he believes the government should be very wary of risking American lives to combat terrorism abroad.\n\n\u201cIt has to be in the national security interest of our nation. If you are under the threat of attack then I think you have to respond,\u201d Rep. Terry said. \u201cCertainly with ISIL, in the meeting I have attending, they are a clear threat.\u201d\n\nSen. Ashford agreed with Rep. Terry over his reluctance to send American troops abroad. Turning to the subject of American troops in Afghanistan, Rep. Terry said he wants the withdrawal of troops to continue, but only when \u2018Afghanistan can stand on their own legs.\n\n\u201cIn Iraq when we pulled out to fast, we created a vacuum, because the government wasn\u2019t ready yet,\u201d Rep. Terry said. \u201cThat vacuum is going to be filled. That vacuum was filled in Iraq by ISIL and that could happen again in Afghanistan if we pull out too quickly.\n\nSenator Ashford agreed with Rep. Terry that American military forces should stay the course in Afghanistan \u2018until the democracy is set.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat is amazing to me is the effectiveness of our military in the Middle East,\u201d Sen Ashford said. \u201cI agree with Lee on this, I think we should maintain our presence in Afghanistan until we\u2019ve made some progress with the new government that has just been elected. \u201c\n\nIn a discussion of economic issues, Rep. Terry believes things are a bit shaky but he said he has a sense that things are going in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThe first thing is we have to continue to expand our economy,\u201d Rep. Terry said. \u201cThere is a lot of thing we should be doing to make sure our economy is growing. With more jobs creates pressure on wages, in fact I am seeing wages in our metropolitan area going up. There are open manufacturing jobs right now that are $20 per hour where maybe a couple years ago they would have been far less than that.\u201d\n\nSenator Ashford then took issue with Rep. Terry\u2019s view on the economy.\n\n\u201cWe need to unleash our economy,\u201d Sen. Ashford said. \u201cLee has been in Congress now for 14 years, in that time, we have not had corporate tax reform in that time. We have to bring the $2 trillion back to America and get our country moving again.\u201d\n\nRep. Terry agreed that the corporate tax needs to be simpler and flatter and he called it an \u2018old code for a different time.\u2019 Both Ashford and Terry agreed on bringing corporations back to America.\n\nSticking with the economy, Sen. Ashford said there also needs to be a boost in the minimum wage to low-income workers. He also noted a large gap in pay for women.\n\n\u201cIn the last 14 or 15 years GDP has increased by about 40%, and the median family income has increased by about 8%, so there is a gap,\u201d Sen. Ashford said. \u201cWe also need to push equal pay for women. Congress needs to work together to get these things past. It\u2019s been five years since the minimum wage was raised.\u201d\n\nSen. Ashford also pointed out that growing income inequality in American must be addressed by the congress. He said he would vote for a minimum wage increase. Terry however said he would not support a minimum wage increase. He focused not on the wage gap, but what he called the \u2018skills gap.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe best ways to get people high paying jobs is to give them the skills necessary to succeed,\u201d Rep. Terry said.\n\nOn the subject of healthcare, Ashford said he wouldn\u2019t have voted for the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t support the employer mandate,\u201d Sen Ashford said. \u201cEmployers already have a benefit for providing insurance and quite frankly I do agree employers could make a full-time employee, a part-time employee. There are 150 million Americans covered by employers insurance and I think that will continue.\u201d\n\nSen. Ashford said there is a more work to be done and not just simply voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Rep. Terry said the ACA must be repealed and called it horrible law saying it damaged the economy.\n\n\u201cFar more people have come to me and talked about the higher costs of insurance now,\u201d Rep. Terry said. Businesses have told me about how they\u2019ve changed employees from full-time to part-time or that if they don\u2019t get some relief, they could go out of business.\u201d\n\nAshford said \u2018voting to repeal it 56 times isn\u2019t the answer,\u2019 he added, \u2018neither is waiting four years to fix it.\u2019\n\nIssues like immigration, veterans\u2019 benefits, the fight against Ebola and the Keystone XL pipeline were among the other topics during debate.\n\nComments are closed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Omaha, NE - The race for Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional seat between Republican incumbent Lee Terry and Democratic challenger Brad Ashford inches closer to November 4th\u2019s Election Day.
