They hate the haggling and the cheesy sales tactics, and they hate leaving feeling ripped off, even if they drove off with a good deal. Car salespeople are the least trusted professionals in the nation, even beating out members of Congress for the dubious title.\n\nBut for 80 years, that\u2019s been the only game in town. If you\u2019ve ever bought a new car, you\u2019ve had to do it at a car dealer and on its terms. Unless you recently bought a Tesla, that is.\n\nThe direct-sales model Tesla uses threatens the very existence of car dealers. The electric-car company markets its cars through stores called galleries and over the Internet. There\u2019s no dickering, bait-and-switch or trade-ins, and no sales people if you don\u2019t want them. All prices are set, you pick the features and options you want from a menu and your car is delivered to your door. The entire experience is often described as being as easy as buying from the Apple Store.\n\nJohn Voelcker, editor of Green Car Reports, says that if Tesla\u2019s direct-sales model catches on, it could be a huge \u201ccrack in the dam\u201d for dealers as consumers will naturally gravitate to the better car-buying experience.\n\n\u201cThe dealers are afraid that the public will find that this is a process that is vastly more appealing,\u201d says Voelcker. \u201cAnd if Tesla gets big and is selling 500,000 cars in 10 years, then people are going to talk about their experience, and others will demand the same when they buy. The dealers know this.\u201d\n\nAutomotive analysts say that if Tesla\u2019s model proves successful it could inspire other car makers like General Motors, Ford or Toyota to once again try direct sales themselves (as they have, unsuccessfully, on a few occasions since World War II). The dealers believe this might doom them.\n\nBut the auto dealers \u2014 knowing their business model is flawed, antiquated and imperiled \u2014 are not going down without a fight. Dealer associations are aggressively protecting their turf using their powerful state lobbies to pump legislators and governors either to shut Tesla down or hobble it so it can\u2019t become a threat. Many states already have laws stating that automakers can\u2019t sell cars directly to the public and compete with the independent dealerships that sell their brands. But now, dealers want statehouses to rewrite those laws to apply to automakers that don\u2019t have dealers, like Tesla.\n\nLast month, Iowa became the latest state to challenge Tesla Motors\u2019 right to sell its cars directly to consumers. The state\u2019s Department of Transportation told the electric-car manufacturer that it must stop offering test drives in the state, because it isn\u2019t registered as an auto dealer there. The state\u2019s DOT ordered Tesla to halt its test drives only after it was tipped off by the state\u2019s Automobile Dealers Association, according to the Des Moines Register.\n\nIowa joins Arizona, Maryland, New Jersey, and Texas in restricting the direct sales of Teslas. The only states to formally approve of Tesla\u2019s direct-sales model are California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Virginia.\n\nTesla\u2019s ability to sell cars directly is being vigorously challenged across the country. According to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing the 12 largest automakers, dealers have pushed 33 bills in 26 states so far this year. Auto dealers have also tried to challenge Massachusetts laws allowing Tesla sales operations there, taking their case to the state\u2019s courts; however, the state\u2019s Supreme Judicial Court recently ruled in the car maker\u2019s favor.\n\nWhy Are Dealers Afraid of Tesla?\n\nIt might seem curious that a state would prohibit an automaker from selling its cars directly to consumers, and that state lawmakers are so quick to act against Tesla. But the legal objections to Tesla\u2019s sales model are rooted in states\u2019 laws, some written decades ago, that forbid automakers from competing against franchised car dealerships.\n\nDealerships have been at odds with the concept of direct sales by the automakers since the Depression era. Back then, dealers were considered independent and therefore more accountable to their buyers, with whom they stayed in contact through the entire ownership experience. So regulations were put in place to stop the car companies from competing against dealers as they could have an unfair pricing advantage and could possibly shut them down. Consumers would suffer because they would be at the mercy of a large corporation, not a local proprietor.\n\nJim Ziegler, an automotive sales trainer, says that Tesla will eventually bust the dealer franchise laws on the books and allow for all car makers to sell directly to consumers. But he still believes that the laws, as they were written then, are a public benefit.\n\n\u201cFranchised dealers give consumers a competitive advantage with service and pricing. Factory-owned stores do not provide that,\u201d argues Ziegler in an article in Ward\u2019s Auto. \u201cPolitically, consumers might think the protected dealer franchise system is not in their best interest. Dealers generally sell their cars at a loss or break even. The manufacturers make the lion\u2019s share of the profit. With manufacturer control, margins and prices will increase.\u201d\n\nThis Year\u2019s Model\n\nOne of the reasons Tesla gives for eschewing the dealer business model is that the service and maintenance on its cars is distinct from that of internal-combustion engine cars. The all-electric Model S (the only Tesla currently on sale) requires no oil, spark plugs, fuel filter changes, or tuneups. There are no emissions to be tested. If something goes wrong, it can often be fixed with a software update or patch sent over the Internet. If there\u2019s a need for physical service, Tesla sends over a flat-bed to pick up the car and leaves a loaner, all for free. Thus, Tesla maintains it has no need for a service department, one of the most integral parts of a dealership.\n\nWhile the Model S, introduced last year, may have fewer parts to service, it has had some dependability problems and glitches early on, though that\u2019s not unusual for any first-year model, despite the drivetrain. And while Tesla says it won\u2019t make servicing its cars a profit center, it doesn\u2019t mean its cars are bulletproof.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s are still electro-mechanical devices,\u201d says Voelcker, \u201cTheir mechanical parts will still wear out. They\u2019re still going to need servicing over time.\u201d\n\nSo, with a high-tech sales and service operation to go with its electric car, Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he found little need for the dealership-style business model.\n\n\u201cWhen Tesla came along as a new company with no existing franchisees, the auto dealers, who possess vastly more resources and influence than Tesla, nonetheless sought to force us to sell through them,\u201d says Musk. \u201cThe reason that we did not choose to do this is that the auto dealers have a fundamental conflict of interest between promoting gasoline cars \u2014 which constitute virtually all of their revenue \u2014 and electric cars, which constitute virtually none.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The electric car company's sales model poses an existential threat.
