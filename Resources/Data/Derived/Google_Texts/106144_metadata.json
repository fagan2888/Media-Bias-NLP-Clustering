It's affiliate American HealthTech, meanwhile, provides clinical and financial solutions for more than 3,300 post-acute care providers and nursing facilities, while affiliate Rycan offers revenue cycle management workflow and automation software to 250 hospitals.\n\nTo make the acquisition, CPSI is using a mix of available cash, funded debt from a senior secured credit facility and shares of its common stock.\n\nCPSI said the combined company will have annual revenues of about $300 million in 2015 and will employ more than 1,900 staffers. CPSI's adjusted earnings per diluted share is expected to increase by 35 percent in 2016 and 50 percent the year after.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nCPSI chief executive Boyd Douglas said the combined company will serve about 1,200 acute care facilities and 3,300 post-acute care facilities. He added that the company will better be able to drive patient engagement and care coordination, particularly as health systems transition to more of a value-based payment model.\n\nCPSI is the parent of two companies, Evident and TruBridge. Evident provides electronic health record software to community hospitals -- similar to one of Healthland's core functions.\n\nTwitter: @JELagasse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/electronic-health-records-vendor-cpsi-buys-rural-competitor-healthland-250-million", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doctor-ehr-hfn-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Computer Programs and Systems, which provides healthcare information solutions to rural and community hospitals, will buy technology vendor firm Healthland Holding and its affiliates for $250 million, the company announced.", "title": "Electronic health records vendor CPSI buys rural competitor Healthland for $250 million"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doctor-ehr-hfn-feature.jpg"}, "description": "Computer Programs and Systems, which provides healthcare information solutions to rural and community hospitals, will buy technology vendor firm Healthland Holding and its affiliates for $250 million, the company announced.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Electronic health records vendor CPSI buys rural competitor Healthland for $250 million"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Computer Programs and Systems, which provides healthcare information solutions to rural and community hospitals, will buy technology vendor firm Healthland Holding and its affiliates for $250 million, the company announced.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Like Healthcare Finance on FacebookCPSI chief executive Boyd Douglas said the combined company will serve about 1,200 acute care facilities and 3,300 post-acute care facilities.\nHealthland provides electronic health records and clinical information management to more than 350 hospitals.\nEvident provides electronic health record software to community hospitals -- similar to one of Healthland's core functions.\nComputer Programs and Systems, which provides healthcare information solutions to rural and community hospitals, will buy technology vendor firm Healthland Holding and its affiliates for $250 million, the company announced.\nHe added that the company will better be able to drive patient engagement and care coordination, particularly as health systems transition to more of a value-based payment model."}
