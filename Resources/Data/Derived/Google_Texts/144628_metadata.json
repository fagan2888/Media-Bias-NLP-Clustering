McCulloch from a public program being scheduled by SLU Law students.\n\n\u201cAs an organization, we implore the SLU Law administration to rescind Mr. McCulloch\u2019s invitation to speak on February 20,\u201d the black law students wrote in an open letter. \u201cWe also implore SLU Law to be tolerant and accepting of protests and dissent that may arise.\u201d\n\nProtests and dissent certainly will arise if McCulloch speaks at the day-long \u201cThin Blue Line: Policing Post Ferguson\u201d event scheduled for from 8:30 a.m. \u2013 4 p.m. Friday, February 20 at Scott Hall.\n\nCome early if you want to see the fireworks, as McCulloch is slated to give the opening address. A press release says he will \u201cprovide personal insight into the political challenges facing prosecutors who are asked to review police conduct, respond to community pressure, and set law enforcement priorities.\u201d\n\nThe black law students said McCulloch\u2019s handling of the Darren Wilson case shredded his legal credibility and rendered him unfit to speak under the auspices of a law school. They decried his \u201cunethical behavior during Wilson\u2019s grand jury process and during the post-decision press conference (the latter of which stoked riots in Ferguson).\u201d\n\nThe EYE agrees with this account of McCulloch\u2019s actions and credibility, but questions the strategic decision to silence him, especially since a Q&A has been promised. McCulloch is so brazen and unapologetic that he digs a deeper hole for himself every time he goes on public record. Many of the worst claims against McCulloch \u2013 for example, that he suborned perjury in the Wilson case \u2013 we know because he admitted it in public. The EYE wants more of McCulloch on the record, not less.\n\nLooting anniversary\n\nSt. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar \u2013 who led the homicide investigation in the Wilson case, as well as the initial militarized police response to Ferguson protests \u2013 also is on the \u201cThin Blue Line\u201d bill at SLU Law. This week Belmar\u2019s department observed the six-month anniversary of the August 10 looting in Ferguson by posting video and photos of it. The EYE noticed St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger did not brand this looting evidence, as he was called out in this space for doing last week.\n\nCoordinated and unconstitutional\n\nBelmar\u2019s counterpart in the city, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson, is exploring a motorist version of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policing in downtown St. Louis, according to news reports.\n\nMissy Kelley, the chief operating officer of Downtown STL, Inc. \u2013 and suddenly an authority on policing \u2013 said the new \u201ccoordinated safety checks\u201d could include \u201cstopping vehicles and searching for things like unbuckled seat belts, alcohol, guns and drugs.\u201d\n\nMissy and Sam might also search for the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which offers protection against \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d while they are at it. They seem to have lost sight of it.\n\nMuni court bill advances\n\nThis week the Missouri Senate gave initial approval to Senate Bill 5, legislation sponsored by state Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Glendale, to prevent municipalities from using unfair traffic ticketing practices for the sole purpose of increasing local revenue. Senate Bill 5 needs a final vote in the upper chamber before moving onto the House for consideration.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 5, a municipality may only fund up to 10 percent of its budget with traffic fines. The reduction would be phased in over two years. Additionally, the bill has provisions that create penalties if political subdivisions do not remit money over the threshold: people in the city will get the opportunity to vote on municipal disincorporation; and the excess revenue will be distributed to local schools, enforced by the Department of Revenue.\n\n\u201cAs lawmakers, we have to rein in this practice, which all too often falls on the backs of lower-income citizens,\u201d Schmitt said. Finally, a major initiative we can support from a GOP legislator. Good looking out.\n\nMunis going out of business?\n\nSpeaking of \u201cmunicipal disincorporation\u201d \u2013 that is, taking a municipality out of business \u2013 state Rep. Bob Burns, D-St. Louis, has filed legislation that would streamline the process in St. Louis County. There are more than 90 municipalities in the county, many of which have just a couple hundred residents and offer few, if any, municipal services.\n\nUnder House Bill 741, an election to discorporate a city, town or village would be forced by the filing of a petition signed by at least 25 percent of city voters. If a majority of voters support it, then the municipality would be disincorporated.\n\n\u201cPart of our dysfunction as a region stems from the fractured municipal governance in St. Louis County, which not only has too many municipalities, but has too many small municipalities that lack the tax base and revenue to properly function,\u201d Burns said. Yeah, like he said.\n\nListen up, labor\n\nOn Tuesday, February 11, the Missouri House of Represented perfected state Rep. Courtney Curtis\u2019 bill that would impose \u201cRight to Work\u201d in the state\u2019s construction trades, which have been notoriously resistant to racial diversity. Labor is moaning that his bill could lead to more general \u201cRight to Work\u201d laws and the erosion of labor power and wages, but the EYE says labor needs to listen up.\n\nAsking black legislators to protect labor in the trades that have largely resisted the inclusion of black people is plain stupid. Curtis\u2019 constituents see him as a hero taking on a special interest that has actively worked against the interests of the black community. He had the political savvy to align himself with his party\u2019s political enemies to deliver a surgical strike at one of his community\u2019s enemies.\n\n\u2018Manly firmness\u2019?\n\nDon\u2019t get the EYE twisted. There is no Republican love here. How can there be? When you have the Republican super-majority in the Missouri State Legislature passing a resolution calling for the Missouri Congressional delegation to \u201cendeavor with \u2018manly firmness\u2019 and resolve to totally and completely repeal\u201d and not replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cManly firmness\u201d? Seriously?\n\nU.S. Senator Claire McCaskill responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think you prove your manhood by kicking folks off their health coverage and once again letting insurance companies discriminate against women and sick people.\u201d\n\nIt is estimated that a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act would strip more than 200,000 Missourians of health insurance coverage, and (according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office) would raise the national deficit by billions of dollars.\n\nTemple of doom\n\nNot that the EYE has much love for the actions of Missouri Dems either.\n\nLast week the Missouri Democratic State Committee re-elected Roy Temple as chair of the Missouri Democratic Party. Temple was first elected to the position in 2013, but has been in the Dem game in Missouri, approximately, forever.\n\nConsider the 2014 that Missouri Democrats suffered through in the state\u2019s largest urban center. A Democratic county prosecutor who provoked riots in Ferguson (McCulloch) led the election of a Democratic county executive who would later brand riot looting evidence as his own while forcing blacks out of county offices (Stenger). This unholy alliance of white Democrats forced a major defection of black Democrats to Stenger\u2019s Republican opponent (Rick Stream) \u2013 and now a black Democrat-supported Right to Work bill.\n\nAll of this happened on Temple\u2019s watch without a word of leadership from him. That was 2014. And we are already looking at critical 2016 contests. And Temple is still your guy in 2015? Really?\n\nYet all of the other powerful white Dems \u2013 McCaskill, Gov. Jay Nixon, Attorney General Chris Koster, State Treasurer Clint Zweifel and Secretary of State Jason Kander \u2013 signed on to more of Temple, with the usual platitudes, as if their collective hair were not on fire. \u201cRoy has the strategic vision we need as we continue to grow our party,\u201d said Koster, for example. Really?\n\nThe Missouri Democratic State Committee also re-elected St. Louis Comptroller Darlene Green as vice chair.
