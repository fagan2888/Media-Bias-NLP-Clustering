Scott Fitzgerald, literature, reading, The Great Gatsby, Life News\n\nWhenever I teach \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d as I have so many times in my forty years in the college classroom, I always wonder if I will tell the students my story. It\u2019s my mother\u2019s story, really. But it\u2019s mine, too, the story of a personal link to the book\u2019s author that tinges every professional comment I make about themes and narrative voice and structure and the other facets of fiction that English professors train their students to look for. I care about all these, to be sure, but I have an intensely private as well as professional understanding of the novel at hand. Or rather, the private and professional strands are so intertwined that I can\u2019t really say where one ends and the other begins. In class I present them as separate. I tell the personal story when I\u2019ve proven to myself that I don\u2019t have to, when I feel we have satisfactorily \u201ccovered\u201d the \u201cmaterial,\u201d as we call it, with professorial dispassion and dispatch. Perhaps the revelation comes in an impulsive moment of warmth for the group of young people before me\u2014I want to be closer to them, to give them something they might find special. Or perhaps there\u2019s been a little sag in classroom energy and I turn to the story to reinvigorate us.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a personal connection that may interest you. My mother actually knew F. Scott Fitzgerald. It was in the last years of his life in Hollywood.\u201d I see mild interest in their faces. \u201cShe was involved with him,\u201d I say. A variant of this, if the group seems more sophisticated, perhaps a class of graduate students, might be: \u201cShe was his lover.\u201d Interest at this point increases, usually mixed with a bit of understandable anxiety that an aging female professor, talking about her mother\u2019s lover, has become unpredictable. \u201cYes, they were together for three-and-a-half years. He died in her living room\u2014stood up and dropped dead of a heart attack. A few days before Christmas 1940.\u201d Now I\u2019ve made it vivid. \u201cBut what interests me the most,\u201d I say, \u201cis that he devised for her an education. The F. Scott Fitzgerald College of One. It was an entire college curriculum\u2014with history and art and music, and even a little economics. But above all poetry and the novel. Dickens. Thackeray. Henry James. We had the books from the College of One in our library when I was a child. Those were the books I read growing up.\u201d My private relation to F. Scott Fitzgerald is that he bought the books for my mother that I have loved all my life, the books, it\u2019s fair to say, that turned me into a professor of English literature. I loved the volumes in the College of One inside and out\u2014their bindings, their pages, their print, their stories\u2014and I lived in them more fully than I can remember living in the world around me. Thus, my F. Scott Fitzgerald story is less that he was my mother\u2019s lover before I was born, dying dramatically in her living room, releasing her to go forth and be with other men and become my mother, than that he shaped my life\u2019s reading by having bought her those books. Long before I even knew of her connection to him, they lined the shelves along opposite walls of our den, there for me to take down and carry upstairs to my bedroom and immerse myself in stories that transported me to other times and places. The palm trees and eucalyptus of dusky Southern California gave way to the imagined bustle of Thackeray\u2019s London or the green landscape of David Copperfield\u2019s Suffolk downs. And as soon as I finished one book, perhaps \u201cTom Jones\u201d or \u201cBleak House,\u201d I would ask my mother to recommend another, thus building the shadow world that I would live in, have lived in all my life.\n\nSo reading and teaching \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d entails for me, always, not only the themes of the great American novel with its tragic dreamer hero, believing in the wrong dreams, but also the subtext of my mother\u2019s relationship with Fitzgerald, my mother herself looming as a kind of female Gatsby, a woman who emerged from a Jewish orphanage and made herself up as Sheilah Graham, London chorus girl and Hollywood columnist, suppressing her Jewishness and her early poverty, believing anything was possible, and awesome in the energy of her self-creation, to which she proved faithful to the end. And I understand Gatsby as myself, someone who has wed her dreams to people, starting with my mother, whom I wanted to believe in as golden and magic. But I am Nick Carraway as well, awed by Gatsby but able to judge him; the level-headed spectator, who ultimately turns away from a gaudy world to seek something else, a more solid if more ordinary existence. And I link, too, with Fitzgerald in our shared love for my mother. And with him as a pedagogue devising his syllabi for the F. Scott Fitzgerald College of One, joining with me in our imagined shared love of Victorian novels. Everything is all mixed together.\n\nI want to write of the private stories that lie behind our reading of books, taking my own trajectory through English literature as the history I know best but proposing a way of thinking about literature that I believe is every reader\u2019s process. We bring ourselves with all our aspirations and wounds, affinities and aversions, insights and confusions to the books we read, and our experience shapes our responses. I have begun by citing my relation to \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d but the story of reading \u201cDavid Copperfield\u201d or \u201cVanity Fair\u201d or \u201cTo the Lighthouse\u201d or any of the books discussed in this volume is just as dramatically personal. Young David has an evil stepfather, as did I, and I share in David\u2019s fear and loathing of this figure. The \u00e9lan of Becky Sharp reminds me of my mother, and I can\u2019t help admiring Thackeray\u2019s witty, resourceful rogue. The yearning of Woolf\u2019s grief-suffused Lily Briscoe for the dead Mrs. Ramsay touches the chord of all the important losses of my life. Of course, reading is more complicated than this finding of biographical parallels. We also read, as one of my students has so well put it, \u201cto escape the relentless monotony of being ourselves\u201d as well as \u201cto return from the experience with a slightly different mind than we had going in.\u201d All that is true, and much else besides, a subtle and magical interaction between the reader and the book that I hope to illuminate.\n\nWhen I first thought to write a book about reading and literary characters, I had a concept for a more strictly academic study that I called \u201cfrom orphan to immigrant.\u201d Always attuned to patterns and structure, I saw a succession of figures in the English novel: the orphan of the Victorian period, the \u201cnew woman\u201d and the artist of late nineteenth-, early twentieth-century modernism, and the immigrant of late twentieth-century postcolonialism that linked for me in a striking genealogy. Each in turn fits uneasily with his or her society, yet at the same time becomes representative of that society, the protagonist who speaks for a given age, expressing its energy, its fears and aspirations. I was struck, for example, by a passage in Hanif Kureshi\u2019s \u201cThe Buddha of Suburbia\u201d in which a theatrical producer explains to the protagonist Karim that \u201cthe immigrant is the Everyman of the twentieth century.\u201d Karim has been asked to \u201cplay\u201d an Indian\u2014i.e. wear a loin cloth and cultivate an Indian accent\u2014for a theater production of \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d in which he has landed the leading role of Mowgli. Yet Karim, born in London, sees himself as \u201can Englishman born and bred, almost.\u201d The Indian identity that goes unnamed creates the \u201calmost.\u201d \u201cPerhaps,\u201d he muses, poising himself on the brink of a modern day picaro\u2019s adventures, \u201cit\u2019s the odd mixture of continents and blood, of here and there, of belonging and not, that makes me restless and easily bored.\u201d He declares himself \u201cready for anything,\u201d a prime condition for fiction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Their three-year fling \u2014 which ended when he died in her living room \u2014 has shaped my life in immeasurable ways", "title": "My mother\u2019s affair with F.
