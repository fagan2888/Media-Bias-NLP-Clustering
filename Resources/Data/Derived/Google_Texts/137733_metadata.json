Welcome to \u201cThis Week In Crazy,\u201d The National Memo\u2019s weekly update on the loony, bigoted, and hateful behavior of the increasingly unhinged right wing. Starting with number five:\n\n5. Paul Meyer\n\nThe Christian persecution narrative plays itself out in arenas of great consequence (such as the ongoing assault to which Christian groups subject Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate, which was again argued before the Supreme Court this week) and not (remember when Megyn Kelly got all huffy arguing that Santa was white?)\n\nThis belongs to the latter category.\n\nPaul Meyer, who sits on the Millard Public School Board in Omaha, had a little hissy fit recently, in which he told atheists to \u201ccrawl back into their hellhole.\u201d The dispute had something to do with the phrase \u201cwinter break.\u201d Those damned atheists and their seasons.\n\nAs reported by Omaha.com, Meyer whined that he\u2019s \u201ca little bit tired of a minute minority in this country that keeps pushing Christmas out, keep pushing God out, keep pushing Christ out, when the majority is still a Judeo-Christian country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to make a motion that we rename this period Christmas break, and those atheists who don\u2019t like it can crawl back into their hellhole, because I, for one, will not put my Lord, my God, aside for a few atheists,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t like it, the ACLU doesn\u2019t like it, the heck with them.\u201d\n\nRaw Story helpfully notes that:\n\nLast year Meyer made news when he defended embattled Nebraska State Board of Education member Pat McPherson for posting racist comments about President Barack Obama on his Objective Conservative blog. When fellow state board members voted to ask McPherson to resign after public outcry, Meyer called upon those board members to step down for attempting to violate his right to free speech. \u201cThe responsibility of this board is to set a good example for the kids of this state,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cBut what you show these kids is that the First Amendment is null and void, and does not apply to anyone if the speech Nazis disagree.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood example.\u201d Right.\n\nHat tip Raw Story\n\nNext: Joy Overbeck", "article_metadata": {"description": "The War on Christians is heating up, Bernie Sanders is the new Hitler, and Michele Bachmann is still talking.
