(Reed Saxon/AP Photo)\n\nKaiser explained to them , and to me, that their plan didn\u2019t meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and therefore had to be canceled. But how could it be, many readers wondered, that the seemingly inferior plan offered for next year met the requirements of the act while the richer one they currently have does not?\n\nKaiser Permanente\u2019s decision to cancel the insurance policies of lifelong Democrats Lee Hammack and JoEllen Brothers generated a flood of interest yesterday. The couple, supporters of President Obama, may have to spend twice as much next year for a health insurance plan that has fewer benefits than the plan they have .\n\nI spent hours yesterday trying to figure that out and in the process came upon a related dispute between California\u2019s insurance commissioner and the state\u2019s new health insurance marketplace over these cancellations.\n\nHere\u2019s what I learned:\n\nFirst, President Obama\u2019s now-infamous pledge that those who liked their health plan could keep it applied only to people enrolled in those plans as of the day the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, March 23, 2010. That became known as the \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause.\n\nHammack, a San Francisco architect, and Brothers have been members of Kaiser Permanente since 1995, but they\u2019ve only been enrolled in this particular plan since January 2011. So they do not qualify for the grandfather protection. (Even if they did, Politifact has labeled the pledge \u201cpants on fire.\u201d)\n\nNext, and more importantly, the benefits their plan offered didn\u2019t fully comply with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt did not cover dependents in the manner set out by the law, and it did not cover pediatric dental and vision services, as well as \u201chabilitative services,\u201d which includes speech, occupational therapy and physical therapy.\n\n\u201cWe did not cover these services in 2013,\u201d Kaiser spokesman Chris Stenrud wrote in an email. \u201cPediatric dental and vision obviously do not apply to this couple, but it is one benefit package, regardless of age.\u201d\n\nThese seemed like pretty minor points. Is this really enough to tank this plan? I asked Ken Wood, senior adviser for products, marketing and health plan relations for Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace.\n\n\u201cAny tiny point tanks the plan,\u201d he told me last night. \u201cIf it was just the pediatric dental, that alone would say it\u2019s a noncompliant plan.\u201d\n\nThere was a bigger issue, too. The plan was medically underwritten, meaning that it carefully chose members based on their health status. The Affordable Care Act eliminates such screening and requires that insurers take all comers. \u201cBecause their current insurance pool is comprised of healthier people who use fewer medical services, the premium level needed to pay for those services is also less,\u201d Stenrud wrote.\n\nPut another way, Hammack and Brothers are casualties of an insurance system in transition. Until now, insurance companies could pick and choose which consumers to accept and reject. People were forced to pay different amounts based on their age and health status.\n\nThe new system created by the Affordable Care Act does not allow plans to turn away people with pre-existing conditions or charge them more. As a result, sick people previously denied coverage and healthy people who currently have insurance will pay the same.\n\nThat makes health care more affordable for many, but less affordable for some.\n\nBut there was something else at play. Stenrud noted that Kaiser\u2019s contract with Covered California requires that insurers doing business on the exchange cancel existing contracts at the end of this year -- rather than renew them -- if they don\u2019t meet the requirements of the act.\n\n\u201cWe shared Covered California\u2019s view that most consumers would benefit from lower premiums and greater stability in the exchange if we all agreed to forgo early renewals in the individual market,\u201d Stenrud wrote.\n\nFor more explanation of what\u2019s going on, I called the California Department of Insurance. The agency earlier this week forced Blue Shield of California to extend the canceled health policies of 115,000 members for three months because the insurer did not give them proper notice.\n\nJanice Rocco, the department\u2019s deputy commissioner for health policy and reform, said she anticipates that by year\u2019s end, between 900,000 and 1 million Californians will see their individual health insurance policies canceled.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t have to be this way, she said.\n\nWait, what?\n\nIt\u2019s not the act, but the arrangement between insurers and Covered California that mandated the cancellations right now.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act aims to improve the quality of insurance plans offered, she said, it does not require that insurers cancel all of their contracts at the end of this year. In other states, she noted, consumers are able to keep their policies until they expire in 2014, giving more time to make thoughtful choices.\n\nInsurers, including Kaiser and Blue Shield, wanted the California Legislature to require that all existing individual contracts expire at the end of this year, Rocco said. That could give them a marketing edge because of their size and the short window to make choices, she said. But her department opposed it, and lawmakers didn\u2019t go along.\n\nThe insurers were more successful with Covered California, which adopted the requirement, Rocco said.\n\n\u201cPeople who did the right thing, played by the rules, were responsible and had health insurance coverage are being forced out of their policies on December 31 by most of the health insurers in this state. This is not required by state or federal law,\u201d Rocco said.\n\n\u201cPeople without insurance today will have until March 31 to choose which product is best for them,\u201d she said, noting the end of the 2014 open enrollment period.\n\nCovered California defended its requirement.\n\n\u201cIt has always been one of our stated goals to try to start on a level playing field in 2014 and start out the new year with a single risk pool,\u201d meaning a melding of young and old, sick and healthy, said Anne Gonzales, a spokeswoman for the exchange.\n\nGonzales acknowledged that there will be winners and losers in this transition. \u201cThere are going to be people out there that are going to find that their premiums are about the same, some are going to have them go up, some are going to have them go down,\u201d Gonzales said.\n\nOf the 900,000 or so people whose policies are being canceled in California, she said, about 310,000 will qualify for financial assistance, in the form of premium subsidies, which will lower the cost of coverage. The rest will not.\n\n\u201cThe flip side is 32 million people [in California] will be keeping their plans, and 4 million people will get plans that they couldn\u2019t afford to buy before this reform,\u201d she said.\n\nWood said the situation facing Hammack and Brothers is \u201cunique in my experience\u201d and that the rate they have been paying is more akin to rates for people in their 20s. Hammack is 60; Brothers, 59.\n\nTogether, they pay $550 a month now and could pay up to $1,300 a month after Jan. 1. \u201cAt their respective ages, a more typical rate would be $550 each,\u201d Wood said.\n\nHammack told me that he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do. He makes slightly more than 400 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 $62,000 for a couple \u2014 which means he isn\u2019t eligible for premium subsidies. But he\u2019s considering reducing his income below that level, which would reduce his premiums substantially.\n\nWood says that\u2019s smart. If Hammack is able to get his income at or below $62,000, he stands to save $10,740, Wood told me in an email.\n\n\u201cJust as people think about the tax consequences of home ownership and retirement savings, I think health care will now become another area where the middle class will need to think about the tax implications of purchasing individual health insurance,\u201d he said.\n\nHas your insurance been canceled?
