McLeod\u2019s mucker\u2019s goal in the second period brought the Avalanche back to even against the Columbus Blue Jackets.\n\nAnd McLeod pumped his fist and whipped around, nearly accidentally decking the ref. McLeod was so excited \u2014 not for his goal, perhaps, but any goal.\n\nThe Avs finally surpassed 100 goals this season \u2014 the last team in the Central Division to get to triple digits. But they couldn\u2019t hold on because of a tally that really mattered.\n\nColumbus got an atoning goal from David Savard with 1:01 left in the game, a slap shot from the blue line, for a 4-3 victory over Colorado.\n\n\u201cObviously we should be disappointed \u2014 I am disappointed,\u201d Colorado coach Patrick Roy said. \u201cBecause, one minute left until overtime, this is when you should get to overtime. And this has happened too many times this year.\u201d\n\nThe Avs \u2014 who struggled to shoot, let alone score, for large parts against the Blue Jackets \u2014 lost just a third game in regulation in their past 11. They are 6-3-2 over that stretch.\n\nBut at 15-16-8, the Avs remain in last place in the Central Division.\n\n\u201cWe were one minute away from getting an important point and giving ourselves a chance where we have been confident and pretty successful, in OT,\u201d Avs forward Jarome Iginla said. \u201cBut unfortunately, we didn\u2019t get that done.\u201d\n\nSavard\u2019s goal deflected in off Avs rookie Borna Rendulic.\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado Avalanche vs. Columbus Blue Jackets, Jan. 4, 2015\n\nSo the Blue Jackets scored the winner late, while the Avs got on the board very early.\n\nIginla\u2019s goal just 30 seconds in got the Avs off to their quickest start of the season. Savard, a Columbus defenseman, threw a lazy break-out pass in his own zone and Iginla intercepted it, then wristed one of the easiest goals of his career.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t the final, ignominious word from Savard. The Avs picked on him all night. Gabe Landeskog ran over Savard on the left boards after a Tyson Barrie pass was fumbled by the Columbus defenseman. Landeskog stole the puck, cut across, then triple-deked Jackets goalie Curtis McElhinney for a goal that tied the game at 2 early in the second period.\n\nMcLeod\u2019s goal also came at the expense of Savard. McLeod scrapped out the puck behind the net, then wrapped around a goal off Savard\u2019s skate.\n\nBut the Avs were, for awhile, back to their worst habits.\n\nHalfway through the game, no Avs player had managed multiple shots. And Columbus had an 18-6 shot advantage and a 3-2 lead after two Brandon Dubinsky goals and a Ryan Johansen hustle goal.\n\nLandeskog broke a 15-game goalless streak, scoring his first since Nov. 29. But his fellow slumping forwards continued to struggle. Matt Duchene, who earned an assist on Landeskog\u2019s goal, managed just two shots and extended his goals slump to 10 games. Nathan MacKinnon, who got two shots, now has just one goal in his past 21 games.\n\n\u201cEven if we didn\u2019t have our best start, my problem wasn\u2019t with the number of shots,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIt was the way we compete.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche loses at home on late goal to Columbus Blue Jackets", "title": "Avalanche loses at home on late goal to Columbus Blue Jackets", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/04/avalanche-loses-at-home-on-late-goal-to-columbus-blue-jackets/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150104__blue-jackets-goalp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150104__blue-jackets-goalp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-04T20:54:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:55:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8cc\"", "article_summary": "PHOTOS: Colorado Avalanche vs. Columbus Blue Jackets, Jan. 4, 2015So the Blue Jackets scored the winner late, while the Avs got on the board very early.\nMcLeod\u2019s mucker\u2019s goal in the second period brought the Avalanche back to even against the Columbus Blue Jackets.\nColumbus got an atoning goal from David Savard with 1:01 left in the game, a slap shot from the blue line, for a 4-3 victory over Colorado.\nMcLeod was so excited \u2014 not for his goal, perhaps, but any goal.\nMatt Duchene, who earned an assist on Landeskog\u2019s goal, managed just two shots and extended his goals slump to 10 games."}
