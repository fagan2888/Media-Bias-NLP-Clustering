Theirs is one of the latest health care union battles to heat up in California between workers and hospital administration, and is drawing a new generation of members to union organizing.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think being a doctor is super glamorous and you make tons of money and everyone loves you,\u201d said Alana Arnold, a second-year resident. \u201cBut in fact, residency is difficult. We\u2019re here to learn and train. And we have to protect ourselves just like any other workforce.\u201d\n\nShe and other pediatric medicine residents in Oakland have joined with SEIU\u2019s Committee of Interns and Residents to fight for higher compensation, and a special fund for patients to cover bus tokens and other costs to help them get to appointments and maintain care.\n\nResidents are paid $52,000 a year and work up to 80 hours a week. The residents say they want a small $2,000 bonus over their three-year residency to help offset housing costs. But after more than a year of negotiating, there is no resolution. The latest talks with a federal mediator broke down.\n\n\u201cThis contract bargaining has now become an issue of respect,\u201d Arnold said at a demonstration outside the hospital last Friday. \u201cThe hospital administrators must see us as equal contributors and as professionals who provide critical medical services to patients of Children\u2019s Hospital.\u201d\n\nThe hospital says it values the residents, but it also faces high costs of doing business in the Bay Area. Spokesperson Melinda Krigel says the hospital has to balance the residency program with a lot of competing needs, including patient care, research and community benefits.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at all our costs and programs and decide where we have to put the money to sustain our mission,\u201d Krigel said.\n\nShe said the residents\u2019 demands come at the same time that federal grants for graduate medical training have been slashed 30 percent. The hospital plans to accept 28 residents in the next incoming class, compared to 30 in each of the last few years.\n\n\u201cWithout that federal funding, our hands are tied,\u201d Ms. Krigel said, adding that the residents do get various financial perks \u2014 including a stipend for books, and free food.\n\nThe residents say the hospital should tap into the $50 million philanthropic gift it recently received from Marc and Lynne Benioff, following the Oakland hospital\u2019s affiliation with the UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital earlier this year. The hospital says it hasn\u2019t yet decided how it will spend the money.\n\nThe residents were joined by at least one member of another union at their march on Friday. Susan Segal is a nurse in the intensive care nursery at Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland and a member of the California Nurses Association, a union that has often been at odds with SEIU, the union backing the residents.\n\n\u201cThere are huge divides. And there have been historically huge feuds and coming together of SEIU and CNA,\u201d Segal said. \u201cBut when it comes to this hospital, we stand together. Personally as a nurse and union member I\u2019m committed to supporting every other union and their fights.\u201d\n\nArnold says it\u2019s important for people at all levels of the health care field, and of all ages, to get involved with their union.\n\n\u201cBeing a doctor is a privilege and an honor,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut it is something that should not be abused by your employer. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going on with the hospital administration. So it\u2019s just out of necessity that we need to organize and make sure that our working conditions are appropriate and necessary to carry out our duty, which is to provide the best care possible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Residents at Children's Hospital Oakland work 80 hours a week and are paid $52,000 a year.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Resident Physicians at Children's Oakland Rally Over Contract Stalemate\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/06\\/10\\/resident-physicians-at-childrens-oakland-rally-over-contract-stalemate\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-10 00:13:38\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-10 15:56:58\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19459,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Health Care Workers\",\"Physician Workforce\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/06\\/RS10682_IMG_6674-hpf.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Residents at Children's Hospital Oakland work 80 hours a week and are paid $52,000 a year.", "title": "Resident Physicians at Children\u2019s Oakland Rally Over Contract Stalemate", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/06/10/resident-physicians-at-childrens-oakland-rally-over-contract-stalemate/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/06/RS10682_IMG_6674-hpf.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "health care workers,physician workforce", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6a0e\"", "article_summary": "Resident physicians at UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland say their salaries aren\u2019t keeping up with the cost of living in the Bay Area.\nThe residents say they want a small $2,000 bonus over their three-year residency to help offset housing costs.\nThe residents say the hospital should tap into the $50 million philanthropic gift it recently received from Marc and Lynne Benioff, following the Oakland hospital\u2019s affiliation with the UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital earlier this year.\n\u201cThis contract bargaining has now become an issue of respect,\u201d Arnold said at a demonstration outside the hospital last Friday.\nTheirs is one of the latest health care union battles to heat up in California between workers and hospital administration, and is drawing a new generation of members to union organizing."}
