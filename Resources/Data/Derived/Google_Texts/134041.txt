THE NATION – Michelle Obama has had enough. According to a bombshell new report, the First Lady and Barack Obama are sleeping in separate White House bedrooms. Michelle is also preparing to boot her hubby of 21 years out of their ritzy Chicago home – and seriously discussing divorce.

“The smart money says the marriage is doomed,” a source told the National Enquirer. “Barack and Michelle have had a rocky go for years and mainly stayed together for their daughters and his political career. “But now Michelle is mad AS hell. She feels violated in front of the whole world, and screamed at him, ‘I’ve had enough.’ “She’s met with divorce lawyers and told Barack that she wants a life apart from him. “Michelle will stay in the White House for the rest of Barack’s term for appearances’ sake, but she made it clear they’ll be leading separate lives.

“She’s moving into one of the vacant bedrooms in the family’s private living quarters, and she’s preparing to move his clothes and personal things out of their million-dollar house in Chicago.” Michelle was left furious after Barack was photographed brazenly flirting with Denmark’s dishy female prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, during the service for former South African president Nelson Mandela. Obama, 52, laughed and whispered with the 46-year-old Danish beauty throughout the solemn ceremony, at one point cavalierly caressing her shoulder. “Barack already had enough headaches with his public approval rating plummeting after the disastrous rollout of his ‘Obamacare’ health plan. Now he’s walked smack into the worst marital crisis of his life,” said the White House insider.
