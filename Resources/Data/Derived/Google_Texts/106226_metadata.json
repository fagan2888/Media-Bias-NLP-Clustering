As it stands, many states limit or prohibit the ability of cities to offer services that compete with telcoms monopolies/duopolies. In many cases, towns where there is no broadband service are prohibited from rolling out their own.\n\nThe FCC has promised to intervene in these rules, giving cities the power to set up broadband networks. Blackburn believes that this should not be allowed.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation's Dear FCC site has an action center item that lets you call your congresscritter correct.
