A child and an adult were transported to the hospital this morning after the car they were in was hit by another car at West Prince Road and North Stone Avenue, according to authorities.

The collision happened a little before 8 a.m., according to Barrett Baker, a spokesman for the Tucson Fire Department.

Rescuers had to use the so-called "jaws of life" to extricate the two patients, he said.

Two other people were assessed at the scene but didn't need further attention, Baker said.

Sgt. Pete Dugan, a spokesman for the Tucson Police Department, said the adult patient initially had life-threatening injuries but has since stabilized.

He said alcohol was possibly a factor in the crash.

The investigation is ongoing.
