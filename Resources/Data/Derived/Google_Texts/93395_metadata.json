The kitchen sustained extensive damage and is currently not in use. Patients are receiving meals from a temporary kitchen but have limited menu options.\n\nThankfully no one was injured in the incident. As a precautionary measure, two patients were transported Saturday to different hospitals to undergo surgery.\n\nThey aren't sure when the kitchen will reopen. The cost of the damage is not yet known.\n\nWilkerson says the Hospital is working with their insurance company and the natural disaster relief agency on repairing the damage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kearney's Good Samaritan Hospital in Nebraska is operational after a wave of flash flood waters burst through windows of the cafeteria.", "language": "english", "author": "WITN", "og": {"url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/CAUGHT-ON-CAMERA-Flash-Flood-Waters-Rip-Through-Hospital-271091031.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/504*315/NC_hospitalflood0813_mezzn.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Kearney's Good Samaritan Hospital in Nebraska is operational after a wave of flash flood waters burst through windows of the cafeteria.", "title": "CAUGHT ON CAMERA: Flash Flood Waters Rip Through Hospital"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kearney's Good Samaritan Hospital in Nebraska is operational after a wave of flash flood waters burst through windows of the cafeteria.", "creator": "@WITN", "url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/CAUGHT-ON-CAMERA-Flash-Flood-Waters-Rip-Through-Hospital-271091031.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/504*315/NC_hospitalflood0813_mezzn.jpg", "title": "CAUGHT ON CAMERA: Flash Flood Waters Rip Through Hospital", "site": "@WITN", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "fb": {"app_id": 100653909772, "pages": 45809529741}, "keywords": "CAUGHT ON CAMERA: Flash Flood Waters Rip Through Hospital", "google-site-verification": "SAIlGc4W5cz6VdYh4YTfTRgDO0fVlzEwt0FUQF1Qp3g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "CAUGHT ON CAMERA Flash Flood"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6f3\"", "article_summary": "Hospital staff looked on in disbelief as flash flood waters ripped through the cafeteria at the hospital Friday night.\nKearney's Good Samaritan Hospital in Nebraska is operational after a wave of flash flood waters burst through windows of the cafeteria.\nWilkerson says the Hospital is working with their insurance company and the natural disaster relief agency on repairing the damage.\nMoments before midnight, nine feet of standing water outside the hospital came bursting through the large glass windows.\nThe kitchen area is damaged and not in use.The incident caused quite a scare for the staff and patients."}
