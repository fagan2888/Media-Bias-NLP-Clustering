Let\u2019s hope it won\u2019t be one of the big stories of 2014.\n\nClaims for unemployment insurance spiked in December in several of Georgia\u2019s metro areas, including Savannah.\n\nThere were 1,820 initial unemployment claims in Chatham, Effingham and Bryan counties in December. That\u2019s up pretty dramatically from the 1,436 claims in December 2012.\n\nMore than 3,000 area residents filed unemployment claims in December 2008, one of the worst months of the recession, but there were fewer than 1,000 claims in December 2007.\n\nA variety of factors could have contributed to the recent spike in layoffs, including slower than expected holiday sales, inclement weather, the timing of the holidays, the ongoing impacts of federal budget sequestration and fears about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut, really, it\u2019s hard to say.\n\nAccording to the ongoing survey of establishments, the Savannah metro area had 158,800 nonfarm payroll jobs in December, up a measly 300 from a year earlier. We probably need to be adding more than 1,500 jobs per year just to keep pace with population growth.\n\nSavannah is not the only area seeing weak job growth. The job market is apparently booming in Atlanta and doing fine in a few other Georgia cities, but several metro areas in the state are seeing stagnant or falling employment, including Augusta, Brunswick, Dalton, Hinesville, Valdosta and Warner Robins.\n\nThe data from the Atlanta metro area are so good right now that the entire state ends up looking good if you don\u2019t break the numbers down by metro area.\n\nAs we have seen in recent months, only a couple of employment sectors are showing relatively strong growth. In 2013, the Savannah metro area added 900 jobs in retail trade and 600 jobs in leisure and hospitality.\n\nBut, over the course of 2013, we lost 500 federal government jobs, 300 local government jobs, 400 jobs in the sector that includes construction and 200 jobs in manufacturing.\n\nEmployment is a lagging indicator of economic conditions. So good economic news might not translate into new hires for many months.\n\nBut by most measures, the Savannah metro area economy has been growing steadily for about four years now. We should definitely be seeing better news for the local labor market.\n\nCity Talk appears every Sunday and Tuesday. Bill Dawers can be reached via billdawers@comcast.net.
