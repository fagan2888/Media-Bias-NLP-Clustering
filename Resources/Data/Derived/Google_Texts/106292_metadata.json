We have to walk to BART too.\u201d\n\nThe shuttle zones, one on each side of Dolores Street, would remove a total of eleven parking spots from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. each weekday \u2013 four near the entrance of Dolores Park and seven near the intersection of 19th and Dolores streets. Parking will continue to be permitted in these zones when not in use as a shuttle stop.\n\nA public hearing regarding the proposed changes will take place on March 18 at 10 a.m. in room 416 at City Hall. If approved by the transit agency\u2019s board on April 19, the new zones could be implemented shortly afterward.\n\nThe city\u2019s shuttle bus program was implemented in August 2014 to regulate shuttles transporting workers to and from their jobs in Silicon Valley. But under new city policy, which will go into effect on April 1, vehicles of their size will be prohibited from picking up passengers on small neighborhood streets to avoid congestion.\n\n\u201c18th Street is not an arterial, so we are looking for alternate locations,\u201d said Paul Rose, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency\u2019s spokesperson. The agency has proposed creating new loading zones on both sides of the block of Dolores Street between 18th and 19th streets.\n\n\u201cDolores is the preferred north-south arterial in the area available for shuttles since Guerrero is weight-restricted south of 18th,\u201d said Rose. \u201cWe are trying to minimize shuttles on major bike corridors like Valencia and on Muni\u2019s most frequent corridors like Mission, where there are a number of Muni Forward improvements.\u201d\n\nDaniel Milligan lives opposite from one of the shuttle\u2019s current stops on 18th Street and said that although he supports the program, he does not see a benefit in compromising parking spaces by moving the loading zone onto Dolores street.\n\n\u201cDolores isn\u2019t that much bigger than 18th, I don\u2019t know why that justifies creating a new zone and taking away another seven parking spots for that,\u201d said Milligan. Although he has noticed increased congestion on 18th Street as a result of the shuttles, Milligan said he prefers the status quo.\n\n\u201cA minor inconvenience of a bit of a back up if a [Muni] bus has to wait at peak time is preferable. It seems drastic to take away seven parking spaces in this area,\u201d he added.\n\nCindy Irons is an 11-year resident of the block of Dolores where the new shuttle zone is proposed, and agrees that having them stop at public bus stops along 18th Street is a better solution.\n\n\u201cThere is a school right there \u2013 you\u2019ve got little kids that are being dropped off. It\u2019s probably not the best area to put a stop,\u201d said Irons, referring to the Children\u2019s Day School at 333 Dolores St., directly across the street from the proposed shuttle loading zone.\n\nFormer shuttle bus passenger Jack Hebrew defended the transit agency\u2019s proposal and likened the temporary restriction of parking spaces for shuttle buses to the permanent removal of spaces along Fell and Oak streets to make room for bike lanes.\n\n\u201cResidents in that neighborhood didn\u2019t like that either, but I like the bike lanes and feel safer now that they are there,\u201d said Hebrew. \u201cIt\u2019s tradeoffs all the time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "public transportation, tech, tech buses, Transportation", "og": {"site_name": "MissionLocal", "description": "Nearby residents are upset over proposed\u00a0changes to move tech shuttle stops\u00a0from 18th Street to Dolores Street, a move that\u00a0will remove coveted parking spaces during certain times of the day.
