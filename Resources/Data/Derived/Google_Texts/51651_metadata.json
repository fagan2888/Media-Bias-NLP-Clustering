Some of the evidence in that case is being used in yet another case implicating Mr. Sarkozy, this one involving a $550 million state payout in 2008 to Bernard Tapie, a colorful businessman with a checkered past.\n\nMr. Sarkozy had been kept quietly informed about a court\u2019s plans for the evidence by Mr. Azibert, according to Le Monde and government documents. Mr. Azibert, who is nearing retirement, is said to have intimated that he might like some assistance in obtaining a post in the seaside principality of Monaco, and Mr. Sarkozy said he would help, in exchange for information.\n\nAn investigation into breach of judicial secrecy and influence-peddling has been opened, and the homes and offices of Mr. Azibert and Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s lawyer have been searched. Mr. Azibert was recently hospitalized, and there is speculation he might have attempted suicide.\n\nPhoto\n\nInauspicious as this may seem for Mr. Sarkozy and the right, it is the center-left government of Mr. Hollande that is now on the defensive. After first insisting that they had learned of the phone-tapping only through the news media, government ministers including the justice minister, Christiane Taubira, admitted they were informed as early as last month.\n\nThe French judiciary is not entirely independent of the executive branch, and it is not uncommon for the minister of justice to be apprised of judicial investigations, especially if celebrities or public officials are involved. But the government, and Ms. Taubira in particular, were not altogether forthcoming about their knowledge of the case. Their political opponents, who presumably should be on the defensive, have pounced.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, leader of the Union for a Popular Movement, Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s party, has called for Ms. Taubira\u2019s resignation.\n\nMs. Taubira has refused, and has insisted she did not lie. At a news conference last week, she said that she had indeed been told about the tapping last month, but that she had been given no information about what it revealed. But the internal papers she strangely chose to flash before reporters to prove her point were captured in news photographs, and closer observation of the documents suggests Ms. Taubira was far better informed than she claimed.\n\nMr. Cop\u00e9 and his party renewed their attacks. But those sallies have been widely viewed as a diversionary tactic, considering that Mr. Cop\u00e9 is embroiled in a scandal of his own. According to the newsmagazine Le Point, Mr. Cop\u00e9 gave a sweetheart contract to a company run by two friends to organize rallies during Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s unsuccessful 2012 campaign. The party spent $11 million with the firm, more than one-quarter of its entire declared campaign spending, paying double the going rate for several of the services provided, Le Point reported last month.\n\nBecause French political parties depend heavily on public funding, much of that money would have come from taxpayers.\n\nMr. Cop\u00e9 declared himself a victim of hateful press and suggested the report was concocted to hurt his party before municipal elections later this month. He did not, however, deny it. A judicial investigation into the party\u2019s campaign spending was opened this month.\n\nIn still another embarrassment for Mr. Sarkozy and the right, secret recordings made by a close aide to Mr. Sarkozy during his presidency appeared recently on a news website, Atlantico, and in transcribed form in an investigative newspaper, Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9.\n\nThe recordings do not seem to reveal anything illegal, but Mr. Sarkozy and his wife, the singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, can be heard discussing money \u2014 she paid the bills during his presidency, it seems \u2014 and Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s advisers can be heard crudely insulting government ministers, as well as Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy.\n\nIt is unclear how the recordings were leaked. The aide who recorded the conversations, Patrick Buisson, a shadowy political operative with deep ties to the far right, initially said he had made the recordings for his own records. His lawyer later claimed the recorder had mysteriously switched on, repeatedly, unbeknown to Mr. Buisson.\n\nClaiming a breach of his privacy rights, Mr. Sarkozy on Friday obtained an injunction requiring that the recordings be removed from the website and that Mr. Buisson pay him $14,000 in damages.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMany French doubt, already, political officials\u2019 sense of the public interest,\u201d Le Monde wrote in a front-page editorial last week castigating the country\u2019s political class. \u201cThese new developments can only reinforce their mistrust and disgust. In one manner or another, majority and opposition will pay the price.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140315122648, "twitter": {"description": "Accusations of Libyan campaign donations and secret recordings keep the former French president in the headlines.", "title": "Out of Office, Sarkozy Is Still Front and Center", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/world/europe/out-of-office-sarkozy-is-still-front-and-center.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002770391"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/16/world/FRANCE/FRANCE-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/world/europe/out-of-office-sarkozy-is-still-front-and-center.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002770391", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/world/europe/out-of-office-sarkozy-is-still-front-and-center.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "world/europe", "hdl_p": "Out of Office, Sarkozy Is Still Front and Center", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/europe/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 15, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Sarkozy  Nicolas,Ethics and Official Misconduct,Qaddafi  Muammar el-,Hollande  Francois,Wiretapping and Other Eavesdropping Devices and Methods,France,Campaign Finance", "news_keywords": "France", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Scott Sayare", "SCG": "europe", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Hollande, Francois", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By SCOTT SAYARE", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Accusations of Libyan campaign donations and secret recordings keep the former French president in the headlines.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/16/world/FRANCE/FRANCE-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Accusations of Libyan campaign donations and secret recordings keep the former French president in the headlines.", "CG": "world", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "Europe", "modified": "2014-03-17", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/europe/index.jsonp", "tag": "Campaign Finance", "published": "2014-03-15", "section-taxonomy-id": "9A43D8FC-F4CF-44D9-9B34-138D30468F8F"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "France", "slug": "16france", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140317153141, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/world/europe/out-of-office-sarkozy-is-still-front-and-center.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/16/world/FRANCE/FRANCE-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Accusations of Libyan campaign donations and secret recordings keep the former French president in the headlines.", "title": "Out of Office, Sarkozy Is Still Front and Center"}, "pdate": 20140315, "des": "Campaign Finance", "articleid": 100000002770391, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Out of Office, Sarkozy Is Still Front and Center", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/16/world/FRANCE/FRANCE-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc14c\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Sarkozy had been kept quietly informed about a court\u2019s plans for the evidence by Mr. Azibert, according to Le Monde and government documents.\nPhotoInauspicious as this may seem for Mr. Sarkozy and the right, it is the center-left government of Mr. Hollande that is now on the defensive.\nAn investigation into breach of judicial secrecy and influence-peddling has been opened, and the homes and offices of Mr. Azibert and Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s lawyer have been searched.\nMr. Azibert, who is nearing retirement, is said to have intimated that he might like some assistance in obtaining a post in the seaside principality of Monaco, and Mr. Sarkozy said he would help, in exchange for information.\nIn their recorded conversations, Le Monde reported, Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Herzog discussed an investigation into whether Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 campaign received illegal funding from Liliane Bettencourt, the 91-year-old L\u2019Or\u00e9al heiress who is France\u2019s richest woman."}
