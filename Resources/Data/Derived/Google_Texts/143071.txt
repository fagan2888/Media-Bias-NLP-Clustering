Access Health CT Picks Interim Chief From Within

Access Health CT, the state health insurance exchange implementing the Affordable Care Act, is losing its CEO, Kevin Counihan, next week. Counihan is going to Washington, D.C., to lead HealthCare.gov, the exchange website under the federal government.

HARTFORD â€” James Wadleigh, chief information officer for Access Health CT, was the unanimous choice Wednesday to lead the organization at least through November.

The board of directors for Access Health CT chose Wadleigh, 47, to be interim chief over two other internal candidates.

"Jim has the ability and the knowledge of the technology," said Lt Gov. Nancy Wyman, who is also chair of the exchange's board of directors. "This is recommended by the human resource committee as they did an intense interview with the three of them. The board thought it was a great idea to accept their recommendation. All three men are talented. And we will be in touch with all three men and making sure they work as a team."

Before joining Access Health CT, Wadleigh worked for years at Cigna Corp. as senior director of application development, call center technologies, among other jobs.

He earned a bachelor of science degree in business administration from the University of Vermont and a master of science degree in management from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Wadleigh will run the organization while the exchange's executive committee conducts a national search to find a new CEO. Wadleigh will be in charge at least through November and the beginning of open enrollment for 2015, Wyman said.

Open enrollment begins Nov. 15, a month and a half later than last year.

The state enrolled nearly 257,000 people in 2014, doubling its goal of 100,000 people signing up for coverage in the first year.

Wadleigh and the other two candidates for the interim position, Chief Operations Officer Peter Van Loon and Chief Financial Officer Steven Sigal, have been asked to apply for the permanent job.
