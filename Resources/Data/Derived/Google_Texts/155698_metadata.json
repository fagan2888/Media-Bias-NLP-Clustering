A score of \u201c10L\u201d is regarded as \u201cmost liberal,\u201d 0 is a \u201ccentrist,\u201d and \u201c10C\u201d is \u201cmost conservative.\u201d Crowdpac also provides the methodology for each score, such as the types and number of votes and donors.\n\nOn the Republican side, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is the most conservative candidate, earning a score of 10.16C.\n\nPaul spokesman Brian Darling told CNN that the Kentucky senator \u201chas a very conservative outlook,\u201d and that he was \u201chappy to see his boss named most conservative.\u201d\n\nThe most moderate Republican is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 2.5C, followed by former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 3.0C and 4.2C, respectively.\n\nPaul is followed by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, at 9.7C, and Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., at 7.8C.\n\nThe most liberal candidate is Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., at 8.3L.\n\nSanders told CNN that he prefers the term \u201cprogressive\u201d over \u201cliberal,\u201d but said he was considering a bid for the White House despite being \u201cto the left of most of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that there have not been enough voices out there, and I think there\u2019s a reservoir out there of people who are angry at the establishment,\u201d said Sanders.\n\nAfter Sanders is Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., at 8.2L and Hillary Clinton at 6.4L.\n\nThe most moderate Democrat is Vice President Joe Biden at 4.4L.\n\nCNN called the analysis \u201cconvention-busting.\u201d\n\nFor example, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., often regarded as a conservative, earned a less conservative score than former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who is often regarded as a moderate.\n\nCrowdpac users can vote on which candidates they\u2019d like to see run for president, monitor their favorite candidate\u2019s poll average, and see how others have ranked their \u201cpresidential qualities.\u201d They analyzed 24 likely Republican and Democrat contenders for the White House.\n\nCrowdpac has also received permission from the Federal Election Commission to process campaign donations. Users can donate to their favorite candidate\u2014before they\u2019ve even declared their candidacy. Should the candidate run for president, Crowdpac will send them the donation. If they choose not to, it will be returned to the donor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new political startup has studied the potential 2016 presidential field\u2014and their pocketbooks.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new political startup has studied the potential 2016 presidential field\u2014and their pocketbooks.", "title": "Political Startup Ranks the Most Conservative, Liberal 2016 Candidates", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150114_2016Ranking_Scanlon.png", "updated_time": "2015-01-15T14:01:03+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/14CdfNf"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new political startup has studied the potential 2016 presidential field\u2014and their pocketbooks.", "title": "Political Startup Ranks the Most Conservative, Liberal 2016 Candidates", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150114_2016Ranking_Scanlon.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-01-15T03:01:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-15T14:01:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2016, 2016 Candidates, Republicans, Democrats, President, White House, presidential race"}, "article_summary": "On the Republican side, Sen.
