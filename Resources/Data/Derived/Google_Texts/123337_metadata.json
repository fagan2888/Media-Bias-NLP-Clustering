Alan Simpson to center stage in Washington\u2019s budget battles, appointing the Wyoming Republican to co-chair (with Morgan Stanley board member and former Clinton chief of staff Erskine Bowles) his National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. Simpson and Bowles\u2019 budget proposal received the support of a majority of the commission, and a passel of pundit plaudits, but failed to secure the supermajority of the commission required to formally advance to Congress.\n\n\u201cIt was damn good,\u201d Simpson told Salon, this week, \u201cbecause it effectively pissed off everyone in America \u2026\u201d\n\nWhile the Bowles-Simpson plan was embraced by some congressional liberals including Nancy Pelosi (and Obama issued subsequent deficit proposals Ezra Klein called \u201cin almost every category, to the right of Simpson-Bowles\u201d), it was panned by a battery of progressive pundits and economists. Paul Krugman called the plan \u201ctax cuts for the wealthy, tax increases for the middle class,\u201d and charged that it was \u201cbasically saying that janitors should be forced to work longer because these days corporate lawyers live to a ripe old age.\u201d Dean Baker slammed the pair for \u201cignorance of basic economics\u201d and \u201cxenophobic fear-mongering\u201d about China, writing that \u201cthe current deficit is a support for the economy, rather than a drain on the economy,\u201d and \u201cthe transfer of wealth to China depends entirely on our trade deficit, which is determined by the value of the dollar, not the budget deficit.\u201d\n\nIn an interview this week, Salon asked Simpson \u2013 now co-chair of the Pete Peterson-backed Fix the Debt \u2014 about his past predictions of a supposedly imminent debt crisis, whether it\u2019s fair for the retirement age to go up faster than many Americans\u2019 life expectancy, and why his deficit commission plan would have capped federal revenue. The ex-senator told Salon that the current healthcare system \u201ccan\u2019t possibly work,\u201d citing, among other culprits, \u201cpeople with diabetes Type 2 \u2014 that\u2019s mostly self-induced.\u201d (According to the National Institutes of Health, \u201cFamily history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes,\u201d as well as weight, diet and activity level.) A condensed version of our conversation follows.\n\nI\u2019m 29 years old. Why should I and my friends be more concerned about the debt than about climate change, or about mass unemployment?\n\nWell, I\u2019m 82, and when I was your age I didn\u2019t think about anything. And as I watch \u2026 and then serve as co-chair of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and work on that for 10 months and hear the results: That we can\u2019t grow our way out of this mess with double-digit growth for 20 years, we can\u2019t cut spending way out of our \u2013 that won\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t tax your way out of this mess. So you ought to get serious.\n\nSo we did a 67-page report, which was serious. But it was \u2013 and it was damn good because it effectively pissed off everyone in America, which is the best way to do one of those \u2026\n\n2033, by doing nothing, you\u2019re going to walk up to the window and get a [Social Security] check for 23 percent less. So I would think you would begin to pay attention. But if you\u2019re going to say, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t really think there\u2019d be anything for me there in that time,\u201d then you really have rot for brains, because you\u2019ve put in 6.2 percent of your salary for 40 years.\n\nSo I would think you\u2019d start paying attention. But probably, you won\u2019t. Not you \u2013 just generically.\n\nShould we increase the cap on how much income is taxable for Social Security?\n\nSure, and that\u2019s in our report. I think you need to read our report. It\u2019s 67 pages. It\u2019s in English. It uses terms like \u201cgoing broke\u201d and \u201cshared sacrifice\u201d \u2026\n\nWe would give the lowest 20 percent of people in that [Social Security] system a payment of 125 percent of poverty. We would give the older old, from 80 to 85, an extra percent. We would raise the wages subject to the tax to 190 [thousand] plus, and you can keep right on going after that. We change to the chained CPI \u2026 And then we said that retirement age should be raised to 68 by the age 2050. And the senior groups said, [switches to a funny voice] \u201cOh no, how will anybody ever be able to prepare for that? What\u2019ll happen?\u201d I said: Well you know, if that\u2019s the way you\u2019re gonna act, well, you\u2019re the children.\n\nCongress voted in 1983 to raise the Social Security retirement age by two years over a 22-year period. In 2007, the Social Security Administration found that for the bottom half of the income distribution, life expectancy of male workers who retired at 65 had only gone up by 1.3 years over the prior three decades. Do you see any problem with raising the retirement age faster than life expectancy for big swaths of the population?\n\nWell, all I do is math. I really don\u2019t do mystery or hypotheses. All you have to know is that the average age today is 78, got it? And in two years will be 80. And here\u2019s a system that was set up in 1937\u2026 it was set up to replace a person\u2019s wage \u2026 the age of mortality was 63 and the retirement age was 65. Now the average age is 78 and you can retire at 62 \u2026\n\nWhen I was your age \u2014 a little earlier \u2014 there were 16 people, 15, paying into the system, and the next month, one taking out-\u2026 Today there are three people paying in and one taking out. How long do you think that\u2019ll last?\n\nYou and Erskine Bowles have warned, including in a 2012 USA Today Op-Ed, that \u201cwe face the most predictable economic crisis in history.\u201d In March 2011 you testified, \u201cI think it will come before two years,\u201d and that \u201cwithin a year,\u201d if debt holders \u201cjust thought you\u2019re playing with fluff,\u201d they\u2019re \u201cgoing to say, \u2018I want some money for my paper \u2026\u2019 It won\u2019t matter what the government does, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I want my money, I\u2019ve got a better place for it.\u2019\u201d Were those predictions wrong?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alan Simpson also tells Salon Type 2 diabetes is \"mostly self-induced\" -- and insists debt disaster is still ahead", "title": "Exclusive: Bowles-Simpson icon begrudgingly admits his predictions were wrong", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Alan Simpson also tells Salon Type 2 diabetes is \"mostly self-induced\" -- and insists debt disaster is still ahead", "title": "Exclusive: Bowles-Simpson icon begrudgingly admits his predictions were wrong", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/21/exclusive_bowles_simpson_icon_begrudgingly_admits_his_predictions_were_wrong/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/alan_simpson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Alan Simpson also tells Salon Type 2 diabetes is \"mostly self-induced\" -- and insists debt disaster is still ahead", "title": "Exclusive: Bowles-Simpson icon begrudgingly admits his predictions were wrong", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/alan_simpson.jpg", "creator": "@josheidelson", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Josh Eidelson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alan Simpson, Barack Obama, Bowles-Simpson, Budget, Dean Baker, Debt, Diabetes, Erskine Bowles, exclusive, interview, Medicaid, Medicare, Paul Krugman, Social Security", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb09\"", "article_summary": "Congress voted in 1983 to raise the Social Security retirement age by two years over a 22-year period.\nWhat\u2019ll happen?\u201d I said: Well you know, if that\u2019s the way you\u2019re gonna act, well, you\u2019re the children.\nDo you see any problem with raising the retirement age faster than life expectancy for big swaths of the population?\nWe change to the chained CPI \u2026 And then we said that retirement age should be raised to 68 by the age 2050.\nShould we increase the cap on how much income is taxable for Social Security?"}
