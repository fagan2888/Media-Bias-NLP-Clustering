Kevin Brady, the Republican deputy whip, said he would fight Obama\u2019s proposed action\u2014which the president is reportedly considering delaying until after the midterms to avoid political blowback.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fight it on constitutional grounds, we\u2019ll fight it through the law that\u2019s sitting in the Senate and we\u2019ll fight it in the courts if need be,\u201d said Brady, alluding to the Senate\u2019s failure to pass its $2.7 billion border bill before August recess.\n\nI think it [Obama executive action] will add more fuel to the fire that the Senate has got to change hands. There has to be checks and balances against a president who is overreaching in an unprecedented fashion. People really believe in the checks and balances of the Constitution. And this will convince them even more that the country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nObama declared in late June that he would act unilaterally to reform the nation\u2019s immigration system after Speaker John Boehner said the House wouldn\u2019t act on comprehensive immigration reform this year.\n\nThe president originally hinted he would reveal his plan by the end of the summer.\n\nBut mindful of the potential electoral peril for Democratic Senate candidates, Obama \u201chasn\u2019t made a decision on the timing,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday.\n\nWhat\u2019s Under Consideration\n\nThe possibilities for Obama\u2019s plan reportedly include not only deferring deportation for millions of illegal immigrants but also providing new green cards for high-tech workers and for the relatives of U.S. citizens and permanent residents.\n\nMore than a year ago, the Senate passed its own comprehensive bill to clear the way for millions of illegal immigrants to gain a pathway to citizenship.\n\n\u201cThe status quo on the border just isn\u2019t acceptable,\u201d says @RepKevinBrady\n\nBut since a humanitarian crisis involving millions of illegal immigrants, including unaccompanied children, erupted this summer, Republicans have said they will not pursue comprehensive reform until the Obama administration shows it can secure the border.\n\nA month ago, House Republicans passed a $694 million border funding bill, that, among other things, tweaks a 2008 human-trafficking law to allow for quick return of the unaccompanied minors to their home countries.\n\nIn a separate bill\u2014which Brady cosponsored\u2014the House voted to stop Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which the president implemented in 2012.\n\nFocus on Border Security\n\nBrady, who has served his Southeast Texas district in Congress since 1997, says the House border funding bill represents the only solution worth considering right now.\n\n\u201cThe solution \u2026 not to manage the problem, but to stop it, was passed by the House before we left [for recess], and it\u2019s sitting in the Senate,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart solution: securing the border, deterring families from sending kids on a dangerous journey and reuniting them back in Central America.\u201d\n\nBrady, who also serves as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, wants any decision on legalization to be made after improvements in border security.\n\n\u201cI think there is a need to address this [immigration reform] sooner rather than later,\u201d Brady said.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution\n\n\u201cThe status quo on the border just isn\u2019t acceptable. It\u2019s going to take a step-by-step solution, starting with securing the border. [Only when] we can do that with confidence, steps two and three\u2014which are addressing the workforce needs of the country and resolving what we do with those living here illegally today\u2014can follow.\u201d\n\nWould an executive order on immigration alter November\u2019s midterm elections?\n\nUnlike some of his conservative colleagues, Brady downplayed talk that Republicans would call for Obama\u2019s impeachment or another government shutdown if the president uses executive action.\n\nBrady said a unilateral move by Obama would show the president is focused on securing his legacy.\n\n\u201cWhat I see here, not knowing exactly what the president will do, is that his proposed action contradicts his own insistence for several years that only Congress has the power to change immigration law,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThat leads me to believe this is a very cynical political move.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Texas lawmaker says if President Obama were to try to revamp immigration law on his own, it would change the course of November\u2019s midterm elections.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Texas lawmaker says if President Obama were to try to revamp immigration law on his own, it would change the course of November\u2019s midterm elections.", "title": "House Leader: Immigration Executive Action Would Help GOP", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140902_BradyImmigration_Siegel.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-26T10:12:32+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1w4kjv0"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Texas lawmaker says if President Obama were to try to revamp immigration law on his own, it would change the course of November\u2019s midterm elections.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140902_BradyImmigration_Siegel.jpg"}, "title": "House Leader: Immigration Executive Action Would Help GOP", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "executive overreach,immigration", "published_time": "2014-09-03T03:01:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-26T10:12:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "immigration, border crisis, Rio Grande Valley, Kevin Brady, DACA, mid-terms, John Boehner, President Obama, executive action, impeachment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde851\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think there is a need to address this [immigration reform] sooner rather than later,\u201d Brady said.\nI think it [Obama executive action] will add more fuel to the fire that the Senate has got to change hands.\nObama declared in late June that he would act unilaterally to reform the nation\u2019s immigration system after Speaker John Boehner said the House wouldn\u2019t act on comprehensive immigration reform this year.\nUnlike some of his conservative colleagues, Brady downplayed talk that Republicans would call for Obama\u2019s impeachment or another government shutdown if the president uses executive action.\nIn a separate bill\u2014which Brady cosponsored\u2014the House voted to stop Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which the president implemented in 2012."}
