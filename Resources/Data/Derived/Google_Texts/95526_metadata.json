Rand Paul (R-KY) wrapped his opening week as a 2016 GOP presidential candidate here with remarks to an overflow crowd.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nComing on stage to \u201cTeenage Wasteland\u201d and chants of \u201cPresident Paul!\u201d from the more-than-a-thousand-person crowd crammed into the Desert Vista Community Center, Paul opened his remarks by noting that a \u201cwhile back I decided to count up a few things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found out that the Lord\u2019s Prayer is 66 words long,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe Gettysburg address is 286 words long. The Declaration of Independence is 1,322 words long. But the government regulation for the sale of cabbage is 26,911 words long.\u201d\n\nMuch of the speech focused on an oversized federal government encroaching into Americans\u2019\u2014and Nevadans\u2019\u2014personal lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not getting any better,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the past six years, the president\u2019s EPA has added 25 million words of regulations. We have got a government that is literally run amok.God only knows how many words have been written to distinguish the greater prairie chicken from the lesser prairie chicken. Anybody here think Nevada needs more federal regulations of your land?\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d the crowd shouted in unison.\n\nPaul hammered Obamacare, and hit Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts\u2014a George W. Bush appointee\u2014for upholding it.\n\n\u201cObamacare was 2000 [pages] long,\u201d Paul said.\n\nYou remember, Nancy Pelosi said you could read it after we passed it. Unelected bureaucrats have now added 20,000 pages of Obamacare regulations. I have a novel idea. Why don\u2019t we repeal two regulations for every new one? Our freedom is at risk from a Supreme Court that fails to protect our liberty. In the mistake of the century, Justice Roberts affirmed the power of the state to force an individual to buy a certain type of insurance. Justice Roberts argued that we must presume Obamacare constitutional. I\u2019ve got a better idea. Why don\u2019t we presume Liberty? Just as we are presumed innocent, so too we should be presumed free.\n\nPaul also hammered the Washington political class\u2014both parties\u2014for hurting Americans with big government policies.\n\n\u201cMany Americans are left behind,\u201d Paul said.\n\nThe reward of work seems beyond their grasp. Under the watch of both parties \u2013 the poor seem to get poorer and the rich seem to get richer. Trillion dollar government stimulus packages are handed out and yet the income gap continues to widen. Politically connected cronies get taxpayer dollars by the hundreds of millions of dollar. Poor families across America, though, continue to suffer.\n\nPaul laid out plan for \u201cEconomic Freedom Zones\u201d to allow impoverished areas big tax breaks so they can keep their own money rather sending it to the federal government.\n\n\u201cSome say, but oh, Democrats care more about poor people,\u201d Paul said.\n\nIf that\u2019s true, why is black unemployment still twice white unemployment? Why has minority household income declined by $3,500 over the past six years? Liberal policies have failed our inner cities. Liberal policies have failed to alleviate poverty. Our schools are not equal and the poverty gap continues to widen. You want to know where the income gap is greatest? Cities run by Democrats, states run by Democrats, and countries run by Democrats.\n\nThe crowd went wild.\n\nPaul then talked about his criminal justice reform agenda, explaining it is \u201cnot a white problem, not a black problem, it\u2019s a poverty problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody needs to lead the country,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI am unafraid to challenge the status quo. Everyone in the country should be treated the same under the law no matter what religion it is, no matter the color of the skin, no matter how rich or how poor\u2014everybody should be treated equally.\u201d\n\nPaul also pushed for school choice, when he hit President Obama for sending his daughters to a fancy private school. Sasha and Malia Obama attend Sidwell Friends in the D.C. area, while ordinary Americans don\u2019t have such opportunities.\n\n\u201cIs it just me or does anyone else think it\u2019s ironic that the president\u2019s kids get to go to a great school but if you\u2019re not rich your kids are stuck in a failing public school?\u201d Paul said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul Does Las Vegas: \u2018Unafraid To Challenge The Status Quo\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rand Paul Does Las Vegas: \u2018Unafraid To Challenge The Status Quo\u2019", "title": "Rand Paul Does Las Vegas: \u2018Unafraid To Challenge The Status Quo\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Rand-Paul-American-flag-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/11/rand-paul-does-las-vegas-unafraid-to-challenge-the-status-quo/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rand Paul Does Las Vegas: \u2018Unafraid To Challenge The Status Quo\u2019", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Rand-Paul-American-flag-AP.jpg", "title": "Rand Paul Does Las Vegas: \u2018Unafraid To Challenge The Status Quo\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, Nevada, Rand Paul,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Rand Paul", "published_time": "2015-04-11T13:37:10-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cObamacare was 2000 [pages] long,\u201d Paul said.\nThe Declaration of Independence is 1,322 words long.\n\u201cThe Gettysburg address is 286 words long.\nIn the past six years, the president\u2019s EPA has added 25 million words of regulations.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLAS VEGAS, Nevada \u2014 Sen.
