He is watching high-deductible health plans more warily, however, as uncollected bills now equal 4 percent of revenue.\n\nQuest Diagnostics, headquartered in New Jersey, mostly does blood, urine and drug-abuse testing. It employs 1,200 people in North Texas, most of them at the company\u2019s Irving labs.\n\nDiagnostic testing accounts for just 2 percent of the nation\u2019s $3 trillion health care bill. But those lab results provide the information for nearly three-fourths of the patient care decisions made by physicians, Rusckowski said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act lets consumers get physicals, mammograms, colonoscopies and diet counseling without co-pays, even if they haven\u2019t met the annual deductible. The same applies for screenings to detect diabetes, depression and the AIDS virus.\n\nUp in the air\n\nQuest Diagnostics expects all this testing will boost business. But it hasn\u2019t happened yet. The company says too much of the law is still up in the air, including how many states will expand Medicaid (Texas has not), and when the law\u2019s mandates for insurance coverage will begin to bite.\n\nMeanwhile, employers are moving workers to high-deductible health plans. They are also common in the government-run insurance exchanges for individual health insurance.\n\nWhere they\u2019re in use, the average deductible for a single Texan now exceeds $1,500. Families are paying $2,500 or more.\n\n\u201cThe biggest issue we have in this country right now is that more and more of the costs of care are being pushed to the patient,\u201d Rusckowski said. \u201cWe all have bigger deductibles and co-pays. As a result, our company is spending more time getting those pieces of the overall charge.\u201d\n\nThe 4 percent Quest preliminarily is recording as bad debt comes to $284 million. That\u2019s not chump change for a company with net income of $598 million in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of that is the patient\u2019s responsibility,\u201d Rusckowski said.\n\nIn the meeting with Irving employees, Rusckowski talked up a reinvigorated company that\u2019s looking to be \u201cnot just the largest lab, but a company that aims for better health through diagnostic testing.\u201d\n\nGenetic profiling, for example, is essential to precision medicine. This is getting a lot of attention in part because of new targeted therapies that disrupt the growth and immunity of cancer cells. The treatments can be extraordinarily expensive.\n\n\u201cBased on the genetic profile of the individual, we can tell whether or not a drug will work, and if none of the drugs will work, what [experimental drug] trials a patient can enroll in,\u201d Rusckowski said. \u201cWith the cost of delivering these new therapies for cancer in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, getting that decision right is very important.\u201d\n\nPainless blood draw\n\nTheranos, a lab testing firm in Silicon Valley, is shaking up the industry by promising painless blood draws, lower costs and widespread access through retail partners like Walgreens. Rusckowski said he likes that Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes is bringing lots of media attention to the industry, and he said he\u2019s ready to compete.\n\n\u201cWe actually do have finger-stick capability as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe no longer need to take as much blood from the patient.\u201d\n\nRusckowski said he\u2019s ready to compete on cost and accessibility as well.\n\nFollow Jim Landers on Twitter at @landersjim.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Quest Diagnostics is waiting for a new wave of diagnostic testing, but meanwhile bad debt from high deductibles is growing.", "og": {"description": "Quest Diagnostics is waiting for a new wave of diagnostic testing, but meanwhile bad debt from high deductibles is growing.", "title": "Landers: Lab company waiting to benefit from more free tests", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20150309-landers-lab-company-waiting-to-benefit-from-more-free-tests.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-03-10T02:56:26Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-03-10T02:29:17Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Landers: Lab company waiting to benefit from more free tests\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20150309-landers-lab-company-waiting-to-benefit-from-more-free-tests.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2211039\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-03-10T02:29:17Z\", \"section\": \"Jim Landers\", \"author\": \"Jim Landers\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-03-10T02:29:17Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf08\"", "article_summary": "But those lab results provide the information for nearly three-fourths of the patient care decisions made by physicians, Rusckowski said.\nDiagnostic testing accounts for just 2 percent of the nation\u2019s $3 trillion health care bill.\nHe\u2019s pleased that the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to allow more diagnostic tests at no charge to consumers.\n\u201cThe biggest issue we have in this country right now is that more and more of the costs of care are being pushed to the patient,\u201d Rusckowski said.\nHe is watching high-deductible health plans more warily, however, as uncollected bills now equal 4 percent of revenue."}
