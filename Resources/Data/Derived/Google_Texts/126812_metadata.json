An exact toll amount has not been set.\n\nDeVito said the loan guarantees the toll lane will be open and ready for motorists by fall 2015.\n\n\u201cWe were able to get a good partner for this, and we are happy with the results,\u201d DeVito said.\n\nTransportation officials began in August to seek commercial lenders to help finance the toll lane, which will be used only during peak travel times on eastbound I-70 between Idaho Springs and Empire.\n\nCDOT says the toll lane will help reduce travel time from the Eisenhower Tunnel to the top of Floyd Hill by as much as 48 percent.\n\nThe project\u2019s scope was expanded when CDOT decided to reconstruct a bridge on the interstate, which added to the cost, officials said.\n\nBut the jump in price was mostly the result of shortages in skilled labor, from plumbers and bricklayers to journeyman laborers.\n\n\u201cIt really is hitting everyone hard; it\u2019s pretty much industry-wide,\u201d DeVito said.\n\nSeveral industry groups and analysts say the problem stems from an economy emerging from the recession. An improved housing market produced a hiring spree for skilled labor and sucked up needed material like asphalt, lumber and steel.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at worker shortages statewide in construction projects,\u201d said Tony Milo, executive director of the Colorado Contractors Association. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation that\u2019s completely turned around. Demand is so much greater than it was just from two years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore, nothing was going on. Now we have a whole set of problems because of construction activity,\u201d Milo added. \u201cBut I guess it\u2019s a good problem to have.\u201d\n\nThose shortages are especially hurting public works projects \u2014 like roads and bridges \u2014 causing construction estimates to fall short of what\u2019s really needed to finish a job, Milo said.\n\nNationally, the construction cost escalation rate \u2014 the amount a project\u2019s cost increases between the estimate and final bid \u2014 was 1 percent between 2009 and 2012, according to the Engineering News Record.\n\nBut through 2014, the escalation rate has been at 3.2 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the pay for basic laborers is up 3.7 percent, and the cost of materials overall is up 1 percent, with lumber jumping to nearly 6 percent.\n\n\u201cI am not surprised CDOT has problems with their estimates,\u201d Milo said. \u201cThe market now is completely different from just a year ago. And often the market is well out of the control of the contractors.\u201d\n\nAll of this is prompting CDOT to review all road projects over $15 million that are being funded through the agency\u2019s $1.5 billion Responsible Acceleration of Maintenance and Partnerships program. The I-70 mountain toll lane is one of the bigger undertakings under RAMP.\n\nCDOT will do independent cost estimates of those projects to determine if they will face funding shortfalls as well, said CDOT spokeswoman Amy Ford.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how best to mitigate the costs of these projects and give us the biggest bang for our bucks and deliver the best benefits for these communities,\u201d Ford said.\n\nMonte Whaley: 720-929-0907, mwhaley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/montewhaley", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CDOT toll lane project costs go up, other projects may follow", "title": "CDOT toll lane project costs go up, other projects may follow", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/20/cdot-toll-lane-project-costs-go-up-other-projects-may-follow/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141128__denver-I-70-expansionp1.jpg", "height": 448}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141128__denver-I-70-expansionp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T19:34:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:39:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But steadily rising construction costs helped push the total price of finishing the toll lane project to $70 million.\nDeVito said the loan guarantees the toll lane will be open and ready for motorists by fall 2015.\nThe I-70 mountain toll lane is one of the bigger undertakings under RAMP.\nCDOT says the toll lane will help reduce travel time from the Eisenhower Tunnel to the top of Floyd Hill by as much as 48 percent.\nNationally, the construction cost escalation rate \u2014 the amount a project\u2019s cost increases between the estimate and final bid \u2014 was 1 percent between 2009 and 2012, according to the Engineering News Record."}
