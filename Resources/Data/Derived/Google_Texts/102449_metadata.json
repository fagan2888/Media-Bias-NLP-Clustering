(Photo: File photo)\n\nThe Melville Police Department will host its annual Easter Fair Thursday through Saturday with carnival rides for the entire family. The town also will honor the champion Lady Hurricanes basketball team with a parade Saturday morning.\n\nCyndi Rowe with the police department said the fair on the grounds of the Melville Civic Center, 1105 First St., will serve as a fundraiser for the struggling police department.\n\n\u201cWe need it. We are making it, but it\u2019s rough,\u201d Rowe said. The city began this year with a new administration and a mountain of debt.\n\nAs a result, the town on the Atchafalaya River in northern St. Landry Parish is only able to operate one police car. Money it raises during the event will purchase badly needed equipment and, officials hope, get more police vehicles on Melville streets.\n\nRowe said this is the eighth year for the festival.\n\nThe main attraction will be carnival rides by Jim\u2019s Rides. People may save a bit of money by purchasing their armbands in advance.\n\nRowe said the armbands are $12 in advance and $15 at the fair. They can be bought in advance at the police department, located in the City Hall complex at 516 Church St.\n\nEach armband allows unlimited rides, but each is good for only one day. People who want to ride all three days of the fair will need three armbands.\n\n\u201cWe will have rides for younger children as well as riders for older children and adults,\u201d Rowe said.\n\nThe fair will be open from 3 to 10 p.m. each day, through Saturday will start earlier because of the parade.\n\nThat parade honors North Central High School\u2019s women\u2019s basketball team that recently won the 2015 LHSAA Class 1A State Championship.\n\n\u201cWe are celebrating our own Jazlyn Robertson, who was named MVP,\u201d said Alderwoman Caretta Robertson, who has the honor of being Jazlyn\u2019s aunt.\n\n\u201cIt should be a nice parade,\u201d said Robertson, who said several Melville families plan to host homecomings that weekend.\n\nThe parade will form up on the fair grounds at 10 a.m. on Saturday and will march out at 11 a.m.\n\nIt will then parade through town and return to the fair grounds.\n\nRobertson said individuals, groups and organizations are encouraged to participate \u201cThere is no fee. We want everyone to join us in celebrating St. Landry Parish\u2019s state champs,\u201d Robertson said.\n\nFor more information on the fair, call the police department at 337-623-5777.\n\nFor more information on the parade, call 337-592-2716 or 337-356-8026.\n\nWant to go?\n\nWhat: Easter Carnival to benefit the Melville Police Department\n\nWhen: 3-10 p.m., Thursday-Saturday\n\nWhere: Melville Civic Center, 1105 First St., Melville\n\nInformation: Call 337-623-5777\n\nWhat: Championship Parade celebrating the state champion Lady Hurricanes basketball team\n\nWhen: 11 a.m., Saturday\n\nWhere: Civic Center, 1105 First St., Melville\n\nCost: free\n\nInformation: call 337-592-2716 or 337-356-8026\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/03/28/melville-ushers-spring-parade-easter-fair/70601144/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Saturday\u2019s parade will honor North Central High School\u2019s state champion Lady Hurricanes basketball team", "og": {"site_name": "DailyWorld.com", "description": "Saturday\u2019s parade will honor North Central High School\u2019s state champion Lady Hurricanes basketball team", "title": "Melville ushers in Spring with parade and Easter Fair", "url": "http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/03/28/melville-ushers-spring-parade-easter-fair/70601144/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/dailyworld.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Saturday\u2019s parade will honor North Central High School\u2019s state champion Lady Hurricanes basketball team", "creator": "@", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e0d6d2c917a9b9a535b918177a9bdc4eada1e79a/c=547-0-1453-906&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Opelousas/2015/03/28/B9316769827Z.1_20150328163205_000_G5SABJKTA.1-0.jpg", "title": "Melville ushers in Spring with parade and Easter Fair", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898315311", "fb": {"app_id": 164724483570611}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b0b\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: File photo)The Melville Police Department will host its annual Easter Fair Thursday through Saturday with carnival rides for the entire family.\n\u201cIt should be a nice parade,\u201d said Robertson, who said several Melville families plan to host homecomings that weekend.\nThe main attraction will be carnival rides by Jim\u2019s Rides.\nThe parade will form up on the fair grounds at 10 a.m. on Saturday and will march out at 11 a.m.\nThe fair will be open from 3 to 10 p.m. each day, through Saturday will start earlier because of the parade."}
