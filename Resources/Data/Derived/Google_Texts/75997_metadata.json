Lytell, lead author of the study and a senior behavioral scientist at Rand.\n\n\u201cOne aspect that hasn\u2019t been factored in much during past drawdowns is retaining a demographically diverse workforce,\" she said.\n\nThe cuts are expected to rely more on separations versus lowering recruitment as with previous drawdowns in the 1990s.\n\nThe services are limited in how they can use demographic information in the cuts.\n\nResearch for the study was sponsored by the Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Expected troop cuts could hurt women and racial minorities, a study by Rand Corporation said.", "description": "Expected troop cuts could hurt women and racial minorities, a study by Rand Corporation said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kristina Wong", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Expected troop cuts could hurt women and racial minorities, a study by Rand Corporation said.", "title": "Study: Troop cuts could hurt military diversity", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/258140-study-troop-cuts-could-hurt-military-diversity", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/transgendermilitary_051212getty_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/258140-study-troop-cuts-could-hurt-military-diversity", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-26T17:33-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Kristina Wong", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-26T17:33:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/258140-study-troop-cuts-could-hurt-military-diversity", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Expected troop cuts could hurt women and racial minorities, a study by Rand Corporation said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Study: Troop cuts could hurt military diversity"}, "dcterms.title": "Study: Troop cuts could hurt military diversity"}, "article_summary": "The report, titled \u201cForce Drawdowns and Demographic Diversity: Investigating the Impact of Force Reductions on the Demographic Diversity of the U.S. Military,\u201d looked at multiple drawdown scenarios to examine the potential effects on women and racial minorities.\nADVERTISEMENTThe cuts to \"nontactical operations\" jobs could have an adverse effect on female and black service members, and in some cases, Hispanic service members, the study said.\nTroop cuts could reduce gains made in racial and gender diversity of the military since the 1990s, according to a new Rand Corporation study released Monday.\nCuts involving troops with longer service could adversely affect black personnel, but cuts to troops with shorter service could adversely affect women, the study also said.\nThe cuts are expected to rely more on separations versus lowering recruitment as with previous drawdowns in the 1990s."}
