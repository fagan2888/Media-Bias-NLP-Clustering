It wasn\u2019t a fib. It wasn\u2019t a half truth. It was a bold-faced lie.\n\n\u201cNo matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise,\u201d President Obama told the American Medical Association in 2009. \u201cIf you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.\u201d\n\nThat statement turned out to be a lie. Period.\n\nOn Thursday I asked my Facebook community if they had faced hardships as a result of ObamaCare.\n\nThe response was overwhelming. I received nearly 1,000 replies \u2013 from small business owners, nurses, doctors, electricians, stay-at-home moms, and military personnel. Every single person said they had been adversely affected by President Obama\u2019s signature legislation.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nSo let\u2019s break down the president\u2019s lies.\n\nThursday he told an audience in Largo, Maryland that the Affordable Care Act had not hurt jobs.\n\n\u201cThere's no widespread evidence that the Affordable Care Act is hurting jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily reports that as a direct result of ObamaCare, more than 300 companies have either eliminated jobs or reduced full time jobs to part time jobs. Hospitals across the country are firing staff and reducing work hours.\n\nJanet Blanck owns Country Blossom Florist, a small shop in Gilbert, Ariz. She tells me that as a result of ObamaCare she\u2019s had to lay off three employees.\n\nAt one time, she employed eight people. Those who were not let go now work part-time because of rising insurance costs.\n\n\u201cObama is killing us,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt breaks my heart to have to do this. I have to protect what I have built and this is the only way that I know of to get around this law and still stay in business.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama also promised us that we would be able to keep our doctor. Another lie.\n\nSeveral hundred of you, like Joel Keefauver, wrote to tell me that your doctors were either shuttering their practices or shedding patients.\n\n\u201cUnder the forthcoming Affordable Care Act and new healthcare regulations, I will no longer be able to provide the quality of healthcare you have come to expect and that I believe is proper,\u201d the doctor wrote in a letter to Keefauver. \u201cThe increased cost imposed by complying with these new laws, along with decreasing reimbursements, creates a financial burden that is unsustainable for my solo practice.\u201d\n\nDiDi Henry\u2019s elderly mother recently moved from Alabama to Louisiana. She has been unable to find a doctor willing to take Medicare patients.\n\n\u201cSeveral doctors told her that they just aren\u2019t taking Medicare patients because of ObamaCare,\u201d she told me.\n\nThe president also told us ObamaCare would make health insurance affordable? Another whopper.\n\nBusiness owner Sheila Frey tells me her insurance rates have increased by 46 percent. Her small family-run company is paying $2,000 a month for coverage.\n\nAnd remember how President Obama promised rebate checks to defray the cost of buying insurance coverage? Well, Shelia tells me her rebate check was a meager $127. You do the math.\n\nTammy Boisvert told me she had to find a new pediatrician.\n\n\u201cMy family doctor of 20 years couldn\u2019t take my newborn due to this insurance mess,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWith a family of six all seen by this one doctor, I suddenly had to search for a new pediatrician.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama promised we could keep our current health care plan. Another lie.\n\nMichelle Cox, of Asheville, N.C. wrote to me about a letter she received Thursday from her insurance company.\n\n\u201cACA requires is to make significant changes to our health benefits plan designs,\u201d the letter read. \u201cWe cannot renew your existing plan in 2014.\u201d\n\nAlissa Delamar is in the same boat -- searching for insurance after her company canceled its group plan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stressed so much financially now I can\u2019t fathom any more debt,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt leaves you hopeless.\u201d\n\nCatherine Schneider and her husband own Blue Sky Trucking in Montgomery, Minn. They were just informed that their insurance policy would be canceled in December.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is disrupting our business and it has the potential to destroy our family.\u201d\n\nAllison deNijis\u2019s family policy was also canceled.\n\n\u201cI thought Obama said we could keep our insurance?\u201d she asked. \u201cI thought he said our cost would decline? Not true! Epic fail!\u201d\n\nHer family was offered a new policy that now includes a nearly $1,000 monthly premium and $5,000 in individual deductibles.\n\n\u201cI am seriously considering just paying the fine and putting the differential amount in a personal savings account,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhy should I pay over $13,000 in premiums?\u201d\n\nBy the time ObamaCare is fully implemented, I suspect most Americans will be begging for death panels \u2013 to put us out of our misery.\n\nTodd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.
