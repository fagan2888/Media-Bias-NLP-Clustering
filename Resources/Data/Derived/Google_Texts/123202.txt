The annual Pap smear — a cornerstone of women’s health for at least 60 years — is credited with preventing millions of deaths from cervical cancer.

However, in 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force made decisive recommendations advising women to undergo Pap smear screening less often. The goal is to test women often enough to catch early warning signs of cervical cancer, but not so often that women are subjected to unnecessary, invasive tests.

Given that most cases of cervical cancer are linked to the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus, or HPV, it would seem that a monogamous woman who tests negative for HPV would not need regular Pap smears. However, doctors advise that these women should still undergo Pap smears as recommended for their age and medical history.

Why? One reason is that many HPV infections clear up on their own without causing any problems, and it’s possible that a woman who tests negative for HPV still harbors a dormant form of the virus.

While dormant HPV does not appear to be an immediate health risk or contagious to a partner, it could become active again if the immune system is compromised by another virus or health problem.

“HPV never leaves your body,” said Laura Corio, an obstetrician and associate professor at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. “It can come out various times in your life.”

Under the current guidelines, women should be screened no more than every three years. Women are advised to begin screening at age 21 regardless of sexual history.

The task force also recommends against Pap tests for women over 65, as long as they have had prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer.
