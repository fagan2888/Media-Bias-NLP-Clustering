U.S. officials have said that the organization seems far less driven to launch elaborate, overseas terror plots than al-Qaeda and its affiliates.\n\nBut the Islamic State is also increasingly seen as the center of an expanding movement whose disparate elements range from the ranks of stray followers drawn by the group\u2019s brand of extreme brutality to formal franchises in Libya and other countries where security has deteriorated.\n\n[Tracking the Islamic State\u2019s rise]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become more diffuse geographically and dispersed ideologically,\u201d said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University. In some ways, Hoffman said, the amorphous nature of that network may make it more difficult to contain than al-Qaeda, which has often exerted an almost corporate-style control of regional franchises and terror plots.\n\nU.S. officials said Friday that it was too early to determine whether the attacks were coordinated by the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re still working to determine whether the attacks were coordinated or directed by ISIL, they bear the hallmarks that have defined ISIL\u2019s violent ideology,\u201d a U.S. official said.\n\nThe suspect in France reportedly told authorities of his ties to the Islamic State, and a decapitated corpse has become one of the group\u2019s grisly signatures.\n\nThe organization claimed responsibility for the attack in Tunisia, where at least 39 people were killed. Tunisia has been previously targeted in similar attacks by the Islamic State, which has drawn hundreds of recruits from that country.\n\nTh mosque bombing in Kuwait was quickly claimed by an Islamic State affiliate.\n\nU.S. officials and counterterrorism experts noted that all three incidents took place just days after a spokesman for the Islamic State urged followers to launch attacks during the month-long Muslim holiday Ramadan, and that the terror group may be seeking to mark the anniversary of its declaration of a caliphate in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cWith the three attacks, you basically have three different agendas at work at the same time,\u201d said Will McCants, an expert on militant Islamism at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBut what\u2019s holding them together are people who are favorably disposed to the broader agenda of the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nA North African intelligence official said the geographically dispersed violence is also a signal to al-Qaeda, its rival for influence among jihadists: \u201cThe message is: We can reach anywhere,\u201d the official said.\n\nGiven the volume of fighters flowing into and out of Syria, as well as the proliferation of Islamic State propaganda online, \u201ctreating this as a counter-radicalization problem on an individual basis is . . . just going to exhaust us,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cUntil the organization is weakened, I don\u2019t think its appeal will be diminished.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic State has since its inception threatened to hit Western targets, but its most recent incitements have been more direct and urgent. The group\u2019s principal spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, released a recorded statement this past week calling for attacks by followers beyond Syria during the Islamic holy month.\n\n\u201cYou all must rush to it and be keen on waging invasion in this eminent month, and commit martyrdom in it,\u201d the message said, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors Islamist postings online.\n\nThe group asserted responsibility in May for a thwarted attack in Garland, Tex., on an event where cartoonists were drawing the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n[Islamic State prosecutions in the United States ]\n\nThe targets of Friday\u2019s attacks reflect the broad range of the Islamic State\u2019s goals.\n\nTunisia has been a particular focal point for the group, in part because the country has made more progress toward democratic political overhauls than other nations in the Middle East and North Africa swept up in the so-called Arab Spring. Tunisia has also seen more than 3,000 of its citizens travel to Syria to fight in that country\u2019s civil war, many of them joining the ranks of the Islamic State.\n\nTunisia\u2019s democratic overhauls are \u201cbad news for extremists, and therefore I think it is no accident that Tunisia would be a special focus,\u201d said Paul Pillar, former deputy director of the CIA\u2019s Counterterrorism Center.\n\nThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for an assault in March on a prominent museum in Tunis where more than 20 people, many of them Western tourists, were killed.\n\nThe attack on the American-owned chemical plant in France would fit the Islamic State\u2019s aim of striking Western targets in retaliation for airstrikes by the United States and its allies, as well as sowing anxiety and preoccupying European security services.\n\nThe suicide bombing in Kuwait appeared to be part of a broader campaign by the Islamic State \u2014 which is predominantly Sunni \u2014 to ignite sectarian conflict with followers of the rival sect of Shiite Islam. The attack looked to have been carried out by an Islamic State affiliate known as the Najd Province, a group that has sought to establish a stronghold on the Arabian Peninsula where al-Qaeda\u2019s most potent franchise is based.\n\nIslamic State fighters celebrated the attacks in social media boasts on Friday. One posting on Twitter was addressed to \u201cChristians planning their summer vacations in Tunisia,\u201d and said, \u201cwe can\u2019t accept u in our land while your jets keep killing our Muslim brothers.\u201d\n\nBut even as U.S. intelligence analysts sought to assess the Islamic State\u2019s role in the three attacks, the group\u2019s carnage in Syria and Iraq continued. Reports from Kobane indicated that the Islamic State had killed at least 146 civilians, more than double the death toll in Kuwait, France and Tunisia.\n\nSouad Mekhennet in London and Julie Tate in Washington contributed to this report, which was published originally in The Washington Post.\n\nRead More at The Washington Post:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The attacks appeared to have no connection in terms of tactic or target.", "title": "ISIS Urges More Global Terror Attacks During Ramadan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/28/ISIS-Urges-More-Global-Terror-Attacks-During-Ramadan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06282015_Tunisia_Terror_Attack.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/28/ISIS-Urges-More-Global-Terror-Attacks-During-Ramadan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06282015_Tunisia_Terror_Attack.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The attacks appeared to have no connection in terms of tactic or target.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "[Islamic State prosecutions in the United States ]The targets of Friday\u2019s attacks reflect the broad range of the Islamic State\u2019s goals.\n[Tracking the Islamic State\u2019s rise]\u201cIt\u2019s become more diffuse geographically and dispersed ideologically,\u201d said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University.\nTunisia has been previously targeted in similar attacks by the Islamic State, which has drawn hundreds of recruits from that country.\nU.S. officials said Friday that it was too early to determine whether the attacks were coordinated by the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.\nTh mosque bombing in Kuwait was quickly claimed by an Islamic State affiliate."}
