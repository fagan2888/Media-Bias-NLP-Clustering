From barbecue to lobster rolls, food trucks can provides a range of meals that most fast-food businesses cannot.\n\nAbout 61 percent of the NPD survey respondents said food trucks in their area provided Mexican food, suggesting an interest in something different for Americans who are used to a burger-and-fries combination and that such brick-and-mortar outlets as Taco Bell may be losing the most business to food trucks.\n\nThe most common orders at food trucks are hot sandwiches, Mexican foods, cold sandwiches and soups.\n\nFood trucks also have obstacles that fast-food does not. Permits and regulations differ in each city. Parking becomes an issue in large cities where spaces are scarce, and the amount of time the trucks are allowed to stay in one designated spot varies throughout cities.\n\nThe survey further uncovered that while there are regular users, more than half of consumers aware of the food trucks around them are purchasing only once every two or three months or less, suggesting they view them as a treat or spontaneous act.\n\n\u201cFor now at least, food trucks need not be viewed as a threat to restaurant demand nationally,\u201d says Bonnie Riggs, NPD restaurant industry analyst. \u201cHowever, in markets with a developed food-truck presence, [quick service restaurant] operators may wish to take note of the benefits food trucks offer, such as different and fresh food, especially as a means to build their snack business and/or protect lunch traffic.\u201d\n\nCompetition within the food industry draws attention to fast food workers across the nation, who have been staging protests seeking to raise the minimum wage. Employees in New York last week, for example, demanded that the city more than double its minimum wage, from the current $7.25 an hour to $15.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Traditional fast-food chains have been aware for years of the trendy new food trucks that are cutting into their business, and a new report from the NPD Group shows just how big a bite the mobile competitors have taken out of the quick-service restaurants.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Traditional fast-food chains have been aware for years of the trendy new food trucks that are cutting into their business, and a new report from the NPD Group shows just how big a bite the mobile competitors have taken out of the quick-service restaurants.", "title": "Trendy food trucks no threat to restaurants \u2014 yet", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/1/trendy-food-trucks-no-threat-to-restaurants-yet/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/01/9_1_2013_ap5698220096418201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/01/9_1_2013_ap5698220096418201.jpg", "description": "Traditional fast-food chains have been aware for years of the trendy new food trucks that are cutting into their business, and a new report from the NPD Group shows just how big a bite the mobile comp", "card": "summary", "title": "Trendy food trucks no threat to restaurants \u2014 yet"}, "Author": "Casey Mutchler - The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Hospitality Recreation"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFor now at least, food trucks need not be viewed as a threat to restaurant demand nationally,\u201d says Bonnie Riggs, NPD restaurant industry analyst.\nThe most common orders at food trucks are hot sandwiches, Mexican foods, cold sandwiches and soups.\nFrom barbecue to lobster rolls, food trucks can provides a range of meals that most fast-food businesses cannot.\nAbout 61 percent of the NPD survey respondents said food trucks in their area provided Mexican food, suggesting an interest in something different for Americans who are used to a burger-and-fries combination and that such brick-and-mortar outlets as Taco Bell may be losing the most business to food trucks.\nFood trucks also have obstacles that fast-food does not."}
