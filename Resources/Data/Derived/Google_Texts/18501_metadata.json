Then he boasted that\u2019s how you handle misguided people.\n\n\u201cDid you get him out of here? Did you get them out?\u201d Trump repeatedly said. \u201cPretty soon they\u2019re [his security] going to get so nasty, that we will not have any protests.\u201d\n\nThe see-saw between Trump\u2019s endless boasts, his smearing of critics and competitors, and his strongman treatment of protesters to show he would do whatever it takes to stay in control, continued throughout his 80-minute speech. Trump briefly attacked Sanders in much the same way he went after the protesters, saying he would love to run against him in the general election\u2014that it would be \u201ca dream come true\u201d\u2014but then said he lost respect for Sanders after the incident in which the senator was interrupted onstage by Black Lives Matters protesters and allowed them to take over the microphone.\n\n\u201cI would never let that happen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI lost so much respect for Bernie. We can\u2019t let anybody take over our mic. We can\u2019t let it happen.\u201d\n\nWhether it was holding onto the microphone or anything else Trump deemed important\u2014building a wall on the Mexican border, taking Iraq\u2019s oil\u2014he said that only he has the reasonable and strong position, while everyone else is weak, stupid and incompetent.\n\nIn many respects, Trump\u2019s criticism of Sanders was muted in comparison to his harsh words for congressional Republicans, who he said caved badly during the just-passed federal budget deal with President Obama. But that may not have been the point of Trump\u2019s visit to Burlington, where Sanders was mayor for eight years in the 1980s. The Vermont media coverage from Burlington is also broadcast in New Hampshire, where the first GOP primary is held. With Ted Cruz looking like he will win in Iowa, where candidates favored by Republican evangelicals have repeatedly won the first-in-the-nation caucuses, Trump used the Vermont appearance to portray his GOP competitors as weak for not venturing into Sanders\u2019 backyard.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump used his well-honed sense of stagecraft to ensure the event would draw maximum attention. On Wednesday, his staff announced they had given away nearly 20,000 tickets for an event in a theater with only 1,400 seats. That caused local police to fret about crowds, some committed supporters and protesters to get in line as early as 4:30am, and TV crews to be present during the day. The anti-Trump protests in a park across the street from the event included silent vigils, marchers chanting, \u201cRacist, fascist, anti-gay, Donald Trump, stay away!\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t give in to racist fear, refugees are welcome here.\u201d The pro-Trump side countered from the sidewalk, \u201cBuild a wall!\u201d and \u201cUSA!
