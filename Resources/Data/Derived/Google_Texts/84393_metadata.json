Many, she said, bore May 3 postmarks from other ZIP codes. That means they arrived too late to be counted.\n\n\u201cWe were in the (post office) lobby when it closed, and asked (postal employees) to look for every ballot they could find,\u201d Ross said. Every ballot that arrived after that came too late to be counted. Cissy Olson, a designated election official at Marchetti and Weaver, an Edwards-based firm that handles special district accounting and management, wrote in an email that she and other election officials often see ballots that were postmarked later than May 3. That\u2019s despite notices on the front of all ballots that state ballots must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nSlim Margins\n\nThe ambulance district \u2014 which includes Vail and the entire Eagle River Valley \u2014 this spring asked voters for a property tax increase. That revenue will help fill a hole in the budget caused in large part by provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act that both expanded Medicaid eligibility and reduced reimbursement to facilities that provide care to those patients. That has created a roughly $1.8 million annual shortfall in the district\u2019s budget.\n\nThe proposal passed, but by only about 24 votes.\n\nThe ambulance district was one of four districts asking voters for tax increases this spring. The others were the Eagle River Fire Protection District, the Gypsum Fire Protection District and Edwards Metropolitan District. All the proposals passed, but the ambulance district vote was by far the closest.\n\nThe ambulance district has also had the most returned ballots, although that could be due to the fact the district has by far the most voters.\n\nIn an email, Kris Nash, the designated election official for the Eagle River Fire Protection District, said that district had received roughly 170 late or undeliverable ballots as of May 10. Ross said she\u2019s heard the same story from all of the election officials responsible for the May elections.\n\nThose numbers are high compared to coordinated county mail ballot elections.\n\nIn an email, Eagle County Clerk and Recorder Teak Simonton wrote that the last county election saw more than 5,000 ballots mailed out, and only 50 or so arrived too late to be counted.\n\nThe problem may be the number of separate elections held by the districts. For instance, a voter in Eagle-Vail would have had separate ballots for the Eagle-Vail Metropolitan District Board of Directors as well as the fire and ambulance districts. All had to be mailed separately.\n\n\u201cThe state doesn\u2019t allow us to coordinate on the same ballot (for spring elections),\u201d Ross said, adding that she and other election officials are now working to see if there are ways to make voting easier for residents.\n\nAnd, she added, \u201cwe need to come up with some kind of affidavit for the postmaster to sign that we were there when the post offices close on Election Day.\u201d\n\nVail Daily Business Editor Scott Miller can be reached at 970-748-2930, smiller@vaildaily.com and @scottnmiller.", "article_metadata": {"description": "EDWARDS \u2014 The votes have been counted in the Eagle County Health Service District\u2019s May 3 election, but ballots are still arriving every day.Several Edwards residents Monday saw a", "og": {"url": "http://www.vaildaily.com/news/21977610-113/district-receives-hundreds-of-late-ballots", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.vaildaily.com/csp/mediapool/sites/VailDaily/assets/img/facebook-thumbnail-1200.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "site_name": "The VailDaily", "description": "EDWARDS \u2014 The votes have been counted in the Eagle County Health Service District\u2019s May 3 election, but ballots are still arriving every day.Several Edwards residents Monday saw a", "title": "District receives hundreds of late ballots | VailDaily.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@VailDaily", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 306532666136106}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 21977610}}, "keywords": "DISTRICT, BALLOTS, ELECTION, LATE, EAGLE, BALLOT, COUNTY, VOTES, AMBULANCE, COUNTED", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The ambulance district has also had the most returned ballots, although that could be due to the fact the district has by far the most voters.\nThe others were the Eagle River Fire Protection District, the Gypsum Fire Protection District and Edwards Metropolitan District.\nAll the proposals passed, but the ambulance district vote was by far the closest.\nIn an email, Kris Nash, the designated election official for the Eagle River Fire Protection District, said that district had received roughly 170 late or undeliverable ballots as of May 10.\nSlim MarginsThe ambulance district \u2014 which includes Vail and the entire Eagle River Valley \u2014 this spring asked voters for a property tax increase."}
