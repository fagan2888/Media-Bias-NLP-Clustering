Bush\u2019s flagrant constitutional abuses and foreign quagmires, Gore Vidal famously dubbed the country of which he fancied himself the official biographer \u201cthe United States of Amnesia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe learn nothing,\u201d Vidal wrote, \u201cbecause we remember nothing.\u201d\n\nA dozen years later, it would hardly seem that Americans have simply forgotten the foreign policy and and economic calamities that defined the Bush era: Voters spurned Mitt Romney in 2012, largely because President Obama argued that however slow and halting the recovery had proven, a Romney presidency would represent a return to the disastrous economic policies of the Bush years. And in a profoundly karmic twist of fate, Bush\u2019s younger brother risks failure in his own White House quest, in part because Dubya\u2019s presidency has become an albatross. Indeed, if Jeb Bush comes up short in his 2016 campaign, we may date his bid\u2019s decline to his erratic attempts to answer whether, in retrospect, he\u2019d have invaded Iraq \u2014 a war a decisive majority of Americans see as a grievous error.\n\nBut even if Americans don\u2019t look back fondly on the eight years that witnessed a $2 trillion war, claiming nearly 4,500 American and an estimated half-million Iraqi lives; the deepest economic slump since the Great Depression; and the worst-ever jobs record, they\u2019re increasingly inclined to cut the man who delivered that list of horrors some slack. For the first time in a decade, a new CNN-Opinion Research Corporation poll finds, more Americans take a favorable view of the 43rd president than look on him unfavorably. Fifty two percent of respondents told CNN they viewed Bush favorably, against 43 percent who did not; when Bush left office in January 2009, those numbers were 35 percent and 60 percent, respectively.\n\nMuch of the political press corps pounced on the finding that Bush\u2019s favorable ratings are now better than those of Obama, who was propelled to the presidency by a growing anti-Bush backlash. While Americans now view Bush favorably by a nine-point margin, they split on his successor, 49 percent to 49 percent. Of course, it\u2019s not surprising that the public is a bit tougher in its estimation of a sitting president, mired as he is in the day-to-day squabbles of American politics. Bush, by contrast, has been out of office for 6.5 years \u2014 and while he hasn\u2019t quite grown his hair out and become a hermit, the Lyndon Johnson tradition \u2014 he\u2019s assiduously avoided delving into hot-button political debates. Unlike his trigger-happy vice president \u2014 whom we always considered the real brains of the Bush-Cheney politico-policy operation \u2014 Bush seems to understand that the best way to rehabilitate his public image is to lay low.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the first time in a decade, Bush's ratings are back in the black.
