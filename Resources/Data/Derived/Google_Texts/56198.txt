A 4.8 magnitude earthquake rocked central Oklahoma Saturday afternoon, according to the Oklahoma Geological Survey. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake was a 4.5 magnitude.

It was recorded at 12:10 p.m.

The epicenter was located about one mile southeast of Lake Arcadia, about five miles northwest of Jones, seven miles east of Edmond, nine miles north, northwest of Choctaw, and 14 miles northeast of Oklahoma City.

Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, characterized it as a shallow quake that might knock items from shelves and cause light fixtures to sway.

Caruso said it is likely part of the swarm of quakes that have struck near the Jones area over the past few years. It was felt as far south as Wichita Falls, Texas, and as far north as Wichita, Kansas, he said.



It was about five miles deep.

Kenna Carmon with the Oklahoma Department of Transportation says ODOT crews have been checking their roads and bridges in a 15 mile radius from the epicenter and have found no damage.

News On 6 offices shook noticeably in what felt like two waves. Viewers in many Oklahoma cities, including Oklahoma City, Edmond, Tulsa, Broken Arrow, Stillwater, and Guthrie reported feeling the earthquake.
