John Bel Edwards and members of his administration say the process is necessary to make the system more efficient and maintain the public hospitals that for several decades have been central to the state\u2019s ability to provide health care for those who cannot afford it.\n\n\u201cWe are negotiating to keep them in place but at a savings. That\u2019s hard to do,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe have to achieve savings.\u201d\n\nThe focus is sharpening on the value of the public-private partner contracts as the Legislature cobbles together a spending plan for the budget year that begins July 1 \u2014 while facing an estimated $600 million shortfall.\n\nLouisiana shifted three years ago to the privatized model for nearly all of the old charity hospital system that was previously run by LSU.\n\nWith mounting stress on the state budget, lawmakers this year are loudly voicing concerns over whether the deals made are benefiting the state.\n\nDuring the House floor debate on the coming year\u2019s budget, Rep. Lance Harris, R-Alexandria, questioned whether the state Department of Health and Hospitals has adequately reviewed how favorable the hospital deals are to the private partners and accused the DHH leaders of \u201cnonsensical management.\u201d\n\nThe hospital at Alexandria was one on the list that would not have been funded under Edwards\u2019 budget proposal, which covered five of the nine contracts.\n\n\u201cIf people want more in the public-private partnerships, then find the money. You can find it,\u201d said Rep. Jay Morris, R-Monroe.\n\nThe partnerships were eventually funded at the level Edwards wanted \u2014 lower than the partners themselves had asked for \u2014 after a late-night amendment on the House floor, in a close vote, shifted $72 million from the popular Taylor Opportunity Program for Students college scholarships to save the hospitals.\n\nLegislators, who have been loathe to pare back TOPS, which provides tuition to Louisiana high schoolers who meet certain average benchmarks and go to college in state, found themselves faced with the choice of funding their local hospitals or cutting TOPS.\n\n\u201cThis is life or death in my district and every one of your districts,\u201d said Rep. Malinda White, D-Bogalusa.\n\nKey to the debate is that several of the safety net hospitals also serve as training grounds for future doctors through the LSU medical school.\n\nEdwards said he also has questions about whether the state is getting the most out of what it spends to keep the health care services in operation. \u201cNobody likes to sit at the table to negotiate a reduced amount of money,\u201d he said. But he said he believes there is room for savings to the state.\n\nThe hospitals, meanwhile, maintain they are making no money off their arrangements with the state and have repeatedly threatened to walk away if their budgets are slashed too deeply.\n\nDuring a recent meeting of the Senate Finance Committee, the hospital partners defended their contracts and denied that they are making money off of the state.\n\n\u201cPublic-private partnerships should transcend politics,\u201d said Tyrone Picard, who represents the Alliance of Public-Private Partnership Hospitals, which includes most of the partners.\n\nBut legislators remain skeptical.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard people say that they\u2019ve borrowed money and expanded, all in an effort to break even. That\u2019s just makes no sense to me,\u201d said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Eric LaFleur, D-Ville Platte. \u201cIt\u2019 s ridiculous. It\u2019s just not credible.\u201d\n\nThe privatization process, which was pushed by Edwards\u2019 Republican predecessor Bobby Jindal and approved by an LSU governing board made up of his appointees, allowed contracts to be approved \u201cwith dozens of blank pages,\u201d Edwards said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that they were too hastily put together,\u201d said Edwards, whose mother worked for years as a nurse at Lallie Kemp Charity Hospital in Independence \u2014 the only state-run hospital remaining from the old system. \u201cIt\u2019s not the approach you would ever want to take on something so serious as our safety net hospitals.\u201d\n\nEdwards said that the hospital partners need to tweak their business model to offer better savings to the state. \u201cThey are engaging with us in good faith,\u201d he added.\n\nThe administration\u2019s plan includes stressing to the hospitals the need to encourage patients to sign up for Medicaid. Starting in July, qualifications will be rolled back to allow an estimated 375,000 people onto the state Medicaid rolls, with the federal government picking up most of the tab, thanks to the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe health care law, frequently referred to as \u201cObamacare,\u201d was once thought to be a threat to the state\u2019s unique charity hospital system that had offered health care for the poor and uninsured for decades in Louisiana. The health care law scales back federal funding for hospitals that provide care for the indigent. That funding model helped fuel the privatized charity system.\n\nThe public-private partnership contracts allow the partners to walk away if the state doesn\u2019t adequately fund them. Hospital operators also can scale back services if they aren\u2019t paid at the rate they demand.\n\nThe public-private partners now run the former LSU hospitals in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Lafayette, Alexandria, Lake Charles, Bogalusa, Houma, Monroe and Shreveport\n\nThe partners also have begun offering care through clinics and other services they operate.\n\nJindal touted the privatized model as a chance for the state to save money while improving care.\n\nNearly everyone agrees that health care services have improved under the new model \u2014 there have not been the long waits and rationing of care that were seen under the old charity system \u2014 but the claim of saving money continues to be questioned.\n\nHarris, who is the chairman of the GOP delegation in the House, said he thinks the state should be questioning the profit margin for hospitals.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t review financials of the partners to know if we\u2019re getting a good deal on profit margins?\u201d Harris asked DHH leaders on the House floor.\n\nDepartment of Health and Hospitals Secretary Dr. Rebekah Gee, who took on that role shortly after Edwards took office in January, spent nearly two hours defending the contracts during the budget debate.\n\nShe said there are concerns about the contracts and that\u2019s what the administration is trying to fix in the renegotiations.\n\n\u201cWith less dollars and less physicians, longer wait times and rationing of care would ensue,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow Elizabeth Crisp on Twitter, @elizabethcrisp.
