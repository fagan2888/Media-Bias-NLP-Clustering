I think that is a huge mistake.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his foreign policy qualifications, Walker said that while his political experience has been at the state level, that \u201cleadership\u201d is key to foreign policy. As an example of this, he cited Ronald Reagan\u2019s handling of the air traffic controller strike, which he said sent a message that Reagan was a serious president.\n\nRegarding current events in Yemen, he argued \u201cthis goes to part of a pattern\u2026when you have an administration whether it\u2019s the United States or France or anywhere else, who doesn\u2019t take seriously those threats, who doesn\u2019t invest the resources needed to take those threats seriously, you open the door to chaos. And I think that\u2019s just something we all should have learned after 9/11. It\u2019s not a matter of if there\u2019ll be attempts, it\u2019s a matter of when. And we need to be prepared here and around the world to make sure the fight doesn\u2019t come to us, that we take the fight to them. Whether it\u2019s in Yemen, whether it\u2019s in Iran, whether it\u2019s anywhere else out there. There\u2019s a concerted effort, that if we want to protect our families, our children, our livelihood here in the United States, we\u2019ve got to be prepared to act elsewhere.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scott Walker talked foreign policy, offering criticism of President Obama's, while arguing that he was qualified to handle foreign affairs", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Scott Walker talked foreign policy, offering criticism of President Obama's, while arguing that he was qualified to handle foreign affairs", "title": "Walker Talks Foreign Policy, Defends His 'Leadership,' Criticizes Obama - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Walker-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/01/22/walker-talks-foreign-policy-defends-his-leadership-criticizes-obama/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scott Walker talked foreign policy, offering criticism of President Obama's, while arguing that he was qualified to handle foreign affairs", "title": "Walker Talks Foreign Policy, Defends His 'Leadership,' Criticizes Obama - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Walker-Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "foreign policy, Iran, President Obama, Scott Walker, Yemen,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Jihad,Walker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Yemen", "published_time": "2015-01-22T21:03:58-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Jihad,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb34\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWisconsin Governor Scott Walker (R) talked about foreign policy, offering criticism of President Obama\u2019s foreign policy while arguing that he was qualified to handle foreign affairs on Thursday\u2019s \u201cKelly File\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\nI think that is a huge mistake.\u201dWhen asked about his foreign policy qualifications, Walker said that while his political experience has been at the state level, that \u201cleadership\u201d is key to foreign policy.\nThere\u2019s a concerted effort, that if we want to protect our families, our children, our livelihood here in the United States, we\u2019ve got to be prepared to act elsewhere.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWalker began by declared \u201cwe send mixed messages to Israel at the same time this administration is seemingly opening its arms to Iran.\nWhether it\u2019s in Yemen, whether it\u2019s in Iran, whether it\u2019s anywhere else out there."}
