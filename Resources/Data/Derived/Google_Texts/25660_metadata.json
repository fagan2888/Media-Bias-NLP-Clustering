And as the doctor helped Eli\u2019s father Troy cut the cord, Brandi looked at her baby for the first time.\n\n\u201cI pulled back and said \u2018Something\u2019s wrong!\u2019 And the doctor said, \u2018No, he\u2019s perfectly fine.\u2019 Then I shouted, \u2018He doesn\u2019t have a nose!'\u201d\n\nThe delivering doctor hadn\u2019t even noticed what was so obvious to Eli\u2019s mother \u2014 Eli was born with a rare facial anomaly called complete congenital arhinia, meaning he was born without a nose. In addition to not having an external nose, Eli does not have a nasal cavity or an olfactory system. There are only about 37 cases like Eli\u2019s worldwide, and the chances of a baby being born with congenital arhinia is about one in 197 million.\n\nEli is a true miracle baby.\n\nAfter Brandi cried out that something was wrong, her newborn baby was immediately taken away, and Brandi was left alone for about ten minutes agonizing over whether she had actually seen what she thought she had seen \u2014 or didn\u2019t see.\n\n\u201cI was the first person to see it,\u201d Brandi said. \u201cEven when they took him away, my family still didn\u2019t know something was wrong, due to being caught up in the excitement of his arrival. It wasn\u2019t until they opened the blinds of the nursery that everyone else saw.\u201d\n\nBut the doctor did come back with what Brandi described as \u201cthe most apologetic look.\u201d She began to cry before he even spoke. Her partner Troy also had tears in his eyes\n\nShe had been right. Eli didn\u2019t have a nose.\n\nHer pregnancy, though more difficult than her previous one, had shown nothing unusual. Her doctor poured over her ultrasounds, including a 3D one, to see if he had missed anything, but he hadn\u2019t. There had been no indication that Eli would be anything but a normal, healthy baby boy when he was born, although he was born slightly early at 37 weeks after mom Brandi went into early labor three separate times.\n\nEli was taken to USA Children\u2019s and Women\u2019s Hospital in Mobile, Alabama the night he was born where Brandi was sure he wouldn\u2019t make it through the night. She called every 45 minutes, and Eli continued to hang on.\n\nAt 5-days-old, doctors performed a tracheotomy. Because of that, he no longer makes any noise when he cries, and so he must be watched closely at all times. But the tracheotomy has led to improvements for Eli.\n\n\u201cHe has done wonderfully since then,\u201d Brandi said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a much happier baby.\u201d\n\nThe doctors and medical staff have been baffled by Eli\u2019s condition because it is so rare. The staff at the USA Children\u2019s and Women\u2019s Hospital immediately began to research the condition as soon as they knew Eli was on his way and were only able to find three very brief articles on the condition. And so Eli\u2019s doctors are writing a case study on Eli himself.\n\nIn addition to the case study being written by doctors, the lactation consultant on staff is writing an article about Eli as well \u2014 Brandi wanted to breastfeed Eli when he got his tracheotomy and became the first mother to ever nurse a baby with a trach.\n\nBrandi, by reaching out to the few other people and mothers of children with the same condition, has gained more confidence that Eli will not only survive, but thrive well into adulthood. But he faces some definite challenges.\n\nHelping Eli isn\u2019t as simple as building him a nose and creating nasal passageways. In addition to being born without a nose, Brandi explains, \u201cHis palate didn\u2019t form all the way, so his brain is lower. It\u2019s a wait-and-see game.\u201d\n\nAnd because his condition affects his pituitary gland, Eli will have to be past puberty before a nasal passageway can even be attempted. Until that happens, Brandi says she would prefer to spare Eli from any unnecessary facial surgeries.\n\n\u201cWe think he\u2019s perfect the way he is. Until the day he wants to have a nose, we don\u2019t want to touch him. We have to take it day by day.\u201d\n\nBut after just three weeks in the hospital, Eli is getting ready to go home. And it seems apparent that his parents are ready for his homecoming.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best to make sure he\u2019s happy,\u201d Brandi said. \u201cThe rest of him is so cute, sometimes you don\u2019t realize he doesn\u2019t have a nose.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Brandi isn\u2019t aware of the challenges her miracle baby Eli will face as he grows.\n\n\u201cMy biggest fear for Eli is that the world won\u2019t see him as the beautiful, brave little boy that I see him as.\u201d\n\nBut despite facing a life of surgeries and other difficulties, Eli has a mother who obviously adores him and calls him \u201cthe most beautiful boy I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on.\u201d\n\nAnother baby who was born with a rare facial anomaly has made headlines this week.
