So I looked online,\u201d Little said.\n\nAnd bought a box to go with it.\n\n\u201cI knew I didn't know how to wire it,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, he called an electrician.\n\n\"To connect this box into my circuit breaker box,\u201d he said.\n\nHe bought his generator about eight years ago.\n\n\"I think I got this one at Sam\u2019s,\u201d Little said.\n\nHe hasn't been without power since. It's a good idea if you're not into roughing it, and so many people think so that the guys at Steve's Wholesale Distributors are loading generators up like hotcakes.\n\n\"We are selling an average at least five every 20 minutes. We've got a distribution center here,\u201d Robert Pineda said.\n\nBut when you show up to purchase one, be prepared, and know exactly what you plan to power.\n\n\"There's where the catch is,\u201d Pineda said. \u201cA lot of people do this and they think a 4,000 (kilowatt) is going to be sufficient, but because it being so small they think OK that'll be great, but then when they realize that they\u2019re going to run multiple items then you'll start throwing the breaker on it.\"\n\nTo keep just your fridge running, going for a smaller unit will work.\n\n\"Four thousand is going to be right around the ballpark of the smaller appliances,\u201d Pineda said.\n\nA 5,000 kilowatt is the most popular and costs just under $700, but to keep everything up and going, expect to pay about $5,000 for a 3,000 square-foot house.\n\n\"The whole house generator is a 22,000 KW. That one there will run your whole house,\u201d Pineda said.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "EMSA has a warning about generators and deadly carbon monoxide.", "author": "Joleen Chaney", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30843324/ice-storms-in-one-month-lead-to-rush-in-generator-sales", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9541889_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "EMSA has a warning about generators and deadly carbon monoxide.", "title": "Ice Storms In One Month Lead To Rush In Generator Sales"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9541889_G.jpg", "description": "EMSA has a warning about generators and deadly carbon monoxide.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ice Storms In One Month Lead To Rush In Generator Sales"}, "wnreadableurl": "ice-storms-in-one-month-lead-to-rush-in-generator-sales", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/12/28", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,carbon monoxide poisoning, generators,", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS24", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,carbon monoxide poisoning, generators,"}, "article_summary": "\"I bought the generator first, and then I thought, 'OK how am I going to run this generator?'\n\"The whole house generator is a 22,000 KW.\nThat one there will run your whole house,\u201d Pineda said.\nIf you're thinking about getting a generator, it's important to get the right kind and to know how to use it safely.\nBut when you show up to purchase one, be prepared, and know exactly what you plan to power."}
