But unlike in 2013, when San Jose State was left out, MW associate commissioner for communications Javan Hedlund said all teams will find a landing spot.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great for the league,\u201d Hedlund said. \u201cAll three years we\u2019ve had 12 teams in two six-team divisions, we\u2019ve had seven bowl-eligible teams. Having the opportunity to place all seven will be great for the league.\u201d\n\nIt will happen, because with 80 teams needed to fill 40 bowls, the NCAA does not have enough qualified teams. As of Sunday, only 75 were eligible, with three more (Kansas State, Georgia State and South Alabama) still having a chance. That means some bowls will draw from a pool of teams with 5-7 records to fill the gaps. By rule, bowl-eligible teams have to be placed first.\n\nThe Rams (7-5) don\u2019t care where they play, just that they are playing in the postseason. They\u2019ll find out this Sunday, after the announcements for the College Football Playoff and at-large bids are announced.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy we\u2019re going to a bowl for my senior year, and I know the guys are, so we\u2019re thankful for anything,\u201d said Joe Hansley, the star of Saturday\u2019s win with his three-touchdown performance, two of which came on first-half punt returns.\n\nBefore Colorado State can start making travel plans, the Rams must let things play out. Air Force and San Diego State are up first, meeting this Saturday at Qualcomm Stadium for the conference title. Then the Las Vegas Bowl gets to decide between the champion and BYU. If BYU doesn\u2019t play in Las Vegas, it goes to the Hawaii Bowl.\n\nFrom there, if the Cactus Bowl slot is open, that game picks next. After that, the conference and the bowls will make the decisions.\n\nIn that regard, the one decision that probably has been made is New Mexico will play in the New Mexico Bowl to help draw a bigger crowd.\n\nUntil then, the Rams have other things to cover, such as getting healthy. Bobo and his staff will hit the road this week to recruit.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado State Rams to go bowling but await specifics", "title": "Colorado State Rams to go bowling but await specifics", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/29/colorado-state-rams-to-go-bowling-but-await-specifics/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151123_015349_mike-bobo-4.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151123_015349_mike-bobo-4.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-29T19:08:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T06:57:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "As of Sunday, only 75 were eligible, with three more (Kansas State, Georgia State and South Alabama) still having a chance.\nColorado State capped the 2015 regular season Saturday night with a 34-31 victory at Fresno State, securing a winning season for first-year coach Mike Bobo.\nThen the Las Vegas Bowl gets to decide between the champion and BYU.\nBefore Colorado State can start making travel plans, the Rams must let things play out.\nIf BYU doesn\u2019t play in Las Vegas, it goes to the Hawaii Bowl."}
