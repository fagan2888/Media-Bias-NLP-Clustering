Those qualified organizations will also be allowed to provide or sell claims data to providers.\n\nThe rule also outlines strict privacy and security requirements for any entity receiving Medicare analysis or data. Additionally, there will be new annual reporting requirements.\n\n[Also: CMS changes benchmark rules for Shared Savings ACOs, will account for regional differences]\n\n\"Increasing access to analyses and data that include Medicare data will make it easier for stakeholders throughout the healthcare system to make smarter and more informed healthcare decisions,\" said CMS Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt.\n\nThe qualified entity program, authorized by the Affordable Care Act, allows qualified organizations access to patient-protected Medicare data to produce public reports. Such entities must combine the Medicare data with other claims data, such as private payer data; this enables them to produce quality reports representative of how providers and suppliers are performing across multiple payers (Medicare or Medicaid, for example, or various commercial payers).\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nTo date, 13 organizations have applied for, and received, approval to be a qualified entity. Of these, two have completed public reporting. The other 11 are preparing for that.\n\nThe new rules, said CMS, aim to bolster the current qualified entity program, allowing for more innovating uses of Medicare data for non-public uses, while at the same time ensuring the privacy and security of beneficiary information.\n\nTwitter: @JELagasse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cms-proposes-sharing-claims-data-providers-employers-improve-care", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/DHS-building-feature_3_0.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed new rules it expects will expand access to analysis and data that helps employers and providers make more informed decisions about care delivery.", "title": "CMS proposes sharing claims data with providers, employers to improve care"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/DHS-building-feature_3_0.gif"}, "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed new rules it expects will expand access to analysis and data that helps employers and providers make more informed decisions about care delivery.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CMS proposes sharing claims data with providers, employers to improve care"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed new rules it expects will expand access to analysis and data that helps employers and providers make more informed decisions about care delivery.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5d6e\"", "article_summary": "The qualified entity program, authorized by the Affordable Care Act, allows qualified organizations access to patient-protected Medicare data to produce public reports.\nThose qualified organizations will also be allowed to provide or sell claims data to providers.\nLike Healthcare Finance on FacebookTo date, 13 organizations have applied for, and received, approval to be a qualified entity.\nSuch entities must combine the Medicare data with other claims data, such as private payer data; this enables them to produce quality reports representative of how providers and suppliers are performing across multiple payers (Medicare or Medicaid, for example, or various commercial payers).\nThe rule also outlines strict privacy and security requirements for any entity receiving Medicare analysis or data."}
