Japan\u2019s consumer culture is littered with manias for Western food imports: pancakes, popcorn, doughnuts, even Taco Bell.\n\nSuccess in Japan is important for Blue Bottle, which operates 17 cafes in the San Francisco Bay area, New York and Los Angeles. Japan is its first foray outside of the U.S. Blue Bottle raised nearly $26 million last year to invest in expansion, including financing from Silicon Valley executives, setting the stage for a test of whether an artsy gourmet coffee chain can go big.\n\nFounder James Freeman, a musician, was inspired by Japan\u2019s old-style \u201ckissaten\u201d coffee-shops: tiny dimly-lit establishments, with good music and a barista behind a wooden counter. Think places for quiet serious thinking and real drip coffee, not sweet, frivolous drinks.\n\n\u201cWe care about every part of the coffee. We call it from seed to cup,\u201d said Saki Igawa, the business operations manager for Blue Bottle in Japan.\n\nAttention to detail that dovetails with aspects of Japanese culture accounts for part of the coffee chain\u2019s early popularity. The spread of Starbucks internationally, which has created a cookie-cutter coffee culture that some people want to trade up from, is another factor. Blue Bottle is also benefiting from the image problems in Japan of fast food chains and highly processed foods.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new era in eating out,\u201d said food industry consultant Jotaro Fujii who contends that Blue Bottle\u2019s arrival and the decline of McDonald\u2019s in Japan is part of a bigger trend of consumer interest in the safety and quality of the entire food supply chain.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is suffering declining popularity in Japan, a problem exacerbated after plastic pieces, and even a tooth, was found in its food last year, setting off an outrage among consumers.\n\nUpscale burger chain Shake Shack, which started as a hot dog stand in New York, is expected to arrive in Japan soon, said Fujii.\n\nSuch chains, including Blue Bottle, are likely to aim for 50 or at most 100 outlets in Japan, not the thousands that fast-food eateries, such as McDonald\u2019s, has achieved here, he said.\n\nInstead, they will focus on fortifying a brand image, which can lead to other kinds of lucrative businesses.\n\nAlthough the prevalent image of Japan might be tea, it has long had plenty of affection for coffee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Artsy coffee chain Blue Bottle brews long queues in Tokyo", "title": "Artsy coffee chain Blue Bottle brews long queues in Tokyo", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Artsy coffee chain Blue Bottle brews long queues in Tokyo", "title": "Artsy coffee chain Blue Bottle brews long queues in Tokyo", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/artsy_coffee_chain_blue_bottle_brews_long_queues_in_tokyo/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/japan-blue-bottle.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Artsy coffee chain Blue Bottle brews long queues in Tokyo", "title": "Artsy coffee chain Blue Bottle brews long queues in Tokyo", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/japan-blue-bottle.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Yuri Kageyama", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "We call it from seed to cup,\u201d said Saki Igawa, the business operations manager for Blue Bottle in Japan.\nBlue Bottle is also benefiting from the image problems in Japan of fast food chains and highly processed foods.\nThe spread of Starbucks internationally, which has created a cookie-cutter coffee culture that some people want to trade up from, is another factor.\nSuccess in Japan is important for Blue Bottle, which operates 17 cafes in the San Francisco Bay area, New York and Los Angeles.\nAttention to detail that dovetails with aspects of Japanese culture accounts for part of the coffee chain\u2019s early popularity."}
