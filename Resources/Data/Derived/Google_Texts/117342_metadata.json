A victim is offered the system for free after being told a family member or friend had already paid for it. The victims were asked to provide bank or credit information to \u201cverify\u201d their identity only be socked with a monthly $35 service fee and they never receives their system. In addition, they had trouble getting a refund.\n\n* Auction Reseller Scam \u2013 Ebay and other auction resellers were scammed when a \u201cbuyer\u201d purchases an item then asks that it be shipped that day due to an emergency such as a child\u2019s birthday or someone in the military about to be deployed, etc. The seller receives a fake email from PayPal confirming the payment but the buyer doesn\u2019t pay. Always confirm payment in your Ebay and PayPal accounts before shipping, especially to an overseas address.\n\n* The Arrest Warrant Scam \u2013 Using technology that can change what is visible on Caller ID, scammers posing as law enforcement officers call people saying there\u2019s a warrant for their arrest. However, they tell the victim that they can pay a fine in order to avoid criminal charges and only accept wire transfers or pre-paid debit cards.\n\n* Invisible Home Improvements \u2013 Beware the knock on the door from a door to door solicitor who was in the neighborhood or an email or social media contact from a telemarketer with home improvement offers. The scammers offer to repair or improve areas that cannot be seen easily such as roofs, chimneys, air ducts, crawl spaces, etc. Check out home contractors at bbb.org before saying yes.\n\n* Casting Call Scam \u2013 With the popularity of television talent shows such as \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and \u201cProject Runway,\u201d scammers pose as agents or talent scouts looking for actors, singers, models, reality show contestants, etc., and use phony audition notices to fool aspiring performers into paying to try out for parts that don\u2019t exist or to sell acting lessons, photography services, etc. It can also be a scam for things like fees for online \u201capplications\u201d or upcoming \u201ccasting calls.\u201d Some scammers may use the information for identity theft.\n\n* Foreign Currency Scam \u2013 Scammers are using use real current events and news stories to make their pitches to make investments in foreign currency even more appealing. The scammers claim it\u2019s an easy investment with high return and low risk when you purchase Iraqi Dinar, Vietnamese Dong or, most recently, the Egyptian Pound. The plan is that, when those governments revalue their currencies, increasing their worth against the dollar, you just sell and cash in. Scammers are also giving their victims this real currency. Victims then find that the currency is very difficult to sell and learn it\u2019s extremely unlikely they will ever significantly increase in value.\n\n* Scam Texts \u2013 For people who do online and mobile banking, scammers are using scam texts, known as \u201csmishing,\u201d to steal personal information. They look like a text alert from your bank and ask a victim, to confirm information or \u201creactivate your debit card\u201d by following a link on your smart phone. Banks of all sizes have been targeted and details of the scam vary. The outcome is the same: scammers get your banking information, maybe even your ATM number and PIN. Some victims find that malicious software is downloaded, giving the scammer access to anything on your phone.\n\n* Do Not Call Scams \u2013 The National Do Not Call Registry (U.S.) offer consumers a free way to reduce telemarketing calls. Scammers call pretending to be a government official to sign up or confirm participation on the Do Not Call list and ask for personal information or charge a phony fee to be registered for this free government service.\n\n* Fake Friend Scam \u2013 Scammers are using Facebook to become friends with a person but end up getting their personal information to create fake profiles or recommend sketchy websites that download malware, use your account to scrap information on your other friends, even impersonate a military officer or other trustworthy people to perpetrate a romance scam.Keep your privacy settings high and don\u2019t share confidential information.\n\nScam of the Year: Affordable Care Act Scam\n\nScammers had a field day with the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d), using it as a way to fool Americans into sharing their personal information. Scammers would call claiming to be from the federal government and saying the would-be victim needed a new insurance card or Medicare card. However, before they can mail the card, they need to collect personal information such as your bank\u2019s routing number, bank account number, a Social Security number, a credit card number, of a Medicare ID number. A person risks identity theft by sharing this personal information and unknown caller.\n\nHave a consumer issue, problem or complaint?
