The band had not begun to play and the crowds the food truck owners were expecting after the Tampa Bay Storm game at the Forum hadn\u2019t arrived.\n\nDebbie Guy, who operates the Dochos sandwiches food truck, said she and her team were at the Channelside fireworks show on Memorial Day, and the crowds didn\u2019t show up until closer to the show. She expected it to be a similar scenario this weekend.\n\nBob and Linda Huebert, who had read about the event in the newspaper and drove from Apollo Beach, were disappointed that there wasn\u2019t a bigger crowd. They thought the event should have been advertised better.\n\n\u201cYou want people to be down here,\u201d Linda Huebert said.\n\nJohn and Terry Greene, who came from Brandon, agreed. They used to come to Channelside frequently \u2014 back when it was busy and crowded many nights.\n\nTerry Greene said she doesn\u2019t understand why the plaza is struggling now. She wants the fireworks series to be more successful in coming weeks and bring in new clients for the restaurants and shops.\n\n\u201cI think the idea is good and the location is good,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful.\u201d\n\nThe Light Up Channelside series kicks off this weekend, and will take place most Saturdays through Aug. 23. On Aug. 31, there will be a Labor Day fireworks show and lighted boat parade.\n\nThe event lasts from 5 to 11 p.m., with the fireworks starting at 9 p.m. Between six and eight food trucks will be at the plaza from 5 to 9 p.m. each night of the series.\n\nTo find out more about Light Up Channnelside, go to www.channelsidebayplaza.com.\n\nEbehrman@Tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7691\n\nTwitter: @LizBehrmanTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 07 Jun 2014 19:35:45 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 The Light Up Channelside Summer Fireworks Series was off to a slow start Saturday.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 The Light Up Channelside Summer Fireworks Series was off to a slow start Saturday.", "title": "\u2018Light up Channelside\u2019 slips quietly into pre-summer", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/light-up-channelside-slips-quietly-into-pre-summer-20140607/", "image": {"width": 2192, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140607/ARTICLE/140609376/EP/1/1/EP-140609376.jpg", "height": 1245}, "updated_time": "2014-06-07T21:04:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 The Light Up Channelside Summer Fireworks Series was off to a slow start Saturday.", "title": "\u2018Light up Channelside\u2019 slips quietly into pre-summer", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140607/ARTICLE/140609376/AR/0/AR-140609376.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-06-07T19:35:45Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-06-07T21:04:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2c1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m hopeful.\u201dThe Light Up Channelside series kicks off this weekend, and will take place most Saturdays through Aug. 23.\nThe Light Up Channelside Summer Fireworks Series was off to a slow start Saturday.\nThe long-struggling Channelside Plaza mostly was empty just after 5 p.m., when the fireworks festival was scheduled to start.\nShe wants the fireworks series to be more successful in coming weeks and bring in new clients for the restaurants and shops.\nThe band had not begun to play and the crowds the food truck owners were expecting after the Tampa Bay Storm game at the Forum hadn\u2019t arrived."}
