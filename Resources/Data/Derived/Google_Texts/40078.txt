At least 37 Christian denominations have taken a very liberal stance on Obamacare, as reflected by their reaction to the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold the Affordable Care Act.The 37 denominations with liberal views are members of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA (NCC), a group which greeted the Supreme Court decision with glee. "Adequate health care is [a] matter of preserving what gracious God has made," the NCC said in a statement cited by the American Spectator. Some of the mainstream members of the NCC also came out with their own statements in favor of Obamacare. "The Supreme Court decision today is a clear signal that we as a country are moving toward the realm of God on earth,' wrote the president of UCC, as quoted by American Spectator.The United Methodist Church (UMC) and the Presbyterian Church USA voiced their support for a single-payer approach to health care, as well. The Presbyterian Church Stated Clerk said, "We rejoice today as the Supreme Court rules to uphold constitutionality of Affordable Care Act.‚ÄùThe UMC Board of Church and Society on Capitol Hill pronounced that, "[we] celebrate provisions in that law which continues to fill the gaps and expand existing health care, particularly to low-income Americans."Despite vehement opposition to the Act from leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention, members of the liberal-leaning NCC also include seven other Baptist organizations, according to a list on the NCC's website. These are the Alliance of Baptists, American Baptist Churches in the USA, National Baptist Convention of America, Inc., National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., National Missionary Baptist Convention of America, and Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc.The Roman Catholic Church was the first to raise opposition to provisions of Obamacare stipulating that health insurance plans for hospitals and charities run by Catholics and other religious groups must subsidize contraceptives as preventive care.However, the Southern Baptist Convention soon chimed in with support for the Roman Catholic position. In a letter published on the Aquila Report website, two church leaders joined with the president/CEO of GuideStone Financial Services, health insurance provider for many Southern Baptists, to disparage Obamacare's contraception coverage as "a blatant and outrageous encroachment" on First Ament rights to religious freedom.Organizations close to these two churches have filed lawsuits based on this principal, as described by Reformation 21. Conversely, other members of the NCC include the African Methodist Episcopal Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, Armenian Church of America, Eastern and West Diocese, and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in the United States and Canada, according to the NCC.Also on the list are the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church Church of the Brethren, Community of Christ, Coptic Orthodox Archdiocese of North America, Ecumenical Catholic Communion, Episcopal Church (USA), Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, and Hungarian Reformed Church in America.Additional members are the International Council of Community Churches, Korea Presbyterian Church Abroad, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, American Diocese, Mar Thoma Church, Moravian Church in America, Northern and Southern Provinces, Orthodox Church in America, Patriarchal Parishes of the Russian Orthodox Church in the USA, Polish National Catholic Church, and Reformed Church in America.Others include the Religious Society of Friends, Friends United Meeting, Religious Society of Friends, Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, Serbian Orthodox Church in North and South America, Swedenborgian Church of North America, Syrian Orthodox Church of Antioch, Archdiocese of the Eastern United States, and Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA.
