But in Dell Rapids, Troop #40030 is doing something much sweeter this holiday season.\n\nSometimes big rewards come from small packages.\n\n\"We're doing a project to change the world, to give to the homeless people or to people who have to go to the pantry, because they don't have enough money,\" Girl Scout Rylee Bird said.\n\nTheir project is to make and collect items to help the needy in their hometown.\n\n\"Like toys, blankets, pillows, and food maybe,\" Girl Scout Quinn Becker said.\n\nThe girls are putting together 80 gift bags filled with those items and more. They'll be taken to the Storehouse Food Pantry in Dell Rapids where needy families pick up food for Christmas; and now a gift bag too.\n\n\"It's like giving a gift for someone on Christmas, they should be glad for it,\" Becker said.\n\n\"I hope those people are glad,\" Girl Scout Madisyn Kistler said.\n\n\"The girls initially wanted to walk the streets and pass out pillows and blankets and hot chocolate and offer the homeless a place to stay; one girl suggested we start building homes for them,\" Girl Scout Troop Leader Gennifer Randolph said.\n\nAfter deciding that was a little bit too ambitious, the girl scouts decided to have a more immediate impact this holiday.\n\n\"Through our journey books in girl scouts, they are encouraged to do a project to help change the world,\" Randolph said.\n\nThe girls got the idea after a homeless woman in Sioux Falls froze to death a couple of weeks ago.\n\n\"It was devastating that she had to die in that way, alone and cold and that just shouldn't happen to anybody,\" Randolph said.\n\nSo they're hoping the pillows and blankets will keep someone warm this winter. Their project may not change the world, but it's a start.\n\n\"Because that would make the world a better place,\" Girl Scout Syanne Randolph said.\n\nThe girl scouts will be dropping their collected items off at the Storehouse Food Pantry on December 20th.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "When most of us think of girl scouts, we probably think of those delicious girl scout cookies.
