The days of Winter are numbered and with that comes the excitement that Spring is in the air. Warmer weather drives many people outdoors to take part in a variety of fun filled activities.

"Spring kind of starts festival season, so we have a lot of festivals coming up in the near future," Executive Director of Council for the Arts Laura Carmichael said.

The real big kick-off to the festival season comes as the Threefoot building celebrates its birthday.

"We're really excited about the first weekend in April, which kicks off our big Spring festival downtown; The Threefoots Art Festival," said Carmichael.

In conjunction with the festival, Earth's Bounty will also start the 2016 Farmer's Market season.

"We're involved in every event that's going on and it's always something exciting," said Carmichael. "There's always something to do in Meridian, because there is so many different events and organizations who put a lot into our community."

With Jimmie Rodgers Festival, 59/20 Music Festival, and a variety other events to unfold over the coming months, the Council of Arts said there will be something to do for everyone.
