After having a civil lawsuit dismissed last week, and hopping into his first work in team drills Saturday afternoon, concerns about Galette now revolve more around his health and just what he could do as a pass-rushing complement to Ryan Kerrigan.\n\nGalette tore his left pectoral muscle while benching 365 pounds in June, when he was still with the New Orleans Saints. The weight rested on his chest after he heard his pec \u201cripping like a towel.\u201d A spotter helped push it off.\n\nGalette knew something was wrong. However, he took having full range of motion as a positive sign. The healing process became the question. Galette said he received three opinions from doctors. The Saints\u2018 doctor told Galette he needed surgery, according to Galette. Two other doctors said he did not.\n\nHe chose to rest and rehabilitate instead of opt for surgery, which he said would cause a five-month recovery process at a crucial point in his career. As the only faction to tell Galette he needed surgery, the Saints did not further themselves to him. Galette was a costly cut for the Saints seven weeks later.\n\n\u201cTrust factor was not there when you\u2019re telling me I need surgery,\u201d Galette said. \u201cIt is what it is. I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nGalette performed a lot of \u201cridiculous\u201d rehab. He upgraded the strength in his pec from around 80 percent last week to a hard \u201c93 percent\u201d on Saturday. Galette was so upset with how he was injured, he\u2019s gone away from the bench press with a full bar. He uses dumbbells now.\n\nHe also mentioned that the Redskins place a block on the chest of the bencher so the bar does not descend all the way to the chest, theoretically protecting a player from the sort of pectoral tear that befell Galette.\n\n\u201cI was benching [at] 7:30 in the morning,\u201d Galette said. \u201cWhy? Why am I doing that? Friday morning, on my day off \u2014 it makes no sense. Why am I doing that? Benching my day off, why? We don\u2019t do that here. If we bench heavy, there\u2019s going to be a block, which is amazing, you don\u2019t go all the way down. That\u2019s the smart way to lift.\u201d\n\nGalette was quick to temper criticism of his former team, opting instead to lavish more praise on the Redskins. He reiterated that he\u2019s been embraced since arriving, saying he was down and the Redskins have picked him up.\n\nHe had 12 sacks in 2013 and 10 more in 2014. Kerrigan had a career-high 13.5 sacks last season as the Saints\u2018 lone pass-rush threat. In the middle, Stephen Paea had six sacks last season with the Chicago Bears. Jason Hatcher, 33, had 11 sacks as recently as 2013, though he had just five last season, his first with the Redskins.\n\nGalette\u2019s speed, low-to-the-ground approach and flexibility are apparent even in practice. He said he can do splits both ways, and that his lateral movement and quickness are why he went from undrafted out of Stillman, a Division II college. He started his college career at Temple, but was suspended and chose to transfer prior to his senior year.\n\nThe Redskins have taken a chance on Galette.
