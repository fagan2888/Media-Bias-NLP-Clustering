Lightbourn Jr. Senior assistant district attorney Matt Patterson said Ortega-Brown was at a party before the shooting but left after there was a fistfight. Patterson said Ortega-Brown later returned and fired at people who had been involved in the altercation.\n\nUnder the plea, Ortega-Brown faces a sentence of nearly 19 years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 2.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Damieon Michael Ortega-Brown entered the plea Friday in Shawnee County District Court.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Kansas-man-pleads-guilty-in-deadly-drive-by-shooting-322605892.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Damieon+Michael+Ortega-Brown.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Damieon Michael Ortega-Brown entered the plea Friday in Shawnee County District Court.", "title": "Kansas man pleads guilty in deadly drive-by shooting"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Damieon Michael Ortega-Brown entered the plea Friday in Shawnee County District Court.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Kansas-man-pleads-guilty-in-deadly-drive-by-shooting-322605892.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Damieon+Michael+Ortega-Brown.jpg", "title": "Kansas man pleads guilty in deadly drive-by shooting", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Kansas man pleads guilty in deadly drive-by shooting", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Kansas man pleads guilty in"}, "article_summary": "A 20-year-old man has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in a drive-by shooting in Topeka.\nHe also pleaded guilty to criminal discharge of a firearm at an occupied dwelling or vehicle, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\nUnder the plea, Ortega-Brown faces a sentence of nearly 19 years in prison.\nThe Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Damieon Michael Ortega-Brown entered the plea Friday in Shawnee County District Court.\nPatterson said Ortega-Brown later returned and fired at people who had been involved in the altercation."}
