He warned Gergan to be \"cautious\" when discussing the hearing with Ginsburg, who was a lawyer for the ACLU before President Jimmy Carter appointed her to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Circuit.\n\n\u201cJudge Ginsburg views the White House\u2019s interest and her interests as being at odds with each other,\" Klain wrote. \"She sees us as having a stake in presenting her as a moderate and in getting along well with the Senate; she sees her interest as \u2018being herself,\u2019 preserving her \u2018dignity,\u2019 and promoting her \u2018independence.\u2019\u201d\n\nGinsburg would be approved by the senate in a 96-3 vote, and has been one of the more liberal justices serving on the court during her almost 21 years of service.\n\nAs a Supreme Court Justice, she is known to protect women's rights and the rights of the disadvantaged. Ginsburg \u2014 whose fans call her the \"Notorious RBG\" \u2014 is the most frequent liberal lone dissenter on the court. Her dissent in the recent case involving the birth control coverage mandate in Obamacare got an unusual amount of media coverage and was even turned into a song.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Allan Smith", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Clinton aide thought she might have some trouble in her confirmation hearings.", "creator": "akarl_smith", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/clinton-white-house-papers-reveal-criticisms-of-ruth-bader-ginsburg-2014-7", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/53cd37d56bb3f7c205b608a7-506-253/top-clinton-aide-warned-that-ruth-bader-ginsburg-defended-extreme-liberal-views.jpg", "title": "Top Clinton Aide Warned That Ruth Bader Ginsburg Defended 'Extreme Liberal Views'", "site": "bi_politics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Politics, Law & Order Select, Supreme Court, Bill Clinton, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Allan Smith,", "description": "Clinton aide thought she might have some trouble in her confirmation hearings.", "author": "Allan Smith", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-21", "sailthru.title": "Top Clinton Aide Warned That Ruth Bader Ginsburg Defended 'Extreme Liberal Views'", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/53cd37c769bedd08208b4567-50-50/top-clinton-aide-warned-that-ruth-bader-ginsburg-defended-extreme-liberal-views.jpg", "news_keywords": "Politics, Law & Order Select, Supreme Court, Bill Clinton, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Allan Smith,", "tbi-image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/53cd37c769bedd08208b4567/top-clinton-aide-warned-that-ruth-bader-ginsburg-defended-extreme-liberal-views.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2014-07-21", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/allan-smith"}, "sailthru.description": "Clinton aide thought she might have some trouble in her confirmation hearings.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Clinton aide thought she might have some trouble in her confirmation hearings.", "title": "Top Clinton Aide Warned That Ruth Bader Ginsburg Defended 'Extreme Liberal Views'", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/clinton-white-house-papers-reveal-criticisms-of-ruth-bader-ginsburg-2014-7", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/53cd37d56bb3f7c205b608a7-1190-625/top-clinton-aide-warned-that-ruth-bader-ginsburg-defended-extreme-liberal-views.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Top Clinton Aide Warned That Ruth Bader Ginsburg Defended 'Extreme Liberal Views'", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/53cd37c769bedd08208b4567/top-clinton-aide-warned-that-ruth-bader-ginsburg-defended-extreme-liberal-views.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics"}, "article_summary": "\u201cJudge Ginsburg views the White House\u2019s interest and her interests as being at odds with each other,\" Klain wrote.\nThe memo, which then-associate White House counsel Ronald Klain wrote to Clinton top adviser David Gergen, also said Ginsburg \"relishes defending the ACLU as an institution, and its importance in American society.\"\nGinsburg \u2014 whose fans call her the \"Notorious RBG\" \u2014 is the most frequent liberal lone dissenter on the court.\nThe National Archives released 1,000 pages of Clinton-era memos and speeches on Friday that had not been public, including a memo called \u201cJudge Ginsburg: Performance Pitfalls.\u201dThat memo warned President Bill Clinton that now-Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has a tendency \"for defending some rather extreme liberal views,\" National Law Journal reports.\nAs a Supreme Court Justice, she is known to protect women's rights and the rights of the disadvantaged."}
