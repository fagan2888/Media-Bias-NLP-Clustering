President Jill Hoggard Green says the hospital has been near 90-percent capacity for the last nine days.

Despite being at near capacity the hospital says it's emergency room is working to help patients.

The hospital says it is providing emergency care and will always serve anyone experiencing a medical emergency.



The hospital continued, "we will continue to implement action plans to assure that we have the staffing we need to meet this continuing challenge."

The number of patients in the hospital started climbing on Feb. 20 and the traffic has remained steady. Hoggard Green said hospital managers are not sure what's behind the surge in patients.
