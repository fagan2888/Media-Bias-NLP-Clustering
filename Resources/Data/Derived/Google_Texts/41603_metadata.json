Texas Sen. Ted Cruz vowed to scrap the Iran deal. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson reminded voters in his closing remarks of the professional background that separates him from the rest: \u201cI\u2019m the only one to separate Siamese twins.\u201d\n\n\n\nThroughout the debate, Donald Trump was the unrivaled lightning rod, but the prime-time showdown made clear he\u2019s not the only fighter on the stage \u2013 or in the race.\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie reclaimed his reputation as a tough-talking executive, blasting his rivals for their positions on domestic surveillance and entitlements. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul traded barbs with several candidates, including Christie.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, one-time front-runner former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush found himself on defense several times and largely avoided tangling with Trump on the Fox News/Facebook stage.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most fiery moment came in an exchange between Christie and Paul. Long-simmering tension between the two exploded when Christie stood by his criticism of the senator for opposing NSA bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone data.\n\n\n\nPaul said he\u2019s \u201cproud of standing for the Bill of Rights,\u201d but Christie called his stance \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d \u2013 suggesting he wants to cherry-pick only some data.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re sitting in the subcommittee just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that,\u201d Christie said.\n\n\n\nPaul fired back: \u201cI know you gave [President Obama] a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go ahead.\u201d Christie said the hugs he gave were to the families of 9/11 victims, and then accused Paul of playing \u201cpolitics,\u201d by using videos of floor speeches to raise money.\n\n\n\nThe exchange was striking, even in a debate that was tense from the start. Though several rivals stood out, Trump did not hold his fire, either \u2013 making clear he\u2019s not softening his approach to campaigning as he picks up steam in the polls.\n\n\n\nIf anything, the debate signaled the primary race is about to get tougher and is still wide open as 17 candidates vie for the lead with months to go until the opening contests.\n\n\n\nTrump, the billionaire businessman front-runner, sparred at the outset of the debate with Paul after refusing to pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee if it\u2019s not him and to swear off an independent run.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will not make the pledge at this time,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\n\nPaul accused him of \u201chedging his bet on the Clintons.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already hedging his bets, because he\u2019s used to buying politicians,\u201d Paul said. (Trump later acknowledged he gave money to the Clintons and demanded Hillary Clinton \u201cbe at my wedding\u201d in exchange; he called this a sign of a broken system.)\n\n\n\nTrump also stood firm on his vow to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about illegal immigration,\u201d Trump said, blasting \u201cstupid leaders\u201d in the U.S. harboring illegal immigrants.\n\n\n\nBush said a comprehensive solution is needed, including a \u201cpath to earned legal status,\u201d which he said is not \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\n\n\nMoments later, Cruz said some on stage support \u201camnesty\u201d, while he does not.\n\n\n\nA big question going into the debate was whether Bush would aggressively challenge Trump and try to knock him off his perch.\n\n\n\nBut he would only go so far as to question Trump\u2019s tone, calling his language \u201cdivisive.\u201d Hours before the debate, Politico ran a story saying Bush recently told a donor he thinks Trump is a \u201cbuffoon\u201d and a \u201cclown.\u201d Asked about that report on stage, Bush denied it.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Bush said.\n\n\n\nTrump then called Bush a \u201ctrue gentleman.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs for his tone, Trump said it\u2019s \u201cmedieval times\u201d in the Middle East, and, \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for tone.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut other candidates were able to stand out on the crowded stage. Carson called Hillary Clinton the \u201cepitome\u201d of the progressive movement.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe counts on the fact that people are uninformed. The Alinsky model, taking advantage of useful idiots,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nWalker also blasted the Iran nuclear deal, as did other candidates: \u201cThis is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS, it is tied together and once and for all we need a leader who is going to do something about it. It is yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio landed laughs when, upon being asked about his faith in God, he said: \u201cI think God has blessed us, he\u2019s blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates. The Democrats can\u2019t even find one.\u201d\n\n\n\nRubio also vowed to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and called the lack of accountability after the Veterans Affairs scandal \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee vowed to defend entitlements and stood his ground on social issues. He blasted Planned Parenthood and defended his pro-life views, accusing abortion providers of \u201cselling\u201d fetal parts \u201clike they\u2019re parts to a Buick.\u201d\n\n\n\nKasich, like Walker and Bush, tried to keep the focus on his record in his state.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmerica is a miracle country and we have to restore the sense that the miracle will apply to you,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAnd Cruz vowed, if elected, to prosecute Planned Parenthood, cancel the Iran nuclear deal and nix Obama\u2019s executive orders. \u201cI believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nTrump was challenged several times on his conservative views. He previously was pro-choice, but said he\u2019s \u201cevolved\u201d on the issue.\n\n\n\nAlso, under questioning from moderator Megyn Kelly about past disparaging comments he made about women, Trump interrupted to say, \u201cOnly Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\u201d He then said, \u201cHonestly, Megyn, if you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe candidates squared off at the second of two kick-off debates, hosted by Fox News and Facebook in conjunction with the Ohio Republican Party.\n\n\n\nThe seven other Republican hopefuls spent much of the first debate doing their best to hammer home the message that Clinton represents four more years of Obama. In the earlier debate, the candidates largely avoided sparring with each other and instead trained their fire on the Obama years -- with promises to roll back ObamaCare and undo the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nMore On This...
