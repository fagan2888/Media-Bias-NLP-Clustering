So extrapolating to the roughly 75,000 illegal immigrants that a 2011 Pew Center study determined lived in Oklahoma, the figure of state\u2019s immigrants benefiting from the Obama order is about 25,000.\n\nSteven Camarota, director of Research for the Center for Immigration Studies, said exact state and national figures are hard to come by since the people are not here legally.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to believe the distribution will be different state by state from national figures,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really a guestimate.\u201d\n\nThe real question is what all those new immigrants will cost taxpayers. The costs depends on a number of factors, including whether the immigrants benefiting from the order also will receive entitlement benefits like welfare, Affordable Care Act subsidies and Medicaid.\n\nRector\u2019s study shows the average illegal immigrant household, defined at 3.7 people, receive a net of about $14,000 in taxpayer-funded benefits more than the taxes they pay before the executive order.\n\n\u201cIn 2010, the average unlawful immigrant household received around $24,721 in government benefits and services while paying some $10,334 in taxes,\u201d the study said, including public education, infrastructure and other services as taxpayer-funded benefits.\n\nBut the study shows legalization initially will lower that net household benefits draw to about $11,000 a household a year because protected immigrants will be able to get better paying jobs and pay more taxes, and the government will be able to better collect taxes on jobs that are currently paid \u201cunder the table\u201d in cash.\n\nBut that equation flips around if the immigrants qualify for benefits like welfare, ACA subsidies and tax credits, the study shows. The net cost of those households would be $28,000 a year or in Oklahoma about $189 million a year, multiplying the Heritage study household estimates by the average illegal immigrant households in the state.\n\nNationwide, the Heritage study said the immigrants protected by the executive order would receive $9.4 trillion benefits but pay only $3.1 trillion in taxes over their lives.\n\n\u201cThese costs would have to be borne by already overburdened U.S. taxpayers,\u201d the study says.\n\nBut Oklahoma officials haven\u2019t started estimating the costs.\n\n\u201cConsidering that it\u2019s not even a day old yet, no\u201d the state hasn\u2019t figured out the costs, wrote John Estus, spokesman for the Oklahoma Management and Enterprise services in an email last week.\n\nRector said it\u2019s nearly impossible to imagine that the newly legal immigrants won\u2019t eventually receive additional benefits because programs like the ACA depend on full participation and Americans won\u2019t allow people to suffer in poverty without some assistance.\n\n\u201cHow can Congress say you can stay but we\u2019re not going to give you access to medical care, food stamps,\u201d Rector said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "25,000 Oklahoma illegal immigrants could get benefits under amnesty but the costs depend on which benefits are granted.", "title": "25,000 Oklahoma illegals could benefit from executive order but costs unknown - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/RobertRector-e1416608386890.png", "updated_time": "2014-11-28T10:49:34+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/184124/25000-oklahoma-illegals-could-benefit-from-executive-order-but-costs-unknown/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Immigration", "tag": "amnesty,Oklahoma,Taxpayers,welfare", "published_time": "2014-11-28T04:00:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-28T10:49:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "25,000 Oklahoma illegal immigrants could get benefits under amnesty but the costs depend on which benefits are granted.", "title": "25,000 Oklahoma illegals could benefit from executive order but costs unknown - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/obama-whitehouse-photo.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "25,000 Oklahoma illegal immigrants could get benefits under amnesty but the costs depend on which benefits are granted."}, "article_summary": "So extrapolating to the roughly 75,000 illegal immigrants that a 2011 Pew Center study determined lived in Oklahoma, the figure of state\u2019s immigrants benefiting from the Obama order is about 25,000.\nNationwide, the Heritage study said the immigrants protected by the executive order would receive $9.4 trillion benefits but pay only $3.1 trillion in taxes over their lives.\nThe costs depends on a number of factors, including whether the immigrants benefiting from the order also will receive entitlement benefits like welfare, Affordable Care Act subsidies and Medicaid.\nObama said the newly nondeportable will not get benefits under his order, but critics say it\u2019s tough to see how they will not eventually qualify for entitlements.\nBut that equation flips around if the immigrants qualify for benefits like welfare, ACA subsidies and tax credits, the study shows."}
