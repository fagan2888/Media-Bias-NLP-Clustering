A Florida cop reportedly used a tazer on an unarmed driver moments after he emerged from his vehicle.

According to World Star Hip-Hop, the incident occurred in Bradford County. The report states that the man approached the police officer in an “aggressive” manner, which is why the cop responded by tazing him without any advance warning.

In the video, the police officer is heard calling in the driver’s information — including his license plate. The driver’s door remained open. Moments later, the driver hopped out of the car and headed towards the officer.

The driver mentions something about “godd-mn lights” as he walks towards the police officer moments before he is shot with the tazer and quickly falls to the ground.
