The most drama the audience can hope for is a candidate forgetting to wear the obligatory American flag lapel pin. If we\u2019re really lucky, we might get a comedic Internet meme out of the deal (remember those \u201cbinders full of women\u201d?)\n\nRest assured, writer/director Luke Mullan\u2019s Up for Debate brings way more laughs than your average political debate, as well as more pressing concerns for the audience. Surely that candidate isn\u2019t planning to actually use that shotgun he\u2019s toting, right?\n\nThis one-act play stages a debate between three candidates seeking to represent Idaho in the US Congress. There\u2019s John W. Wallace, a Reaganite Republican in a red power tie who believes that bad puns are the key to connecting with the \u201cyounger generation.\u201d Then there\u2019s Kevin Sampson, a Zach Galifianakis-type member of that millennial generation who has temporarily quit playing Call of Duty in his mother\u2019s basement in order to represent the Libertarian party.\n\nFinally there is protagonist Ivan Chekovitch, who represents the \u201cSocialist Democratic Republican People\u2019s Party for the Cure.\u201d Or, at least, he would be speaking for that party if he could stop having musical flashbacks of his formative years in Soviet Russia. All three candidates are reined in (barely) by a straight man moderator played with just the right amount of exasperation by Phillip Kiley.\n\n\n\nUp for Debate\n\nWritten and directed by Luke Mullan\n\nMusic by Brian Claeys\n\nDetails and tickets Written and directed by Luke MullanMusic by Brian Claeys\n\nThese are not characters so much as caricatures. As Chekovitch, Jack Cashmere puts on a Boris Badenov accent and refers to himself in the third person. Republican candidate Wallace kisses babies and attempts to spout Bible verses. John Leach\u2019s amusingly lackadaisical Sampson plays to the stereotype of millennials as self-absorbed and utterly clueless about history. There\u2019s no character depth here, but also no real need for it. The stereotypes alone are enough to keep the audience laughing as the debaters address political hot topics such as NSA surveillance, Social Security, food stamps, and the Affordable Care Act. And if the candidates\u2019 reactions occasionally feel trite and unoriginal, that\u2019s to be expected: the show\u2019s blurb did promise \u201chot takes.\u201d\n\nHave I mentioned the musical numbers? Although the show is in fact properly billed as a comedy rather than a musical, it includes several musical moments, most notably Joseph Cooney\u2019s rousing opening number, \u201cI\u2019d-A-Go to Idaho.\u201d The talented Brian Claeys provides a lively piano soundtrack that underscores and often provides the punchline to the play\u2019s jokes.\n\nThe young cast\u2014most are recent graduates of Gonzaga College High School\u2014is enthusiastic and fun to watch, although there were a few noticeable breaks in character and moments where the comedic timing didn\u2019t gel. There are numerous running gags, many of which work (what DO you call citizens of Idaho?), but some that take a moderately funny bit too far. A recurring joke about a train accident eventually went off the rails (sorry, couldn\u2019t resist). There are moments when Mullan has written and staged absurdity above and beyond the play\u2019s already zany standard. During those moments the play feels overblown and too ridiculous, jolting the audience from what had previously been a humorous, sometimes hilarious, ride.\n\nUp for Debate holds a funhouse mirror up to the nature of politics. Check it out, if only to reassure yourself that our real-life candidates are not (quite) that crazy.\n\nTake me back to the DC Capital Fringe Guide", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "DC Theatre Scene", "description": "For the average Joe there\u2019s typically not much excitement in the world of televised political debates.
