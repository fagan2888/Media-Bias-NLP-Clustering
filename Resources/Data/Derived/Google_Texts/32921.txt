PEORIA — A Peoria man was sentenced Thursday to 15 years in prison for abusing a toddler in July 2012.



Eddie L. Patton, 29, was emotional when he addressed Chief Circuit Judge Steve Kouri, saying he needed to be there for his children. Patton, whose court file lists no address, maintained he didn’t injure the child on July 30, 2012. He also indicated he had problems with his plea deal, which capped any prison term at 15 years. Aggravated battery to a child has a 30-year maximum sentence.



Kouri noted things could have been far worse.



“But for 20 minutes, we would have been here on a murder charge,” the judge told Patton, referring to anticipated testimony from a doctor indicating that had the boy been treated 20 minutes later, he could have died.



The judge also noted the strong family support as evident by letters and nearly a dozen people in the courtroom. But Kouri said, “you are a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” type of person.



“Either you can’t control your anger or you don’t want to,” he added.



When Patton pleaded guilty last summer, prosecutors told Kouri that Patton was watching his girlfriend’s son July 30 when he had a potty training accident. Another relative stopped by, noticed the boy looked ill and took him to the hospital.



There, doctors found the boy, then 2, suffering from a severely lacerated liver, a broken clavicle, damage to both his pancreas and spleen as well as has having bruises all over his body. The boy suffered from heavy internal bleeding.



Under state law, Patton must serve at least 85 percent of his sentence, meaning that with credit for time served, he’ll be in prison for about 12 years.
