Seven years later, Abbott, who leads the Iowa state council of the Communications Workers of America, is warring against the president, trying to stymie an Obama trade deal he believes will devastate organized labor. This summer, when Hillary Clinton wouldn\u2019t take up that cause, he decided to back Bernie Sanders. After Obama, he says, \u201cThe lack of a commitment is a red flag.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople feel betrayed by President Obama,\u201d agrees Mark Cooper, the president of the South Central Iowa Federation of Labor. \u201cI think that\u2019s why Bernie\u2019s getting the traction he has.\u201d\n\nFor a swathe of local union activists and national labor leaders, the Obama experience casts a queasy shadow over the 2016 race. The president, whom organized labor went all out to elect and re-elect, has done big things that unions wanted\u2014like overhauling healthcare and financial regulation, assisting reeling auto giants, and moving to expand the reach of overtime. At least as important, union leaders believe his veto pen has been a bulwark, stopping congressional Republicans from doing nationally what Scott Walker did in Wisconsin. But Obama\u2019s proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership pact, which unions contend endangers jobs, wages, and regulations, is only the latest in a series of bitter disappointments for organized labor, from the labor law reform the president showed little interest in fighting for, to the union-sought Obamacare changes he rebuffed, to safety regulations that were scrapped or languished, to his stances on energy, education reform, and Social Security.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people want a third term of Obama, which is what the Hillary candidacy represents.\u201d RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director National Nurses United\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people want a third term of Obama, which is what the Hillary candidacy represents,\u201d says National Nurses United executive director RoseAnn DeMoro, whose union is hosting a \u201cBrunch With Bernie\u201d Monday afternoon. Union leaders who embrace Clinton without getting commitments on issues like trade, argues DeMoro, are repeating the same mistakes made with Obama. \u201cWhy would she have to change anything,\" she asks, \"because she\u2019s saying nothing, and they\u2019re saying, \u2018Go Hillary!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last seven or eight years has just hardened me up and told me you can\u2019t play the game,\u201d says Amalgamated Transit Union president Larry Hanley, who endorsed Clinton in the 2008 primary. Like DeMoro, he believes unions have been too focused on getting access to politicians and not enough on building a mass movement that can keep them from straying. Interviewed in his office last month, he gestured at the wall: \u201cThere\u2019s my picture with Obama at the Christmas party, but I didn\u2019t get a f--king thing done. But nothing\u2019s happened\u2014the country\u2019s still going to hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the lesson we got out of this administration in terms of Hillary Clinton is: Slow down,\u201d says Greg Junemann, the president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, who compares endorsing a candidate before they\u2019ve made concrete commitments to tipping a cab driver before they\u2019ve given you a ride. \u201cLook at the record on labor\u2014don\u2019t just listen to the speech.\u201d\n\nOther disappointed union leaders say they have studied the record, and it shows they were right to prefer Hillary all along. \u201cI am ready for a president who\u2019s got some experience,\u201d says International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers president Tom Buffenbarger, who endorsed Clinton in 2008 and (while his union hasn\u2019t yet endorsed) is supporting her again for 2016. Obama said plenty about how pro-union he\u2019d be during the 2008 campaign, argues Buffenbarger, and then \u201cforgot all about helping workers organize.\u201d So he doesn\u2019t see much point in holding off on endorsements until candidates make the right promises: \u201cI don\u2019t know that that worked out so well, those commitments.\u201d Better, he says, to get behind someone with a pro-labor record, like Clinton.\n\nAmerican Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten, whose national union was the first (and so far only) to endorse a 2016 candidate, also says Clinton\u2019s earned her confidence. \u201cShe had very different positions in 2008 than President Obama did on issues like testing, on issues like merit pay, on issues like making sure that there was high quality public education for all students,\u201d Weingarten told Bloomberg last month when asked about how Clinton would stack up against the current president. \u201cThis is not about Barack Obama\u2014this about who is going to make public education what it ought to be for all kids.\u201d\n\nNational Association of Letter Carriers president Fredric Rolando, who says it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d to get members excited about Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election while fighting his plans to cut postal service, says he\u2019s \u201creally pretty comfortable\u201d with Clinton, as well as with the rivals running to her left. Electability, he argues, has to be paramount. \u201cIf she\u2019s not saying something that maybe I wish she were saying, I get it,\u201d he told Bloomberg. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, but I get it\u2026 I know she\u2019s got our back.\u201d\n\nSome of the union presidents opposing Obama's trade agenda take a sunnier view of his overall record. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to agree on everything,\u201d says American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees president Lee Saunders, who chairs the AFL-CIO\u2019s political committee. \u201cFor the most part, I think that they stood with working families.\u201d\n\nBut the discontent is long-standing, and widespread. \u201cWhat I really saw at the AFL-CIO was this incredible frustration on the part of many prominent national leaders of affiliate unions that after everything that organized labor had done for the Democrats\u2026they could get a meeting\u2014they couldn\u2019t get anything policy-wise out of it, even when the Democrats controlled the Congress,\u201d says Glenn Perusek, who directed the AFL-CIO\u2019s Center for Strategic Research from 2010 to 2013, and now consults for unions. That predicament goes beyond Obama or Clinton, who\u2019s backed labor law reform, paid sick leave, and a higher minimum wage, but declined union calls to oppose the TPP, endorse a $15 wage floor, or back reinstating Glass-Steagall financial regulation. \u201cWhen you accept the premises of the situation,\" says Perusek, \"that organized labor is a partner within the Democratic Party, a junior party that is, let\u2019s face it, ever weaker\u2014the prime concern has to be keeping a Democrat in the White House. It\u2019s a backstop given that you\u2019ve got a Republican Congress.\u201d\n\nThat fear of unified Republican control helps explain why even Clinton\u2019s strongest labor critics are prepared to get out the vote for her if \u2013 as remains overwhelmingly likely \u2013 she becomes the Democratic nominee. Few doubt that the AFL-CIO, a federation of 56 unions which requires two-thirds support to make an endorsement, will ultimately back Clinton, even if it holds off until the primary is over. By then, labor officials expect she\u2019ll have rounded up a slew of national unions\u2019 endorsements, even as some withhold their support in hopes of dragging her in their direction, and a handful endorse Sanders in hopes of fomenting a lasting left-wing movement.\n\nInterviewed in Altoona after helping moderate an Iowa AFL-CIO presidential forum that Clinton declined to attend, AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka told Bloomberg it\u2019s \u201cnot impossible\u201d for the AFL-CIO to endorse a candidate who doesn\u2019t oppose the trade deal unions despise, but warned that such a candidate would have \u201ca tough time energizing people\u201d in the general election. Trumka said Obama has \u201cdone a lot of good,\u201d and would\u2019ve done much more if not for congressional Republicans. But he said he worries that, if the president gets his way on the TPP, \u201chis legacy will be that he helped send [away] more jobs, more factories, and lower American wages.\u201d\n\nOn trade, Trumka said, \u201cI believed what he said when he ran.\u201d The AFL-CIO president, who took office in 2009, argued the federation is now taking a more \u201cissue-oriented\u201d approach to this election cycle, making clear early on that \u201craising wages\u201d would be the standard on which every candidate was judged. And, with a laugh, he cited an old saw: \u201cIf you\u2019re a rational human being and you don\u2019t take life\u2019s experience to learn from, to guide you into the future, then I go back to that definition of insanity where you do the same thing over and over and over again, and expect a different result.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Josh Eidelson", "description": "Disgruntled with the current president, some union members are looking for\u00a0a new approach.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "Disgruntled with the current president, some union members are looking for\u00a0a new approach.", "title": "How Obama Hurts Clinton (and Helps Sanders) With Unions", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-10/how-obama-hurts-clinton-and-helps-sanders-with-unions", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/imaMDQ.1OI60/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Disgruntled with the current president, some union members are looking for\u00a0a new approach.", "title": "How Obama Hurts Clinton (and Helps Sanders) With Unions", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-10/how-obama-hurts-clinton-and-helps-sanders-with-unions", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/imaMDQ.1OI60/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"status": "Disgruntled with the current president, some union members are looking for\u00a0a new approach."}, "parsely-title": "How Obama Hurts Clinton (and Helps Sanders) With Unions", "parsely-tags": "Labor,Barack H Obama,Labor Relations,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "NSUZO36S972G01", "parsely-author": "Josh Eidelson", "date": "2015-08-10T09:00:03.993Z", "keywords": "Labor,Barack H Obama,Labor Relations", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Labor,Barack H Obama,Labor Relations", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-10T09:00:03.993Z", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/imaMDQ.1OI60/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-10/how-obama-hurts-clinton-and-helps-sanders-with-unions"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda788\"", "article_summary": "After Obama, he says, \u201cThe lack of a commitment is a red flag.\u201d\u201cPeople feel betrayed by President Obama,\u201d agrees Mark Cooper, the president of the South Central Iowa Federation of Labor.\nUnion leaders who embrace Clinton without getting commitments on issues like trade, argues DeMoro, are repeating the same mistakes made with Obama.\nThis summer, when Hillary Clinton wouldn\u2019t take up that cause, he decided to back Bernie Sanders.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why Bernie\u2019s getting the traction he has.\u201dFor a swathe of local union activists and national labor leaders, the Obama experience casts a queasy shadow over the 2016 race.\nTrumka said Obama has \u201cdone a lot of good,\u201d and would\u2019ve done much more if not for congressional Republicans."}
