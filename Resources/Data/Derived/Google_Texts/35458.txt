The major averages ended up more than 1% on a sharp rebound in oil prices.

The Nasdaq rose 1.5%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each climbed 1.4%, ending near intraday highs. But volume was lower across the board in the stock market today.

Food and dairy products were among the day’s biggest decliners after Dean Foods (DF) plummeted almost 8% following a disappointing quarterly earnings report. The stock ended below a 19.51 buy point of a cup-shaped base after being up as much as 9%.
