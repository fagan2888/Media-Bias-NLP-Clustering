Some skeptics might say that\u2019s an oxymoron in itself. But look, lacrosse is legit. The world\u2019s best teams are in the Denver area this week, and Rabil might be the best player on the best team. Thursday at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Park, Rabil netted a hat trick with two assists in a 22-3 clobbering of Australia (they went for two after the third touchdown). This was the semifinals of the FIL World Lacrosse Championships, and Rabil will be No. 99 in red, white and blue in Saturday\u2019s title game.\n\nRabil, 28, is one of those dudes who just separates himself. You know those athletes. You could be watching some strange sport for the first time and be like \u2014 yep, that guy in the glasses is clearly the best quidditch player out there. Minutes into Thursday\u2019s lacrosse game, Rabil soared before he scored. The 6-foot-3 tree darted toward the goal from the left wing and then just feet from the goalie he faked low and basically just placed the ball over the helpless man\u2019s mask, like an older sibling teasing baby bro in the backyard.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be the best ever, and he\u2019s on his way,\u201d said U.S. goalie Jesse Schwartzman, who also plays for the Denver Outlaws. \u201cHe\u2019s an animal. And it\u2019s not just the way he plays, it\u2019s the way he trains, it\u2019s the way he practices. He\u2019s the hardest worker I\u2019ve ever been around \u2014 in the weight room, on the field, running, reading books, watching film. He\u2019s a super-competitive dude. And he puts the team before everything, and that\u2019s what\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nRabil\u2019s a rebel. He plays brazenly. Lacrosse publications have said he shoots 112 miles per hour and is on pace to be the sport\u2019s first million-dollar player. And that face? He\u2019s lacrosse\u2019s Don Draper. He sort of looks like the \u201cmimbo\u201d from that one \u201cSeinfeld\u201d episode. He had long hair and didn\u2019t care; now he\u2019s got this Mohawk-mullet that we Costanzas couldn\u2019t pull off. His braggadocio is swaggadocio.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s wicked-awesome,\u201d super fan Darci Becker said from the stands. \u201cHis speed, he\u2019s got moves, he swims \u2014 when he\u2019s being defended, his arm swims right over his defenders and he just gets in there.\u201d\n\nLacrosse needs this guy. And lacrosse needs this guy out there more. He\u2019s the type of transcendent athlete who can inspire those who admire. He won MVP of this quadrennial tournament in 2010 and very well could win the honors again Saturday. You watch these games at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Park, thousands of young people in their Such And Such High Lacrosse T-shirts and flamboyant neon shorts, and you know that lacrosse isn\u2019t just this niche thing that the rich kid down the street plays. This is a game for the next generation. But it\u2019s pretty boring on TV. And it\u2019s hard to pick out personality off the screen. Hopefully for this sport, Rabil will be a name we start knowing, a la Clint Dempsey from a month ago.\n\n\u201cLacrosse is our passion; it\u2019s in our soul,\u201d Rabil, who plays for the Boston Cannons in Major League Lacrosse, said after Thursday\u2019s win for his country. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to put into words how this moment feels, this tournament feels, this opportunity feels \u2014 it means the world to us. The level of passion this team has, and they way we\u2019ve gone about this whole process, has been nothing short of brilliant.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10d7\"", "article_summary": "The world\u2019s best teams are in the Denver area this week, and Rabil might be the best player on the best team.\n\u201cLacrosse is our passion; it\u2019s in our soul,\u201d Rabil, who plays for the Boston Cannons in Major League Lacrosse, said after Thursday\u2019s win for his country.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the way he plays, it\u2019s the way he trains, it\u2019s the way he practices.\nCOMMERCE CITY \u2014 The face of U.S. lacrosse has eye black smeared, a purposely-forgot-to-shave beard and a haircut that\u2019s just weird.\nThis was the semifinals of the FIL World Lacrosse Championships, and Rabil will be No."}
