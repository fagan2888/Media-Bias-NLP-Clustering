Keeping a lit menorah in the window is part of the Hanukkah tradition of sharing the light.\n\n\"It's about bringing light to the world and creating a sense of community,\" she said. \"People really look forward to it each year.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecky O'Brien, who lives in Lafayette, said this was the first year she made it to the event \u2014 in previous years, the event was on a school night, the weather was bad or conflicted with other events.\n\n\"All the stars aligned this year,\" she said.\n\nAlong with celebrating the first night of Hanukkah with the community, she said, she was drawn by the promise of latkes.\n\n\"You can't have too many latkes,\" she said.\n\nRon Werner of HW Homes lights the menorah for the Hanukkah on Pearl Street Mall celebration on the first day of Hanukkah Sunday.
