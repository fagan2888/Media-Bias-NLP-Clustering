EDITOR: I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the village of Weston trustee position vacated by the resignation of Sharon Jaeger.

I have been a Weston resident since 1990. In the last 25 years, I have been involved in the community as a volunteer for many youth organizations, such as D.C. Everest community education, Everest Youth Football Leage and Everest Youth Little League. Currently I am a citizen member of the Village Personnel Committee.

I have budgetary, planning, project management and hiring experience within my work resume. I’ve been attending Village Board meetings regularly for the last 15 months.

I promise to represent village residents by coming to every meeting informed and prepared.

Let’s continue to make Weston the best place to live and work in central Wisconsin!

Don Penza,

Weston
