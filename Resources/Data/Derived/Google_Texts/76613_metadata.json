But unlike the numbers that dial him back to his childhood, Thomas spends every day as an adult wishing he could forget 94667.\n\nIt\u2019s his inmate number.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I still have that DOC number,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m owned by the state, still.\u201d\n\nThomas was 17 when he was convicted of one count of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Now, 17 years after he was convicted and 12 years after he completed his sentence, Thomas is seeking a pardon for his crime.\n\nBut more than two years after Gov. John Hickenlooper ordered the re-creation of the Executive Clemency Advisory Board, meant to review requests and make recommendations for pardons or commutations of a sentence, the board has yet to review a single application.\n\nThe board has never met. Only on Monday did Hickenlooper fill all seven seats on the board he created in October 2012.\n\n\u201cI expected to get an answer back within 10 days,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt\u2019s been months.\u201d\n\nAbout 150 applications have been submitted since 2012, said Stephanie Donner, chief legal counsel for the governor. Not all of those applications are ready to be reviewed by the board, but Donner did not know how many were ready to be considered.\n\nThomas\u2019 pardon request was first reported by Law Week Colorado in August.\n\nColorado governors have issued dozens of pardons during their time in office, but doing so can be politically controversial, and it is not uncommon for governors to wait until the end of their terms to grant them. Hickenlooper can review and grant pardons without the board, but Donner said he values input from experts in various fields when making these decisions.\n\nThe governor has not yet granted any pardons.\n\nSurprising review\n\nThe Arapahoe County district attorney\u2019s office, which prosecuted Thomas in 1997, reviewed his application and sent a letter recommending a pardon back to the clemency board. Applications for pardons are reviewed by the district attorney before being reviewed by the board.\n\nChief Deputy District Attorney John Hower, who successfully prosecuted two of Colorado\u2019s three death row inmates, was asked to review Thomas\u2019 application. What he found surprised him.\n\n\u201cWe often see defendants and prisoners say they are sorry, but it\u2019s hard to tell if they are really sorry for what they did or if they are just sorry they got caught,\u201d Hower said. \u201cThere was simply no attempt (by Thomas) to evade full responsibility.\u201d\n\nHower reached out to Christopher Town, the man whom Thomas pistol-whipped after he thought he snitched on him to police. Hower found Town in the Wyoming State Penitentiary serving 75 years to life for shooting and killing his estranged wife.\n\n\u201cI forgave him a long time ago,\u201d Town told Hower. \u201cI believe everyone should have a second chance, and I hope someone will think that about me someday.\u201d\n\nThomas, now 35, speaks about his journey in a confident cadence more familiar to a pregame motivational speech than a story of redemption.\n\nThomas met with Hower this past summer and described growing up in Aurora, where he went to high school and started dabbling in dealings he should have avoided. In 1997 Thomas was sentenced to five years in the Youth Offender System for hitting Town.\n\nOften the only person who could read his podmates\u2019 letters, Thomas quickly decided to take advantage of what opportunities he had.\n\n\u201cI just started to really count my blessings and started to realize how fortunate I was,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nFrom there, the teenager who claimed he didn\u2019t like school began what would be a 12-year academic journey, earning his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees before going after his doctorate. Twelve years to the day after Thomas finished serving his parole, he graduated with his doctorate in health sciences.\n\nHis wife, Jaymee, and 5-year-old son attended his ceremony.\n\n\u201cYou get out what you put into life. I wasn\u2019t putting much into life, and that was the result I got,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cAnd when I realized that about my life and invested in myself, I got more out of it.\u201d\n\nNow Thomas works as a director of durable medical equipment and back office manager at a local orthopedic practice.\n\nDespite his successes, Thomas says he still falls back into the same feelings of frustration and inferiority he felt right after he was released. He\u2019s been turned away from apartments and jobs because of the felony on his record, he says.\n\nDavid Beller, president of the Colorado Criminal Defense Bar, said there is no legal requirement for Hickenlooper to review or grant requests for pardons, but slowing down the process could discourage people working to rehabilitate themselves.\n\n\u201cA pardon is a legal forgiveness. It doesn\u2019t forget the act, but it forgives it,\u201d Beller said. \u201cWe want that system to be in place because we want people to be motivated and incentives to do phenomenal things that Mr. Thomas has done.\u201d\n\nBoard finally filled\n\nDonner said the empty board\u2019s seats did not stop people from applying for a pardon.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office started reviewing applications for the five empty board seats \u2014 two of the seats were designated for the executive directors of the Department of Corrections and the Department of Public Safety \u2014 in late 2014. Prior to vetting board candidates, the governor\u2019s office worked to streamline the application process for adult and juvenile offenders seeking pardons, Donner said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no step in the criminal justice process that requires the governor to consider an application,\u201d Donner said. \u201cA criminal defendant never has an expectation that the governor will look at the application, will do anything with the application or will grant the application.\u201d\n\nThirteen people were given pardons by Gov. Bill Owens during his eight years in office. Gov. Bill Ritter granted pardons to 42 convicts.\n\nNo matter the wait, Thomas said he will continue to find success with or without a pardon.\n\n\u201cWho knows what type of person I would be now if I would have just stayed focused and did what I was supposed to do,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut then again, who\u2019s to say this situation didn\u2019t make me the person I am today.\u201d\n\nJordan Steffen: 303-954-1794, jsteffen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jsteffendp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Reformed inmate frustrated by backlog in Colorado\u2019s pardon process", "title": "Reformed inmate frustrated by backlog in Colorado\u2019s pardon process", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/16/reformed-inmate-frustrated-by-backlog-in-colorados-pardon-process/", "image": {"width": 490, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150116__20150117_A18_A18-cd17pardonjpp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150116__20150117_A18_A18-cd17pardonjpp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-16T20:51:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T09:58:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde131\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s no step in the criminal justice process that requires the governor to consider an application,\u201d Donner said.\nChief Deputy District Attorney John Hower, who successfully prosecuted two of Colorado\u2019s three death row inmates, was asked to review Thomas\u2019 application.\nPrior to vetting board candidates, the governor\u2019s office worked to streamline the application process for adult and juvenile offenders seeking pardons, Donner said.\nOnly on Monday did Hickenlooper fill all seven seats on the board he created in October 2012.\nNow, 17 years after he was convicted and 12 years after he completed his sentence, Thomas is seeking a pardon for his crime."}
