(Photo: File / The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nNASH, an exchange-traded fund tracking the performance of Nashville area-based publicly traded companies, turns 2 this month, with returns outperforming the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average since its launch.\n\nThe ETF, launched by LocalShares Inc., climbed 29 percent since Aug. 1, 2013, through July 31, compared with 23 percent gains by the S&P 500 and 13 percent by the Dow.\n\n\"It's been an exceptionally good return,\" said Stephen Frohsin, a portfolio manager at Woodmont Investment Counsel in Nashville, whose clients have invested in the fund. \"It tells you that our local economy is very healthy. It is growing, it is strong, and it's vibrant.\"\n\nNASH's performance has been boosted by local health care companies included in the fund that have gained investor support amid the Affordable Care Act, but those in other sectors \u2014 retail and banking \u2014 also have fared well. HCA, the top stock in the fund, rose 138 percent in the past two years.\n\nBased on conversations with Frohsin and Bill Decker, who co-founded and manages the fund, The Tennessean breaks down the basic concepts of exchange-traded funds and NASH, in particular.\n\nWhat is an ETF?\n\nAn exchange-traded fund, like a mutual fund, is a basket of securities that allow investors to own shares of several stocks through a single purchase. While ETFs have gained momentum in the past decades, mutual funds remain the more dominant asset class for retirement funds.\n\nHow much has been invested in NASH?\n\nNASH's assets exceed $11.1 million, with 350,000 shares. That's up from $2.5 million when it launched in 2013.\n\nHow does it compare with other indexes:\n\nGains since Aug. 1, 2013:\n\nNASH: 29 percent\n\nS&P 500: 23 percent\n\nDow Jones industrial average: 13 percent\n\nRussell 2000: 17 percent\n\nWhich companies are included?\n\nTo be included in NASH, a Middle Tennessee company must have a market capitalization of more than $100 million and the average daily volume of the company's stock must exceed 50,000 shares. As companies have had mergers, IPOs or changes in market capitalization levels, the fund's makeup has changed.\n\nHow much of the fund is health care related?\n\nOf the 25 companies, 12 are health care companies.\n\nHow does an ETF compare to a mutual fund?\n\nThe main differences come down to transparency, cost, liquidity and diversification, Frohsin said.\n\nAn ETF investor can check returns daily versus quarterly with a mutual fund. The cost to invest is typically lower, as well. NASH charges 0.49 percent of returns.\n\nMutual funds are typically managed more actively as well, with managers regularly trading securities as they seek to beat the major indexes. While some mutual funds are able to do so, the indexes tend to outperform over the long run, Frohsin said.\n\n\"A lot of money is coming from actively managed mutual funds and being invested in ETFs or index funds,\" he said.\n\nAre companies equally represented in the fund?\n\nBill Decker, who manages NASH, determines how much ownership the fund should have of a particular company based on its size, stock performance, liquidity, profitability and other factors, such as whether it pays a dividend. Decker makes changes quarterly.\n\nHow common are geography-based ETFs?\n\nWhile ETFs are often based around a sector \u2014 such as energy or industrials \u2014 there are few, if any, other region- or city-based ETFs, Frohsin said.\n\nWho is investing in the ETF?\n\nDecker says he is unable to track where investors are or how many investors have contributed to NASH, but he estimates that most live in or around Nashville. Their stakes range from $75 to about $1 million, based on trades.\n\nReach Jamie McGee at 615-259-8071 and on Twitter @JamieMcGee_.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1T04e8I", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "NASH, an exchange-traded fund tracking the performance of Nashville companies, has outperformed the S&P 500 and Dow since its launch.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "NASH, an exchange-traded fund tracking the performance of Nashville companies, has outperformed the S&P 500 and Dow since its launch.", "title": "Nashville stocks fund outperforms in first two years", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/2015/08/07/nashville-stocks-fund-outperforms-first-two-years/30473827/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NASH, an exchange-traded fund tracking the performance of Nashville companies, has outperformed the S&P 500 and Dow since its launch.", "title": "Nashville stocks fund outperforms in first two years", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a9ddf67e5654e3e21b8096a7796b2c225c5f150/c=235-0-675-440&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/06/Nashville/Nashville/635744923757542324--Downtown-after.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/byhollyfletcher"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/S&P 500", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Companies/S&P 500", "title": "Nashville stocks fund outperforms in first two years", "author": "Jamie McGee, and Holly Fletcher", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/efa5042eb31e414722fd1317e3cf80e378bedafd/c=290-0-620-440/local/-/media/2015/08/06/Nashville/Nashville/635744923757542324--Downtown-after.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4cc7da3cf56f9c28147dd61793fdf9bad7eabf26/c=235-0-675-440/local/-/media/2015/08/06/Nashville/Nashville/635744923757542324--Downtown-after.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9ce7db0123a684ea8923149c90aae332c153699d/c=162-0-747-440/local/-/media/2015/08/06/Nashville/Nashville/635744923757542324--Downtown-after.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/da43e5e89ac92ef4ff325dd84ae20db6c0217a94/c=66-0-845-440&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/06/Nashville/Nashville/635744923757542324--Downtown-after.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-07T18:12:12.010000-05:00", "shorthed": "Nashville stocks fund outperforms in first two years", "articleid": 30473827, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/73a31dd5376503937f80aeb6982f487c81db1035/c=66-0-845-440/local/-/media/2015/08/06/Nashville/Nashville/635744923757542324--Downtown-after.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ec2519dd8300a942a9e37f949dbc1312e03a1cf6/c=332-0-578-440/local/-/media/2015/08/06/Nashville/Nashville/635744923757542324--Downtown-after.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "NASH, exchange-traded funding, ETFs"}, "article_summary": "An exchange-traded fund, like a mutual fund, is a basket of securities that allow investors to own shares of several stocks through a single purchase.\nNashville stocks fund outperforms in first two yearsBuy Photo NASH, an exchange-traded fund tracking the performance of Nashville area-based publicly traded companies, turns 2 this month, with returns outperforming the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average since its launch.\nAn ETF investor can check returns daily versus quarterly with a mutual fund.\nWhile ETFs have gained momentum in the past decades, mutual funds remain the more dominant asset class for retirement funds.\n\"A lot of money is coming from actively managed mutual funds and being invested in ETFs or index funds,\" he said."}
