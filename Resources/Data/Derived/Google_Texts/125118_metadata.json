But they are expected to become a model that winners and losers in the fight believe will be replicated elsewhere. The credit \u2014 or blame \u2014 for the newfound urgency can be traced in part to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. A variety of workplace wellness programs and preventive health-care initiatives called for in the law could soon translate into rivers of billable hours for those with credentials to keep American waistlines in check.\n\nThese regulations could eventually lead to the ability to bill insurance companies for services much like such professionals as dieticians and physical therapists, putting millions of dollars at stake.\n\nThe problem here is that there are no standards for personal training everywhere. Gyms and clinics everywhere have their own rules.\n\nThese standards could cause some facilities to close so trainers can obtain certification.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018personal fitness trainer\u2019 is not true for everyone in the industry,\u201d Phillip Godfrey, a medical exercise specialist in the District told the Washington Post. \u201cThat\u2019s a known title, but there are kinesiologists, corrective specialists . . . literally hundreds of titles and sub-specialties. Setting one pathway, one test, one methodology to train individuals \u2014 that can be problematic. It may work for some and not others.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Business Journal reported:\n\nThe Post reports this move has some of the best-muscled voices in the industry making noise, questioning the process and asking lawmakers to slow it down or even bring it to a complete stop, threatening legal battles if necessary. One of the most vocal opponents is CrossFit, the brand of high-intensity workouts that some swear by, and others say leads to injury. The cost to revamp CrossFit\u2019s courses could go into the tens of millions, the company says, if it\u2019s forced to do it throughout the country.\n\nThe District\u2019s Board of Physical Therapy is expected to release its new regulation next month.", "article_metadata": {"home_name": "Washington D.C.", "geoLat": "38.807", "description": "The personal training industry has existed for nearly 50 years and nearly all of that time it has been unregulated.", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aggrego.SunTimes.National", "locale": "en_US", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "site": "@SunTimesDC"}, "og": {"site_name": "Washington D.C.", "description": "The personal training industry has existed for nearly 50 years and nearly all of that time it has been unregulated.", "title": "D.C. personal trainers to be guinea pigs for national regulation", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://bullseye-prod.aggrego.org//wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2015/08/CNLYFhEUkAAMy0B.jpg?o=eyJ3aWR0aCI6MCwiaGVpZ2h0IjowLCJ4IjowLjUsInkiOjAuNX0%3D&s=pVyf3qJT%2BKnfMfdXG%2FcEdlrBUrY%3D", "updated_time": "2015-08-24T11:45:14+00:00", "url": "http://dc.suntimes.com/dc-news/7/82/230137/dc-personal-trainers-regulation/", "type": "article"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "gmt_offset": "-4", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=930568317", "article": {"section": "Washington D.C.
