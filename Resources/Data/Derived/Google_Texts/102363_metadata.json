Altman, who is the Sol C. Chaikin professor of national health policy and also chair of the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, has been involved in federal health care reform since the Nixon administration. His book, Power, Politics and Universal Healthcare: The Inside Story of a Century-Long Battle, explains the Affordable Care Act and the long road leading up to its implementation. Sampath, an assistant professor of the philosophy of justice, rights, and social change, posed questions to Altman that touch on the moral and ethical arguments championed by opponents of the ACA. In their conversation they explore various criticisms of this landmark legislation, and seek to unravel an already complicated and politically charged issue. The full audio podcast is below, followed by a brief video clip and selected transcribed excerpts.\n\nIn the video excerpt below, Raj Sampath poses the question, \u201cIn the 70s only a marginal percentage of the GDP went to health care, and now it's up to 18% of a $17 trillion GDP. Critics could ask, are we comparing apples to apples here when we talk about industrialized democratic nations that have a moral, political, legal, philosophical obligation to provide universal healthcare, when you\u2019re talking about socialist democracies with relatively small, homogenous populations, high tax rates, et cetera. The United States is a very big country; we\u2019re not Japan, we\u2019re not Scandinavia. We\u2019re talking about immense diversity, and we\u2019re dealing with an extremely complex political system\u2026 Is it fair to make those types of comparisons to other countries like these that [enacted universal healthcare] a long time ago, and we\u2019re just late to the game? Or is there something to be said for those people that make the argument that \u2018there\u2019s got to be an alternative plan out there, let\u2019s just scrap [the ACA], rethink this, and move forward\u2019?\u201d Altman's insightful response to this argument follows.\n\nStuart Altman says, \u201cThere is no question\u2014the Affordable Care Act is a complicated piece of legislation. Why? Because we chose to build it on top of our current system. We chose not to create a much simpler, single-payer system. Why? Because many people believe that if government controlled the whole healthcare system, it would change it in a way that would be negative for many people, and it would be negative for many people that provide healthcare: doctors, hospitals, drug companies, nurses and so on. So we created the Affordable Care Act similar to the Nixon plan\u2014a complicated override of our complicated healthcare system. And no question about it, it is very complicated. It\u2019s been very difficult to implement, but in my view, it was the only way this country was prepared to pass universal coverage. And we just have to live with the complications. They\u2019re not that complicated. They can work, but they require time, they require a government that is flexible. Unfortunately, with a large percentage of the population opposed to it, and the Republicans taking control of the Congress, they\u2019ve made implementation much, much harder.\"\n\n\"First of all,\" says Altman, \"there is a philosophical argument that government should not be responsible for providing services or goods to individuals who potentially have the capability to either buy it on their own or to buy insurance themselves. That is a philosophical argument that government does not have an appropriate role here. We\u2019ve had a major debate in this country over whether health care is a right or a privilege. And there are those of us who believe that like every other industrial democracy in the world, and even many dictatorships, basic health care is a fundamental right of every American.\"", "article_metadata": {"ROBOTS": "index,follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe049b\"", "article_summary": "June 8, 2015Professors Stuart Altman and Rajesh Sampath discuss the Affordable Care ActHeller thought leaders Raj Sampath and Stuart Altman sat down to discuss the history, politics and policy of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nSo we created the Affordable Care Act similar to the Nixon plan\u2014a complicated override of our complicated healthcare system.\nStuart Altman says, \u201cThere is no question\u2014the Affordable Care Act is a complicated piece of legislation.\nWe\u2019ve had a major debate in this country over whether health care is a right or a privilege.\nHis book, Power, Politics and Universal Healthcare: The Inside Story of a Century-Long Battle, explains the Affordable Care Act and the long road leading up to its implementation."}
