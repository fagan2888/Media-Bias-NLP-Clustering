At least that\u2019s what conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh would have his listeners believe. On his radio show Friday, Limbaugh claimed that Mandela \u201chas more in common or had more in common with Clarence Thomas than he does with Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nThe crux of Limbaugh\u2019s argument is a familiar conservative complaint \u2014 \u201cObama looks at the US Constitution as an obstacle and makes end runs around it every day, practically,\u201d according to Limbaugh. Mandela, by contrast, \u201cinsisted on compliance with his country\u2019s constitution.\u201d For this reason, Limbaugh claims, \u201cMandela had much more in common with Clarence Thomas, and a lot of conservatives, than he has with Obama, but the left doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh\u2019s decision to praise Mandela for his loyalty to the South African constitution is ironic, as it would be difficult to craft a document more anathema to Limbaugh\u2019s world view than the constitution Mandela signed as South Africa\u2019s president in 1996. Mandela\u2019s constitution protects a right to \u201cfair labour practices,\u201d to \u201cform and join a trade union,\u201d to \u201can environment that is not harmful to . . . health or well-being,\u201d and to \u201csufficient food and water.\u201d It forbids discrimination on the basis of \u201crace, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth.\u201d Perhaps most offensive of all to someone of Limbaugh\u2019s beliefs, the South African Constitution also provides that \u201c[e]veryone has the right to have access to \u00ad. . . health care services, including reproductive health care.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Limbaugh\u2019s decision to present Justice Thomas as a foil to Obama\u2019s supposed disregard for the Constitution is simply absurd. Indeed, it is likely that no one in American government has tried harder to read his own policy preferences into the Constitution that Clarence Thomas.\n\nThomas is a deep skeptic of government \u2014 at least outside of the military context. Thomas screens a film version of Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d to his four law clerks each summer, and he\u2019s also a devotee of Ludwig von Mises \u2014 an anti-government economist who opposed the New Deal as the \u201cfirst steps on the way toward the establishment of full communism.\u201d\n\nThese political views shine through in Thomas\u2019 judicial opinions. Among other things, Thomas wants to return to a long discredited reading of the Constitution that was once used to declare federal child labor laws unconstitutional. Though it would be difficult to catalog all the laws that would cease to exist if Thomas got his way, a short list includes the federal ban on whites-only lunch counters, bans on race, gender and other forms of employment discrimination, overtime laws and the national minimum wage.\n\nThomas, in other words, has about as much in common with Nelson Mandela as Walter White has with McGruff the Crime Dog.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Clarence Thomas thinks that a nationwide ban on child labor and whites-only lunch counters is unconstitutional.
