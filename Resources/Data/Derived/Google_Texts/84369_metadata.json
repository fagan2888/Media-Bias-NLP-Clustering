We\u2019ll take direct military action against these terrorists. We have done that. We are doing that in Iraq and Syria. But longer term, we have to look at how we combat the conditions that can lead people to turn to extremism.\u201d\n\nMr. Blitzer then asked: \u201cSo you suggested that maybe if you find these young men jobs, they might not become terrorists?\u201d\n\nMs. Harf called that a \u201cgross oversimplification\u201d of her view and went on to clarify \u2014 but also doubled down and suggested that those who couldn\u2019t grasp her notions were perhaps not as smart as the experts.\n\nIn statements a few moments later, she said: \u201cWe cannot kill every terrorist around the world, nor should we try. How do you get at the root causes of this? It might be too nuanced an argument for some, like I\u2019ve seen over the last 24 hours [in] some of the commentary out there, but it\u2019s really the smart way that Democrats, Republicans, our partners in the Arab world think we need to combat it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf doubled down on her claim that the long-term solution for dealing with Islamic State terrorists was to help them with economic opportunities \u2014 help them get jobs \u2014 saying that those who criticized that notion were perhaps not smart enough to understand.", "Author": "Cheryl K.
