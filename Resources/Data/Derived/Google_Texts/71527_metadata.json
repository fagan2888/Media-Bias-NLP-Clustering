Sam Brownback\u2019s famous Arthur Laffer \u201cpetri dish\u201d experiment, in which he slashed taxes and government programs in order to usher in a Republican free market economic utopia. The experiment looks like it\u2019s blowing up the lab:\n\n[T]he Brownback/Laffer tax scheme hasn\u2019t goosed the Kansas economy and it doesn\u2019t look like it will any time soon. It has succeeded marvelously, though, in redistributing wealth to the top of the income ladder, while, at the same time, screwing over the people at the bottom. While the rich soaked up the lion\u2019s share of the tax windfall, the poorest Kansas families actually saw their tax burden tick up a little bit. And when it comes to screwing the poor, Kansas Republicans are proving to be among the more creative and heartlessly depraved groups of legislators in the country. Last month, the Legislature passed a resolution barring welfare recipients from spending their benefits at swimming pools, movie theaters, casinos, tattoo parlors, and strip clubs. It\u2019s a dehumanizing and paternalistic policy that assumes the poor are undeserving of simple diversions like going to see a movie, or are scamming the government to finance their gambling and/or stripper habits.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. He points out that Brownback and company have devised one of those cunning Scrooge-like plans to take money that\u2019s needed to put food in little children\u2019s mouths and give it to big banks. Here\u2019s how Max Ehrenfreund at the Washington Post described it:\n\nA dollar bill is a special kind of thing. You can keep it as long as you like. You can pay for things with it. No one will ever charge you a fee. No one will ask any questions about your credit history. And other people won\u2019t try to tell you that they know how to spend that dollar better than you do. For these reasons, cash is one of the most valuable resources a poor person in the United States can possess. Yet legislators in Kansas, not trusting the poor to use their money wisely, have voted to limit how much cash that welfare beneficiaries can receive, effectively reducing their overall benefits, as well. The legislature placed a daily cap of $25 on cash withdrawals beginning July 1, which will force beneficiaries to make more frequent trips to the ATM to withdraw money from the debit cards used to pay public assistance benefits. Since there\u2019s a fee for every withdrawal, the limit means that some families will get substantially less money.\n\nImagine making it so that banks can collect extra fees from mothers with small children who are trying to feed them on less than four hundred dollars a month. How cruel do you have to be to think that making them only carry 20 dollars cash will somehow teach them a lesson?\n\nBut this is what\u2019s happening in states governed by miserly Republicans who are determined to wring every last dime out of people who have nothing and give it to people who have more than they can spend in a lifetime. In Scott Walker\u2019s Wisconsin, for instance, they are making long lists of prohibited foods for those who use SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs.) The list of other prohibited purchases includes \u201cherbs, spices, or seasonings,\u201d all nuts, red and yellow potatoes, smoothies, spaghetti sauce, \u201csoups, salsas, ketchup,\u201d sauerkraut, pickles, dried beans sold in bulk, and white or albacore tuna.\n\nThey were particularly adamant that nobody on the program be allowed to eat shellfish, lobster in particular, which seems odd considering that it\u2019s Wisconsin and the lobster catch there is decidedly small. (In fact, it\u2019s non-existent.) I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be surprised to learn that this lobster hysteria stemmed from a Fox News documentary which seems to have been the catalyst for these crackdowns on foodie welfare cheats. Media Matters reported on it back in 2013:\n\nPrior to its August 9 airing, Fox News hyped the special, \u201cThe Great Food Stamp Binge,\u201d on Fox News Insider, FoxNews.com, and several of its daytime shows. Each preview focused on Jason Greenslate, a freeloading surfer who Fox correspondent John Roberts interviewed in Southern California. FoxNews.com described Greenslate at length in an article that teased the \u201cnew documentary\u201d: \u201cThe Fox News Reporting documentary profiles, among others, a California surfer and aspiring musician named Jason Greenslate. Greenslate shows how he supports his beach-bum lifestyle with food stamps, while dismissing the idea of holding down a regular, steady job. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want a job, I don\u2019t want a boss. I don\u2019t want someone telling me what to do. I\u2019m gonna live my own life,\u2019 Greenslate tells Fox News\u2019 John Roberts. \u2018This is the way I want to live. And I don\u2019t really see anything changing. I got the card. It\u2019s $200. That\u2019s it.'\u201d As promised, \u201cThe Great Food Stamp Binge\u201d labeled Greenslate \u201cthe new face of food stamps,\u201d devoting two full segments to his lifestyle in a shameless attempt to characterize SNAP recipients as freeloaders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The party of the rich is now doing everything in its power to make sure those without money live in misery", "title": "The Republican campaign to destroy the poor stoops to a new low", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The party of the rich is now doing everything in its power to make sure those without money live in misery", "title": "The Republican campaign to destroy the poor stoops to a new low", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/the_republican_plot_to_destroy_the_poor/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/scott_walker7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The party of the rich is now doing everything in its power to make sure those without money live in misery", "title": "The Republican campaign to destroy the poor stoops to a new low", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/scott_walker7.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Heather Digby Parton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Food Stamps, Poverty, safety net, Sam Brownback, Scott Walker, TANF, The Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And when it comes to screwing the poor, Kansas Republicans are proving to be among the more creative and heartlessly depraved groups of legislators in the country.\nFor these reasons, cash is one of the most valuable resources a poor person in the United States can possess.\nWhile the rich soaked up the lion\u2019s share of the tax windfall, the poorest Kansas families actually saw their tax burden tick up a little bit.\nEach preview focused on Jason Greenslate, a freeloading surfer who Fox correspondent John Roberts interviewed in Southern California.\nSam Brownback\u2019s famous Arthur Laffer \u201cpetri dish\u201d experiment, in which he slashed taxes and government programs in order to usher in a Republican free market economic utopia."}
