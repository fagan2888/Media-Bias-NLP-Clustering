He still gets to live in the White House another couple of years. There will be plenty of ribbons to cut and speeches to deliver as he fades in stature and takes on the mayor of America role.\n\nHe\u2019ll be able to use his office to express his heartfelt concern for Americans still struggling during the economic recovery \u2014 even if he can\u2019t point to many programs that helped them in a timely manner.\n\nHe still has plenty of opportunity to wax eloquent about the rights of oppressed people in far-off lands, too. Maybe he\u2019ll even take a few months to firm up his foreign policy. You know, so that the rest of us can understand it.\n\nBut whatever heavy lifting the president hoped to accomplish in a gridlocked Congress in his second term appears to be lost. At least, that\u2019s what I read between the lines of a front-page article in the Tuesday edition of The New York Times under the headline \u201cAloof Obama Is Frustrating His Own Party.\u201d\n\nThe multi-sourced story should send even Obama\u2019s most die-hard supporters to the medicine cabinet for a fistful of Excedrin. The piece starts with a scene in June, which found Obama meeting with personal pit bull Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his opposite number, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, on the subject of the president\u2019s foundering nominees for several ambassador positions. McConnell\u2019s crowd has taken wicked delight in blocking the process, and Reid was fighting for Obama\u2019s selections. Instead of engaging and backing Reid\u2019s argument, Obama is quoted effectively brushing aside the issue and saying, \u201cYou and Mitch work it out.\u201d\n\nThey were Obama\u2019s nominees, but from the sound of things, he was unwilling to joust for them.\n\nFrom the Times: \u201cMr. Reid seethed quietly for the rest of the morning, according to four separate accounts provided by people who spoke with him about it. After his return to the Capitol that afternoon, Mr. Reid told other senators and his staff members that he was astonished by how disengaged the president seemed.\u201d\n\nMaybe it was just Reid being cranky and mercurial, but the last thing Obama should want to do is alienate his fiercely loyal Luca Brasi.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking about the hurt feelings of just any Democrat. We\u2019re talking about brawling Harry Reid of Nevada, the man without whom Obama\u2019s presidency would be so small scientists couldn\u2019t identify it with an electron microscope. Reid has not only carried Obama\u2019s water, he\u2019s drawn it from dry wells and conjured it from cloudless skies. He\u2019s twisted arms and brokered deals and become the favorite target of GOP snipers for years in an effort to move Obama\u2019s agenda and his own.\n\nLove or loathe the Affordable Care Act, without Reid\u2019s pugilistic political poker, it probably doesn\u2019t exist. If Reid is finished fighting for Obama, then Obama is as good as finished.\n\nReid, whose office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment before deadline, isn\u2019t alone in feeling that the fire has gone out of Obama, according to the Times. Interviews with Democratic lawmakers and top staff indicate a prevailing theme: Obama is increasingly disengaged from members of his own party.\n\nOf course, that can\u2019t come as entirely bad news to many Democrats, who know polls indicate the president is a midterm millstone. Obama is only slightly more popular than Ebola.\n\nBut what does it say about the remaining two years of his presidency?\n\nNothing good.\n\nThere\u2019s still time for Obama to accomplish something weighty, or at least productive and memorable, in the remainder of his term. But he can\u2019t accomplish anything without Reid softening up the opposition and other key Democrats attempting to assist a most unpopular president.\n\nWithout Luca Brasi to guard his back, Obama\u2019s presidency sleeps with the fishes.\n\nJohn L.
