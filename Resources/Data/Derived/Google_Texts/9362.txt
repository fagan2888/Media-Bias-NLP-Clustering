The head of one of Washington’s most staunchly anti-Obamacare organizations had his health insurance plan canceled due to Obamacare.

Former Republican congressman Chris Chocola, president of the conservative Club for Growth, was notified Thursday that he would be losing coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

“I have an individual policy, my wife and I. We got our letter today. It’s, I guess, classic language,” Chocola told The Daily Caller, noting with a laugh that the letter tells him “Don’t Worry.”

Chocola, who resides in Indiana, was until recently covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield, which is closely partnering with the Obama White House on Obamacare implementation.

“We’re on a search now for what the best options are. The deductibles are crazy, and we already have a high deductible,” Chocola said. “They’ve offered me a plan that’s a 31 percent [price] increase but I don’t know what the deductible is. I have a $3,000 deductible now.”

Chocola said that new plans feature on his insurance company’s website offer $12,000 and $6,000 deductibles.

Chocola noted that he’s at least glad he can look for a plan on his insurance company’s website and will not have to visit HealthCare.Gov.

Club for Growth fought hard this summer to prevent Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell from agreeing to fund Obamacare, and the group’s fight continues. Chocola noted that while he’s worried about his plan, Democrats like Mark Pryor who voted for Obamacare should be even more worried come 2014.
