Tom Cole (R-Okla.), deputy whip of the House, characterized the atmosphere in the meeting as in \"total support\" of a bill that would delay Obamacare for one year while fully repealing the law\u2019s medical device tax. He wouldn\u2019t dismiss the likelihood of the strategy succeeding, despite previous skepticism of attempts to fully defund Obamacare in a continuing resolution.\n\nThe new approach, he argued, was different because it would be difficult for red state Democrats to resist. Cole pointed specifically to comments from Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) that were critical of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"We know at least some Senate Democrats are anxious for or support a delay ... the medical device tax has already gotten 70-odd votes over there,\" Cole said.\n\nManchin was the main source for House GOP members' political hopes on Saturday morning. In addition to Cole, a number of other Republicans spotlighted the West Virginia Democrat as a potential \"yes\" vote for the new House CR.\n\n\"I'm with Joe Manchin and he says that he will support something like this,\" said Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.).\n\nBut as Manchin\u2019s office noted, he had said that he supported a one-year delay only in the health care law\u2019s individual mandate, not the entire law. He also said that pursuit of such a delay was not worth shutting down the government.\n\nJonathan Kott, a spokesman for the senator, meanwhile, told The Huffington Post on Saturday that Manchin would not support a one-year delay in the law as envisioned under the new House CR bill.\n\nThere are other potential, conservative-leaning or red-state Democrats who were publicly lobbied by House Republicans on Saturday. Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), for one, made entreaties to his home-state senator, Kay Hagan.\n\n\"I'll bet she doesn't want this thing implemented during her reelection, secretly,\u201d he said. \u201cShe won't admit that.\"\n\n\"What will move this is, if there are other Democrat senators who put pressure on Reid,\" he added. \"Again, I think there are a number of Democrats who secretly want a one-year delay.\"\n\nRep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.), meanwhile, argued that there is too much pressure from within the Democratic Party on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to not negotiate off of the new House CR bill. To do otherwise, he said, would be politically unreasonable.\n\n\"I think there is a way forward here, and it's really going to be up to Harry Reid,\" said Rigell. \"What Harry Reid is saying is, there will be no compromise? So he put himself in a bit of a box, and that makes him no different than Ted Cruz, now doesn\u2019t it?\"\n\nBut the likelihood that Reid would budge or that Hagan, Manchin and other conservative-leaning Democrats would break en masse to support the new House CR offer seemed unlikely, at least as of early Saturday afternoon. The party stood together when the debate was squarely about defunding the health-care law. And leadership aides expressed little concern that that would change when the debate shifted to whether or not there should be a year delay.\n\nUPDATE: Surprising virtually no one, Majority Leader Reid announced early Saturday afternoon that the House CR was a non-starter.\n\nToday\u2019s vote by House Republicans is pointless. As I have said repeatedly, the Senate will reject any Republican attempt to force changes to the Affordable Care Act through a mandatory government funding bill or the debt ceiling. Furthermore, President Obama has stated that he would veto such measures if they ever reached his desk. To be absolutely clear, the Senate will reject both the one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act and the repeal of the medical device tax. After weeks of futile political games from Republicans, we are still at square one: Republicans must decide whether to pass the Senate\u2019s clean CR, or force a Republican government shutdown. Senate Democrats have shown that we are willing to debate and vote on a wide range of issues, including efforts to improve the Affordable Care Act. We continue to be willing to debate these issues in a calm and rational atmosphere. But the American people will not be extorted by Tea Party anarchists.\n\nUPDATE: 9/29, 1:00 p.m. -- \"Senator Hagan isn't taking political advice from the people willing to harm servicemembers and seniors just to score political points off a shutdown,\" said Hagan spokeswoman Sadie Weiner.\n\nMichael McAuliff and Luke Johnson contributed reporting.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate\n\n1 of 12 Healthcare In America Is Already 'The Best In The World' One of the more positive sounding admonitions from health care reform opponents was that the United States had \"the best health care in the world,\" so why would you mess with it? Well, it's true that if you want the experience the pinnacle of medical care, you come to the United States. And if you want the pinnacle of haute cuisine, you go to Per Se. If you want the pinnacle of commercial air travel, you get a first class seat on British Airways. Now, naturally, you wouldn't let just anyone mess with someone's tasting menu or state-of-the-art air-beds. But like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody. The costs are prohibitively high, the access is prohibitively exclusive, and the resources are prohibitively scarce. What do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get? Well, at the time of the health care reform debate, they were participating in a system that was, by all objective measurements, overpriced and underperforming -- if you were lucky enough to be participating in it. As anyone who's fortunate enough to have employer based health care or unfortunate enough to have a pre-existing condition can tell you, health care for ordinary people already involved all of those things that we were told would be a feature of the Affordable Care Act -- long waits, limited choice, and rationing. When the Commonwealth Fund rated health care systems by nation , the top marks in the surveyed categories went to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Ezra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care. Our delivery system underperforms, too. 'Even when access and equity measures are not considered, the U.S. ranks behind most of the other countries on most measures. With the inclusion of primary care physician survey data in the analysis, it is apparent that the U.S. is lagging in adoption of national policies that promote primary care, quality improvement, and information technology.'\" Share this slide:\n\nGetty", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Moments after they emerged from a Saturday morning meeting, having agreed to another government funding bill that chips away at the preside...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-29 14:57:46 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Moments after they emerged from a Saturday morning meeting, having agreed to another government funding bill that chips away at the preside...", "title": "House Republicans Lobby Red-State Dems To Support One-Year Obamacare Delay", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/28/manchin-hagan-obamacare_n_4009426.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1379106/images/o-JOE-MANCHIN-KAY-HAGAN-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Moments after they emerged from a Saturday morning meeting, having agreed to another government funding bill that chips away at the preside...", "creator": "SabrinaSiddiqui", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1379106/images/o-JOE-MANCHIN-KAY-HAGAN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "House Republicans Lobby Red-State Dems To Support One-Year Obamacare Delay", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-28 14:57:46 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4009426", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "joe manchin mandate,obamacare delay,Manchin Hagan Obamacare,Politics News,HuffPolitics blog,joe manchin health care,joe manchin obamacare delay,joe manchin individual mandate delay,House CR,reid conservatives,defund Obamacare,Joe Manchin,open enrollment exchanges,joe manchin obamacare,kay hagan,reid cr", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "joe manchin mandate,obamacare delay,Manchin Hagan Obamacare,Politics News,HuffPolitics blog,joe manchin health care,joe manchin obamacare delay,joe manchin individual mandate delay,House CR,reid conservatives,defund Obamacare,Joe Manchin,open enrollment exchanges,joe manchin obamacare,kay hagan,reid cr", "published_time": "2013-09-28 14:57:46 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-09-29 13:13:42 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90ac\"", "article_summary": "Ezra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care.\nBut as Manchin\u2019s office noted, he had said that he supported a one-year delay only in the health care law\u2019s individual mandate, not the entire law.\nThere are other potential, conservative-leaning or red-state Democrats who were publicly lobbied by House Republicans on Saturday.\n\"We know at least some Senate Democrats are anxious for or support a delay ... the medical device tax has already gotten 70-odd votes over there,\" Cole said.\nBut like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody."}
