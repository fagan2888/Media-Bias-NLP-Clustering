The Nuggets were out to put a dent in those plans.\n\nThe result was one of the most entertaining, nail-biting, riveting games the Nuggets have been a part of all season.\n\nThe Pelicans thought they had the guy who mattered most \u2014 all-star forward Anthony Davis. And he was nearly enough. But the Nuggets fought through his near quadruple-double to pull out a heart-stopping 118-111 victory in double overtime Sunday at the Smoothie King Center.\n\n\u201cThey fought,\u201d Nuggets interim coach Melvin Hunt said of his players. \u201cThey had an incredible will to win. These guys, they are reaching inside themselves and they are pulling things out of themselves that they didn\u2019t even know they had.\u201d\n\nOklahoma City Thunder fans were thanking the Nuggets.\n\nThe Pelicans began Sunday tied with Oklahoma City for the eighth spot in the Western Conference, and they own the tiebreaker. But they ended the day one game behind after the Nuggets made all of the necessary plays to win.\n\nNew Orleans will be happy not to see the Nuggets again this season. It has been a bad matchup for the Pelicans, with the Nuggets winning three of four contests.\n\n\u201cToday, I know they were fighting for a playoff spot,\u201d Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried said. \u201cI want to show them, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u2019 \u201c\n\nDanilo Gallinari\u2019s 3-pointer with 1:30 left in the second overtime put the Nuggets up 114-109. A Tyreke Evans layup brought the Pelicans to within three at 114-111. And the teams stayed that way for the next minute. The Nuggets fought off New Orleans late to get the victory. They are 6-2 under Hunt, whose coaching r\u00e9sum\u00e9 grows stronger with each win against a team in the upper echelon of either conference.\n\nDavis lit up the stats sheet with 36 points, 14 rebounds, seven assists and nine blocked shots.\n\n\u201cI wanted to call timeout to see if there were three of him out there,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cHe\u2019d be up top then I was trying to get him in the corner. Next thing I know he was on the baseline. He\u2019s an incredible player.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets were led by Will Barton\u2019s career-high 25 points and nine rebounds. Faried had a double-double of 20 points and 10 rebounds. And Ty Lawson had 19 points and nine assists.\n\n\u201cI think it says a lot about the character of this team, and the coaching staff,\u201d Barton said. \u201cWe were missing some key guys, and to beat those guys pretty much at full strength, and they\u2019re making a playoff push on their home court? It says a lot that everybody came to play, from top to bottom.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost\n\nDENVER AT MEMPHIS\n\n\n\n6 p.m. Monday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Jeff Green: When Memphis acquired Green, a versatile wing, from Boston back in January, almost all observers hailed it as a shrewd move. They were right. He has helped give the Grizzlies some much-needed scoring punch. In his last five games, he has been solid, with averages of 14.6 points and 5.2 rebounds.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets improve to 6-2 under Melvin Hunt with win over Pelicans in 2OT", "title": "Nuggets improve to 6-2 under Melvin Hunt with win over Pelicans in 2OT", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/15/nuggets-improve-to-6-2-under-melvin-hunt-with-win-over-pelicans-in-2ot/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150303_105534_melvin-hunt-nuggets-030315a-1.jpg", "height": 479}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150303_105534_melvin-hunt-nuggets-030315a-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-15T19:12:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T20:45:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e26\"", "article_summary": "But the Nuggets fought through his near quadruple-double to pull out a heart-stopping 118-111 victory in double overtime Sunday at the Smoothie King Center.\n\u201cThey fought,\u201d Nuggets interim coach Melvin Hunt said of his players.\nThe Nuggets fought off New Orleans late to get the victory.\nThe result was one of the most entertaining, nail-biting, riveting games the Nuggets have been a part of all season.\nIt has been a bad matchup for the Pelicans, with the Nuggets winning three of four contests."}
