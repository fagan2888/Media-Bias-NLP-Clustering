NYC is having its worst year in restaurant closures, and only one thing is certain: its epicurean reign is in trouble.\n\nIn the wee hours of Sunday morning, Milk & Honey, one of New York City\u2019s most whispered about cocktail bars, mixologized its final drink. With the building it\u2019s housed in soon to be demolished, owner Sasha Petraske has no choice but to move into a smaller space. \u201cRents have climbed past where drink prices can follow,\u201d he says.\n\nThat\u2019s saying something\u2014a Milk & Honey cocktail can easily run you $16. But even that\u2019s not sufficient to keep a celebrated New York venue in business these days. According to a survey released last week by Zagat, over the past year, 82 New York restaurants closed, almost twice as many as the year before, when the body count was 42.\n\nFor each old corner bistro that closes\u2014only to be replaced by a shiny new Bank of America\u2014another wave of anxiety ripples through New York\u2019s foodie community. Manhattanites are concerned that a decade of Bloombergian rent increases now threatens their venerable dining scene. \u201cIn 20 years, this just might be a city of Taco Bells,\u201d one restaurateur recently shuddered.\n\nAs restaurants\u2019 leases come up for renewal, many are seeing their rents more than double, and longtime institutions like Mesa Grill (Bobby Flay), Pastis (Keith McNally), and WD-50 (Wylie Dufresne) are shutting down. Even spots that survived decades of booms and busts\u2014like the 60-year-old 2nd Avenue Deli, which was forced to relocate to East 33rd Street in 2007\u2014have been forced out by sudden rent hikes.\n\nRestaurateur Danny Meyer crystalized the angst in a New York Times op-ed in July, in which he announced that rising rents would likely force him to close the beloved Union Square Cafe. \u201cBecause the market suggests they can, landlords are using this moment to demand the significantly higher rents they\u2019ve been waiting for since first betting on their neighborhoods,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut that sort of economics doesn\u2019t work for neighborhood restaurants.\u201d\n\nAlex Pemoulie knows this all too well. Along with her husband Kevin, she owns Thirty Acres, a seasonal farm-to-table restaurant in Jersey City. Kevin spent nearly five years as the chef de cuisine at Momofuku Noodle Bar, the revered Manhattan ramen joint with a perpetual hour-long wait. But when it came time to open their own place in the spring of 2012, they decided greener pastures lay in New Jersey. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want our [restaurant\u2019s] rent to be a bigger number than a certain percentage of our sales, so it made sense to move somewhere like Jersey City,\u201d says Alex.\n\nThey\u2019re not alone. When chef Ryan Brazeal, who spent years in the trenches at venerated Manhattan hotspots like M\u00e1 P\u00eache and Nobu 57, decided to open his own restaurant last year, he did it in his hometown of Kansas City. \u201cRent was definitely a factor,\u201d he says. But it wasn\u2019t the only one. Another element was the rise of Brooklyn, which has effectively doubled the number of restaurants people have to choose from, slicing the pie for each establishment even thinner. \u201cThe market share in New York is getting diluted because as it expands to Brooklyn there are just so many options,\u201d Brazeal says. \u201cAll these talented chefs are graduating from these old-guard kitchens and branching out and the market is saturated.\u201d\n\nRising labor costs are another force pushing restaurant owners further afield, Pemoulie says. For instance, this year both New York and New Jersey enacted laws guaranteeing paid sick leave to small-business employees. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool for employees, but it makes things hard,\u201d Pemoulie says. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for McDonald\u2019s to do paid sick leave, but if you only have five cooks and one is out for a week and gets paid the whole time, that\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nObamacare hasn\u2019t helped any either, she says, especially for owners of bigger restaurants. Under the Affordable Care Act, businesses with 50 or more employees will soon have to provide those workers health coverage or pay a fine.\n\nFactors like these are especially hard on restaurants, which tend to operate on razor-thin profit margins. \u201cI think people have the misconception that restaurants are rolling in it,\u201d Pemoulie says. \u201cThey think that because they can buy a steak for so much less at the store that that\u2019s how it works. But there\u2019s a reason restaurants go out of business. They\u2019re really hard businesses to run, and they\u2019re very variable.\u201d\n\nFor instance, she thinks that last year\u2019s winter kept customers away. \u201cPeople just wouldn\u2019t go out of the house,\u201d she says, a fact that may have contributed to the higher-than-usual number of closings. And Sasha Petraske says shoe-horning young people out of their homes today is no small task, especially for bars. \u201cI think millennials staying home and socializing on the Internet is a real factor in bars having a hard time,\u201d he says.\n\nHow this will all shake out is a topic of rampant speculation. Real-estate expert Julian Hitchcock told Grub Street he expects to see more chain restaurants pop up in New York. \u201cThey can just be a billboard,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only type of restaurant that can survive: one that can take a hit because it needs to be in New York to have its brand represented here, and so it essentially just becomes marketing dollars.\u201d\n\nThat marketing doesn\u2019t come cheap: The rent for Danny Meyer\u2019s Union Square Cafe reportedly rose to an appetite-quashing $650,000 per year. Typically, restaurant owners try to keep their rent outlays smaller than 10 percent of their gross sales\u2014a goal that\u2019s increasingly untenable in New York.\n\nBut Pemoulie says that despite all the hand-wringing, most restaurateurs she knows aren\u2019t in panic mode. And in fact, even as closings jumped this year, so did openings\u2014207 new restaurants opened for business in New York, the most since pre-recession 2007.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it as an epidemic of restaurants closing,\u201d Pemoulie says. \u201cNot every restaurant wants to be open for 25 years. A lot of these restaurants, the chef just wants to close it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "will_doig"}, "keywords": "New York City,New York,United States, Food", "publicationDate": 201410280945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/beaststyle", "news_keywords": "New York City New York United States, Food", "pageNum": 1, "title": "High Rents Are Killing the Restaurant Capital", "tags": "entity:city/new_york_city_new_york_united_states,topic:lifestyle/food", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Exorbitant rents, the rise of Brooklyn, lazy millennials.
