The findings were published simultaneously online in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\"It\u2019s probably time for a reappraisal of routine pretreatment strategies in non-ST-elevation ACS,\" Montalescot said at a press briefing.\n\n\"Overall, these results indicate that patients with [non-ST-segment elevation MI] who are selected for an early invasive strategy will be best served by administration of prasugrel only after angiographic definition of their coronary anatomy,\" John Keaney Jr., MD, of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, wrote in an editorial accompanying the NEJM paper. \"It remains to be seen whether a similar strategy could be applied to ticagrelor (Brilinta), the other high-potency P2Y 12 antagonist currently available.\"\n\nMontalescot noted that a strategy of pretreatment versus treatment in the cath lab has not been tested using ticagrelor because all of the patients in the pivotal PLATO trial were pretreated.\n\nThe findings of the current trial might cause some centers to move away from pre-angiography P2Y 12 inhibition in this patient population, said Spencer King III, MD, executive director of academic affairs at St. Joseph's Health System and a past president of the American College of Cardiology.\n\n\"But to tell you the truth, I think there's not a dramatic negative message here about giving it upstream or giving it in the cath lab,\" he told MedPage Today, adding that \"I think people will continue to give upstream if they think that they need antiplatelet effect right away.\"\n\nTwo previous trials evaluating pretreatment with clopidogrel -- one in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS and one in patients undergoing elective PCI -- have suggested that the strategy reduces ischemic events at the cost of increased major bleeding. Those findings have formed the basis of a class I recommendation to pretreat patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS who are scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure.\n\nRecent observational studies and a meta-analysis have disputed the benefit of routine pretreatment with clopidogrel. But other P2Y 12 inhibitors -- prasugrel and ticagrelor -- are more potent and faster acting.\n\nACCOAST, which was conducted at 171 centers in 19 countries, was designed to compare pretreatment with prasugrel at the time of diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation ACS before angiography with administration after angiography only if PCI was indicated.\n\nPatients in the pretreatment group received a 30-mg loading dose of prasugrel before angiography and another 30-dose if PCI was indicated after angiography. Patients in the control group received prasugrel (60 mg) only if they underwent PCI.\n\nThe trial was stopped early after 4,033 of a planned 4,100 patients were enrolled because of a lack of efficacy and an increase in bleeding associated with pretreatment. All of the included patients (mean age 64) had a positive troponin level and were scheduled to undergo angiography within 48 hours after randomization.\n\nAfter angiography, 68.7% of the patients underwent PCI, 25.1% received medical therapy alone, and 6.2% underwent CABG.\n\nThere were no differences between the pretreatment and control groups in the rate of the primary composite endpoint or any of the individual components either at 7 days or 1 month.\n\nAt 7 days, the rate of TIMI major bleeding not related CABG was nearly three times higher in the pretreatment group (1.3% versus 0.5%; HR 2.95, 95% CI 1.39-6.28) and the rate of life-threatening bleeding was more than five times higher (0.8% versus 0.2%; HR 5.56, 95% CI 1.63-19.0).\n\nRates of fatal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage were similar in the two groups.\n\nThe findings were consistent in the patients who ultimately underwent PCI.\n\nThe results could help streamline care of patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS, Keaney noted in his editorial. Administration of P2Y 12 inhibitors soon after hospital admission can cause delays in performing CABG in those need it, which causes inefficiency and cost.\n\n\"The work of Montalescot and co-workers indicates that one can safely pursue a more parsimonious approach of reserving prasugrel administration until after angiography,\" Keaney wrote. \"With this strategy, P2Y 12 treatment can be limited to patients who will be undergoing PCI, and patients with non-STEMI who require CABG will be able to avoid unnecessary delays.\"\n\nACCOAST was sponsored by Daiichi Sankyo and Eli Lilly.
