In this regard, texting is one the 21st century\u2019s greatest gifts. With the ultimate level of interconnectedness between doctor and patient, not to mention between patient and loved ones, people looking at the success or failure rates of certain forms of treatment don\u2019t have to wonder if anything is getting lost to the flaws in self-reports. They can document, track, analyze, and help.\n\nA new study published in the journal Personal and Ubiquitous Computing found that among 325 people receiving treatment for a mental illness at a community-based outpatient clinic, texting was far and away the most widely used technology \u2014 at rates similar to those of a nationally representative sample. The only difference was patients tended to share their phones more often than non-patients. Nearly 80 percent of people texted and many didn\u2019t use any apps at all.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time researchers have relied on texting\u2019s ability to get accurate information fast. In 2013, University of Michigan psychologists hoping to measure Facebook\u2019s impact on people\u2019s happiness texted subjects periodically throughout the day. They asked questions related to people\u2019s current level of contentedness, how recently they used Facebook, and how they felt after using it. Texting was key in this case because the data let scientists quickly parse through the effect Facebook was having, instead of having to rely on slippery testimony later, after the emotions had worn off.\n\n\"By utilizing a technology that is readily available and familiar to so many Americans, we see huge potential to improve treatment outcomes and provide patients who currently have only limited access to treatment additional treatment options,\" Kelly Caine, co-author and assistant professor in Clemson University\u2019s School of Computing, said in a statement.\n\nMental illness is surprisingly common in the United States. One in four people is estimated to suffer from either depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or one of the many other disorders that are formally recognized. Unfortunately, as many as 60 percent of adults and 50 percent of adolescents between 8 and 15 receive no treatment, either because they can\u2019t afford it or they choose not to receive it.\n\nTexting may give doctors a natural way in, Caine says. Patients may even have the chance to text their doctors directly about their concerns. The full extent to which they can harness the medium will be determined in future studies.\n\n\"When designed from a patient-centered perspective, such as understanding cell phone sharing habits,\" Caine said, \u201cthese technologies have the potential to be useful and usable to the largest number of patients.\"\n\nSource: Campbell B, Caine K, Connelly K, Doub T, Bragg A.
