Workers said that tactic allows the contractors to avoid having to pay for benefits such as health insurance.\n\nThe union\u2019s contract expires in October.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d rather have them bargain it out. But the bottom line is, we need them to do the right thing,\u201d Riemer said of the service contractors association. \u201cI recognize that we have a challenge in the county with commercial vacancies. The economy, it\u2019s improving but it\u2019s not improving as fast as everyone would like. At the same time, there\u2019s some things that just need to be part of the base set of expenses.\u201d\n\nAn attorney representing the Washington Service Contractors Association couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nJaime Contreras, vice president of the regional 32BJ chapter, said there are about 20 commercial properties in Montgomery County that are part of the union\u2019s contract\u2014most are in Bethesda, Rockville and Silver Spring.\n\nMiriam Pineda, a Takoma Park resident, said through a translator that she\u2019s given 20 hours of cleaning work per week at a salary of $12.75 per hour.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to make a living. The rent has gone up, there are family expenses,\u201d Pineda said. \u201cFor some of us, we\u2019re getting older and they refuse to give us more hours.\u201d\n\nContreras said the union would like to secure 30 hours of work per week for all of its workers, which would allow them to apply for healthcare under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAbout 90 percent of the cleaners that the union represents in Montgomery County are Hispanic. Contreras said many must work second jobs and that about 85 percent of union members in the county work part time.\n\n\u201cWe know, in Maryland, in Montgomery County, in Bethesda, one of the wealthiest jurisdictions in America, the better you treat your workers, the better they treat you,\u201d District 19 state Sen. Roger Manno said at the rally Tuesday.\n\nManno, who represents areas of Silver Spring, Aspen Hill, Rockville and Gaithersburg, said he was at the event to support the workers.\n\nA staff member for Riemer said the bill legislating full-time hours could be introduced as soon as this summer.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bethesdamagazine.com/Bethesda-Beat/2015/Office-Cleaners-Rally-for-Full-Time-Salaries-Benefits-at-Bethesda-Metro/", "image": "http://www.bethesdamagazine.com/Bethesda-Beat/2015/Office-Cleaners-Rally-for-Full-Time-Salaries-Benefits-at-Bethesda-Metro/Cleaners.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Montgomery County lawmaker says bill in the works that would require full-time jobs and health benefits", "title": "Office Cleaners Rally In Bethesda for Full-Time Salaries, Benefits"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Montgomery County lawmaker says bill in the works that would require full-time jobs and health benefits", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Office Cleaners Rally In Bethesda for Full-Time Salaries, BenefitsMontgomery County lawmaker says bill in the works that would require full-time jobs and health benefitsBy Aaron KrautAn office cleaner at a rally Tuesday in Bethesda demanding more full-time jobs in Montgomery County Aaron KrautAbout two dozen office janitors and cleaners marched Tuesday through Bethesda\u2019s Metro Plaza, demanding more full-time positions and the health benefits that come with them amid tense negotiations over their union\u2019s next collective bargaining agreement.\nAbout 90 percent of the cleaners that the union represents in Montgomery County are Hispanic.\nContreras said many must work second jobs and that about 85 percent of union members in the county work part time.\nJaime Contreras, vice president of the regional 32BJ chapter, said there are about 20 commercial properties in Montgomery County that are part of the union\u2019s contract\u2014most are in Bethesda, Rockville and Silver Spring.\nWorkers said that tactic allows the contractors to avoid having to pay for benefits such as health insurance."}
