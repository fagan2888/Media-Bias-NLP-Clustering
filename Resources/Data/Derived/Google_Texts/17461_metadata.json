Dick Durbin sported a tie suitable for Halloween as he spoke on the Senate floor Tuesday, but his orange had a much different meaning: The Illinois Democrat was plugging National Gun Violence Awareness Day, an idea with roots in his home state.\n\nAs Durbin reminded his Senate colleagues, Hadiya Pendleton was just 15 years old when she was gunned down in Chicago on Jan. 29, 2013. Her death resonated nationally because just one week before, she had played with her King College Prep High School band at President Barack Obama\u2019s second inauguration.\n\nSince then, Pendleton\u2019s friends have been active in trying to get guns off the streets. They started a group called Project Orange Tree, which joined forces with the Michael Bloomberg-backed Everytown for Gun Safety and similar groups. They stood together to create the first National Gun Violence Awareness Day on June 2.\n\n\u201cThey decided that they would ask us to wear something orange today,\u201d Durbin explained. \u201cThe color that hunters use when they\u2019re in the woods to make sure no one shoots them.\u201d\n\nWhile Durbin showed his support on the Senate floor, some of his peers \u2013 including Sens. Ed Markey, D-Mass., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Al Franken, D-Minn. \u2013 used Twitter to get their constituents involved.\n\nA number of celebrities also pledged support, but the effort got the National Rifle Association riled up. The NRA called the day \u201cpointless\u201d and classified it as \u201can easy way of scoring points for being \u2018socially conscious.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that quite a few presumably well-meaning celebrities are caught up in a thinly veiled anti-gun stunt orchestrated by Bloomberg and friends,\u201d reads a post on the NRA America\u2019s 1st Freedom website.\n\nIgnoring the NRA's assessment, here's a group of politicians and celebrities who are #WearingOrange on Twitter:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Durbin, Richard", "title": "Why Are Politicians and Celebrities #WearingOrange Today?", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "June 2 is the first National Gun Violence Awareness Day.", "title": "Why Are Politicians and Celebrities #WearingOrange Today?", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/02/why-are-politicians-and-celebrities-wearingorange-today", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/1e/da/e4ea3c81452290cf7a76e8b62815/150602-editorial.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "June 2 is the first National Gun Violence Awareness Day.", "card": "summary", "title": "Why Are Politicians and Celebrities #WearingOrange Today?"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "June 2, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nikki Schwab,Pulse,social,gun control and gun rights,guns,Durbin, Richard", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "June 2 is the first National Gun Violence Awareness Day."}, "article_summary": "Ignoring the NRA's assessment, here's a group of politicians and celebrities who are #WearingOrange on Twitter:\nThey stood together to create the first National Gun Violence Awareness Day on June 2.\nA number of celebrities also pledged support, but the effort got the National Rifle Association riled up.\n\u201cThey decided that they would ask us to wear something orange today,\u201d Durbin explained.\nAs Durbin reminded his Senate colleagues, Hadiya Pendleton was just 15 years old when she was gunned down in Chicago on Jan. 29, 2013."}
