The software would have allowed the hackers to steal files and passwords as well as intercept all Skype calls and instant messages.\n\nThe cyberattackers tried to infiltrate the computers via a fake email with an attached Microsoft Word Document that contained the malicious spyware.\n\nIt\u2019s an updated version of a similar attack launched on the ESAT reporters in December 2013, the researchers said.\n\nThey believe the Ethiopian government was behind both incidents, based on an analysis of the email addresses and servers tied to the attacks.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said the attempts fit with the country\u2019s poor record on press freedom.\n\nThe country has a long history of jailing journalists and shutting down media outlets, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\nThe digital component has given the country another outlet to try and control the press, Wong said.\n\n\u201cEthiopia\u2019s government has over the past year intensified its assault on media freedom by systematically trying to silence journalists,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Researchers say Ethiopia is hacking journalists to stop news from reaching its citizens.", "description": "Researchers say Ethiopia is hacking journalists to stop news from reaching its citizens.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Researchers say Ethiopia is hacking journalists to stop news from reaching its citizens.", "title": "Ethiopia targets D.C. journalists with cyberattack", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/235037-ethiopia-targets-dc-based-journalists-with-cyberattack", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/235037-ethiopia-targets-dc-based-journalists-with-cyberattack", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-09T10:16-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-09T10:16:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/235037-ethiopia-targets-dc-based-journalists-with-cyberattack", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Researchers say Ethiopia is hacking journalists to stop news from reaching its citizens.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ethiopia targets D.C. journalists with cyberattack"}, "dcterms.title": "Ethiopia targets D.C. journalists with cyberattack"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ed4\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTESAT is an independent news outlet run by Ethiopian journalists who left their home country after being subjected to government threats or criminal charges.\nHuman Rights Watch said the attempts fit with the country\u2019s poor record on press freedom.\nThe country has a long history of jailing journalists and shutting down media outlets, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\nResearchers at the University of Toronto uncovered attempts by the Ethiopian government to hack into the computers of U.S.-based journalists working with Ethiopian Satellite Television (ESAT).\n\u201cEthiopia\u2019s government has over the past year intensified its assault on media freedom by systematically trying to silence journalists,\u201d she said."}
