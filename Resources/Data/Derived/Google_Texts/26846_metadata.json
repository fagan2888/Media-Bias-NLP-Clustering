But in early 1920, as the Roaring Twenties jumped into full swing, the only newfound freedom women enjoyed came in the form of bobbed haircuts and rising hemlines.\n\nThen, on August 18, the 19th Amendment was ratified. For the first time, women in the United States were able to take their voices to the polls.\n\nMillions of women cast their very first votes on November 2, 1920, during the presidential election of Warren G. Harding.\n\nThe date marked a turning point in American history, and a victory for those who fought for roughly 70 years for the right to vote, including leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott.\n\nThese early pioneers gathered around 200 women in July, 1848, at Seneca Falls, New York, for the first women\u2019s rights convention in the United States.\n\nStanton and Mott first met in 1840 at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, which they attended despite not being allowed on the convention floor due to their gender. Bonding over this exclusion, Stanton and Mott vowed to fight for equal rights.\n\nSoon, they were joined by Susan B. Anthony, a suffragist at the time known for being arrested and fined $100 after registering to vote in Rochester, N.Y., during the 1872 election of President Ulysses S. Grant. Anthony, a champion for women\u2019s rights, swiftly fought back with a petition to Congress, arguing \u201cthat the fine imposed upon your petitioner be remitted, as an expression of the sense of this high tribunal that her conviction was unjust.\u201d\n\nWith the deaths of Stanton and Anthony in the early 1900s, new leaders took charge.\n\nWomen\u2019s voting rights began to take hold at the state level as many states\u2014Washington, California, Oregon, Arizona, and Kansas, to name a few\u2014 began to grant women the right to vote between 1910 and 1918.\n\nIn 1918, President Woodrow Wilson changed his stance on women\u2019s suffrage and became the first president in office to support the ratification of the 19th Amendment.\n\n\u201cI regard the extension of suffrage to women as vitally essential to the successful prosecution of the great war of humanity in which we are engaged,\u201d Wilson said, as reported by The New York Times.\n\nThe Susan B. Anthony Amendment was proposed in Congress in May of 1919. Now known as the 19th Amendment, it passed in both the House and Senate.\n\nThe Amendment was then sent to the states for ratification. Thirty-five states passed it by the end of March 1920, leaving it just one state short of the two-thirds majority that was needed.\n\nFinally, on this day 95 years ago, Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment after a tie in the state legislator brought the deciding vote to 24-year-old representative Harry T. Burn.\n\nBurn\u2019s unexpected decision to side with women\u2019s rights activists like Carrie Chapman Catt came about after a change of heart within 11 hours of the vote.\n\nAs it turns out, Burn had received a note from his mother that read, \u201cBe a good boy and help Mrs. Catt put the \u2018rat\u2019 in ratification.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 95th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment on August 18th marks an historic date for women's voting rights.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The 95th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment on August 18th marks an historic date for women's voting rights.", "title": "95th Anniversary of 19th Amendment\u2019s Ratification", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150818_SusanB.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-18T19:06:38+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Ljc4Gr"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The 95th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment on August 18th marks an historic date for women's voting rights.", "title": "95th Anniversary of 19th Amendment\u2019s Ratification", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150818_SusanB.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Evergreen Topics", "tag": "founding principles", "published_time": "2015-08-18T15:13:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-18T19:06:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "19th Amendment, women's suffrage, Susan B.
