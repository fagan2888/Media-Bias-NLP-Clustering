You can only get to Shell Island by water, but that doesn't mean it's free from trash.

Volunteers spent the weekend cleaning up the island. They filled an entire dumpster with about 30 trash bags.

Organizers say much of the litter was left behind on the island or had washed up on shore.

Sixteen local volunteers patterned with the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics.

The group is based out of Boulder, Colorado and picked Panama City Beach and St. Andrews State Park as one of six "hot spots" it's working with this year.

Despite the similar name, the group is not affiliated with the area's three-year-old Leave no Trace ordinance.

But organizers say they share a similar goal to the law to educate the community on how to reduce impact on shared land.
