Steve Beshear in July 2012 issued an executive order creating Kynect, a state-run health insurance exchange heavily dependent on federal subsidies.\n\nGov.-elect Matt Bevin in the 2015 gubernatorial campaign promised to undo \u2013 also by executive order \u2013 programs created by the misnamed Affordable Care Act, calling it \u201ca disaster for Kentucky\u2019s taxpayers.\u201d\n\nBeshear created Kynect by executive fiat out of frustration with the failure of the politically gridlocked legislature to climb aboard Obamacare\u2019s train as it huffed and puffed through the Bluegrass State.\n\nLegislators\u2019 concerns \u2013 members of both parties wanted to slow that train down \u2013 have again been confirmed with the recent announcement by the Kentucky Health Cooperative, Kynect\u2019s largest insurance provider, that it\u2019s shutting down.\n\nThe co-op, which has sold 75 percent of the policies on Beshear\u2019s exchange, is closing down after losing $50 million last year \u2013 the most of any of the 22 Obamacare-subsidized co-ops nationwide.\n\nKentucky Republican and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell effectively drove home the point about how this failure overlaps the entire Obamacare debacle in causing real harm to real people.\n\nReferencing the most-deceptive statement ever \u2013 and repeatedly \u2013 made about federal health-care reform by President Obama himself that \u201cif you like your health care plan, you keep your health care plan,\u201d McConnell noted that the 51,000 Kentuckians losing their plans because of the co-op\u2019s shutdown \u201cmay now be losing the health insurance they had and liked twice within the past three years because of Obamacare\u2019s failures.\u201d\n\nBeshear waves the protests aside, claiming it\u2019s really not a big deal since those obtaining insurance through the cooperative still have multiple choices between insurers on the exchange.\n\nBut what if they want to keep their existing plan?\n\nOnly minor surgery on this policy is required to discover: Obamacare is an absurdly schizophrenic scheme that both forces people who don\u2019t even want a plan to purchase one or face IRS penalties while at the same time causing people to lose plans they had and liked.\n\nIt\u2019s also an unsustainable policy.\n\nHow many businesses, for example, could bleed at the rate of the co-op and keep their doors open?\n\nIt\u2019s an uncertain policy, especially in terms of the federal government\u2019s failure to keep its promise to prop up plans \u2013 like the soon-to-be-defunct Kentucky co-op, which bled cash while funding claims of previously uninsured \u2013 and unhealthy \u2013 clients who rushed to the doctor\u2019s office after obtaining a Kynect card.\n\nThe feds, which pledged to assist state exchanges forced to pay out far more in claims than originally anticipated to cover these losses, sent less than $10 million of the $77 million expected by the Kentucky co-op.\n\nNot even the co-op\u2019s steep premium increases during the past two years could plug such a gap.\n\nAllow for the fact that no federal bailout money will be provided to Kynect after 2016 \u2013 resulting in Standard and Poor\u2019s conclusion that Kynect is in serious financial trouble \u2013 and the wisdom of legislators wanting to move slower is justified.\n\nConsidering all but one of Kynect\u2019s insurers hiked premium rates this year and a Families USA report indicating one in four people with insurance plans purchased through government-operated exchanges skip doctor\u2019s visits and important medical tests because of struggles to pay premiums and high deductibles \u2013 with the number being closer to one in three among poorer enrollees, Bevin\u2019s assessment on the campaign trail that Obamacare is a \u201cdisaster\u201d is more than defensible.\n\nFinally, the likely unconstitutionality of a unilateral executive order creating a government program involving taxpayer expenditures \u2013 which, gridlocked or not, remains the legislature\u2019s prerogative \u2013 means Beshear\u2019s successor has an airtight case, arguably even an obligation, to rid the commonwealth of the Kynect disaster.\n\nJim Waters is president of the Bluegrass Institute, Kentucky\u2019s free-market think tank.
