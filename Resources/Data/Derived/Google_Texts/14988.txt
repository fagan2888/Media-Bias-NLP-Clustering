Panama City Beach, FL---Saturday night at Frank Brown Park, the United States Specialty Sports Association hosted it's Military Winter World Softball Tournament as members of our five branches of the military played under the lights in an all day affair.

Initially, the action was to carry over to Sunday, but with rain concerns affecting those plans, action was condensed into one day of play.

24 men and women teams playing for seeding, as many will be looking to return to Frank Brown for the World Tournament, the league's championship that starts in August.
