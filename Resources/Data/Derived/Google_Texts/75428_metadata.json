Porter, said that\u2019s only part of his father\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to do enough interviews and there\u2019s a lot of great stories in the paper about what he\u2019s left \u2014 the tangible things we can all see: the state college, the hospital, the sports complex, the Shops at Wiregrass,\u201d Porter said. \u201cAll those things... and they probably meant the least to him. What meant the most to him was his family and leaving a legacy through us.\u201d\n\nDaughter Quinn Miller said her dad was \u201ctough as nails and demanded excellence in everything we did.\u201d But he also loved his wife and kids unconditionally. \u201cHe was my rock.\u201d\n\nLong before he was a millionaire developer and philanthropist, Don Porter was the eldest of three boys growing up on the family ranch and learning to driver a tractor at age 6. He confided to his cousin, Mike Gramling, that he had nightmares about being trampled by the cattle while he tossed them their food pellets.\n\nThe family lived in a house on State Road 54. It was an old moonshiners\u2019 cabin, and they lived without electricity for the first three years. \u201cHis mother cooked dinner every night on a 1-canister Coleman camp stove,\u201d Gramling said.\n\nHe and his two brothers were educated in a one-room school house, and he became such an avid reader he started high school a year early.\n\nAt Pasco High School, he was the star pitcher whose curveball was so devastating he once struck out 20 of the 21 batters he faced. He earned a baseball scholarship to the University of Mississippi, where he became an All-American and conference champion and later played professionally.\n\nHe never owned a store-bought shirt until he left for college \u2014 at age 16. Before that day, every shirt he ever had worn was hand sewn by his mother using material from old flour sacks.\n\nFamily friend Will Roberts said that by the 1980s Porter had developed his own fashion sense, which became a bit of a legend in still-rural Wesley Chapel. \u201cHe had more sweaters than Bill Cosby,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the earliest memories I have of Don was him coaching third base in 1988 in San Ann Little League. He was standing on third, wearing a sweater and black leather pants.\u201d\n\nFlorida House Speaker Will Weatherford said the two became friends despite Porter\u2019s disdain for politicians. Their shared love and sense of community drew them to each other. Weatherford said he viewed Porter as \u201ca quiet giant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never knew anybody who could speak less and say more than Don Porter,\u201d he said. About five years ago, he received a beautifully-wrapped Christmas gift from Porter. As he learned on Saturday, it was the ultimate sign of respect.\n\n\u201cI never understood why he got me a sweater, so thanks for unraveling that mystery,\u201d Weatherford said.\n\nPorter\u2019s personal library was even more voluminous than his sweater collection, according to close friend Doug Manson. He read everything from sonnets to science fiction, and he loaned them to his friends.\n\n\u201cFor 10 years, almost every book I read was either loaned to me or recommended to me by Don Porter,\u201d Manson said. \u201cHe lived what he spoke. He taught me that being a man is being passionate and being compassionate.\u201d\n\nlkinsler@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 371-1852\n\nTwitter @LKinslerTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 12 Jul 2014 18:51:21 -0400", "Description": "WESLEY CHAPEL \u2014 Friends and family crowded into an auditorium on the college campus that bears his name to honor the legacy of Don Porter, who helped transform Wiregrass Ranch into the economi", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "WESLEY CHAPEL \u2014 Friends and family crowded into an auditorium on the college campus that bears his name to honor the legacy of Don Porter, who helped transform Wiregrass Ranch into the economi", "title": "Pasco visionary, family man Don Porter remembered", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/pasco-visionary-family-man-don-porter-remembered-20140712/", "image": {"width": 1235, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140712/ARTICLE/140719762/EP/1/2/EP-140719762.jpg", "height": 1533}, "updated_time": "2014-07-12T18:57:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "WESLEY CHAPEL \u2014 Friends and family crowded into an auditorium on the college campus that bears his name to honor the legacy of Don Porter, who helped transform Wiregrass Ranch into the econo", "title": "Pasco visionary, family man Don Porter remembered", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140712/ARTICLE/140719762/AR/0/AR-140719762.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-07-12T18:51:21Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-07-12T18:57:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFor 10 years, almost every book I read was either loaned to me or recommended to me by Don Porter,\u201d Manson said.\nWeatherford said he viewed Porter as \u201ca quiet giant.\u201d\u201cI never knew anybody who could speak less and say more than Don Porter,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHe was my rock.\u201dLong before he was a millionaire developer and philanthropist, Don Porter was the eldest of three boys growing up on the family ranch and learning to driver a tractor at age 6.\nFriends and family crowded into an auditorium on the college campus that bears his name to honor the legacy of Don Porter, who helped transform Wiregrass Ranch into the economic engine of Pasco County.\nThe family lived in a house on State Road 54."}
