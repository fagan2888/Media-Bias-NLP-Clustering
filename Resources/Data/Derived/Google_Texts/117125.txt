You may have seen a movement gone viral on social media this week.

It's called the "Ice Bucket Challenge," and it aims to raise awareness about ALS, or Lou Gehrig disease.

NewsChannel 7's Weekend Anchor Cristina Pfeffer was nominated by a friend from college to complete the Ice Bucket Challenge.

And now she's challenging Weekend Sports Anchor Greg Brzozowski and Meteorologist Tyler Allender!

The team has 24 hours to complete the challenge, or they must donate $100 to the ALS Association.

To learn more about ALS or to donate to the organization, you can visit the ALS Association website at alsa.org.
