It was a surprise concert to recognize volunteers in the community.\n\n\u201cWell, I thought, what am I going to wear,\u201d said Dot Adkins, who got one of the limited concert tickets.\n\nAdkins and her husband, Don, were VIPs at the concert. They were invited for their work with the homeless, hospitals and schools.\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to promote is volunteerism and we are excited to see so many people that volunteer,\u201d Dot said.\n\nThe Adkins were some of a few hundred guests invited out for the concert, put on by State Farm \u201cNeighborhood Sessions\u201d. It is a program that offers the biggest names in music a chance to give back to their communities with a local party.\n\n\u201cOh I'm here to support Toby Keith, he's amazing, he gives back to this community,\u201d said Sheri Bookout.\n\nHowever, keeping the location secret from the guests was hard to do.\n\n\u201cThe registration and getting on the bus, everyone was trying to figure out what are we doing, what does this mean, so it was exciting to walk out and see this,\u201d said Talor Reazin.\n\nToby Keith chose to have the private concert at Hollywood Corners, a 1920s gas station he recently bought and remodeled into a deli. He wanted to keep everything local for the surprise concert, just like the special guests he invited.\n\n\u201cWhen I found out it was him, that's what surprised me even more,\u201d said concert goer Walter Reif. \u201cI thought, \u2018Gosh, these people must be coming in from all over the country,\u2019 but from what I can see, they are all locals,\u201d Reif added.\n\nKeith performed a dozen songs, including the new hit \u201c35 Mile Per Hour Town,\u201d and repeatedly thanked the volunteers for helping their own 35-mile-per-hour towns.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to feel good every day, find some place where, a school that you can read to first or second graders,\u201d said volunteer Don Adkins.\n\nA production team filmed the concert and will air it in a documentary on TBS in October. The exact date has not been released.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Oklahoma's Own Toby Keith serenaded a special group in Norman on Tuesday night.", "author": "Lacie Lowry", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/29946990/toby-keith-holds-surprise-concert-for-oklahoma-volunteers", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8716415_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Oklahoma's Own Toby Keith serenaded a special group in Norman on Tuesday night.", "title": "Toby Keith Holds Surprise Concert For Oklahoma Volunteers"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8716415_G.jpg", "description": "Oklahoma's Own Toby Keith serenaded a special group in Norman on Tuesday night.", "card": "summary", "title": "Toby Keith Holds Surprise Concert For Oklahoma Volunteers"}, "wnreadableurl": "toby-keith-holds-surprise-concert-for-oklahoma-volunteers", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/09/02", "KEYWORDS": "Volunteer Work, Toby Keith, concert, Norman, State Farm, Neighborhood Sessions, okc, news 9, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS21", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "Volunteer Work, Toby Keith, concert, Norman, State Farm, Neighborhood Sessions, okc, news 9, kwtv"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOh I'm here to support Toby Keith, he's amazing, he gives back to this community,\u201d said Sheri Bookout.\nHe wanted to keep everything local for the surprise concert, just like the special guests he invited.\nIt was a surprise concert to recognize volunteers in the community.\nToby Keith chose to have the private concert at Hollywood Corners, a 1920s gas station he recently bought and remodeled into a deli.\nOklahoma's Own Toby Keith serenaded a special group in Norman on Tuesday night."}
