During an interview on Adam Carolla\u2019s podcast, Take A Knee, Mel Brooks announced his intention to make a sequel to Spaceballs, his 1987 sci-fi spoof. He hopes to have the sequel in theaters to coincide with the release of J.J. Abrams\u2019 new Star Wars trilogy, as the originals were obvious targets for satire the first time around.\n\nBrooks said he would use the title Spaceballs 2: The Search For More Money (a gag from the original film), and would start shooting shortly after Star Wars: Episode VII: The Force Awakens debuts. Presumably, the moichandising machine will be fired up to coincide with the release of Star Wars: Episode VIII: Turn Off The Dark Side.\n\nThere is, of course, a catch\u2014because even in the future, nothing works. Brooks said he would like to reunite the original cast\u2014minus the late John Candy and Joan Rivers, naturally\u2014and that the whole enterprise hinges on coaxing Rick Moranis out of retirement. Moranis played villain Dark Helmet in the original, and his wild swings between Vader-esque villain and his usual nebbish persona were the film\u2019s highlight. \u201cI\u2019ve got the helmet in storage, just waiting for him,\u201d said Brooks. But the director has been in contact with Moranis in recent years and says he\u2019s \u201creally strict\u201d about staying retired. Moranis\u2019 last on-screen appearance was the 1997 direct-to-video sequel Honey We Shrunk Ourselves. Since then, he\u2019s done some voice work in a few kids movies, but the last of those was direct-to-video sequel Brother Bear 2 in 2006. Perhaps Brooks can remind Moranis he won\u2019t be doing it for the money... he\u2019ll be doing it for a shitload of money!\n\nSend your Newswire tips to tips@avclub.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "", "og": {"url": "http://www.avclub.com/article/mel-brooks-wants-make-spaceballs-2-214952", "image": "http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/5335/80/16x9/1200.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Schwartz awakens!
