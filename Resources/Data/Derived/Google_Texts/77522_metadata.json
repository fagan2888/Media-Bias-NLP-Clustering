(AP) - Paducah residents upset over sky high electric rates thanks to cost overruns at a new power plant say they have no idea when they might get some relief.\n\nElectric utility officials spoke at the city commission meeting last week, and the public was given a chance to ask questions about the high electric rates.\n\nMany echoed the concerns of Vicky Holland, a single mother of two who said her electric bills have been $900 a month. Holland said had to take on extra jobs last winter to help pay her bills, The Paducah Sun reported (http://bit.ly/1pdtUe8).\n\n\u201cIf I lose my house, I will seek a lawyer,\u201d she said at the meeting Tuesday night.\n\nThe local electric utility, Paducah Power System, has a contract for electricity from the Prairie State Energy Campus, a southwestern Illinois power plant that was funded by municipalities like Paducah and other small Midwestern communities. The 1,600-megawatt plant ended up costing about $4 billion to develop - twice the original estimate.\n\nThe Sun has reported that Paducah residents pay some of the highest electricity rates in the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the most serious problem for Paducah since the Great Flood,\u201d Mayor Gayle Kaler said. \u201cIt really is.\u201d\n\nAlong with Prairie State executives, Rick Soderholm of Leidos Engineering also attended the forum. Soderholm wrote the original engineering report for the Prairie State project. At the meeting, he acknowledged Paducah\u2019s rates are higher than they should be, but said he expected rates to decline, though he and other officials could not say when.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re convinced \u2026 that going forward, your rates are going to be very, very stable,\u201d he said.\n\nCity Commissioner Sandra Wilson said she wasn\u2019t sure from the company\u2019s presentation that rates would decrease.\n\n\u201cI appreciate you saying you think we\u2019re going to get to a stable rate, but to me, a stable rate doesn\u2019t mean lower. It just means it\u2019s going to be stable and it could mean stable at a high rate,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nThe Kentucky Municipal Power Agency, which is comprised of the Paducah Power System and the Princeton (Kentucky) Electric Plant Board, owns nearly eight percent of Prairie State.\n\nAt the end of Tuesday\u2019s meeting, the commission passed a resolution ordering the Paducah Power System board to hire independent specialists to look into the original decision to invest in Prairie State and find ways to help customers pay their bills.\n\n\u201cI do think the Paducah Power board is really struggling with what to do,\u201d Commissioner Carol Gault said. \u201cI truly feel the current board members understand the dilemma, but they just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paducah residents upset over sky high electric rates thanks to cost overruns at a new power plant say they have no idea when they might get some relief.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/27/paducah-residents-say-electric-bills-too-high/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Paducah residents upset over sky high electric rates thanks to cost overruns at a new power plant say they have no idea when they might get some relief.", "title": "Paducah residents say electric bills too high"}, "twitter": {"title": "Paducah residents say electric bills too high", "description": "Paducah residents upset over sky high electric rates thanks to cost overruns at a new power plant say they have no idea when they might get some relief.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5a36\"", "article_summary": "PADUCAH, Ky.
