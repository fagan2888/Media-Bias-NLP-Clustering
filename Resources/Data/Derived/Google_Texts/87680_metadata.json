To see an index of past questions, read Bazar\u2019s column at www.centerforhealthreporting.org.\n\nIt\u2019s that joyous time of year when W-2s, 1099s and the other forms we need for our taxes start landing in our mailboxes.\n\nA new form debuts this year \u2014 the 1095-A, which goes to people who purchased health insurance through Covered California (and other health insurance exchanges around the country).\n\nBut 1095-A is just the beginning. Obamacare made some big changes to the tax system, and as a result, filing will be more complicated for some people.\n\nQ: There\u2019s supposedly an exemption to the Obamacare insurance requirement if you can\u2019t find an affordable health plan. But I\u2019m having difficulty obtaining information about it. Can you explain?\n\nA: There is indeed such an exemption, as well as many others.\n\nFirst, a refresher: the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires most people to have health insurance or face a tax penalty. If you were uninsured for all \u2014 or part \u2014 of last year, judgment day is approaching come April 15.\n\nI won\u2019t describe the actual penalty amounts in detail because I\u2019ve written about them before. (You can search my previous columns at centerforhealthreporting.org.)\n\nIn short, some of you could owe hundreds or thousands of dollars for remaining uninsured last year. But Obamacare gives some people an out in the form of exemptions. And by \u201csome people,\u201d I\u2019m talking millions.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has predicted that roughly 30 million still will be uninsured in 2016, when the penalties reach their maximum levels. Of those, it estimates more than 23 million will qualify for one or more exemptions.\n\nTo see a complete list of exemptions, google \u201chealthcare.gov Obamacare exemptions.\u201d (Trust me.) Meanwhile, to give you an idea, here are ways you can qualify:\n\n\u2022 You\u2019re uninsured for less than three consecutive months of the year.\n\n\u2022 You didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid because your state didn\u2019t expand eligibility for the program under Obamacare. (This doesn\u2019t apply to Californians, because we did.)\n\n\u2022 You cannot find \u201caffordable\u201d coverage, meaning the cost of your premium would be more than 8 percent of household income.\n\n\u2022 Your household income is low enough that you\u2019re not required to file a federal tax return. For 2014, the tax-filing threshold is $10,150 for individuals under 65 and $20,300 for married couples filing jointly. (You don\u2019t have to file a return to obtain this exemption.)\n\n\u2022 You qualify for one of 14 \u201chardships\u201d that include homelessness, domestic violence, the death of a close family member and bankruptcy. You can find all of them on the healthcare.gov website. Two warnings: You\u2019ll need to prove some of them, and these exemptions aren\u2019t necessarily granted for the full year but rather based on the duration of the hardship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if there were one simple way to apply for an exemption? It would ... but there isn\u2019t. Also, assuming you\u2019re eligible, you have to reapply each year, says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, it\u2019s automatic. You don\u2019t have to lift a finger. In other cases, you just check a box on your tax return,\u201d she says, adding that \u201cin some cases, you would have to file a written application.\u201d\n\nIn general, it\u2019s the federal government, not the state, that approves \u2014 or denies \u2014 your exemption.\n\nSo, how do you know which exemption requires which action? Again, please trust me when I suggest you google \u201cIRS chart ACA exemptions.\u201d\n\nThe tax preparation software TurboTax estimates that three of four people eligible for exemptions will automatically qualify when they file their tax returns.\n\nWhat about the others?\n\nThis brings me back to the original question about the affordability exemption, which applies when the minimum amount you would have paid for health insurance is more than 8 percent of your household income.\n\nThis exemption can be claimed on your taxes but requires you to fill out a worksheet. You\u2019ll need to figure out what the lowest-cost bronze plan from Covered California or the cheapest coverage from your employer would have cost you. Math is required.\n\n\u201cMy piece of advice for people is to make sure you\u2019re not eligible for any other exemption first,\u201d says Tara Straw, senior health policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cThis is kind of like your last-ditch exemption.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a way to apply for the affordability exemption for months in the future, as opposed to requesting it on your taxes for the previous year. Why would you do this? Well, one reason is by showing you can\u2019t afford regular plans, you could become eligible for a cheaper catastrophic plan with much higher out-of-pocket costs.\n\nTo apply proactively, you have to fill out a different complicated form, available at marketplace.cms.gov.\n\nLuckily, there\u2019s help.\n\nTo start, Straw suggests you download the IRS instructions for the exemptions, called \u201c2014 Instructions for Form 8965.\u201d\n\nAnd TurboTax, for example, offers a free, online tool (www.TurboTaxExemptionCheck.com) that can help determine whether you qualify for any of the exemptions, and, if so, help you apply.\n\nSince we\u2019re dealing with tax laws, bureaucracies, crunching numbers, human error and more, my best advice would be to consult a tax professional, especially for one of the more complicated exemptions.\n\nIn the end, thankfully, most people will get to avoid this process altogether. \u201cIf you had coverage all year long, there\u2019s just a box on your taxes that says, \u2018I had coverage for all 12 months of 2014,\u2019 \u201d Pollitz says. \u201cIf you can check yes, you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like to submit a query, email AskEmily@usc.edu.
