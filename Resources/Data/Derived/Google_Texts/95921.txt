Millions of immigrants benefiting from President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration could get a windfall from the IRS.

That's a reversal of fortune after years of paying taxes to help fund government programs they were banned from receiving.

Armed with new Social Security numbers, many of these immigrants will be able to claim up to four years' worth of tax credits geared to helping the working poor. For big families, that's a maximum of nearly $24,000, as long as they can document their earnings during those years.

Some Republicans are labeling the payments "amnesty bonuses" - one more reason they oppose Obama's program shielding millions of immigrants from deportation.

Advocates for immigrants say if these workers are paying taxes, they should get the same benefits as other taxpayers.
