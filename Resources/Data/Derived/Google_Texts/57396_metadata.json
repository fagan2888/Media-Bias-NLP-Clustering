But it looks like a smart move so far.\n\nAmerisourceBergen (ABC) recently announced that it expects adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal year 2014 to increase 21 to 23% from last year with revenue growth in the 35% range. Analysts cite the Walgreen (WAG) joint venture as a key to AmerisourceBergen\u2019s performance well into the future.\n\n\u201cThey think outside the box,\u201d said Steven Halper, senior vice president at FBR Capital Markets in New York City. \u201cIf you asked me five years ago if they could do a deal like that, I\u2019d have said no.\u201d\n\nWith over $100 billion in annual revenue, the Chesterbrook, Pa.-based company primarily distributes drugs \u2014 both generics and specialty pharmaceuticals \u2014 and other health care products. It also provides pharmacy management, consulting and logistics services.\n\nA Frugal Culture\n\nThe company acquired its current name in 2001 when AmeriSource Health merged with Bergen Brunswig. Then-CEO David Yost led the firm through the merger and retired a decade later \u2014 after spending more than 36 years at the company.\n\nYost helped craft the organizational culture, Halper says, emphasizing execution, frugality and customer service.\n\n\u201cYost used to say, \u2018Our competitors stay at the Ritz-Carlton, but we stay at the Holiday Inn when we see clients,'\u201d Halper recalled.\n\nSteven Collis replaced Yost as CEO in 2011. Over his 20-year career at the company, Collis has risen through the ranks and reinforced its culture.\n\n\u201cI love to see promotion from within,\u201d Halper said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone better than Collis to run the company, given his history and his experience.\u201d\n\nHalper used to work at a firm that hosted Collis at several investor meetings. The CEO was impressive.\n\n\u201cHis command of the company\u2019s fundamentals is extremely strong,\u201d Halper said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s got the appropriate level of long-term insight.\u201d\n\nThanks to Collis\u2019s long-term focus, AmerisourceBergen can stay ahead of industry trends and orchestrate change effectively. With a workforce of about 13,000, the company has low employee turnover and low customer attrition, Halper says.\n\nUnder Collis, the firm\u2019s strategic moves have boosted profitability and enhanced its potential for global growth. In announcing the Walgreen deal in 2013, Collis said, \u201cImportantly, these agreements not only expand our U.S. business but also provide opportunities to meaningfully grow our specialty and manufacturer services businesses internationally.\u201d\n\nAs part of his long-term strategy, Collis allocates capital with an eye on future events and their repercussions for his business. Part of his rationale for the Walgreen joint venture involved thinking ahead to how the Affordable Care Act would affect AmerisourceBergen.\n\n\u201cThey have always been committed to operational excellence,\u201d said Ross Muken, senior managing director at ISI Group in New York City. \u201cThey\u2019ve invested in IT (information technology) and warehousing, and been very intelligent in where they\u2019ve invested capital.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2013, AmerisourceBergen inked a 10-year drug distribution deal with Walgreen that took some industry observers by surprise.
