The Reproductive Health Law was signed by President Benigno Aquino III in 2012, but it has languished in the courts ever since thanks to challenges from faith-based lobbies.\n\n\n\nThe Catholic Church, along with other faith groups, filed a total of 14 lawsuits in a mostly failed attempt to prevent the law from taking effect.\n\n\n\nThe court did strike down some of the law\u2019s provisions, much to the bishops\u2019 delight. As originally written, the law would have penalized public health providers who do not inform patients about their contraceptive options or who require parental consent from a minor seeking non-emergency reproductive health care.\n\n\n\nBut Al Jazeera reports that the major portions of the law, access to free contraceptives and the provision of comprehensive sex education in state schools, survived. \u201cThe RH law is not unconstitutional,\u201d a spokesman for the Supreme Court told local reporters.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the law are applauding the ruling as a major advance both for separation of church and state and for women\u2019s health.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis monumental decision upholds the separation of church and state and affirms the supremacy of government in secular concerns like health and socio-economic development,\u201d said Congressman Edcel Lagman, who co-sponsored the legislation.\n\n\n\nArchbishop Oscar Cruz disagreed, telling a local radio station that, \u201cIt [the law] is not really reproductive health\u2026because it prevents reproduction.\u201d According to Al Jazeera, church leaders are urging women not to take advantage of the new law, and still insist they have a \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d to see the law struck down.\n\n\n\nBut the law enjoys overwhelming public support. A recent survey revealed that 72 percent of Filipinos welcomed it, which means the bishops\u2019 efforts will likely fail. The Wall Street Journal also notes that the Philippines has a rising maternal mortality rate and a population that grows by 2 percent every year \u2013 demographic trends that development professionals agree contribute to poverty.\n\n\n\nOnce again, the bishops disagree. \u201cThey are poor not because they have no access to contraceptives but because they have no work. Give them work and it will be the most effective birth spacing means for them,\u201d said Father Melvin Castro of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines.\n\n\n\nCitation needed, but of course Castro didn\u2019t provide one.\n\n\n\nIn the Philippines, as in the United States, the Catholic bishops are out of touch with reproductive science and public opinion. Yet in both countries, the bishops have formed powerful lobbies to oppose common-sense reproductive health care, measures that are supported by most of their own parishioners.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute reports that 99 percent of all sexually active American women have relied on a contraceptive method. That figure is virtually the same for American Catholic women. According to Guttmacher, 98 percent of sexually active Catholic women have used a contraceptive method that is not natural family planning \u2013 the only method permitted by the Vatican.\n\n\n\nBut public opinion hasn\u2019t prevented U.S. Catholic bishops from pursuing their own war against reproductive health care access. They\u2019ve aggressively mobilized against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate, which requires most employers to provide employees with insurance plans that include contraceptives coverage. They don\u2019t seem deterred by the fact that most women don\u2019t believe corporations should be exempt from the mandate.\n\nCulture warriors have never been particularly inspired by facts. But sadly for the world\u2019s Catholic bishops, facts, not dogma, must inform government policy. The Filipino government should be applauded for recognizing this. Let\u2019s hope their American counterparts remember the same lesson.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"admins": "756885656, 10150361922348092"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccdaa\"", "article_summary": "But sadly for the world\u2019s Catholic bishops, facts, not dogma, must inform government policy.\nGive them work and it will be the most effective birth spacing means for them,\u201d said Father Melvin Castro of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines.\nBut public opinion hasn\u2019t prevented U.S. Catholic bishops from pursuing their own war against reproductive health care access.\nIn the Philippines, as in the United States, the Catholic bishops are out of touch with reproductive science and public opinion.\nThe Reproductive Health Law was signed by President Benigno Aquino III in 2012, but it has languished in the courts ever since thanks to challenges from faith-based lobbies."}
