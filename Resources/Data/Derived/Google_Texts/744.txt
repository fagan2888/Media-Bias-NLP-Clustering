Editor’s note: Because of technical issues, this blog did not post on Father’s Day.

Former Senate Minority Leader Mike Kopp is one of four Republican candidates running for governor and a chance to unseat Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper in November.

We asked the candidates to submit a Father’s Day picture to the Spot. Kopp chose a picture from a family vacation in 2007 at the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, but because of technical difficulties it could not be reprinted.

“Amazing how these kids have grown,” Kopp said. “I love them each dearly.”

Kopp and his first wife, Kimberly, who died of cancer in 2011, have four children: Meghan, 18; Ethan, 16; Allie, 14; and Soren, 7. Kopp has since remarried, to Shannon. A recent video of the governor’s candidates in their cribs showed Kopp and his kids and their bees and chickens.

Kopp’s father, Don, is a state representative in the South Dakota Legislature.
