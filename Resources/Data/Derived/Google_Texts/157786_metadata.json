Although Sean Davis is right: In an era of unilateral presidential lawmaking, Congress attempting to set policy with bipartisan support (this one got 63 votes last month) itself qualifies as \u201ccircumventing longstanding processes.\u201d\n\nMcConnell says he\u2019s going to try to override Obama\u2019s veto with 67 Senate votes but no one thinks he can pull that many. The question now is whether Obama will use the veto as a bargaining chip, with approval of Keystone to follow if the GOP plays ball on another of his priorities, or if this is just a favor to his fabulously wealthy environmentalist donor base that nothing else will trump. I know how I\u2019m betting.\n\nVia the Free Beacon, here\u2019s the White Press Corps laughing at Josh Earnest today when he explains why six years isn\u2019t necessarily a long time to review whether to build a pipeline. Look on the bright side: At least the Saudis will be happy.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Yep.", "title": "Obama vetoes Keystone pipeline bill because \u2026 it infringes on the executive branch\u2019s prerogatives", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/02/24/obama-vetoes-keystone-pipeline-bill-because-it-infringes-on-the-executive-branchs-prerogatives/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-24T21:41:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-25T13:31:56+00:00"}, "keywords": "Congress, keystone, Obama, override, pipeline, veto,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e61\"", "article_summary": "White House Keystone veto hitting inboxes now.\nVia the Free Beacon, here\u2019s the White Press Corps laughing at Josh Earnest today when he explains why six years isn\u2019t necessarily a long time to review whether to build a pipeline.\nLook on the bright side: At least the Saudis will be happy.\nObama vetoes Keystone pipeline bill because \u2026 it infringes on the executive branch\u2019s prerogativesposted at 4:41 pm on February 24, 2015 by AllahpunditA tip o\u2019 the cap to O, after waging unauthorized war in multiple countries, rewriting various parts of the ObamaCare statute, and proclaiming by royal decree that amnesty hath come to America, for having the mammoth balls here to complain that Congress is stepping on his turf.\nI know how I\u2019m betting."}
