Loren Crone, but it will also not be just another Monday at the office.\n\nAs millions of Americans prepare for a day filled with beer and barbecues, Lt. Crone, a chaplain at Marine Base Quantico, will be delivering an invocation at a memorial service at Quantico National Cemetery, which will take place at 11 a.m.\n\nOn a day when America honor its military veterans and those who fell in defense of the country\u2019s freedoms, chaplains face a special obligation to comfort the grieving and honor the sacrifices of all those who served.\n\nOriginally called \u201cDecoration Day,\u201d Memorial Day began in the years after the Civil War as a way to honor the dead from both sides. On the first Decoration Day in 1868, Gen. James Garfield \u2014 who would be elected president 12 years later \u2014 spoke at Arlington National Cemetery, after which 5,000 participants helped to decorate the graves of the more than 20,000 Union and Confederate soldiers interred on the grounds.\n\nIt would take more than a century before Memorial Day became a fully fledged federal holiday in 1971.\n\nFor military chaplains like Lt. Crone, a posting such as Quantico only adds to the significance of the day and to the gravity of the duties they perform each year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually one of the challenges to working here,\u201d said Lt. Crone. \u201cWhereas Arlington National Cemetery has a staff of chaplains specifically assigned to perform services, there is no such staff for Quantico National Cemetery, so the base has to support those services.\u201d\n\nQuantico National Cemetery occupies 725 acres in Northern Virginia and was formally established as a national cemetery in 1983.\n\nIn addition to delivering invocations, memorial services and benedictions, the lieutenant and his fellow chaplains on base serve over 25,000 Marines, other service members, government employees, contractors and families who work or live aboard the base. Because the job has so many facets, Lt. Crone and his colleagues often jokingly refer to themselves as \u201cmoral and morale consultants.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a \u2018typical day\u2019 for a Navy chaplain,\u201d he said in an interview late last week. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly counseling people, teaching ethics, conducting other training. Today I gave an invocation in the morning, and I\u2019ll be attending a memorial banquet tonight.\u201d\n\nThe job has been made even more difficult due to the fact that \u201cthere just are not as many chaplains as there used to be,\u201d said Lt. Crone, noting that jobs like his and others in staff roles often have to be cut when military budgets are tight. Currently serving Quantico\u2019s tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel are 11 full-time and one contracted chaplain from seven different faith traditions, including Catholicism, Islam and Protestantism.\n\nAnd while the chaplain\u2019s job comes with a \u201cclerical privilege,\u201d necessary to counseling sailors and marines, Lt. Crone\u2019s military roles, standards and responsibilities as a staff officer are just the same as his colleagues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still officers,\u201d he explained, \u201cand we\u2019re still expected to meet the same requirements as other officers, which includes physical fitness standards and height/weight requirements.\u201d\n\nThe United States Navy Chaplain Corps was established on November 28, 1775, with a primary purpose to \u201cpromote the spiritual, religious, moral and personal well-being of the members of the Department of the Navy.\u201d It is currently headed by Chief of Chaplains Rear Adm. Margaret G. Kibben, who assumed office last August.\n\nIn order to be a chaplain in the U.S. Navy, one must receive an endorsement from any of several religious denominations and faiths while also meeting the Department of Defense\u2019s requirements for military service.\n\nThe Chaplain Corps provides support for the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, Merchant Marine and Coast Guard personnel and their families. There are currently 274 Navy chaplains assigned to the United States Marine Corps alone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Memorial Day will not be a day off for Navy Lt.
