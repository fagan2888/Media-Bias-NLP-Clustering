His field-goal percentage (.485) is the second-best of his career, and his 3-point percentage (.421) destroys his previous career high of .375. He made only 23.6 percent of his shots behind the arc last season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been shooting the ball from the field, from the 3 very efficiently,\u201d said Nuggets coach Michael Malone.\n\nThe biggest reason for Arthur\u2019s reliability? Good health.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m getting my legs back under me,\u201d Arthur said.\n\nThat has been a big deal.\n\nFor the better part of the past two seasons, one injury or another impaired his ability to get in any kind of offensive rhythm. He would be missing time rehabbing or playing through injuries that didn\u2019t allow him to be as effective as he could be.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been a problem this season.\n\nArthur has missed only three games, and he has been counted on more because of injuries and absences to other members of the Nuggets\u2019 frontcourt. In the past two games, Arthur is averaging 18.0 points and 9.5 rebounds. He is shooting 69.6 percent from the field in that span.\n\nThe rebounding stands out.\n\n\u201cThe knock on D.A. is always \u2018He\u2019s this, he\u2019s that, but he\u2019s not a big rebounding forward,\u2019 \u201d Malone said. \u201cWell, I tell you what, when Kenneth (Faried) was out when his wife was having the baby, and (last Wednesday against Golden State), D.A. has shown he can shoot. You can trust him, and he can also rebound the basketball at a fairly high level.\u201d\n\nArthur, a 6-foot-9 forward, scored 18 points and grabbed eight rebounds in the Nuggets\u2019 98-95 loss to Miami on Friday.\n\n\u201cMy legs are feeling good. I think my teammates are doing a good job finding me,\u201d the Kansas product said. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a great job of moving the basketball.\u201d\n\nArthur has been everything the Nuggets hoped he would be when he re-signed with them last summer, a two-year contract in the neighborhood of $6 million, with a player option. Arthur was close to signing with the Los Angeles Clippers as a free agent, but after talking to Denver general manager Tim Connelly and Malone, Arthur was convinced the Nuggets were on the right path. He said he wanted to be a part of that.\n\nLately, he has been a big part of what the Nuggets are doing on the court.\n\n\u201cI have trust in him as a defensive anchor, as an offensive anchor,\u201d Malone said. \u201cYou feel good when he has the ball. You feel good that he\u2019s going to communicate on defense. He\u2019s going to step up and make the right play. He\u2019s been tremendous lately. I can\u2019t say enough good things about D.A.\u201d\n\nINDIANA AT DENVER 6 p.m. Sunday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Paul George:\n\nIt\u2019s his first full season back from the horrific right leg injury that he suffered two summers ago and sidelined him for most of the 2014-15 season. But as his 24.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.9 assists suggest, he\u2019s back in a big way. His shooting percentages have been down of late, but George remains a big-time threat any time he\u2019s on the court. And he continues to be one of the NBA\u2019s best two-way players.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nPacers:\n\nStarting point guard George Hill is questionable because of personal reasons. On Saturday, he posted a message on Instagram in remembrance of a close friend that passed. \u201cAll I Could DO was Sit Here And Let The Tears Fall As I Think About All The Good Memories,\u201d he wrote. \u2026 Center Ian Mahinmi (ankle) is questionable, and Rodney Stuckey (foot) will not play.\n\nNuggets:\n\nPoint guard Jameer Nelson is questionable because of a left wrist injury he suffered in the game against Miami. Meanwhile, center Jusuf Nurkic (knee) will not play. He continues to be monitored and evaluated because of soreness in his surgically repaired left knee.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets\u2019 Darrell Arthur riding good health into solid play", "title": "Nuggets\u2019 Darrell Arthur riding good health into solid play", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/nuggets-darrell-arthur-riding-good-health-into-solid-play/", "image": {"width": 526, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__BN20160117_Z00_BNSP17BKNNUGGETS1p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__BN20160117_Z00_BNSP17BKNNUGGETS1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T20:10:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:09:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Darrell Arthur has played plenty of good basketball in his career, so he won\u2019t easily say these are his best days.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been shooting the ball from the field, from the 3 very efficiently,\u201d said Nuggets coach Michael Malone.\nis always \u2018He\u2019s this, he\u2019s that, but he\u2019s not a big rebounding forward,\u2019 \u201d Malone said.\n\u201cAll I Could DO was Sit Here And Let The Tears Fall As I Think About All The Good Memories,\u201d he wrote.\nBut as his 24.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.9 assists suggest, he\u2019s back in a big way."}
