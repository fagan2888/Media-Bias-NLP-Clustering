The new layout accommodates larger social and business gatherings and offers better views of the Grill\u2019s garden and nearby Rice Park.\n\n\u201cIt makes us more accessible to group dining,\u201d Buffalo said. \u201cWe have more space for groups of 20 or 30 or 40. It helps us push forward to a new era but keeps the brand intact.\u201d\n\nThe work also included refinishing wood floors and inlaid carpets. Buffalo said diners can expect few changes to the menu, which features steaks, chops, fresh fish and other seafood, or the Grill\u2019s signature bar.\n\nBuffalo has worked in restaurants since he began busing tables as a high school student in Duluth. His 15 years in the industry includes most recently working as general manager of the reopened Figlio in St. Louis Park.\n\nHe previously was manager and wine director at the Capital Grille in Minneapolis, general manager at Il Vesco Vino in St. Paul and general manager at Osteria I Nonni in Lilydale.\n\nThe St. Paul Grill, which opened in 1990, is adjacent to the historic St. Paul Hotel and is managed by Morrissey Hospitality Companies.\n\nQ: What has motivated you to pursue a career in restaurant management?\n\nA: It\u2019s not easy and not many people can do it. You\u2019ve got to have the mentality and, of course, support from your family. But I enjoy being out in the action, when it\u2019s busy. I love talking to people and taking care of people.\n\nQ: What sort of group business are you seeing now?\n\nA: It\u2019s a mix of social [gatherings], weddings and business. We do a lot of business with the companies around here. And we\u2019ve already done many same-sex marriage celebrations at the Grill, which is great.\n\nQ: What are your goals as general manager of the Grill?\n\nA: My goal is to help build the business and build the brand. We have some different programs \u2014 scotch dinners, cigar dinners \u2014 where we have a five-course dinner and then go over to Rice Park and smoke cigars. Implementing those is going to help build the business. Group dining will, too. They\u2019ll have a great experience so then they\u2019ll come back again on their own.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A look at the people behind the numbers in area business.", "title": "Movers & Shakers: Henry Buffalo, St. Paul Grill", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/movers-shakers-henry-buffalo-st-paul-grill/227447601/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/M24051661.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/M24051661.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "A look at the people behind the numbers in area business.", "title": "Movers & Shakers: Henry Buffalo, St. Paul Grill", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/movers-shakers-henry-buffalo-st-paul-grill/227447601/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/M24051661.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/M24051661.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A look at the people behind the numbers in area business."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0184\"", "article_summary": "The St. Paul Grill, which opened in 1990, is adjacent to the historic St. Paul Hotel and is managed by Morrissey Hospitality Companies.\nHenry Buffalo, St. Paul grillTitle: General managerAge: 40Henry Buffalo, the new general manager at the St. Paul Grill, enjoys welcoming regulars, newcomers and now larger groups to the landmark downtown restaurant.\nHe previously was manager and wine director at the Capital Grille in Minneapolis, general manager at Il Vesco Vino in St. Paul and general manager at Osteria I Nonni in Lilydale.\n\u201cIt makes us more accessible to group dining,\u201d Buffalo said.\nHis 15 years in the industry includes most recently working as general manager of the reopened Figlio in St. Louis Park."}
