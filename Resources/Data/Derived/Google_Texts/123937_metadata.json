Government programs helped defray 65 percent of those costs, the study estimated. That left providers billions of dollars in the hole.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons the hospital industry was among the first groups to support President Barack Obama\u2019s health plan, agreeing to Medicare and Medicaid funding cuts exceeding $150 billion over a decade in return for getting more paying patients to reduce their uncompensated care.\n\nMany hospital executives were unnerved, therefore, when the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could not be forced to implement the Medicaid expansion and nearly half of them have refused. As a result, hospitals in non-expansion states are undergoing the funding cuts without a corresponding reduction in uncompensated care.\n\n[Read More Stories from Kaiser Health News.]\n\nBig Impact On Patients\n\n\n\nIn Seattle, Harborview had projected a $10 million gain in revenue this year because it would be able to recoup payments for services provided to the newly insured. Now, with a 10-percentage-point drop in uninsured patients in one year, the hospital system managed by the University of Washington is projecting a $20 million revenue increase on annual revenue of about $800 million, said Associate Administrator Elise Chayet.\n\nHospital officials say the biggest impact of the change is on patients themselves. Rather than having to rely on emergency rooms, newly insured patients can see primary care doctors and get diagnostic tests and prescription drugs, among other services.\n\nSome safety-net hospitals say they started to see their numbers of uninsured patients dropping almost immediately after the Medicaid expansion took effect in January.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a steady decline in our uninsured visits,\u201d said Roxane Townsend, CEO of UAMS. \u201cWe did not anticipate this big a drop this quickly.\u201d\n\nAbout 80 percent of the system\u2019s new Medicaid patients had previously been seen by the hospital as uninsured patients, she said. Their enrollment in coverage means the hospital is paid more for their care and is able to direct them to outpatient services and preventive care.\n\nShe said that UAMS has also seen a drop in ER visits by uninsured patients \u2014 from 6,000 visits in first three months of 2013 to about 4,000 visits in first three months of this year, calling the decline \u201csignificant.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"The most common symptoms of a heart attack are chest pain or discomfort; upper body discomfort, like in the neck or jaw; and shortness of breath.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "By Phil Galewitz, Kaiser Health News&nbsp;", "zone": "hospitalsoftomorrow/articles", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "By Phil Galewitz, <a class=\"\" title=\"Link: null\" href=\"http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/May/27/Safety-Net-Hospitals-Seeing-More-Patients-And-Money.aspx\">Kaiser Health News&nbsp;</a>", "title": "Safety Net Hospitals Already Seeing More Paying Patients \u2014 And Revenue", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/hospital-of-tomorrow/articles/2014/05/27/safety-net-hospitals-already-seeing-more-paying-patients-and-revenue", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/b2/258f85b9e226785a0920a8fb7db00f/47644Slideshow_Medicaid_092313.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "By Phil Galewitz, Kaiser Health News&nbsp;", "card": "summary", "title": "Safety Net Hospitals Already Seeing More Paying Patients \u2014 And Revenue - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "published_at": "2014-05-27", "site": "health-news", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/1235731/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2Fb2%2F258f85b9e226785a0920a8fb7db00f%2F47644Slideshow_Medicaid_092313.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-05-27"}, "keywords": "Hospital of Tomorrow,hospitals,Medicaid,health care reform,Medicare", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z1i9uy", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "Kaiser Health News, Hospitals, Health Reform, Obamacare, Uninsured, Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, HCA, Safety-Net Hospitals"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3215\"", "article_summary": "Some safety-net hospitals say they started to see their numbers of uninsured patients dropping almost immediately after the Medicaid expansion took effect in January.\n\u201cWe did not anticipate this big a drop this quickly.\u201dAbout 80 percent of the system\u2019s new Medicaid patients had previously been seen by the hospital as uninsured patients, she said.\n\u201cWe have seen a steady decline in our uninsured visits,\u201d said Roxane Townsend, CEO of UAMS.\nAnd the share of uninsured patients was cut roughly in half this year at two other major safety net hospitals \u2014 Denver Health in Colorado and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Hospital (UAMS) in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\u201cThis is really phenomenal,\u201d said Ellen Kugler, executive director of the National Association of Urban Hospitals, based in Sterling, Virginia, which represents inner-city safety net institutions."}
