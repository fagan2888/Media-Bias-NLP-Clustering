Earlier this year, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti committed to deploying a DART in each of the city\u2019s 21 police divisions.\n\n\u201cOur partnership boosts the expansion of my administration\u2019s anti-domestic violence support programs \u2013 a significant part of my public safety strategy focused on building a safer city and safeguarding the trust between the Los Angeles Police Department and our residents,\u201d said Garcetti. \u201cTogether, we are helping families forge a new path toward a safer, more secure and brighter future.\u201d\n\nDART teams provide on-scene crisis intervention and wraparound services intended to break the cycle of violence. In 2014, 3,022 victims were served, and more than 300 trainings were provided to 4,696 law enforcement officials, victim advocates and community members.\n\n\u201cHealth Net\u2019s grant is expected to help the lives of hundreds of domestic abuse victims,\u201d said Carol Kim, director of Public Affairs for Health Net. \u201cIf we want to stop the cycle of abuse, we have to be able to properly and swiftly take action in these dire situations. DART\u2019s goal is to make sure victims are not led back into abuse simply because they lack resources.\u201d\n\nAbout the Mayor\u2019s Fund for Los Angeles\n\nThe Mayor\u2019s Fund for Los Angeles is a non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to improving life for all Angelenos.
