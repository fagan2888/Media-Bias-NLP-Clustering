A man is behind bars after he was arrested Saturday morning by Bonifay Police officials.

Reports state, early Saturday morning, 29-year-old Taj-Addaryll Quentez Wright forced himself into a home on Neal Lane, and several shots were fired.

One of the victims in the home was shot, and was taken to the Doctor's Memorial Hospital, but later flown to Bay Medical Center.

Another occupant in the home then wrestled Wright to the ground, and was able to get the gun away from him.

Bonifay Police arrested Wright, and he is now in the custody of the Chipley Police Department.

Wright will be processed at the Washington County Jail before extradition back to Holmes County. At this time Wright is being held on a charge of Armed Burglary of an Occupied Dwelling and Attempted Felony Murder.

Wright has a total bond of $70,000.
