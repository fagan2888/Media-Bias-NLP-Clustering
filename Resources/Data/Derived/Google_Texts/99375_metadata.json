Lushniak cites the explosion of indoor tanning as a major cause for what he calls a \u201cmajor public health concern.\u201d\n\nUltraviolet radiation is a natural component of the sun\u2019s rays, which pose their greatest threat during the summer months. With the advent of tanning beds, however, we Americans have come to expect a year-round bronze, and it\u2019s sending us to early graves, Lushniak says. Not only are skin cancer rates increasing year after year; they\u2019re increasing as other cancer rates are falling, posing a compelling question to the American public: What are we doing about it?\n\nThe answer, in short, is simple. We keep on tanning. \u201cCertainly, this time of year, we\u2019re in the midst of this vacation season,\u201d Lushniak told The Washington Post prior to the report\u2019s release. \u201cKnowing that as August comes around, it\u2019s the last big spurt of people heading to the beach, people spending time having that potential exposure to ultraviolet radiation. We thought now was a really good time to get the message out.\u201d\n\nTo Lushniak\u2019s mind, the mere fact melanoma is increasing in prevalence carries more weight than the possible explanations for the trend. Several things could be happening in tandem, he said, such as boons in the indoor tanning market, increased outdoor activities, or even less frequent sunscreen exposure. \u201cFrom our perspective, the real concern is that this is an increase, and we need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAnother factor could also be playing a role, though Lushniak did not mention it explicitly. While Europe and Canada have been churning out new sunscreen formulas for much of the product\u2019s history, in the United States no changes have been made to the recipe for sunscreen for the last decade and a half. Key ingredients, such as ecamsule and amiloxate, already appear in spades in many foreign sunscreen brands. But due to regulatory stopgaps and legal definitions (sunscreen is considered a cosmetic abroad, while an over-the-counter drug here), American sunscreen research is often viewed as too light to make conclusive claims.\n\nOn the other hand, we are also to blame. We are the ones seeking out the tanned skin, after all \u2014 installing industrial beds in private residences to mimic what the sun freely provides, but at a level far more intense. We may look healthy, experts say, but the truth is we\u2019re far from vitality. \u201cAlthough some people think that a tan gives them a \u2018healthy\u2019 glow, any tan is a sign of skin damage,\u201d said Sharon Miller, and FDA scientist and expert on UV radiation and tanning, in a recent FDA release.\n\nHere Miller points to a social norm that is decidedly tough to crack, and in his recent interview with The Post, Lushniak echoed her concern. Social custom has always guided people\u2019s lifestyle with an equal, if greater, force compared to personal health concerns. People smoked cigarettes for decades (and still do) in large part because they knew people who smoked and wanted to synchronize their breaks together. Eating follows the same pattern; people tend to eat more when other people eat more.\n\nThe trick, Lushniak says, is to divorce being tan with being healthy \u2014 to quit seeing olive-toned skin as a vital sign. Their vitamin D levels may be somewhat higher, but even greater is their risk of joining the more than 60,000 people who die each year as the result of melanomas of the skin. \u201cWe\u2019re really talking about a tragic disease here, something that really affects the young,\u201d Lushniak said. \u201cThat\u2019s something, from a public health perspective, we have to do something about.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "surgeon, general, warns, against, tanning, skin, cancer, us, creeps, toward, epidemic, while", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In the never-ending quest to be tanner than the person next to them, Americans are sacrificing the health of the body's largest organ.", "title": "Americans Are Tanning Themselves To Death", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/surgeon-general-warns-against-tanning-skin-cancer-us-creeps-toward-epidemic-while-other-cancers-fall", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/29/tanning1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the never-ending quest to be tanner than the person next to them, Americans are sacrificing the health of the body's largest organ.", "title": "Americans Are Tanning Themselves To Death", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/surgeon-general-warns-against-tanning-skin-cancer-us-creeps-toward-epidemic-while-other-cancers-fall", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/29/tanning1.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/29/tanning1.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-07-29T14:57:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-29T14:57:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In the never-ending quest to be tanner than the person next to them, Americans are sacrificing the health of the body's largest organ."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdffc5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s something, from a public health perspective, we have to do something about.\u201d\nThe trick, Lushniak says, is to divorce being tan with being healthy \u2014 to quit seeing olive-toned skin as a vital sign.\ncanon1952, CC BY 2.0Surgeon General Boris Lushniak announced this week growing concern for melanoma\u2019s alarming rise in the United States, as skin cancer rates have nearly tripled over the last 30 years.\nNot only are skin cancer rates increasing year after year; they\u2019re increasing as other cancer rates are falling, posing a compelling question to the American public: What are we doing about it?\nWith the advent of tanning beds, however, we Americans have come to expect a year-round bronze, and it\u2019s sending us to early graves, Lushniak says."}
