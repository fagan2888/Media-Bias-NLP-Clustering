Kasich reportedly has canceled a planned event in order to make his Wednesday night statement.\n\nThis means Donald Trump is on track to be the uncontested nominee.\n\nKasich had been running in a distant third place in the Republican primaries. Second-place candidate Texas Sen. Ted Cruz suspended his own campaign Tuesday evening.\n\nTrump on Tuesday night took all 57 of the state\u2019s delegates. Cruz suspended his campaign, saying there was no longer a \u201cviable path\u201d to becoming his party\u2019s nominee.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, I\u2019ve said that I would continue as long as there was a viable path to victory,\u201d Cruz said on Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cTonight, I\u2019m sorry to say, it appears that path has been foreclosed. The voters chose another path, and so it is with a heavy heart, but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign.\u201d\n\nA statement Tuesday evening by the Kasich campaign indicated the candidate was planning to continue his campaign. It stated that the Indiana results \u201care not going to alter\u201d the Kasich\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cOur strategy has been and continues to be one that involves winning the nomination at an open convention,\u201d the prepared statement said.\n\nThe Kasich campaign, however, has sent mixed messages about the candidate\u2019s plans for the remaining nine primaries. Wednesday morning, the campaign released a kitschy video on May 4, otherwise known as \u201cStar Wars Day\u201d (May the fourth be with you). The short Twitter video uses the iconic Star Wars music and scrolling text to lay out a doomsday scenario for many Republicans.\n\n\u201cIn a galaxy not so far away \u2026 \u201d the video begins. It goes on to tell voters Hillary Clinton has become president, presumably after soundly defeating Trump, and is preparing to nominate liberal Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to the Supreme Court. With the Democrats having won control of both houses of Congress, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are preparing tax increases and more Obamacare spending.\n\nThe video then cuts to news reports touting Kasich\u2019s electability in the general election. It concludes with the Star Wars line: \u201cYou\u2019re our only hope\u201d before flashing the campaign\u2019s logo.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Stories Worth Sharing", "og": {"site_name": "Gephardt Daily", "description": "John Kasich will be suspending his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, NBC news is reporting.", "title": "BREAKING: Kasich To Suspend Campaign - Gephardt Daily", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://gephardtdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/John-Kasich-to-female-college-student-worried-about-sex-assault-Avoid-parties-with-alcohol.jpg", "height": 400}, "updated_time": "2016-05-04T16:19:55-06:00", "url": "http://gephardtdaily.com/national-international/breaking-kasich-to-suspend-campaign/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Kasich will be suspending his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, NBC news is reporting.", "creator": "@GephardtDaily", "image": "http://gephardtdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/John-Kasich-to-female-college-student-worried-about-sex-assault-Avoid-parties-with-alcohol.jpg", "title": "BREAKING: Kasich To Suspend Campaign - Gephardt Daily", "site": "@GephardtDaily", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1032072130", "fb": {"admins": 1229477373}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.id3044", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/GephardtDaily", "section": "Top Stories", "tag": "suspend", "published_time": "2016-05-04T10:30:57-06:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-04T16:19:55-06:00"}, "google-site-verification": "XZj2tyrwhGbnideR_Uvg4fR8Ie2SzYcDCxk-EgS0iAg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "NBC said a senior adviser to the Kasich campaign revealed the Ohio governor will announce his campaign suspension at 5 p.m. Central time Wednesday.\nThe Kasich campaign, however, has sent mixed messages about the candidate\u2019s plans for the remaining nine primaries.\nCruz suspended his campaign, saying there was no longer a \u201cviable path\u201d to becoming his party\u2019s nominee.\nIt concludes with the Star Wars line: \u201cYou\u2019re our only hope\u201d before flashing the campaign\u2019s logo.\nWednesday morning, the campaign released a kitschy video on May 4, otherwise known as \u201cStar Wars Day\u201d (May the fourth be with you)."}
