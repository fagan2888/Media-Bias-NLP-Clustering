As it turned out, the boy wasn\u2019t home at the time, so Francis chatted with his mother for 15 minutes, assuring her of his prayers for the aunt.\n\n\u201cIt was the most beautiful Christmas present that we have received in this difficult moment,\u201d said the parents, who declined to be identified.\n\nInstead, they told the priest of their parish in Calabria, in southern Italy, who relayed the news of the pope\u2019s call at Mass on Christmas Eve and then posted it on the Facebook page of St. Nicholas of Bari in the town of Mendicino.\n\n(And yes, the parish is named after that St. Nick, who today is probably more familiar as the jolly old elf who pops down the chimney around this time of year with a sack full of gifts.)\n\nREAD: Pope Francis, the \u2018cold-call pope,\u2019 reaches out and touches a lot of people\n\nAs often happens when the pope calls unexpectedly, there were a few awkward moments at first as the mother apparently tried to figure out whether this was real or a prank.\n\nBut soon Francis and the mother were chatting with \u201cgreat familiarity\u201d and \u201casking about them as though he were one of the family,\u201d said the Rev. Enzo Gabrieli, the parish priest.\n\n\u201cOftentimes we\u2019re in a hurry when we call others. But they felt the pope was truly interested in them,\u201d Gabrieli told the Catholic news site Aleteia, which also reported that the boy is 7. \u201cAt that moment, they were at the center of his attention. This is what really struck them. He was asking about them; they felt he really wanted to know how they were doing.\n\n\u201cThe pope continues to surprise us with his simplicity and closeness,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cThe great kindness of the family was to want to share the news with the community. The Calabrese people share their joys and sorrows with one another. They live in community as a family. Even though they wished to remain anonymous, they wanted to share with the community the joy of the gift they received.\u201d\n\nThere was no further word on the condition of the aunt, and as is usually the case with these personal exchanges, the Vatican did not issue any statement about the phone call.\n\n(David Gibson is a national reporter for RNS)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Ethics, Institutions, Catholic, Catholic Church, Christian, cold call, Pope Francis, Vatican", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "(RNS) A letter from an Italian boy who wrote the pope because he was worried about his ailing aunt has prompted another surprise papal phone call from Francis.", "title": "Pope Francis surprises an Italian family with a Christmastime call", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/12/29/pope-francis-surprises-an-italian-family-with-a-christmastime-call-out-of-the-blue/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rns-pope-children-copy.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@gibsonwrites"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/12/29/pope-francis-surprises-an-italian-family-with-a-christmastime-call-out-of-the-blue/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/12/29/pope-francis-surprises-an-italian-family-with-a-christmastime-call-out-of-the-blue/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "(RNS) A letter from an Italian boy who wrote the pope because he was worried about his ailing aunt has prompted another surprise papal phone call from Francis."}, "article_summary": "READ: Pope Francis, the \u2018cold-call pope,\u2019 reaches out and touches a lot of peopleAs often happens when the pope calls unexpectedly, there were a few awkward moments at first as the mother apparently tried to figure out whether this was real or a prank.\nBut soon Francis and the mother were chatting with \u201cgreat familiarity\u201d and \u201casking about them as though he were one of the family,\u201d said the Rev.\n\u201cThe great kindness of the family was to want to share the news with the community.\nNow, a letter from an Italian boy who wrote the pope because he was worried about his ailing aunt has prompted another surprise papal phone call a few days before Christmas.\nAs it turned out, the boy wasn\u2019t home at the time, so Francis chatted with his mother for 15 minutes, assuring her of his prayers for the aunt."}
