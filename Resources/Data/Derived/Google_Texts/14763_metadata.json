JP Morgan Chase\u2019s aborted Twitter Q&A\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that five years into the global financial crisis, JP Morgan Chase continues to be the biggest poster-child for the kind of excess and lack of ethics that continues to create economic misery around the world.\n\n\n\n\u201cJP Morgan has suffered from a steady stream of reputational damage that creates the impression that it may be unethical, asleep at the switch and a big part of the reason for the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d says Jason Maloni, chair of the litigation practice at Washington, DC, public affairs and crisis management specialist Levick. \u201cWhile JPM\u2019s stock is performing well, the events of the past year are a blow to the company\u2019s and to all Big Banks\u2019 \u2018trust factor.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAs Carreen Winters, who heads the corporate practice at US public relations firm MWW points out: \u201cWhen your company spends more money on legal fees and fines than actual payroll, it's fair to say it's been a rough year.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the problem is exacerbated by the bank\u2019s inability to stop shooting itself in the foot, as chief executive Jamie Dimon managed to do with his remarkably tone deaf Christmas card, and the company\u2019s marketing team managed to do with its decision to hold\u2014and then abruptly cancel\u2014a Twitter Q&A.\n\n\n\nAfter the company announced a Twitter Q&A session with vice chairman Jimmy Lee, \u201cTwitter users instead used #AskJPM to launch a stream of anger and sarcasm directed at the company, leading JPM to quickly cancel the event and mount an offensive against the negative press that ensued,\u201d noted Chicago area public relatons firm JSH&A in its list of social media blunders of the year.\n\n\n\nAdds Paul Argenti, professor of corporate communications at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, \"JPM\u2019s marketing wizards decided to set up a Q&A on Twitter with superstar banker Jimmy Lee at the same time the bank was being hit with a $13 billion fine for its transgressions during the financial crisis. After 24,000 tweets\u2014arguably one of the fastest and most negative reactions to any major global brand on Twitter\u2014they pulled the campaign and realized that maybe their reputation wasn\u2019t what it once was.\"\n\n\n\nArgenti suggests that the major lesson of this crisis is that a company needs to listen to its corporate communications professionals\u2014he is on record praising JP Morgan\u2019s earlier response to the crisis. At the very least, the fallout from this decisions suggests that marketing and digital people should listen to PR advisors when it comes to social media strategy.\n\n\n\nThe larger issue, however, will be whether the company can rebuild its reputation. Says Winters: \u201cIt might be his most impressive accomplishment to date if Jamie Dimon can lead a rebound, and take back JP Morgan's title from Wells Fargo as the best of the big banks in 2014. To do that, JP Morgan and Dimon will need to get off the reputation roller coaster of making progress\u2026. The reputation of the CEO is a sword that can cut both ways for a company\u2019s reputation.\u201d\u2014PH\n\n\n\n2. The Obamacare website\n\n\n\nAs the centrepiece of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, the stakes were high for the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. Enacted in 2010, the legislation represents the most significant regulatory overhaul of the US healthcare system for more than 40 years, with \u2018Obamacare\u2019 aiming to finally bring universal, quality healthcare to millions of Americans.\n\n\n\nMuch, then, revolved around the launch of Healthcare.gov, the healthcare exchange website that would allow users to shop for different health insurance options. Unfortunately, the site was plagued by serious technology problems from its inception on 1 October 2013, resulting in just 700,000 people making applications in the first month.\n\n\n\nThe technological problems were compounded by communications issues, says Levick director of digital marketing Afgen H. Sheikh.\n\n\n\n\u201cFundamentally, the rollout of the Affordable Care Act website was a failure in effectively communicating trust,\u201d says Sheikh. \u201cThe combination of technical glitches with the website itself, missteps by the administration when it came to taking responsibility and ownership, and the emergence of claims \u2014 namely \u2018if you like your health care plan, you can keep it\u2019 \u2014 made it very difficult for the administration to maintain the credibility they once enjoyed on the issue.\u201d\n\n\n\nNeither were the various problems addressed in a clear manner, while opposition Republicans deployed a highly effective, often devastating, public attack. \u201cThe best course of action would have been to immediately take ownership of the problem,\u201d says Sheikh. \u201cThe administration should have presented a unified singular voice to address user and public concerns.\u201d\n\n\n\nSheikh notes that the administration would have benefited from more honesty about the missteps, along with a clearly communicated strategy regarding the new plan of action.\n\n\n\nA more emotionally resonant approach would have also helped. Opposition ads often focused, to dramatic effect, on the issues being suffered by regular Americans. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, favoured a dry, fact-based tone.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving a more effective platform for presenting the multiple success stories of people that had either saved money and were now able to log on and complete registration on the site could have helped them regain trust more quickly,\u201d says Sheikh.\n\n\n\nThe situation proved debilitating for an administration that had staked so much of its credibility on the new healthcare plan, with many suggesting it would ultimately colour perceptions of President Obama\u2019s legacy. Concerns about the website have helped bolster the notion that the legislation itself is fundamentally flawed, providing ample ammunition for the government\u2019s many political opponents.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe main lesson to be learned through this case, which can be applied to any industry, is that it is always harder to regain trust than it is to preserve it,\u201d explains Sheikh.\u2014AS\n\n\n\n3. Tech companies and government snooping\n\n\n\nWhen former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden blew the whistle about the extent of American snooping worldwide, it undoubtedly created a crisis for the US government and its leading spy network. But it also raised issues for a host of technology and telecommunications companies, many of whom had apparently opened their networks to the NSA.\n\n\n\nAs a result, election officials in India canceled a deal with Google and European regulators threatened to block AT&T's acquisition of wireless company Vodafone.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor me, it was the most interesting crisis of the year,\u201d says Geoff Beattie, head of the global corporate practice at Cohn & Wolfe. \u201cWe learned that the NSA was tapping into worldwide fibre-topic telecommunications 'in collaboration with' several well-known tech giants. Of particular interest was that the NSA and GCHQ had\u2014has?\u2014a team dedicated to \u2018cracking\u2019 Hotmail, Google, Yahoo and Facebook.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs a result, those companies and others \u201chad to walk the line between assuring customers that their data was held safely and securely (and that they were not, in effect, prime collaborators in this mass espionage project) and appearing responsible and supportive of the US\u2014and to a lesser extent the UK\u2014government in the war against terrorism.\u201d\n\n\n\nInitial responses, Beattie says, \u201csuggested that the companies were completely blindsided by these revelations. Responses were thin and evasive. As media commentary on this subject grew, it also shed light on the privacy issues we already associated with Google, Apple, Facebook and Yahoo: how much do they know about us, and what do they do with that information to gain commercial advantage?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Snowden leaks formed the backdrop for Cohn & Wolfe\u2019s \u201cTransparency and Openness\u201d report, which found that more than two thirds of consumers in the US, UK and China rate \u201chonesty and transparency\u201d alongside price and quality when considering to buy a product or brand. \u201cThis is a more general issue for corporate counsellors,\u201d says Beattie. \u201cIs there anything that can be called confidential data anymore? If the answer to that question is nothing\u2014or close to nothing\u2014it has enormous implications for the levels of transparency which large corporations build into their communications.\u201d\u2014PH\n\n\n\n4. GSK\u2019s China bribery case\n\n\n\nThe phenomenon of cultural relativism is not a new one in the public relations arena, often emerging to explain why companies engage in nefarious activities in foreign markets. This, goes the argument, is simply the price of doing business in some countries.\n\n\n\nIt is a line of reasoning that has begun to prove untenable, as digital media assists the fluid flow of information across the globe. Meanwhile, many of those countries that are, supposedly, \u2018morally lax\u2019 have begun to clamp down on the misbehaviour of foreign companies, often as a means of scoring easy political points.\n\n\n\nGSK found itself caught in the crosshairs of these trends, when the Chinese government began a high-profile probe into explosive allegations of bribery at the pharmaceutical giant.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt some point, GSK had apparently decided that the way to get ahead in China was to follow the local customs,\u201d says David Wolf, MD of Allison+Partners global China practice.\n\n\n\nFor years, notes Wolf, this approach worked, in an industry where incentives are regularly offered in return for doctors and pharmacies favouring certain drugs. \u201cThen the government began to focus on what it would take to lower the cost of healthcare in China, and the spotlight fell on pharmaceuticals. Foreign pharma firms were the biggest, most politically convenient targets, and GSK had some unfortunate associations that made it the best target of all.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpecifically, GSK was accused of doling out kickbacks worth more than \u00a33m to Chinese doctors. To make matters worse, foreign companies are often held to a higher standard in the country, thanks to perceptions of quality and reliability.\n\n\n\n\u201cChinese customers are willing to pay for this, particularly when it comes to medicines, where harmful local counterfeits are widespread,\u201d says Jacqueline Ratcliffe, managing consultant at Regester Larkin Asia-Pacific. \u201cWhen foreign companies are perceived to be dishonest or failing to deliver on quality, the feeling is one of betrayal and retribution follows swiftly, potentially threatening a company\u2019s licence to operate.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe case also demonstrated that the days of ethical relativism are numbered. \u201cConducting your business to a lower ethical standard in the PRC than you do elsewhere may work in the short term, but eventually it will catch up to you as standards of what is acceptable change,\u201d says Wolf. \u201cCompanies have to be prepared for this and either stick to the highest standards from the start, or become extremely nimble at anticipating changes in the local environment. GSK apparently did neither, and it is paying the price.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe crisis also highlights how one organisation can become a poster child for a wider industry issue. \u201cGSK has remained in the spotlight while other foreign pharmaceutical companies also under investigation escaped with their names relatively unscathed,\u201d notes Ratcliffe.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the GSK bribery scandal also reinforces the differing standards that apply to foreign companies in China. \u201cPart of the value foreign companies are seen to bring into China is a higher standard of behaviour,\u201d says Wolf. \u201cForego that, and you are giving the people and the party one more reason to turn their backs on you.\u201d\u2014AS\n\n\n\n5. The horsemeat scandal\n\nIt spawned thousands of jokes and memes but, at its heart, the horsemeat scandal shone a profoundly disturbing light on the sourcing practices of retailers and food companies, organisations that are entrusted with upholding rigourous health and safety standards.\n\n\n\nIn this case, the transgressions were hardly negligible, revealing that beef products sold by major UK retailers \u2014 including Tesco, Iceland, Aldi, Lidl, Ikea, Asda and the Co-op \u2014 contained horsemeat. Soon, the scandal had rocked the European beef supply chain, with abattoirs, suppliers, manufacturers and retailers all implicated.\n\n\n\nThe public response, notes Regester Larkin chief executive Andrew Griffin, focused on food fraud, rather than food safety. \u201cConcerns raised about a horse medication that could have an impact on human health if ingested never really took hold,\u201d he points out. \u201cNeither, surprisingly, did any sense of moral \u2018disgust\u2019 at the fact that many people could have eaten horsemeat.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was a classic internal issue relating to performance: companies had failed in their most basic of duties of supplying the consumer with the product they promised.\u201d\n\n\n\nTesco, the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket, was hit particularly hard, particularly when it emerged that one of its \u2018beef\u2019 products was almost 100% horsemeat. The retailer immediately recalled the products and issued an unreserved apology in newspapers. The ads, says Griffin, showcased a welcome dose of humility, admitted that \u201cwe and our supplier have let you down and we are sorry\u201d.\n\n\n\nThis approach, adds Griffin, \u201cneatly encapsulated the supply chain nature of the problem without seeking to outsource responsibility.\u201d\n\n\n\nTesco also mobilised its senior executives, with CEO Philip Clarke addressing the situation on the supermarket\u2019s blog: \u201cIf some of our customers are angry, so are we.\u201d The supermarket soon dropped two suppliers, Silvercrest and Comigel, when their beef products were found to contain horsemeat.\n\nIn addition, Tesco communicated directly with loyalty card customers and launched a range of measures designed to make the supply chain more transparent and trusted. A new website called Tesco Food News features a dedicated product testing section as well as a \u2018promises\u2019 section, while the supermarket also committed itself to sourcing more meat from the UK and Ireland.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe reaction to Tesco\u2019s crisis management was generally positive, with the company seen to have made a textbook response,\u201d says Griffin. \u201cThe company rightly calculated that it was going to be the \u2018poster child\u2019 for this crisis whether it liked it or not.\u201d\n\n\n\nTesco, maintains Griffin, \u201cavoided a reputation nightmare,\u201d yet was hardly unaffected by the scandal. The company may have sustained ts 30% market share, but profits have dropped, while untainted competitors like Sainsbury\u2019s have seen sales rise.\n\n\n\nRegardless, says Griffin, the short-term pain should not overshadow the long-term trust benefit for Tesco.\n\n\n\n\u201cCrisis management is not just about tomorrow\u2019s headlines and till receipts, it is about long-term recovery and an opportunity to change for the better,\u201d explains Griffin. \u201cIf chief executive Philip Clarke means it when he says \u2018we have changed\u2019, and Tesco is seen to have made improvements that its consumers will see and appreciate, he may well have played an excellent reputation long game.\u201d\u2014AS\n\n\n\n6. Chevron's Ecuador lawsuit\n\n\n\nThe legal campaign to hold Chevron accountable for environmental damage in Ecuador began in 1993, with charges that predecessor company Texaco\u2019s drilling in the Amazon from 1964 to 1990 deliberately dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic wastewater into the eco-system. The legal battle is now more than two decades old, with the company found guilty by the Ecuadorian courts and ordered to pay $19 billion, and the public relations battle between the Ecuadorian plaintiffs, their US attorneys and the company also continued into 2013.\n\n\n\nChevron has sued the lawyers in New York, accusing them of fraud and extortion, and has charged that judges in Ecuador conspired with the plaintiffs\u2014part of a strategy developed five years ago by San Francisco-based crisis counselor Sam Singer. The oil company has since produced a statement from a former judge who said the plaintiffs agreed to pay a $500,000 bribe and obtained outtakes from a documentary showing lawyers talking about trying to pressure judges.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn listening very carefully to Chevron and their attorneys, they knew and believed that they had the evidence and that the story being presented by [attorney] Donziger and the plaintiffs was fraudulent,\u201d Singer told reporters earlier this year. \u201cThat\u2019s what we started doing in 2008, and at first it was a tough battle,\u201d Singer said. \u201cBut the plaintiffs handed us the hammer and the nails to build their own coffin.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe says recent coverage \u201cdemonstrates how Chevron turned the tables and demonstrated how a $19 billion lawsuit by plaintiff\u2019s in Ecuador was really a fraud.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther crisis experts are not entirely convinced.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the strategy has been very effective at muddying the waters,\u201d says one US crisis counselor, who asked not to be identified by name. \u201cYou have a country, Ecuador, that people don\u2019t know very much about, and some people are always willing to believe the worst about plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, and so I think the strategy has worked well to sow the seeds of doubt in the US and so it has given the company some cover for its decision to defy the judgment of the Ecuadorian courts.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut it has done nothing to dampen the criticism from activists, and on the global level it just adds to the impression that American companies are a law unto themselves.\u201d\u2014PH\n\nPart two of our 2013 Crisis Review features Walmart, Rana Plaza, Lululemon, McDonald's, Apple China, Barilla and Asiana Airlines.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.holmesreport.com/long-reads/article/the-top-12-crises-of-2013-part-1", "type": "website", "title": "The Top 12 Crises Of 2013: Part 1"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lessons from the key PR crises of 2013, including JP Morgan, Obamacare, the horsemeat scandal, GSK in China, Chevron and government snooping.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "Generator": "Sitefinity 7.1.5213.0 SE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca0f9\"", "article_summary": "To make matters worse, foreign companies are often held to a higher standard in the country, thanks to perceptions of quality and reliability.\n\u201cPart of the value foreign companies are seen to bring into China is a higher standard of behaviour,\u201d says Wolf.\nUltimately, the GSK bribery scandal also reinforces the differing standards that apply to foreign companies in China.\nMeanwhile, many of those countries that are, supposedly, \u2018morally lax\u2019 have begun to clamp down on the misbehaviour of foreign companies, often as a means of scoring easy political points.\nHolmes ReportPart two of our 2013 Crisis Review features Walmart, Rana Plaza, Lululemon, McDonald's, Apple China, Barilla and Asiana Airlines."}
