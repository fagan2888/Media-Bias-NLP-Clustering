It was only hours after his front-running, 5-length victory, but the low-key champ appeared to enjoy the attention, dutifully posing for photographers and patiently letting bystanders pet him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really sweet horse,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to share him with everybody.\u201d\n\nThere were celebrity visits, too, for the newest member of racing\u2019s elite club. Fellow Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott stopped by for a close-up look at American Pharoah, much like Baffert visited Mott\u2019s barn in the mid-1990s to see Cigar, who won 16 consecutive races.\n\nAmerican Pharoah arrived in Louisville, Kentucky, later in the day, and was greeted by hundreds of cheering fans at Churchill Downs, his home in between Triple Crown races.\n\nJockey Victor Espinoza threw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium, where Baffert attended the game.\n\nNext up for racing\u2019s 12th Triple Crown winner is some well-deserved downtime, having run in and won five Grade 1 races in nearly 2 months. That\u2019s a compressed schedule for a racehorse, most of which have at least 30 days between starts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculously insane what he did yesterday,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cIt was a beautiful moment.\u201d\n\nOwner Ahmed Zayat pledged to keep the horse in training, at least through the end of the year. Before the Belmont, Zayat sold breeding rights to American Pharoah to Coolmore Ashford Stud near Versailles, Kentucky. The family has said it received offers higher than $20 million, but the terms of the deal haven\u2019t been disclosed.\n\n\u201cThey have zero say until he retires,\u201d Zayat said. \u201cWe owe it to the sport to do the right thing. Money plays an important factor in this game. I\u2019ve already sold the breeding rights, but it is my genuine desire, as a fan, as someone who loves horses, to race him as long as I possibly can.\u201d\n\nZayat will leave it up to Baffert to map out a schedule. Among the races under consideration are the Jim Dandy at Saratoga in upstate New York on Aug. 1; the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth in New Jersey on Aug. 2; the Pacific Classic at Del Mar on Aug. 22; and the Travers at Saratoga on Aug. 29.\n\nWith a newfound legacy to protect, Baffert vowed American Pharoah would be properly prepared for his next race, saying, \u201cHe\u2019ll tell me.\u201d\n\nThe Haskell might have an edge because Baffert has won it a record seven times and Zayat lives in Teaneck, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an athlete. We have to keep him moving,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cHe\u2019s so happy when he\u2019s on that track.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate goal would be the $5 million Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic, to be run Oct. 31 at Keeneland in Lexington, Kentucky, the cradle of American racing and breeding and near where American Pharoah will serve stud duty.\n\nThe colt was named champion 2-year-old last year and is a cinch to lock up similar honors as a 3-year-old. But all that racing \u201cwears on them and eventually it catches up,\u201d said Baffert, who understands Zayat\u2019s eventual desire to retire American Pharoah to the breeding shed.\n\n\u201cThis way they get rewarded,\u201d Baffert jokingly told The Associated Press recently. \u201cThey get to have sex with 200 mares a year.\u201d\n\nShould anything happen to the colt in future races, Zayat is covered by an insurance policy for which the rates are \u201cincredibly high,\u201d Baffert said recently.\n\nZayat, who has invested tens of millions of dollars into his breeding, buying and racing operation, believes it\u2019s not always about money when you\u2019re passionate about something.\n\n\u201cWe are not thinking here of value or money,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the horse is ready, we will not be scared of running him to lose or not. It\u2019s all about the fans and this belongs to history.\u201d\n\nOff the racetrack, Zayat figures to have marketing and merchandising opportunities to sort through. Just what kind of offers he receives and deals he cuts are uncharted territory since American Pharoah is the first Triple Crown winner in the Internet and social media age.\n\nSecretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown winner, was featured on major nonsports magazine covers and the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp in his honor. He remains a pop culture touchstone for even nonracing fans, and merchandise featuring him sold at Belmont Park on Saturday.\n\nJudging by the crowd\u2019s reaction to history, American Pharoah seems likely to be a popular champion, having cemented his legacy in New York, where the public is not easily won over.\n\n\u201cEverybody was on board with this horse,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cI was pretty in awe of him myself.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A hero's welcome greeted Triple Crown winner American Pharoah in Kentucky on Sunday, the first of many such receptions expected for the sporting world's newest superstar.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A hero\u2019s welcome greeted Triple Crown winner American Pharoah in Kentucky on Sunday, the first of many such receptions expected for the sporting world\u2019s newest superstar.", "title": "American Pharoah to rest, then race again after winning Triple Crown", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/7/triple-crown-winner-american-pharoah-to-rest-then-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/07/6_7_2015_aptopix-belmont-stakes-hors8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/07/6_7_2015_aptopix-belmont-stakes-hors8201.jpg", "description": "A hero's welcome greeted Triple Crown winner American Pharoah in Kentucky on Sunday, the first of many such receptions expected for the sporting world's newest superstar.", "card": "summary", "title": "American Pharoah to rest, then race again after winning Triple Crown"}, "Author": "Beth Harris", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Bob Baffert, New York, Ahmed Zayat"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd25\"", "article_summary": "NEW YORK | A hero\u2019s welcome greeted Triple Crown winner American Pharoah in Kentucky on Sunday, the first of many such receptions expected for the sporting world\u2019s newest superstar.\nSecretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown winner, was featured on major nonsports magazine covers and the U.S.\nJust what kind of offers he receives and deals he cuts are uncharted territory since American Pharoah is the first Triple Crown winner in the Internet and social media age.\nAmerican Pharoah arrived in Louisville, Kentucky, later in the day, and was greeted by hundreds of cheering fans at Churchill Downs, his home in between Triple Crown races.\nNext up for racing\u2019s 12th Triple Crown winner is some well-deserved downtime, having run in and won five Grade 1 races in nearly 2 months."}
