This increased cost has Utah families and individuals reevaluating their health plans to make sure they still have the most affordable and quality health care coverage available. Enrollment USA, launched in September, is a new exchange that allows Utah individuals and families to compare health care plans to find the option that best fits their needs.\n\n\u201cOur service offers a great benefit to the small business owner or self-employed individual looking for health coverage,\u201d said John Carroll, principal and founder of Enrollment USA. \u201cWe are here to help them validate that they have the best health insurance, and if they don\u2019t, we\u2019ll find them the best option at the cheapest price.\u201d\n\nEnrollment USA allows users to verify that their health plan is the most affordable, based on specific factors like prescription drugs, how much they are willing to pay out of pocket and how they prefer to pay for insurance. After these factors are considered, Enrollment USA provides users with the plan that most closely matches their preferences. Enrollment USA also offers free health insurance advice from 75 licensed agents who are certified in Arches Health Plan, Humana, Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield, SelectHealth and United Healthcare policies.\n\nSean Dehghani, owner of Mykonos at City Creek Mall said, \u201cI started looking for health insurance online, but I gave up after a while because it was so confusing and complicated. But Enrollment USA is easy to use and it helped me find a plan that perfectly fits my family.\u201d\n\nEvery year starting around Oct. 15, health insurance companies send out new premium rates to customers that reflect changes for the upcoming year.\n\n\u201cThese rates almost always increase, rarely stay the same and never decrease,\u201d said Carroll. \u201cEvery individual insured today, covered under an individual policy will be getting one of these letters.\u201d\n\nThe regulations in the Affordable Care Act allow individuals and families to change their health care plans once a year during a three month span called Open Enrollment Period. This year, that period runs from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, 2016. With the exception of those who qualify for a Special Enrollment Period, buyers can only enroll in or change health care plans within this window of time. Those who fail to do so during the Open Enrollment Period will face a tax penalty.\n\nIndividuals who use Enrollment USA\u2019s free service can do so through the online comparison feature or by speaking with a live agent over the phone. All of Enrollment USA\u2019s services are also available through the Spanish language arm of the company, Fam\u00edlia USA.\n\nAbout Enrollment USA:\n\nEnrollment USA is the only health insurance exchange built exclusively to help Utahns buy insurance for themselves and their families.
