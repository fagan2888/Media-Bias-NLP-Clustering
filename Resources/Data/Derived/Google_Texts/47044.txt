The Nigerian government is demanding an apology from Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) after he joked last week that the new Affordable Care Act exchange website was being run by Nigerian email scammers, Politico reports.

Ambassador Ade Adefuye told Politico that Nigerians are “disappointed and shocked” by the remarks, adding that Cruz "should not denigrate Nigerians in order to appease these domestic constituents.” The ambassador the statement "was a joke that went too far, and we demand an apology.”

The Houston Chronicle reported on Monday that, before a crowd of tea party supporters, Cruz knocked the new health care system: “You may have noticed that all the Nigerian email scammers have become a lot less active lately. They all have been hired to run the Obamacare website.”

A spokeswoman for Cruz told Politico the remarks were made jokingly and were not intended to offend Nigerians.

Cruz has been a leading figure in the Republican effort to block the implementation of the new health care law.
