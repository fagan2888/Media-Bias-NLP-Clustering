And not just with its business of buying and selling used records and DVDs.\n\nAs one of the last record shops still standing in the Lowcountry, Monster Music has shown over the past decade that there\u2019s plenty to be salvaged from the wreckage of music retailing.\n\nThe store itself was launched in the space formerly operated by Manifest Discs & Tapes, which closed and consolidated into two other locations in Charlotte and Columbia in the mid-2000s. And ever since, the shop on Orleans Road has sustained itself by acquiring equipment and inventory from other music shops around town as they went out of business.\n\n\u201cThat seems to be our M.O. We adapt, we survive,\u201d said Galen Hudson, owner of Monster Music. \u201cWe kind of roll with the punches and adapt to the times, and acquire the good things we can from people that are going under or cashing it in.\u201d\n\nRecently, the store purchased AbundaTrade, an online tool used for buying and selling music and movies, from Millennium Music after the business had to cease its operations last month. The acquisition marked one of Monster\u2019s largest acquisitions yet that could potentially be its bridge to the realm of e-commerce.\n\n\u201cAt one point in time, AbundaTrade did a lot of business and we felt like, if we were successful in bringing it back to the levels they were once at, we\u2019d be able to hopefully streamline it. Alongside that, it\u2019s a whole new avenue for us to acquire inventory,\u201d Hudson said.\n\nRight now, Monster Music relies solely on sellers in the Lowcountry to provide its stock of used vinyl, CDs and DVDs, so Abundatrade will help the store expand its selection by extending its reach to sellers nationwide, Hudson said.\n\nIt also could help Monster Music build a presence on online retailers, such as Amazon and eBay, but those aspects of the business will come later once the local staff is familiar with using the online tool.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole different business model, with very web-based aspects of it like coding and it requires doing a lot of things that we\u2019re not accustomed to in a normal day\u2019s work,\u201d Hudson said, adding that they\u2019re all open to the challenge. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how far outside our wheelhouse it is, if it\u2019s music, we\u2019re interested.\u201d\n\nReach Abigail Darlington at 937-5906 and follow her on Twitter @A_Big_Gail", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Monster Music and Movies continues to adapt, enters realm of e-commerce, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Galen Hudson,Monster Music and Movies,record stores", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Monster Music and Movies has long championed the concept that one\u2019s man trash is another\u2019s treasure.
