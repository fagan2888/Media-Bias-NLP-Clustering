It\u2019s an ambush. Helen and I ride in front while Sue, a retired humane agent, sits in back, a spry guru helping on this tough case. Sue is the kind of person who stands in the road directing traffic away from injured animals, is opposed to flypaper \u2014 cruel to flies! \u2014 and treasures a thank-you card from PETA\u2019s national office. Helen is a plump ash-blonde often flushed with feelings. A thumbed copy of the state anti-cruelty code circulates among us, as we strategize how to rescue Sammy, a three-month-old boxer puppy, from his owner, Bruce.\n\nThe dog rushed us, slamming into our bodies over and over. He wasn\u2019t attacking. Crazed for motion and contact, he flew at us as if trying to pound our warmth into his bones.\n\nIt\u2019s our second visit to Bruce. On our first visit, a week ago, he told us that a child care worker was taking care of his dog during the day, until his wife returned from overseas. But Bruce\u2019s family caseworker \u2014 who reported him \u2014 says that his wife isn\u2019t coming back. And Beth, his child care worker, wants us to rescue Sammy, who is going insane.\n\n\n\nBruce was supposed to contact the humane society for follow-up. He never called, so we\u2019re here to confiscate his dog. Our legal case is shaky. We really need Bruce to surrender Sammy willingly, because the code will make prosecution hard. Our case rests on the facts that Beth shared with us, but Beth refuses to testify. So we\u2019ll try, on this visit, somehow to get her info into our agent\u2019s report, the only tool we have. Helen wrinkles her nose.\n\n\u201cPeople want you to, like, do something, but they never want \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Sue. \u201cBring your phone. If he says again that it\u2019s his wife\u2019s dog, call the wife. Start taking pictures, he\u2019ll demand to know what right you have but you go ahead and take those pictures. You\u2019re the Humane Society gathering evidence.\u201d\n\nOn our first visit, Helen and I met Bruce at 8 p.m., when he returned from work. A big, buzz-cut young blond with silver earrings, he opened the door snarling at the child behind him: \u201cG\u2019wan! Go in the bedroom and watch TV!\u201d We entered a room chiefly furnished with a black vinyl sofa, and Sammy, crouched in a cage without space for him to stand. Let loose, Sammy rushed us, slamming into our bodies over and over. He wasn\u2019t attacking. Crazed for motion and contact, he flew at us as if trying to pound our warmth into his bones. His paws punched my gut. Wham! My jaw. Wham! Left ovary. Helen and I began raising our bent legs to block him, performing a sort of folk dance in front of Bruce, who told us it was his wife\u2019s dog, a guard dog.\n\n\u201cAs you can see,\u201d he smiled. Barking ecstatically, Sammy rammed my leg, clawed a kneecap, and rediscovered Helen in one sprawling leap. So many friends, so little time. Then he crawled, rubbed, and danced all over Bruce, pushing him down into the squashy sofa. Helen began talking seriously, while I got distracted by a yellow blanket creeping across the carpet at my feet.\n\n\u201cOoh!\u201d I gasped. \u201cIs that a snake?\u201d A little hand patted my sneaker, and a pale, dark-eyed kid revealed himself. Did I want to see him do karate? His name was Joey. Did I want to touch his bubble gum toy? Joey\u2019s mother had left months ago, and he had an inexhaustible repertoire. Did I want his doughnut? Helen clipped a leash onto Sammy\u2019s collar and wrangled the dog, acrobatics and all, into the kitchen. She stood on his leash, giving him two feet of slack. Finally he stood still: a gorgeous, gorgeous puppy, bronze velveteen, black eyes alive with questions, charmingly white-tipped paws. An undershot jaw lent a goofy touch to his expression as he moseyed around Helen\u2019s ankles, at a loss for what to do with himself. Helen checked his education:\n\n\u201cSammy! Sit.\u201d Sammy licked the linoleum. And Helen, on whom my sideshow with Joey had not been lost, pulled in her chin. \u201cSammy has got to be trained. Because he\u2019s going to hurt someone, and that will be trouble for you, or he\u2019ll hurt your little boy and then they\u2019ll put him down. And that\u2019s so unfair. Training \u2013 look, you work long hours? You don\u2019t have the time. Nobody\u2019s blaming you. Nobody could do this. If you came to the shelter looking for a dog, I tell you frankly, I would not recommend this dog for you. You\u2019re overwhelmed here. Why don\u2019t you let us take him off your hands?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have hot dogs!\u201d screamed Joey, swooping to the toaster oven and waving his arms. \u201cLook! They\u2019re here! They burned!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey could be dog treats,\u201d Helen suggested.\n\n\u201c\u2018Dog treats,\u2019\u201d Bruce snorted. He scrounged in a kitchen cupboard, and showed us a bottle.\n\n\u201cI got all the dog stuff, I got this shampoo. See, expensive stuff \u2014 but he sheds, man, he sheds. Is this the right shampoo?\u201d\n\n\u201cDogs shed,\u201d replied Helen, out of patience. Crossing his arms, Bruce announced that he was not going to part with the dog. It was his wife\u2019s; she\u2019d be devastated. Joey was hugging my waist. Wistfully, he kept up his siege.\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t you look at me? Why won\u2019t you just look?\u201d I looked at Joey, and my endocrine system yearned to feed him vegetables. Neglect, the most common form of animal cruelty, is always cross-species; that\u2019s why most humane agents are mandated to check for child abuse. Meanwhile, since Bruce planned to keep Sammy, Helen gave him a week to enroll the dog in obedience classes, and call the human society with the name of the trainer.\n\n\u201cI can fly!\u201d Joey zoomed past and leapt facedown into the sofa.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d said his father.\n\nA week later, here we are again at 8. A pickup pulls into the lot, with two Kawasaki bikes in back, and Bruce gets out.\n\n\u201cNice bikes,\u201d Sue remarks, hinting at how much dog-training money and time is in those bikes. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the poop sample, it says everything.\u201d\n\nState law does not protect animals\u2019 mental health. Access to water, however, is prosecutable. It\u2019s all we have, but a good lawyer could make it vanish like morning dew.\n\nHelen and I jump from the van and as we approach, Helen calls, \u201cNice bikes!\u201d Bruce, annoyed to see us, waxes indignant, but Helen rolls both eyes and one hip, and orders him to bring his dog outside. Not looking at us, Bruce fetches Sammy; he clips his leash to a stake in the backyard grass, and, as the puppy goes ballistic, Helen tells me (lucky me!) to hold him, so she can check for pressure sores. I kneel among the mosquitoes and hug what feels like boxing gloves in my face, like flying nails. Sammy is the equal and opposite reaction to the force of neglect. Helen cries,\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d We flip Sammy on his back, and see beneath his collar a small box on a black band. \u201cA shock collar?\u201d Helen\u2019s voice skips an octave and she stares up at Bruce. \u201cWhy does he have a shock collar on?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bark collar. The neighbors complain he barks, right? I\u2019m training him. I got a training video.\u201d Helen gives me a look of perfect wrath. I don\u2019t think she sees me at all. She sees a point in space where she can beam her understanding of cheap videos that go with shock collars on puppies abominably confined.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not \u2018training,\u2019 you\u2019re just giving him electric shocks. You don\u2019t have the time. Give him to us and we\u2019ll find him a home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t \u2014 he\u2019s my wife\u2019s,\u201d Bruce smirks.\n\n\u201cYou said you\u2019d talk to her about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t home.\u201d He shrugs, and Helen shrugs.\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d she says, \u201cFine. Let\u2019s call her again.\u201d As Sue predicted, Bruce is thrown but sulkily provides the number. We smell victory. In the dusty twilight, red and white lights swooshing by on the highway, Helen, crisply and sweetly, explains to some Dubliner awakened at 2:30 a.m. that she is from a no-kill shelter, highly reputable, check us out on the web \u2026 But Bruce\u2019s wife isn\u2019t home. It\u2019s only her boyfriend. Our gambit\u2019s failed.\n\nBy now, Beth, the child care worker, has arrived, opening the glass backdoor and turning on the yellow light over the patio steps, where Bruce sits and argues. Helen is silhouetted against the mustard steps.\n\n\u201cYou cannot use anything, anything, that my caseworker says about me. That\u2019s conflict of interest!\u201d\n\nRelated More From Menagerie Read previous contributions to this series.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a citizen,\u201d Helen retorts. \u201cAny citizen can report abuse. And a family caseworker is bound, by policy, to report any suspicion of animal abuse! I am,\u201d she says, drawing herself up, \u201ca sworn Humane Society agent, and I\u2019m bound to report any suspicion I have of child abuse!\u201d Now his head hangs. That\u2019s got him: the agencies working together, the pincer movement. If only he doesn\u2019t realize we\u2019re bluffing. Legally, there is nothing against isolating Sammy in a hot cage, without standing room, for 10 hours a day, with electric shocks every time he utters a sound. State law does not protect animals\u2019 mental health. Access to water, however, is prosecutable. It\u2019s all we have, but a good lawyer could make it vanish like morning dew.\n\nHelen presses her advantage.\n\n\u201cAnd we have reason to believe that this dog isn\u2019t getting water. That\u2019s illegal!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean no water! She gives him water!\u201d Bruce stamps inside, leaving Beth, a thin teenager biting her lips.\n\n\u201cHow many times a day do you give him water?\u201d Helen asks. Beth murmurs a single word, the precious nugget of evidence for us to enter in our agent\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cOccasionally \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll need your phone number. We may need to subpoena you.\u201d This is aimed at Bruce, listening through the open door; he emerges and puts a full water bowl on the grass. The air fills with splashy gulping. In seconds, it\u2019s an empty bowl. Helen and I are transfixed.\n\n\u201cWhy is he drinking like that?\u201d Helen demands. Bruce slaps down another bowl. Helen crouches and photographs Sammy. No longer explosive, he now looks small and too ribby, replacing, with puppy gusto, his depleted body fluids.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the next step?\u201d Beth asks, right on cue, as she sits beside Bruce, copying his pose with devious loyalty, bare arms draped over knees.\n\n\u201cThe next step is we get a prosecutor and a search warrant, and we file criminal charges. Look,\u201d Helen adds, acid and lucid, \u201cYou\u2019re not able to train this dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, I\u2019m training him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d She\u2019s splendid, fists crammed into her hips, her body behind each word. \u201cIn what 20 minutes? In the morning? I know how kids are at breakfast! At night? I don\u2019t think so! The thing that\u2019s worst is \u2014 the place where you\u2019re lying to me is \u2014 I know there are times when you wish you didn\u2019t have this dog! Wouldn\u2019t you enjoy coming home and instead of telling Joey, \u2018Go watch TV,\u2019 you could spend some time with him?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a pause, during which Bruce\u2019s face alters, as he sees how the neglect of his dog is tied to the neglect of his son. I feel this shift like the night breeze under my sweaty hair.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say I agree. O.K.? Let\u2019s say I agree. It\u2019s got to be my decision. I mean, you come in here and take my dog? He\u2019s part of my life, I mean \u2014 why don\u2019t I just give you the keys to my truck?\u201d He smiles now, to appease.\n\n\u201cYour dog is not the same sort of an object as your truck. Your dog is a living being. He has \u2014 \u201d Helen jabs \u2014 \u201cneeds.\u201d She lets this sink in. \u201cThe only reason you wouldn\u2019t do this is, your stubborn pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d says Bruce, half-laughing, \u201cnow, this isn\u2019t a male-female thing!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I say anything about that?\u201d Helen says. She looks at me and I look at her. There is a zinged air of discharged tension to everyone in the scene, and it\u2019s almost companionable, because we\u2019re all exhausted. It takes such passionate, annoying people to make changes on board, to command our attention for fellow beings\u2019 needs, during our life\u2019s brief voyage. Neglect is cross-species because time is.\n\nSo with sympathy (before taking the poop sample) I tell Bruce that I understand how giving up your dog is hard, but look at it another way, like, you\u2019re a citizen, and we\u2019re the county society \u2026\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a service!\u201d Helen chimes in.\n\nBruce responds to the idea that he\u2019s being served.\n\nAs Helen fills out papers, I imagine both the puppy and the little boy, each begging in his way, \u201cWon\u2019t you look at me?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nSharona Muir is the author of four books, including, most recently, \u201cInvisible Beasts,\u201d a novel.
