Although El Paso Children\u2019s will remain separately-licensed, it will have a new board and a CEO reporting back to UMC El Paso, a 396-bed public teaching hospital affiliated with Texas Tech University.\n\nUntil 2007, El Paso was the largest city in the country without an independently licensed children\u2019s hospital. The creation of El Paso Children\u2019s changed that, with 122 private pediatric rooms and the goal of serving the youth health needs of the 675,000-person city.\n\nFrom the beginning, UMC was a major partner with El Paso Children\u2019s, as a contractor for administrative services, utilities, housekeeping, maintenance and more. Trouble is, El Paso Children\u2019s stopped paying for those services last year, amid weakening finances.\n\nUMC El Paso kept providing the services, to give El Paso time to consider its options, including becoming a part of UMC, which sparked a backlash from some El Paso physicians and community members who have wanted to remain independent.\n\nWith four CEOs in the span of two years, El Paso Children\u2019s has accumulated around $30 million in debt, according to El Paso Children\u2019s leaders, or nearly $90 million according to UMC, whose bond rating was being questioned in light of the debt. UMC had proposed taking over El Paso Children\u2019s, with the pediatric hospital maintaining its own board, albeit one that reports to UMC.\n\n\u201cWe found the common ground we needed to reach to give our community hope at realizing its vision of a successful Children\u2019s Hospital,\u201d Stephen DeGroat, a member of the UMC Board of Managers, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe final terms convey the vision that the El Paso Community had in 2007 to establish an independent Children\u2019s Hospital dedicated to excellence in pediatric healthcare for the children of El Paso,\u201d said Rosemary Castillo, chair of El Paso Children\u2019s board of directors and CEO of Bienvivir Senior Health Services. \u201cIt is a testimonial to the dedication and commitment that the EPCH\u2019s specialists and subspecialists made to this community when they chose to bring their skills and knowledge to our dedicated children\u2019s hospital.\u201d\n\nThe El Paso County Commissioners, which helped create the children\u2019s hospital 10 years ago, still need to approve the terms of the agreement by April.\n\nThis story has been corrected.
