George Demos may have ex-Gov. George Pataki and ex-Mayor Rudy Giuliani. But State Sen. Lee Zeldin has “The Donald.”

Citizens United Political Victory fund said Donald Trump would be doing a robo-call to 50,000 voters for Zeldin’s GOP congressional primary bid in these, the campaign’s closing days.

In the call, Trump calls Zeldin “a terrific guy,” and there’s “nobody better, very conservative -- he’s going to do something very strong against Obamacare. He will make you all very happy and very proud of your country.”

Not to be outdone, Giuliani, who has headlined many of Demos’ ads, will personally stump for Demos Monday at campaign headquarters in Lake Grove, make calls to voters, and rally his volunteers, according to Kevin Tschirhart, Demos' campaign manager.
