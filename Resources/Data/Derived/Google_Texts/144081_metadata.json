Obama touted the U.S. economy while taking a few jabs at China and Russia, saying \u201cRussia doesn\u2019t make anything. Immigrants aren\u2019t rushing to Moscow in search of opportunity.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he feels let down \u201cpersonally\u201d by Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s handling of recent international affairs , Obama remained optimistic about U.S.-Russia relations and noted a need for a wider perspective of Russia itself.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel let down. We had a very productive relationship with President Medvedev. We got a lot of things done that we needed to get done. Russia I think has always had a Janus-like quality, both looking east and west, and I think President Putin represents a deep strain in Russia that is probably harmful to Russia over the long term, but in the short term can be politically popular at home and very troublesome abroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I do think it\u2019s important to keep perspective. Russia doesn\u2019t make anything. Immigrants aren\u2019t rushing to Moscow in search of opportunity. The life expectancy of the Russian male is around 60 years old. The population is shrinking. And so we have to respond with resolve in what are effectively regional challenges that Russia presents. We have to make sure that they don\u2019t escalate where suddenly nuclear weapons are back in the discussion of foreign policy. And as long as we do that, then I think history is on our side.\u201d\n\nObama joked with John Micklethwait, editor-in-chief of The Economist, and Edward Carr about the magazine\u2019s own cover stories saying \u201chow unfriendly\u201d the Obama administration has been with businesses. Obama responded that corporations will always complain about regulation, and that the U.S. economy has only improved during his time in office.\n\n\u201cThey always complain about regulation,\u201d said Obama. \u201cThat\u2019s their job. Let\u2019s look at the track record. Let\u2019s look at the facts. Since I have come into office, there\u2019s almost no economic metric by which you couldn\u2019t say that the U.S. economy is better and that corporate bottom lines are better. None.\u201d\n\nObama discussed implementation of the Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank, saying that the processes could have been simpler, but that democracy is often a \u201cmessy\u201d process.\n\n\u201cAnd so could we have designed a far more elegant health-care law? Of course,\u201d Obama responded. \u201cWould I have greatly preferred a blank canvas in which to design financial regulations post-2008 and consolidated agencies and simplified oversight? Absolutely. But the truth of the matter is, is that we saved the financial system. It continues to be extraordinarily profitable.\n\n\u201cAnd on health care, as messy as the whole process has been, here\u2019s what I know\u2014that we have millions of people [insured] who didn\u2019t have insurance before, and health care inflation is the lowest it\u2019s been in 50 years, for four consecutive years, corresponding to when we passed the law.\u201d\n\nObama criticized the Republican Party on multiple topics including its opposition to immigration reform and a Tea Party \u201canti-globalization\u201d sect of the GOP. However, he did express optimism regarding corporations\u2019 embrace of immigration reform.\n\n\u201cNow, to their credit, I think on an issue like immigration reform, for example, companies did step up,\u201d said Obama. \u201cAnd what they\u2019re discovering is the problem is not the regulatory zealotry of the Obama administration; what they\u2019re discovering is the dysfunction of a Republican Party that knows we need immigration reform, knows that it would actually be good for its long-term prospects, but is captive to the nativist elements in its party.\u201d\n\nObama said that climate change \u201cdeniers\u201d are simply engaging in arguments that are \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the same I think goes for a whole range of other issues like climate change, for example. There aren\u2019t any corporate CEOs that you talk to at least outside of maybe\u2014no, I will include CEOs of the fossil-fuel industries\u2014who are still denying that climate change is a factor. What they want is some certainty around the regulations so that they can start planning.\u201d\n\nObama continued: \u201cGiven the capital investments that they have to make, they\u2019re looking at 20-, 30-year investments. They\u2019ve got to know now are we pricing carbon? Are we serious about this? But none of them are engaging in some of the nonsense that you\u2019re hearing out of the climate-change denialists. Denialists?\u201d\n\n\u201cDeniers,\u201d White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz, corrected.\n\n\u201cSo the point, though, is that I would take the complaints of the corporate community with a grain of salt,\u201d said Obama, adding that the wealthiest Americans have little to complain about from his time in office.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happened over the last four or five years, the folks who don\u2019t have a right to complain are the folks at the top,\u201d said Obama.\n\n\u201cWhere we have made less progress than I would like, and is my obsession since I came into office and will continue to be my obsession until I leave office and afterwards, is the broader trend of an increasingly bifurcated economy where those at the top are getting a larger and larger share of GDP, increased productivity, corporate profits, and middle-class and working-class families are stuck. Their wages and incomes are stagnant. They\u2019ve been stagnant for almost two decades now. This is not a phenomenon unique to the United States, but it is global.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "air force one, climate-change deniers, economist interview, eric schultz, immigration reform, john micklethwait, moscow, president barack obama, russia, russian president vladimir putin, the economist, u.s. corporations, u.s. economy, u.s. foreign policy", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/08/04/obama-immigrants-arent-rushing-to-moscow-in-search-of-opportunity/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/179651861.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/179651861.jpg?w=1500", "height": 1033}, "type": "article", "title": "Obama: 'Immigrants Aren't Rushing To Moscow In Search Of Opportunity'"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/179651861.jpg?w=1500", "site": "/cbsdc", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obama: 'Immigrants Aren't Rushing To Moscow In Search Of Opportunity'"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Washington DC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS DC", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc"}, "keywords": "cbs washington, politics, air force one, climate-change deniers, economist interview, eric schultz, immigration reform, john micklethwait, moscow, president barack obama, russia, russian president vladimir putin, the economist, u.s. corporations, u.s. economy, u.s. foreign policy", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://washington.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b87f6ea5e510fe3d34ffe9a8dbe8c1cf?s=16"}, "article_summary": "Obama touted the U.S. economy while taking a few jabs at China and Russia, saying \u201cRussia doesn\u2019t make anything.\nImmigrants aren\u2019t rushing to Moscow in search of opportunity.\n\u201cNow, to their credit, I think on an issue like immigration reform, for example, companies did step up,\u201d said Obama.\nObama responded that corporations will always complain about regulation, and that the U.S. economy has only improved during his time in office.\nAnd so we have to respond with resolve in what are effectively regional challenges that Russia presents."}
