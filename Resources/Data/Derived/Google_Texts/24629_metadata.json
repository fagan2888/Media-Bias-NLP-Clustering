REUTERS/Bobby Yip\n\n(Reuters Health) - Premature and underweight newborns may have better survival odds if they pass their days with their bare chests nestled directly against their mothers\u2019 breasts, a research review suggests.\n\nResearchers focused on a practice known as \u201ckangaroo care,\u201d which the World Health Organization has long encouraged as a way to reduce infant mortality, particularly in developing countries.\n\nThis type of infant care includes skin-to-skin contact between the newborn and mother, exclusive breastfeeding, early discharge from the health facility after delivery and close follow-up care at home.\n\nIn an analysis of 124 previously published studies, kangaroo care was associated with 36 percent lower mortality among low birth weight newborns, compared to conventional care.\n\n\u201cDespite the evidence of numerous benefits to infants who receive kangaroo mother care, its overall use around the world remains low, and uptake varies greatly across setting and providers,\u201d said lead author Dr. Ellen Boundy and senior author Dr. Grace Chan, public health researchers at Harvard University in Boston, in an email to Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cHopefully our study will provide a clear picture of the evidence on kangaroo mother care to help clinicians, families and policy-makers understand the benefits implementing this practice can have on newborn health,\u201d Boundy and Chan added.\n\nAn estimated 4 million infants die each year during their first four weeks of life, the researchers note in a paper scheduled for publication in the journal Pediatrics. Infants who are born pre-term or at low birth weight face a greater risk of death, serious illness, developmental delays and chronic disease.\n\nWhile scientists aren\u2019t certain exactly how kangaroo care helps these vulnerable infants, the skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby is thought to help newborns maintain a healthy body temperature and also encourage breastfeeding, the authors said.\n\nBy the time they left the hospital, women practicing kangaroo care were 50 percent more likely to exclusively breast-feed their babies, the analysis found. By one to four months, the practice was linked to 39 percent higher odds of exclusive breastfeeding.\n\nKangaroo care was also associated with lower risks of sepsis, a type of serious bloodstream infection, as well as reduced odds that infants would have extremely high or low body temperatures.\n\nIn addition, the practice was linked to a lower likelihood of repeat hospitalizations.\n\nOne shortcoming of the study is that the researchers couldn\u2019t tell whether, or to what extent, specific aspects of kangaroo care, such as skin-to-skin contact or breastfeeding, were linked to the benefits. Their analysis also couldn\u2019t tell whether the number of hours of kangaroo care each day made a difference.\n\nEven so, the findings add to a growing body of evidence on the benefits of kangaroo care, said Susan Ludington, a researcher at Case Western Reserve University and executive director of the U.S. Institute for Kangaroo Care in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nSome mothers might not do it because the find it too intimate an experience, but most may simply be unaware of this option or unable to be with newborns if babies remain hospitalized after mothers are discharged, Ludington, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\n\nEducating clinicians and women about kangaroo care, discouraging swaddling that gets in the way of skin-to-skin contact, and providing mothers with wraps designed to snuggle undressed infants against their chests might help increase the practice, she said.\n\n\u201cIf an infant is well enough to be swaddled or dressed, he should be in kangaroo care,\u201d Ludington added.\n\nKangaroo care may help human infants because, like all mammalian young, these babies develop their physiological systems in the context of the mother\u2019s body, said Ruth Feldman, a researcher at Bar-Ilan University in Israel and Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n\u201cMaternal deprivation during the critical post-birth period carries detrimental long term effects for all mammalian young,\u201d Feldman, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cProvision of the mother\u2019s physical proximity can counter some of the adverse side effects of premature birth.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1kCYrQ1 Pediatrics, released December 22, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kangaroo, care", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Premature and underweight newborns may have better survival odds if they pass their days with their bare chests nestled directly against their mothers\u2019 breasts, a research review suggests.", "title": "Skin-To-Skin `Kangaroo\u2019 Infant Care Tied To Better Survival", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/skin-skin-kangaroo-infant-care-tied-better-survival-366498", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/22/kangaroo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Premature and underweight newborns may have better survival odds if they pass their days with their bare chests nestled directly against their mothers\u2019 breasts, a research review suggests.", "title": "Skin-To-Skin `Kangaroo\u2019 Infant Care Tied To Better Survival", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/skin-skin-kangaroo-infant-care-tied-better-survival-366498", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/22/kangaroo.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/22/kangaroo.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-12-22T14:52:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-22T14:52:18-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Premature and underweight newborns may have better survival odds if they pass their days with their bare chests nestled directly against their mothers\u2019 breasts, a research review suggests."}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf an infant is well enough to be swaddled or dressed, he should be in kangaroo care,\u201d Ludington added.\nIn an analysis of 124 previously published studies, kangaroo care was associated with 36 percent lower mortality among low birth weight newborns, compared to conventional care.\nTheir analysis also couldn\u2019t tell whether the number of hours of kangaroo care each day made a difference.\nBy the time they left the hospital, women practicing kangaroo care were 50 percent more likely to exclusively breast-feed their babies, the analysis found.\nEven so, the findings add to a growing body of evidence on the benefits of kangaroo care, said Susan Ludington, a researcher at Case Western Reserve University and executive director of the U.S. Institute for Kangaroo Care in Cleveland, Ohio."}
