He is targeting a global market of around 1.6 billion Muslims around the world by allying with Germany\u2019s largest erotic retailer, Beate Uhse.\n\nAccording to media reports, the German erotic industry giant approached Aouragh in 2012 with a business proposal to market his \u201cIslamic branded\u201d sex products, which he sells to the public via his Amsterdam-based El Asira online shop, which means society or tribe in Arabic.\n\n\u201cWe think we can learn a lot from El Asira on how to tap into the Muslim erotic market,\u201d Beate Uhse spokeswoman Linda Blommaert was quoted as saying by AFP news agency.\n\nHowever, El Asira online sex shop says it does not provide traditional sex products, but only products that don\u2019t violate Islamic rules.\n\n\u201cThe products we\u2019re putting on the market have nothing to do with blow-up dolls or vibrators,\u201d Aouragh told AFP. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the sex act; it\u2019s what\u2019s going on around it. Our products increase the atmosphere and heighten feelings of sensuality,\u201d he added.\n\nEl Asira provides products such as oils, creams and lotions. Beate Uhse has 96 shops in 11 European countries with revenues of around 142 million euros last year.\n\nThe two companies are thinking about the possibility of opening a concept store for halal sex products in Saudi Arabia, a country with a strict interpretation of Sharia. If finalized, the shop will be headquartered in Mecca, one of the holiest sites for Muslims.\n\nJoin the Conversation.
