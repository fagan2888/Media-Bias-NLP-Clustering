He is dark-haired, perfectly proportioned and, let\u2019s face it, sexy. The choreography is balletic and modern, his own, and his spine does things Balanchine couldn\u2019t have devised. The lines of C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s body extend toe to head, arm to arm. The camera rolls, take after take, jump after jump. The YouTube views add up too: a couple hundred, a couple thousand and then \u2026 2 million views.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of funny, C\u00f4t\u00e9 says four years later, but he gained \u201cmore attention from a two-minute video\u201d than he did dancing in the best opera houses in the world. This, of course, has much to do with ballet\u2019s declining fortunes: The 600-year-old art form set to classical music doesn\u2019t totally fly with millennials \u2014 the share of Americans who attended a ballet dropped from a measly 3.9 percent in 2002 to an even more dismal 2.7 percent in 2012, according to the National Endowment for the Arts. That\u2019s where C\u00f4t\u00e9, 34, comes in. Yes, he can dance \u2014 and choreograph, and compose music too \u2014 but perhaps most important, he can package for a generation loath to turn off its smartphones at the theater. His production company, Anymotion, turns those very smartphone screens into a sneaky vehicle for its ballet videos.\n\nHistorically, ballet has refused to have much to do with video. While dancers watch clips to learn the steps to a new dance, these low-budget, grainy pieces tend to suck the life right out of the grand jet\u00e9 \u2014 they\u2019re utilitarian and drab. C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s videos, on the other hand, are expressly made to convert non-ballet audiences into fanatics of the pirouette, and so they have style, verve, swagger. His moves are not purely traditional \u2014 C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s toes are not always pointed, the lines of his body not always euclidean \u2014 because, he says, \u201cthere\u2019s a little more humanness in breaking the classical form.\u201d\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s parents weren\u2019t dancers \u2014 they taught primary school \u2014 but they itched for more culture than provincial Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec, with its hockey games and aluminum industry, provided. And so they founded a ballet school. Mom was the administrator, Dad the set designer, and the teacher was imported from Montreal. C\u00f4t\u00e9 and his half-dozen or so cousins all attended. The typical assumption would be that C\u00f4t\u00e9 was bullied for wearing tights, but that wasn\u2019t the case; C\u00f4t\u00e9 has albums full of photos of him and his cousins happily wearing spandex.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 was a prodigy. At 10, he switched from his parents\u2019 school to Canada\u2019s National Ballet School, and then moved up to apprentice at the National Ballet of Canada. By 17, he was part of the company. Nowadays, he\u2019s not only a principal dancer but also a choreographic associate. He recently got the go-ahead for his full-on choreographic debut: This June, the National Ballet of Canada will stage C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s Le Petit Prince, which will be the first new full-length Canadian ballet it\u2019s commissioned in 20 years. Yep, The Little Prince is also being made into a movie this year and it\u2019s a total coincidence.\n\nBut his passion may lie in performances that will never be on the stage. C\u00f4t\u00e9 started his production company after the surprise success of his first video, Lost in Motion. Soon after, he made Lost in Motion II, starring his wife, Heather Ogden, who\u2019s also a principal at the National Ballet of Canada. (Ogden recently gave birth to their first child.) Lost in Motion III will take the concept further. For starters, it\u2019ll involve multiple dancers, and C\u00f4t\u00e9 also plans some surreal play with time, speed and dimension \u2014 stop-motion antics and other things only a camera could do. The goal: \u201cA video game feel,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nSince C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s 2011 foray on camera, others have followed suit. In February 2015, there was ballet\u2019s bad boy Sergei Polunin, racking up 12 million YouTube views with an angsty, David LaChapelle\u2013directed performance set to Hozier\u2019s \u201cTake Me to Church.\u201d In May, the Boston Ballet posted a slo-mo video to promote their lineup (hashtag #rethinkballet). Was the video inspired by C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s work? Well, his videos certainly provide \u201ca glimpse into the art form, which entices somebody who is not already involved in it,\u201d says Mikko Nissinen, the company\u2019s artistic director.\n\nThere are downsides to the video approach, of course. While it gives dancers and choreographers a direct-to-viewer platform, unmediated by a $180 ticket, it also strips away context. The field of vision is necessarily smaller \u2014 the camera often zeroing on the movement of an arm or a torso \u2014 than in the theater, where a cast of dancers creates patterns and repetitions against the backdrop of an expansive stage. \u201cSmall-screen\u201d ballet also seems to require more explicit drama: billowing fabrics, passionate expressions. In the theater, ballet is much less \u201cemotionally overwrought than some of these videos would lead you to think,\u201d says Marina Harss, a writer and member of the Dance Critics Association.\n\nThen there\u2019s the revenue model problem: There isn\u2019t much of one. Lost in Motion was funded by grants and individuals (including C\u00f4t\u00e9 himself), but after 2 million YouTube views, C\u00f4t\u00e9 kind of figured that \u201cit would snowball into resources.\u201d It hasn\u2019t. Which is why Anymotion is now exploring the idea of putting its videos on iTunes. They\u2019ve also partnered with a London production company, Crystal Ballet, which has a Netflix-like subscription model for ballet-video junkies.\n\nFor now, though, C\u00f4t\u00e9 seems happy enough to be able to make people realize \u2014 or \u201cput a worm in their brains,\u201d as he puts it \u2014 that they might actually, shockingly, enjoy ballet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For dance to be relevant in the 21st century, people have to experience it.
