Protectionist barriers are much lower than they were a few decades ago.\n\nIndeed, shifts to freer trade have helped compensate for growing fiscal burdens in the post-WWII era.\n\nBut we also have bad news. There are still sectors where trade taxes and other protectionist policies inhibit voluntary exchange, most notably for agriculture and textiles.\n\nLomborg cites data about the huge gains that would be possible if these sectors were liberalized.\n\nThe direct economic benefits would be a 1.1 per cent increase in global GDP. This sounds modest. But because it would impact the entire world economy, by 2030 we would be about $1.5 trillion richer every year. Open economies also grow faster. In the last 50 years, countries as diverse as South Korea, Chile and India have seen their rate of growth shoot up by 1.5 per cent per annum on average, shortly after liberalisation. If Doha can be completed, it is estimated that the global economy will grow by an extra 0.6 per cent for the next few decades. By 2030, such dynamic growth would make the world economy $11.5 trillion larger each year, leaving us 10 per cent more resources to fix all other problems. \u2026By the end of the century, free trade could leave our grandkids 20 per cent better off, or with $100 trillion more every year than they would otherwise have had.\n\nLomborg is making the very important point that even modest increases in growth, sustained over long periods of time, can lead to huge increases in prosperity.\n\nHe correctly applies this analysis to the trade sector, but it\u2019s a lesson that has universal applicability. It\u2019s why we need better tax policy, a lower burden of government spending, less regulation and red tape, and better rule of law to limit government corruption.\n\nBut today\u2019s focus is trade, so let\u2019s look at a great video from Marginal Revolution University. Here\u2019s Professor Tyler Cowen of George Mason University talking about the benefits of trade.\n\nBy the way, I didn\u2019t notice it at first, but Tyler\u2019s video doesn\u2019t focus on international trade. He simply explains the benefit of trade among people.\n\nBut this also helps to explain why free trade across borders is good for growth. If it\u2019s good for two people inside Virginia to engage in voluntary exchange, and if it\u2019s good for a person in Virginia and a person in Ohio to engage in voluntary exchange, then it\u2019s also true that it\u2019s good for a person in Virginia and a person in Ireland to engage in voluntary exchange.\n\nAnother subtle yet important secondary point from the video is that central planning is folly because no single bureaucrat, or group of bureaucrats, will ever have the necessary knowledge (much less incentive) to properly allocate resources. To elaborate, you just listened to Prof. Cowen explain that one of the big benefits of trade is that people can specialize in things where they have a comparative advantage. And when people specialize, they develop greater knowledge in particular fields, which further increases their productivity. Yet it\u2019s impossible for that diffuse knowledge to be centralized, much less used properly.\n\nWhich is why centrally planned economies such as North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela are such disasters.\n\nAnd this also explains why nations that normally rely on markets get such bad results when politicians take control of specific sectors of the economy. Just consider the failures of ObamaCare and the U.K.\u2019s government-run healthcare system.\n\nBut let\u2019s get back to the issue of trade.\n\nPoliticians sometimes make arguments about \u201ceconomic patriotism.\u201d If that simply meant, for instance, that they wanted a lower corporate tax rate to make American companies and workers more competitive, that would be fine.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve seen with Obama, language about patriotism oftentimes is a ruse to push for protectionism and other bad policies.\n\nAnd one of the reasons why the protectionism-patriotism argument doesn\u2019t make sense is that it presumes a contest among nations. Yet as Walter Williams wisely explained, trade ultimately is between private individuals.\n\nP.S. The MRU videos are great tutorials about economics. In prior posts, I\u2019ve shared videos explaining how taxes destroy economic value, highlighting the valuable role of market-based prices, and revealing the destructive impact of government subsidies. They\u2019re all worth a few minutes of your time.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Daniel Mitchell articles, Daniel J.
