Of course, my feeling is all lives matter,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was an important gesture of goodwill.\u201d\n\nChief Magnus said he was surprised by the negative reaction he received after an onlooker snapped a photo of him at the protest. The Richmond Police Officers\u2019 Association accused him of breaking the law for politicking in uniform, the CBS affiliate reported.\n\n\u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t intended to be a political statement \u2014 it was intended to be a humane statement,\u201d Chief Magnus explained. \u201cI can understand how it is hard for a lot of police officers, especially given what has gone on in some the protests, the violence, the ugly anti-police sentiment.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Chief Magnus said he would be \u201cappalled\u201d if he saw an officer holding a sign that was supportive of former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, who fatally shot Michael Brown.\n\n\u201cI would have been appalled. And I think there is a real difference because my statement was about building bridges,\u201d he told the news station. \u201cA statement like supporting Darren Wilson, especially under the circumstances, is incredibly divisive \u2014 I think inappropriate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A California police chief is defending his participation in a police brutality protest where he appeared in uniform holding a \"#BlackLivesMatter\" sign.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A California police chief is defending his participation in a police brutality protest where he appeared in uniform holding a \u201c#BlackLivesMatter\u201d sign.", "title": "Chris Magnus, Calif. police chief, defends holding #BlackLivesMatter sign while in uniform", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/17/chris-magnus-calif-police-chief-defends-holding-bl/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/17/chris-magnus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/17/chris-magnus.jpg", "description": "A California police chief is defending his participation in a police brutality protest where he appeared in uniform holding a \"#BlackLivesMatter\" sign.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Chris Magnus, Calif. police chief, defends holding #BlackLivesMatter s"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Chris Magnus, CBS"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b26\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t intended to be a political statement \u2014 it was intended to be a humane statement,\u201d Chief Magnus explained.\n\u201cSure, I would do it again,\u201d Richmond Police Chief Chris Magnus told a local CBS affiliate.\nA California police chief is defending his participation in a police brutality protest where he appeared in uniform holding a \u201c#BlackLivesMatter\u201d sign.\nAnd I think there is a real difference because my statement was about building bridges,\u201d he told the news station.\nThe Richmond Police Officers\u2019 Association accused him of breaking the law for politicking in uniform, the CBS affiliate reported."}
