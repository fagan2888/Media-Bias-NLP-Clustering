But the first meeting of a group that will review applications for the grants shows there\u2019s doubt over who will be able to accept the funding.\n\nNext week, Colorado\u2019s health department will release the program\u2019s official request for applications. Starting early next year, the state expects to distribute $9 million for research on the medical effects of cannabis, making it the largest state-funded effort to study medical marijuana.\n\nThe department\u2019s new Medical Marijuana Scientific Advisory Council will review applications in November and make recommendations to the state Board of Health over which studies should be funded. Who will receive that money, though, is an ongoing question because of marijuana\u2019s strictly illegal status at the federal level.\n\nAt the council\u2019s first meeting Friday, several members raised questions about whether university-based researchers would be able to participate in the program without first getting complicated approval from the federal government. Some members said university review boards might pull approval for projects seen as too controversial or a threat to the university\u2019s federal funding even after the state grants money for the research.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge for the applicant,\u201d said Dr. Larry Wolk, the health department\u2019s executive director. \u201cPart of our work is going to be to make sure we have reserve awards if something falls through.\u201d\n\nDr. Paula Riggs, a council member who is an addiction-medicine specialist at the University of Colorado, said researchers can reduce that concern by getting approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration. But such approval typically takes a long time.\n\n\u201cYou can do it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you have to jump through the hoops.\u201d\n\nThe bill that created the grant program also directs Colorado\u2019s attorney general to work with the federal government to get approval for research on marijuana. It is unclear what the attorney general\u2019s office has done to pursue that goal.\n\nJohn Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.com/john_ingold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado medical marijuana research grants face federal uncertainty", "title": "Colorado medical marijuana research grants face federal uncertainty", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/29/colorado-medical-marijuana-research-grants-face-federal-uncertainty/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140714__20140703__marijuana-stockp1-3.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140714__20140703__marijuana-stockp1-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-29T14:14:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:52:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca9f0\"", "article_summary": "But the first meeting of a group that will review applications for the grants shows there\u2019s doubt over who will be able to accept the funding.\nColorado will begin handing out money for a groundbreaking medical-marijuana research grant program early next year.\nStarting early next year, the state expects to distribute $9 million for research on the medical effects of cannabis, making it the largest state-funded effort to study medical marijuana.\nThe department\u2019s new Medical Marijuana Scientific Advisory Council will review applications in November and make recommendations to the state Board of Health over which studies should be funded.\nWho will receive that money, though, is an ongoing question because of marijuana\u2019s strictly illegal status at the federal level."}
