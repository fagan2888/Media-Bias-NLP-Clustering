They have the most wins and are the most fun. They are trendsetters and record setters. They are leaving a trail of teams and NBA observers alike in a sea of head shakes and awe.\n\nWe know them.\n\nThey are worthy headliners in how they operate on and off the court.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a one-team show.\n\nTwo of the best stories of late are under-the-radar teams.\n\nMost observers would be hard-pressed to identify the Charlotte Hornets as having one of the 10 best records in the NBA going into Saturday. But they do. The Hornets are stocked with shooting and led by one of the most improved and underrated players in the league, point guard Kemba Walker.\n\nOne season ago, you needed to head to the bottom of the 3-point percentage rankings to find the Hornets.\n\nIndeed, there they were, last in the NBA at 31.8 percent.\n\nNow?\n\nCharlotte knocks down 3-pointers with the best teams in the league and is among the top 10 in the category. Going into Saturday\u2019s games, the Hornets had risen to fifth in the East, just a 1\u00bd games out of fourth. This was the trajectory coach Steve Clifford\u2019s team was supposed to be on last season, but bad personnel moves doomed the Hornets from the start after a promising 2013-14 season.\n\nMeanwhile, the coach getting the last laugh \u2014 so far \u2014 is the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 Dave Joerger.\n\nHis team loses players \u2026 and wins more games.\n\nGone are leading scorers Marc Gasol (injury) and Mike Conley (injury). Brandan Wright (injury) is out. Jeff Green and Courtney Lee were traded.\n\nIn are Chris Andersen, Lance Stephenson, P.J. Hairston \u2026 and more wins?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very upside-down situation,\u201d Joerger said before his Feb. 29 game in Denver against the Nuggets. \u201cWe\u2019re coming along, guys are in good spirits, chemistry is good, and guys like each other. They go out there arm in arm and just go play hard.\u201d\n\nIt should be a combustible mix. Stephenson, Tony Allen, Matt Barnes, Andersen.\n\nArm in arm?\n\nYes. In lock step.\n\nGrit and grind have been replaced with space and pace. Scores in the 90s have been replaced by an average of 105.3 points in 12 games since the all-star break. Instead of fading in wake of considerable attrition, the Grizzlies have flourished, solidifying themselves in the fifth spot in the Western Conference race.\n\nWhat\u2019s taking place in Memphis is remarkable. These were the five starters Memphis put on the court against New Orleans on Friday night: Briante Weber, Allen, Barnes, JaMychal Green and Ryan Hollins.\n\nGo ahead, beat Anthony Davis and Co. with that.\n\nJoerger did.\n\nThere is some question about whether he\u2019ll be back with the team next season. There is no question the system he wanted this team to transition to from the start is getting its first true test.\n\nAnd it\u2019s passing with flying colors.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the glitz of Golden State. That\u2019s basketball on steroids, an MVP (Stephen Curry), a player averaging almost a triple-double this season (Draymond Green), a 3-point-shooting all-star (Klay Thompson) and a host of high-caliber support players.\n\nBut Memphis is a great story.\n\nAnd maybe, in the future, a big winner.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nJames Harden, G, Houston\n\nThe battle for the final two playoff spots in the Western Conference is heating up, and James Harden is doing all he can to get Houston in the postseason. In so doing, he is The Denver Post\u2019s player of the week.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In four road games, Harden averaged 34.3 points, 8.5 assists and 5.5 rebounds. Houston won three of those games. There were flaws in his performances: Harden shot just 41.8 percent from the field and 24.2 from the 3-point line. But he was at his foul-drawing best, taking a whopping 15.3 free throws per game, on average, making an average of 86.9 percent. He averaged a plus-8.8 for the week, so the Rockets were effective as a team when he was on the court.\n\nBackground: It hasn\u2019t been easy following last year\u2019s MVP-caliber season for Harden. Houston has struggled, he has taken a lot of the blame for that, and the whole scene has been rocky. But he led the Rockets to three good wins, first over the East\u2019s second-best team, Toronto. Then came a win over Philadelphia, and finally a win over Boston, the East\u2019s third-best team, which snapped the Celtics\u2019 14-game home winning streak.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: The Rockets are trying to live out the adage: All\u2019s well that ends well.\n\nThis season has been a struggle at best. A coach was fired. Ty Lawson, who was supposed to bolster the Rockets\u2019 roster, was waived. Dwight Howard was dangled on the trade market. But making the playoffs would be big, and the Rockets, winners in four of their last five going into Sunday\u2019s game, seem to be getting things right at the opportune time.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: Hornets, Grizzlies two of the NBA\u2019s most-underrated stories", "title": "Dempsey: Hornets, Grizzlies two of the NBA\u2019s most-underrated stories", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/12/dempsey-hornets-grizzlies-two-of-the-nbas-most-underrated-stories/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-12T17:52:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:37:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christopher Dempsey"}, "article_summary": "What\u2019s up: In four road games, Harden averaged 34.3 points, 8.5 assists and 5.5 rebounds.\nGoing into Saturday\u2019s games, the Hornets had risen to fifth in the East, just a 1\u00bd games out of fourth.\nOne season ago, you needed to head to the bottom of the 3-point percentage rankings to find the Hornets.\nMost observers would be hard-pressed to identify the Charlotte Hornets as having one of the 10 best records in the NBA going into Saturday.\nThe Hornets are stocked with shooting and led by one of the most improved and underrated players in the league, point guard Kemba Walker."}
