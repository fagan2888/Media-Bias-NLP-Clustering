Winds of 127 mph ripped across Louisiana 10 years ago, leaving in its wake devastation of property, destruction of lives, and a death toll of 1,836 people.

New Orleans was among the hardest hit due to its location on the Gulf Coast with levees breaching in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

FEMA called it “the single most catastrophic natural disaster in U.S. history,” and it is estimated to have caused $108 billion from the damage that ensued.

While the majority of the city of New Orleans had been evacuated before the worst of the storm, many natives felt they could endure it in their own homes, like they had before. The combination of the Category 3 hurricane with the failure of the levees led to 80 percent of the city being immersed in water, and the need for tens of thousands to be rescued.

Hurricane Katrina touched ground 10 years ago this week, yet its presence is still felt as New Orleans has rebuilt itself from the destruction.

Here are 19 pictures showing the aftermath of that catastrophic storm and the people who survived it.
