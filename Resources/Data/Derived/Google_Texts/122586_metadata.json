JIEP is devoted to the dissemination of high quality, peer-reviewed articles covering the full spectrum of interprofessional healthcare education, including first professional degree, post-licensure learners, practitioner continuing education and faculty development.\n\nTopics covered in JIEP include:\n\nAssessment of educational outcomes\n\nClinical practice, interprofessional healthcare research, opinion, public policy and review\n\nInnovative teaching and learning strategies\n\nNew school and program start-up strategies\n\nReal-world healthcare activities that promote collaborative, efficient and cost-reducing measures\n\nJIEP founding Co-Editors-in-Chief are Devin R. Nickol, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine at UNMC, for the interprofessional education (IPE) portion, and Antonio E. Puente, PhD, Professor of Psychology at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, for the interprofessional practice (IPP) portion.\n\nExcited by JIEP's potential to advance the field of IPE, Dr. Nickol said, \"In recent years, IPE has developed into an essential feature of healthcare education, a fact increasingly recognized by accrediting bodies. JIEP will serve a vital role by encouraging scholarly work in the field and providing practical resources to educators responsible for implementing IPE for students in all health disciplines.\"\n\nDr. Puente added, \"JIEP's role will be to reflect the future of health care, as supported by the NAP as the sponsoring official organization. With the advent of the Affordable Care Act and modern day health care, interfacing and integrating all aspects of health care will be the standard, and the journal will be a scholarly pioneer in this critical movement.\"\n\nNina Milton, Publishing Director at Elsevier, said, \"We are excited about the launch of JIEP, which gives us an early presence in the rapidly growing field of IPE/IPP. JIEP's joint focus is an ideal union because clinicians cannot practice without education and the goal of education is practice. We are also thrilled to be collaborating with NAP and UNMC, both highly influential in the IPE/IPP arena, lending credibility to JIEP's role in advancing interprofessional education and practice with resulting improved patient outcomes.\"\n\n###\n\nFor more information or to submit an article, go to: http://www. jieponline. com/\n\nAbout National Academies of Practice (NAP)\n\nNAP is a nonprofit organization founded in 1981 to advise governmental bodies on the healthcare system.
