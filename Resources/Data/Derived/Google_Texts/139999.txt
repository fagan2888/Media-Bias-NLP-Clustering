Two men were formally charged Friday in connection with the murder of 19-year-old Randy Canister this year.

Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey charged Qashelby Frazier-Moore, 21, and Kentrall Hines, 19, with first-degree murder and felony murder, according to a news release.

The charges allege that Frazier-Moore and Hines were in a car with Canister on Feb. 17 when they shot him and left his body on the side of the road near East Robins Drive and Ireland Street, the release said.

Police initially called their inquiry a “death investigation” before saying they were investigating the death as a homicide.

Frazier-Moore and Hines remain in custody and are being held without bail.

Their next court date has not been set.
