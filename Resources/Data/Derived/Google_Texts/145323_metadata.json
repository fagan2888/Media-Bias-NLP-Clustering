(Credit: Epstein Global)\n\nFor this week\u2019s walk down memory lane, we visit Gottlieb Memorial Hospital in Melrose Park, Ill., a Chicago suburb.\n\nLocal construction and engineering firm A. Epstein and Sons Inc. was hired in 1959 to expand the general-treatment facility, then a 120-bed medical institution. Over the next six years, the company designed additional floors and enlarged ancillary services, nearly doubling the number of beds to 225.\n\nWhen the first phase was completed in 1961, a marketing mailer touted the facility\u2019s state-of-the-art technology: a heating and air conditioning system powered by radiant ceiling panels, remote-control television, a bedside-operated audio and visual nurses\u2019 call system; \u201c ... in general, the interiors are pleasing and designed for patient comfort.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting to see that patient comfort was finally considered an important design element,\u201d notes Noel Abbott, Epstein\u2019s vice president, director of marketing and public relations, adding that today, enhancing the patient experience is almost the No. 1 hospital concern.\n\nNurses\u2019 station. A May 17, 1959, Chicago Daily Tribune article stated that future building expansion would include a school for nursing, an initiative that didn\u2019t happen, according to Alan Goldberg, the hospital\u2019s vice president of administrative services. (Credit: Epstein Global)\n\nGottlieb\u2019s distinctive entrance canopy also created a stir within the medical community, because it was considered too \u201cshowy,\u201d Abbott says; however, this feature eventually was duplicated nationwide.\n\nWhile Gottlieb has been expanded numerous times during the past 50 years, elements of Epstein\u2019s original design are still visible. The facility merged with Loyola University Health System in 2008 and became part of Trinity Health System in 2011. A. Epstein and Sons Inc. also has grown and is now Epstein Global.\n\nEntrance canopy for the 1961 addition. A May 17, 1959, Chicago Daily Tribune article stated that original building plans included a \u201cradiation-resistant\u201d bomb shelter in the basement. The shelter was never built, says Goldberg.
