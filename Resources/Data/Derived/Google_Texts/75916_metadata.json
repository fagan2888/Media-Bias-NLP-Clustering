Other parents tend to drive carefully, and we\u2019re all pretty good about making allowances for children who disembark slowly, hefting backpacks that look big enough to hide their siblings. Aggravation, when it happens, is usually triggered by the decals on other vehicles.\n\nIts Euro-socialist pedigree notwithstanding, my 15-year-old Volvo is not one of those cars adorned with a \u201cCoexist\u201d bumper sticker. Like fellow Spectator contributor R.J. Moeller, I do not see the point of mixing secular and religious iconography in head-scratching (not to say \u201cdumbass\u201d) ways. Even so \u2014 and despite an antipathy for almost every political program our president stands for \u2014 I made peace with both the \u201cCoexist\u201d sticker and with the false sunrise of the Obama logo two elections ago. One of them is incoherent, and the other does not seem so grandiose if you think of the stylized sun as a grow light in close-up. The red, white, and blue in its proper context means \u201cthis is your country,\u201d but the red, white, and blue in Obama for America\u2019s agricultural tattoo means \u201cThis is your country run by the Choom Gang.\u201d\n\nIt may not be fair to subject bumper stickers to the same level of scrutiny that longer arguments get, but thinking has to start somewhere. Six years into the most deliberately divisive administration in American history (Both Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln had more humility), I\u2019m beginning to think that the only effective strategy for conservatives must be Churchillian: We shall fight on the beaches; we shall fight on the landing grounds; we shall fight in the fields and in the streets \u2014 and it is only by doing so that we can give peace a chance, beset as peace currently is by state-sponsored envy and intolerance.\n\nYesterday morning\u2019s carpool reverie ended when I noticed that the minivan in front of me had bumper stickers at odds with each other: \u201cWag more, bark less\u201d one said. Amen to that, I thought, but not to the sticker next to it: \u201cThe president is not a foreign-born socialist giving away free health care. That would be Jesus.\u201d\n\nWell isn\u2019t that special. Barack Obama is doing the Lord\u2019s work \u2014 and not just inadvertently, but by design. Quotation marks do not exist anymore, straw men are xenophobes, \u201csubsidized\u201d now means \u201cwithout cost,\u201d and every stinking jot and tittle of the Affordable Care Act advances the Kingdom of God, complete with contraception and abortion. Glad you cleared all that up, Mr. Genius Sticker Maker. Somebody ought to tell Hobby Lobby and the Little Sisters of the Poor. As rhetoric goes, your handiwork is a bad amalgam of Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Lord of the Rings (\u201cBadges? We ain\u2019t got no badges!\u201d), but failure to cite evidence for an invidious comparison does not often fool me. The Elvish blade of my education glowed blue near that bumper sticker, as my high school debate coach had known it would.\n\nConsider that sticker as a cultural artifact, and what an artifact like that says about its fans. Some people, bless their hearts, slept through lessons about \u201cseparation of powers\u201d in American government. After that, they missed a flotilla of well-documented problems with \u201cliberation theology\u201d and how its \u201csocial justice or bust\u201d ethos always ends badly for the already powerless. It\u2019s Low Information Voting, writ large. Now some of the same people aim to improve on Peter\u2019s answer to the question, \u201cWho do you say that I am?\u201d as recorded in Mark 8:29 and Luke 9:20. Lucky for the rest of us that Peter said nothing about Jesus being a Socialist, and his answer to that all-important question about Christ\u2019s identity was ratified by God.\n\nShall we box Jesus into political categories, passing up the Messiah for a kinder, gentler Che Guevara? No thank you. I know there\u2019s precedent for that kind of thing (In the Palm Sunday liturgy of the Catholic Church, the whole congregation shouts for Pontius Pilate to release Barabbas rather than Jesus in observance of the first-century Roman custom at Passover, but that\u2019s a scriptural exercise meant to stimulate soul-searching, not \u2014 one hopes \u2014 a paraphrase of any recent Democratic Voter Guide).\n\nThe carpool line might not do much for my blood pressure this year.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6d5\"", "article_summary": "Its Euro-socialist pedigree notwithstanding, my 15-year-old Volvo is not one of those cars adorned with a \u201cCoexist\u201d bumper sticker.\nThe Elvish blade of my education glowed blue near that bumper sticker, as my high school debate coach had known it would.\nThe carpool line might not do much for my blood pressure this year.\nYesterday morning\u2019s carpool reverie ended when I noticed that the minivan in front of me had bumper stickers at odds with each other: \u201cWag more, bark less\u201d one said.\nMy son takes a bus to school, but my daughter does not, and the carpool lane where she and I pass several minutes every weekday morning creeping past traffic cones to whichever teacher has Door Duty at the school entrance can be aggravating."}
