OSBI agents are investigating following an officer-involved shooting in Altus Saturday.

Saturday afternoon, Altus Police were called to home at 1213 Frisco to serve a felony arrest warrant on 35-year-old Pete Mendoza Miranda, Jr. Miranda had barricaded himself with a handgun inside a bedroom of the home. After a short period, Miranda fled and officers pursued on foot.

Miranda ran to a vacant lot in the 700 block of S. Hickman and took cover behind an abandoned vehicle.

Altus Police said Miranda drew a pistol from a holster beneath his coat and pointed it at an officer. Thatâ€™s when one officer fired several shots. Miranda was hit twice in the chest before he surrendered himself to police. He was transported to a local hospital and treated for minor injuries.

Miranda has since been released and booked into the Jackson County Jail on a felony warrant for concealing stolen property, possession of controlled and dangerous drugs, and use of a firearm while committing a felony.

OSBI agents will continue to investigate and compile a report for the DA. The DA will determine whether the shooting was justified.
