The Chicago-based physicians group issued a statement last month that it has adopted a policy to block such advertising.\n\nThe AMA\u2019s chief argument is that the \u201cgrowing proliferation of ads is driving demand for expensive treatments despite the clinical effectiveness of less costly alternatives.\u201d Patrice A. Harris, chair-elect of the AMA, added: \u201cDirect-to-consumer advertising also inflates demand for new and more expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not be appropriate.\u201d The AMA noted that the U.S. and New Zealand are the only two countries that allow DTC advertising of prescription drugs. It cited research by Kantar Media that tracked a 30% increase in ad spending by drug makers in the past two years, totaling $4.5 billion.\n\nRelated: How Injectable 'Biologic' Drugs Are Busting Medicare\u2019s Budget\n\nMuch of the advertising for prescription drugs is actually directed at doctors, according to Wharton professor of health care management Amanda Starc. Only a tenth of the advertising budgets at pharmaceutical companies is spent on TV ads, she said. \u201cThe AMA is targeting a relatively small proportion of ads that potentially provide information to consumers or potentially steer consumers from one drug to another within a category,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cYou might think these ads could be good,\u201d said Michael Sinkinson, Wharton professor of business economics and public policy. \u201cThey could actually encourage people to talk to their doctor and get their cholesterol checked. The worry, though, is: What if these ads are not about getting you to talk to your doctor [but] getting you to ask for a specific drug?\u201d He noted that the AMA\u2019s concern is precisely that \u201cthese ads are having more of a bad effect.\u201d\n\nStarc and Sinkinson discussed the likely implications of a ban on DTC advertising of prescription drugs on the Knowledge@Wharton show on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111. (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.)\n\nDTC advertising of pharmaceutical drugs was tightly regulated until 1997, when the Food and Drug Administration relaxed rules. Over time, advertising of drugs increased, Starc noted. Other changes that have occurred in recent years include the aging of baby boomers and their emergence as a market for anti-cholesterol drugs. The expansion of prescription drug coverage in the Medicare program will also create a bigger market for pharmaceuticals, and consequently more and more advertising, she added.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nStarc and Sinkinson recently published a paper that looked precisely at the impact of DTC advertising of pharmaceutical drugs. The paper, titled \u201cAsk Your Doctor? Direct-to-Consumer Advertising of Pharmaceuticals,\u201d found that advertisements for branded, patented pharmaceutical drugs often have effects that go beyond providing information to patients, according to a recent Knowledge@Wharton report.\n\nRelated: Specialty Drug Prices Soar Past $50,000 a Year \u2013 and We\u2019re All Going to Pay for It\n\nThe DTC ads are also about \u201cbusiness-stealing,\u201d i.e., convincing consumers to buy one firm\u2019s drug over that of a rival, the researchers found. In a positive spillover, the ads encourage patients to visit their doctors to check on different medical conditions, but potentially drive them to cheaper, generic equivalents of the branded drugs that are advertised, the authors wrote.\n\nThe paper looked at the effectiveness of TV advertising for anti-cholesterol drugs such as Pfizer\u2019s Lipitor and Astra Zeneca\u2019s Crestor during the election cycle of 2007 and 2008, and the impact of political ads on drug ads in that period.\n\nSinkinson said the study found that many consumers do go to their doctors to talk about Lipitor, but end up walking away with a prescription for another drug in the same class, potentially a lower-priced one. \u201cThat is a positive effect of this advertising,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the largest U.S. trade group for the pharmaceutical industry, defended DTC advertising of prescription drugs. In a response to the AMA call for a ban, it said the ads increase consumer awareness of available treatments for diseases, including undiagnosed conditions, according to a Reuters report. A series of court decisions has determined the ads cannot be banned outright because they are a form of commercial speech protected by the U.S. Constitution, the report added.\n\nThe Profit Connection\n\nStarc saw a clear connection between drug advertising and pharmaceutical company profits. She said pharmaceutical companies spent those advertising dollars targeted largely at doctors only because they steer patients towards specific drugs. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that these are profit-maximizing firms doing this advertising,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing it for the good of your health; they\u2019re doing it to improve their bottom line.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why the U.S. Is Being Gouged on Drug Prices Compared to Other Countries\n\nPatients today could look up public data records to check where their physician is receiving payments from. That is thanks to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act that was enacted in 2010, Starc said.\n\nAccording to Sinkinson, the AMA\u2019s call for a ban brings up a crucial regulatory question: \u201cAre the benefits of these ads worth potentially the cost of these ads to the system?\u201d he asked. He said pharmaceutical companies tend to stop advertising their branded drugs once they go off-patent. Lipitor\u2019s patent expired in November 2011, while that of Crestor is set to expire in 2016. \u201cIf there are no more ads to encourage patients to do their cholesterol check, that could be bad,\u201d he said.\n\nStarc noted that although generics alternatives might also be available, insurance companies often put structures in place that attempt to steer consumers towards one product or another in a class. \u201cFor example, your insurance company may want you to take generic statins that are similar to Lipitor but at a fraction of the cost,\u201d she said. \u201cDirect-to-consumer advertising is just one of the many mechanisms used to funnel consumers towards certain products within a category.\u201d\n\nStarc said advertising could be justifiable in cases where a certain drug is seen to be cost-effective. \u201c[If] the benefits far outweigh what we are paying for it, then, from a public policy perspective, you want more people taking it \u2014 and there is where we think the advertising might have a positive effect,\u201d she added.\n\nRelated: Pfizer, Allergan and the Growing Needs of an Aging Population\n\nWho decides if the cost-benefit ratio justifies the advertising? \u201cThe doctor is like the gatekeeper here,\u201d said Sinkinson. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go and buy a prescription drug. You have to get a prescription first.\u201d\n\nWhat if the AMA Wins?\n\nIf the AMA is successful in its call for a ban on DTC advertising of prescription drugs, pharmaceutical companies would have to rethink their marketing strategies overall, said Starc. \u201cThey would also have to rethink their relationships with insurers and their pricing strategies,\u201d she added. According to Sinkinson, while it would be \u201cgood to have a more educated patient population, it is not so good to have them fighting with their doctor to get a prescription for a specific drug.\u201d\n\nStarc backed DTC advertising in situations where it makes drugs that target a smaller population more profitable. \u201cIt we think there is an underdevelopment of R&D in that area, that could be a very big thing,\u201d she said.\n\nSinkinson saw millennials as \u201cthe next markets\u201d for pharmaceutical advertising. \u201cThe fact that they can be reached and are going to be more engaged with the Internet where they could be targeted more effectively might make [drug development] more profitable,\u201d he said. The digital age presents \u201ca huge growth area\u201d for pharmaceutical companies in \u201cgetting the right ad to the right person,\u201d he added.\n\nHere, Starc expected pharmaceutical companies to target millennials with drugs such as oral contraceptives and others for anxiety and depression. \u201cThis is going to be an ongoing issue as various cohorts move through the life cycle.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Knowledge@Wharton\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising in the U.S.", "title": "Is It Time to Get Rid of TV Drug Ads?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/05/It-Time-Get-Rid-TV-Drug-Ads", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/viagra-date-night-large-10.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/05/It-Time-Get-Rid-TV-Drug-Ads", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/viagra-date-night-large-10.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising in the U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Only a tenth of the advertising budgets at pharmaceutical companies is spent on TV ads, she said.\nDTC advertising of pharmaceutical drugs was tightly regulated until 1997, when the Food and Drug Administration relaxed rules.\nThe paper looked at the effectiveness of TV advertising for anti-cholesterol drugs such as Pfizer\u2019s Lipitor and Astra Zeneca\u2019s Crestor during the election cycle of 2007 and 2008, and the impact of political ads on drug ads in that period.\nThe digital age presents \u201ca huge growth area\u201d for pharmaceutical companies in \u201cgetting the right ad to the right person,\u201d he added.\nThe Profit ConnectionStarc saw a clear connection between drug advertising and pharmaceutical company profits."}
