An integration of telecommunications technology, customer service and best practice processes, PayVow allows a hospital or physician office to get patients quickly \u201con the record,\u201d creating a context of commitment to paying. It also applies proprietary, Patient Friendly Billing\u00ae practices to resolve accounts based on patients\u2019 intention regarding payment.\n\nChanges under way in healthcare make PayVow especially timely. Health insurance premiums have doubled since 2003, and deductibles have shot up 146%, according to the Commonwealth Fund, resulting in patients paying a much larger share of medical bills. Hundreds of new insurance plans have arisen since passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, leaving patients unaware of their out-of-pocket costs. As a result, self-pay collections have become a far bigger revenue cycle challenge for healthcare providers.\n\n\u201cMost hospitals focus on high-charge bills, but even people with higher incomes pay late or won\u2019t pay at all,\u201d said Jesse Ford, Salud\u2019s President and CEO. \u201cSmall balances are easier to collect, but there is a diminishing return on investment in pursuing them. We invented PayVow to solve this dilemma.\u201d\n\nThe PayVow\u2122 Collection Suite is ideal for smaller accounts, allowing a large number of accounts to be contacted with less labor time. Staff is freed up to focus on larger balance accounts, and overall collections are improved. Healthcare providers can collect on accounts earlier, reducing bad debt. They can also proactively identify charity care cases to meet or exceed community benefit requirements.\n\nPayVow is unique in harnessing the power of social psychology to improve collections. A vast array of research has cast light on the power of verbal or written statements in influencing future behavior. Robert Cialdini, Regents\u2019 Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Marketing, Arizona State University, and the author of the 2006 book, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, wrote: \u201cOnce we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.\u201d PayVow is designed to obtain that personal commitment from the patient.\n\n\u201cThis approach is new to healthcare but it has been successfully applied in other industries,\u201d said Richard DeSoto, Salud\u2019s Vice President of Consulting Services, who leads the PayVow project. DeSoto has worked on such applications previously. \u201cPayVow changes the nature of the interaction from a collections approach to customer service outreach, where you can have a dialogue about the patient\u2019s available insurance coverage, ability to pay and charity care options.\u201d\n\nAbout Salud\n\nSalud Revenue Partners provides hospitals, health systems and physician practices with revenue cycle management, extended business office support, leading-edge coding solutions and patient access services.
