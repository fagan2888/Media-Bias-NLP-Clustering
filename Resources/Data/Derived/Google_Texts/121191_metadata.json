Instead, nurses gave her cotton-gauzes and at best clamps to stop the bleeding. Then, one day a doctor solved her problem in five minutes. \u201cFinally a doctor had enough compassion for me and cauterized the vein,\u201d Marquez said.\n\nThe mother of four told her story about life as an undocumented resident without insurance at a forum meant to underscore the importance of a bill introduced by Senator Ricardo Lara (D) called \u201cHealth4All\u201d (SB4).\n\nThe legislation, which passed the Senate and is now before an Assembly committee, seeks to provide healthcare \u2013 regardless of immigration status \u2013 to the nearly 2.6 million uninsured Californians. Illness does not discriminate and neither should California, said Senator Lara, during a briefing for the ethnic media that New America Media hosted earlier this month.\n\nLara, whose parents immigrated from Mexico, introduced the bill in December, 2014. He called Governor Jerry Brown\u2019s recent decision to allocate $40 million to provide Medi-Cal for the the state\u2019s 170,000 undocumented children a victory. The program will be launched in April 2016.\n\nAlthough Brown\u2019s budget will provide health coverage for children, nearly 1.5 million undocumented adults in California remained uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe need to be sure that the Health for All Kids Budget signed by the governor remains a top priority, and also help the children to do a quick transition from the emergency Medi-Cal to a comprehensive coverage,\u201d he said. Medi-Cal covers low-income residents.\n\nLara\u2019s bill includes a request for a federal waiver to allow undocumented citizens to buy health insurance through Covered California. At present, President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act prevents undocumented residents from any federally-funded insurance.\n\n\u201cWe get our foot in the door, but we haven\u2019t reach the finish line which is the coverage for all,\u201dsaid Assembly member Rob Bonta (D), a co sponsor of the bill. \u201cSome Republicans have argued fiscal reasons for not supporting the law but we need to understand that it is costing $1.7 billion annually to our state budget, to care for undocumented immigrants in our emergency rooms,\u201d said Bonta, whose parents immigrated from the Philippines.\n\n\u201cThe right to be sick\u201d\n\nMarquez said her immigration status makes it impossible or too expensive to get care.\n\n\u201cEvery time one gets injured, it is impossible to pay costly doctors appointments,\u201d she said \u201cThere is not enough money for rent, food and also, all my kids are in college,\u201d she said. \u201cMy other son developed kind of a tumor in his feet and just for a room in the hospital, they charged us $1500.\u201d\n\nIndeed, just one of her four children, who is 16, would be covered under Brown\u2019s budgetary allocation. To qualify she will need to prove that the family\u2019s annual income falls below $18,000 a year.\n\n\u201cI recently started to work in the City and I am glad that I will have health insurance after 14 years of living in this country,\u201d said Jesus Castro, 20, one of Marquez\u2019s children. His income, however, makes it difficult for the family to qualify for insurance for his younger brother.\n\nCastro knows the pain of living without insurance. At 10 years of age, he dislocated an elbow while playing baseball and his parents couldn\u2019t afford to buy a cast for his arm. He received a brace in the emergency room but that was all. \u201cAt the end, my parents took me to a bone healer, a \u201ccurandero,\u201d who twisted my elbow while telling me a tale to keep me distracted,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat was very smart, and I thank him for that.\u201d\n\nNowadays he takes care of his mother whose vision is getting worse. He bought her a pair of glasses as a birthday present. \u201cShe likes to read a lot and I was having a hard time watching her read with some glasses that she found in a cabin,\u201d he said. \u201cI said: that is enough, I\u2019m going to get you some glasses, no matter if they are expensive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "MissionLocal", "description": "En Espa\u00f1ol.For two years, Cristina Marquez, 43, an immigrant from Mexico living in the Mission District, made\u00a0numerous visits to San Francisco General Hospital, but never managed to see a doctor. \u00a0\u201cI suffered too much,\u201d she said of those\u00a0years of inexplicable nosebleeds.
