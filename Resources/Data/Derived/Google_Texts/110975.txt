Oh, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee.

Despite the fact that thousands and potentially millions of Americans have had their plans canceled due to noncompliance with minimum standards of the Affordable Care Act, that's just no big deal to Rep. Lee.

Speaking to National Review Online (emphasis added):

Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, told National Review Online today that instead of sending out cancellation letters, insurance companies should have told their customers that their coverage was about to get better. She said she wrote an amendment before the president’s announcement that would require insurance companies to “tell the truth.” “The cancellation notice was not the truth,” she says. “It should have been: ’We intend to or expect to modify your insurance.’”

Really, Rep. Lee? Really? How else could you possibly describe a letter from an insurance company that blatantly states that their plan will no longer be offered due to Obamacare? It is, in the literal sense of the word, a cancellation letter.

And that's the truth.
