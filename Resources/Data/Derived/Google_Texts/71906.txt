New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio shovels the sidewalk in front of his house in New York on January 3. Mr. de Blasio has 'displayed a talent for marshaling energy around a cause, successfully convincing Albany's leaders to pay for his campaign promise to expand prekindergarten,' writes reporter Michael Howard Saul. 'He has shown less aptitude for managing a complex city government and navigating the city and state's turbulent politics, according to a broad spectrum of political observers and leaders.'
