Two window washers were rescued by firefighters Saturday morning when the basket they were standing in failed, leaving them dangling 100 feet above the ground.

Denver firefighters responded at about 8:30 a.m. to a medical office building near East Iliff Avenue and South Havana Street to find the scaffolding being used by window washers dangling by one side.

Firefighters arrived on the scene just three to four minutes after they were called, and were able to rescue the men in approximately 10 minutes.

Lt. Mike Pylar, acting as a fire department spokesman, said firefighters had to stretch their 105-foot tower ladder almost full length to reach the men who were dangling eight stories up.

No one was injured. Pylar said the workers were wearing their emergency equipment.

“It went pretty smoothly,” Pylar said.
