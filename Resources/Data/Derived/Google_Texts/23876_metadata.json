Deval Patrick is downplaying the disastrous roll-out of the state\u2019s Obamacare website on his watch and blaming the media for sensationalizing its problems \u2014 even as the glitch-filled web portal is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nIn comments made last Friday, a day after the state disclosed that federal officials subpoenaed Health Connector records for as far back as 2010, Patrick told a group of MIT students that people have \u201cgot to be realistic that change is messy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou try things, and people celebrate when you make the announcement, and then it goes sideways and they freak,\u201d Patrick said, according to a post dated today on MIT\u2019s news website. \u201cAnd they\u2019re encouraged to do so by a media which sensationalizes everything.\u201d\n\nHe cited the Health Connector website failures as a \u201ctelling\u201d example.\n\n\u201cThe machine didn\u2019t work. We added hundreds of thousands of people to health care while the machine didn\u2019t work. But the story was \u2018The machine doesn\u2019t work,\u2019\u201d Patrick said. \u201cWell, what was the point? To have a really cool website? Or to sign people up for health care?\u201d\n\nThe Health Connector website\u2019s failures have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. When people couldn\u2019t enroll through the site, state officials were forced to put many on Medicaid as a stopgap measure without being able to determine whether they qualified for subsidized care.\n\nDespite a complete overhaul, \u201chundreds\u201d of problems remain, according to Gov. Charlie Baker, who has remade the Connector\u2019s board, installed a new executive director and slammed the mess he inherited from the Patrick administration.\n\nFederal prosecutors have since begun digging. A bombshell Pioneer Institute report, released Sunday night, claims the Patrick administration \u201cvastly overstated\u201d its progress in building the new website to avoid losing federal funds, hiding gaping holes in the portal to fool the feds.\n\nCiting internal documents and whistleblower accounts from former project officials at UMass Medical School, who came forward in early 2014, Pioneer sent its findings in an October 2014 letter to the head of the FBI and other federal watchdog agencies. One of the whistleblowers told the Herald he already has been questioned by the FBI.\n\nAn MIT spokeswoman directed further questions to a Patrick aide, who do not return an email.\n\nU.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-South Boston) said today on Boston Herald Radio he was especially struck by one whistleblower\u2019s allegations, reported in the Herald, that he was fired after objecting to several time-saving shortcuts proposed by website vendor CGI.\n\nSaid Lynch: \u201cThat is more egregious than willing ignorance, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u00a92015 the Boston Herald.
