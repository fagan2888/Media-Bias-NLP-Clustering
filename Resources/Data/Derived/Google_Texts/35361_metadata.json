Matt Mead speaks during the Wyoming Press Association Winter Convention in Cheyenne Friday afternoon. Mead discussed the 2015 legislative session and fielded questions from journalists during the annual event.\n\nCHEYENNE \u2014 Gov. Matt Mead still doesn\u2019t like the Affordable Care Act and still questions whether it\u2019s financially sustainable. But he says it\u2019s time for Wyoming to use the federal money made available in the act (often called Obamacare or the ACA) to help lower-income residents with their medical bills.\n\nMead\u2019s administration has proposed a plan that would expand Medicaid benefits to thousands of uninsured Wyomingites under the health care law.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to like the (Affordable Care Act); we can agree that it needs to continue to be fixed, if not done away with, but we are in a place now where we\u2019re rejecting $100 million a year that is going to other states, in a place now where we have legitimate needs \u2014 17,000-plus Wyoming citizens, many of whom are hard-working,\u201d Mead said Friday, as he addressed representatives of the state\u2019s newspapers.\n\nCurrently, people qualify for Medicaid only if their income is low and they meet certain conditions (like being pregnant or disabled). The Wyoming Department of Health\u2019s proposed SHARE plan, following Affordable Care Act guidelines, would make Medicaid healthcare help available to anyone making less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level (around $16,100 for an individual; $32,900 for a family of four).\n\nUnder the Department of Health\u2019s proposal, those covered under the plan would have to pay certain deductibles when they receive care, and people making between 101 and 138 percent of the poverty level would have to also pay monthly premiums. The program would end if the federal government backed out of its promises to foot at least 90 percent of the costs.\n\nThe Legislature\u2019s health committee disfavors the SHARE plan; it has recommended an alternative plan that instead would give the covered individuals health savings accounts. The committee\u2019s leaders believe a health saving account would help ensure people have a financial stake in their health care decisions and don\u2019t overuse the system.\n\nMead said he believes the SHARE plan would be cost-neutral and less expensive to the state than the alternatives he\u2019s seen, but that he\u2019s open to suggestions.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t want is for us to go through this and the Legislature will say, \u2018We don\u2019t like the SHARE plan so we have no plan,\u2019\u201d Mead said.\n\nThe governor said the state has been passing on the federal money for four years while working men and woman can\u2019t afford healthcare and state hospitals absorb some $200 million a year in uncompensated care. He said now is the time to move forward.\n\nIn other remarks:\n\n\u2022 The governor said plummeting oil prices should concern everyone across the country, given the jobs the industry directly and indirectly supports. Every $5 drop in oil prices costs Wyoming $35 million, Mead said.\n\nBut he said it\u2019s not the time for Wyoming to be hoarders.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to have a self-fulfilling prophecy here where we put out a closed sign and say, \u2018We don\u2019t have any money and so we\u2019re stopping everything,\u2019\u201d Mead said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t do that and, in my mind, we can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nHe said the state should keep saving, but that it\u2019s also time for the state to have a conversation about its reserves and when it\u2019s time to tap into them. Mead would also like a more transparent fiscal process.\n\nFor example, he said a recent revenue forecast suggests the state has no money to spend, but that doesn\u2019t recognize the record amount of savings socked away in recent years.\n\n\u2022 Mead still opposes legalizing marijuana in Wyoming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be pig-headed on this,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe will watch and we will see (what happens in Colorado), but I don\u2019t think it is the right direction for Wyoming.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s unconvinced that Colorado\u2019s additional tax dollars and \u201cmarijuana tourism\u201d will surpass the impacts to traditional tourism, law enforcement, substance abuse treatment and other areas.\n\nNebraska and Oklahoma have each sued Colorado over its legalization of the drug, saying it has negatively impacted them, but Mead indicated he won\u2019t join that fight.\n\n\u201cMy position, if we could get there, wouldn\u2019t necessarily be to sue the state of Colorado; it would be to sue the federal government and the Department of Justice,\u201d Mead said. Possession and distribution of marijuana remains a federal crime, but the Obama administration has decided not to enforce the laws in states where it\u2019s been legalized.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an appropriate way for the federal government, the Department of Justice, to ignore an entire set of laws, because in effect then you are changing law \u2014 and that should be an act of Congress, not an act of an individual man deciding what he would like to do,\u201d said Mead, a former federal prosecutor.\n\n\u2022 President Obama\u2019s call to provide free community college educations to all citizens isn\u2019t being echoed by Mead. While praising the value of Wyoming\u2019s community colleges and saying it\u2019s important for them to remain inexpensive, the governor believes students should have some \u201cskin in the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cEducation is so important that it is worth some amount of sacrifice,\u201d Mead said.\n\n\u2022 Two terms as governor is enough, and Mead said he plans to return to ranching after completing the second four-year term that he began this month.\n\n\u201cEven if, in the future, we have the best governor ever, I think it\u2019s important to have that turnover,\u201d Mead said.\n\nHe said he supports a current or former governor for president in 2016, listing several potential Republican candidates, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Your news source for what's happening in Park County.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "CJ Baker", "og": {"url": "http://powelltribune.com/news/item/13262-governor-it-s-time-to-expand-medicaid-in-wyoming", "image": "http://powelltribune.com/media/k2/items/cache/1ba3eed65e30b044d8b8d8566a893186_M.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Your news source for what's happening in Park County.", "title": "Governor: It\u2019s time to expand Medicaid in Wyoming"}, "image": "http://powelltribune.com/media/k2/items/cache/1ba3eed65e30b044d8b8d8566a893186_M.jpg", "title": "Governor: It\u2019s time to expand Medicaid in Wyoming", "keywords": "Powell, Powell WY, Park County, Powell News", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfd6\"", "article_summary": "Mead\u2019s administration has proposed a plan that would expand Medicaid benefits to thousands of uninsured Wyomingites under the health care law.\nMatt Mead still doesn\u2019t like the Affordable Care Act and still questions whether it\u2019s financially sustainable.\nCurrently, people qualify for Medicaid only if their income is low and they meet certain conditions (like being pregnant or disabled).\nMatt Mead speaks during the Wyoming Press Association Winter Convention in Cheyenne Friday afternoon.\nThe committee\u2019s leaders believe a health saving account would help ensure people have a financial stake in their health care decisions and don\u2019t overuse the system."}
