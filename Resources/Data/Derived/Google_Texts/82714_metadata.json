Cruz made the recommendation after expressing his outrage with the high court\u2019s ruling on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage. Kopf called the proposal \u201cwacko.\u201d\n\nVIDEO HIGHLIGHTS Kopf explains why he ended his blog. Click here.\n\nSome legal writers felt Kopf violated the U.S. Courts code of ethics for judges and in a follow up article Kopf agreed he \u201ccrossed the line\u201d and violated the section stating \u201ca judge should not . . . publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.\u201d No action has yet been filed. Kopf apologized to Cruz in a subsequent online post while standing by his criticism of the proposal.\n\nIn the interview recorded Friday with NET News, Kopf said Chief Judge Laurie Smith Camp did not ask him to step down nor is he considering resigning.\n\nKopf\u2019s two year old blog, titled \u201cHercules and the Umpire,\u201d became a popular and controversial feature in the legal community, sharing blunt and personal reflections on everything from analysis of U.S. Supreme Court rulings to the toll cancer treatments took on Kopf\u2019s stamina and outlook. (In noting his health was not a reason to discontinue his writing Kopf wrote \u201cI am perfectly healthy. As far as cognition is concerned, I am no more goofy now than I was when I was appointed.\u201d)\n\nFrom the start Kopf said he intended the blog to provide insight into the job of a federal judge and always intended not to shy away from sharing his opinions. \u201cIt was very much an experiment and there was some good parts of that experiment and some not so good parts,\u201d Kopf told NET News. \u201cIt didn\u2019t end the way I wanted it to, but that\u2019s the nature of experiments.\u201d\n\nOn several occasions the judge\u2019s sharp opinions and less than diplomatic language drew national attention and criticism.\n\nAmong posts that riled debate and raised the scorn of some readers:\n\nTelling Congress to \u201cgo to hell\u201d after the Republican majority declared many federal employees, including those in the federal court system to be \u201cnon-essential personnel.\u201d\n\nTelling the U.S. Supreme Court to S.T.F.U. following its ruling that Hobby Lobby stores were persons validly protecting their religious beliefs in denying employees access to birth control insurance benefits.

The chief federal court judge for Nebraska told Kopf one courthouse staff member asked if others felt Kopf\u2019s blog had become an embarrassment to the court. The judge asked for a show of hands. The chief judge reported a great majority said yes.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more important to me than the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska,\u201d Kopf said during his interview with NET. \u201cIf I\u2019ve lost the confidence of the employees because I write the blog, then I think I\u2019m duty-bound to pull the plug.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://netnebraska.org/sites/default/files/styles/largepopup/public/net-article/Kopf-Studio2_WEBt.jpg"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The chief federal court judge for Nebraska told Kopf one courthouse staff member asked if others felt Kopf\u2019s blog had become an embarrassment to the court.\nThe chief judge reported a great majority said yes.\nKopf ended his blog \u201cHercules and the Umpire\u201d after court employees raised concerns during a retreat Thursday.\nIn the interview recorded Friday with NET News, Kopf said Chief Judge Laurie Smith Camp did not ask him to step down nor is he considering resigning.\nAmong posts that riled debate and raised the scorn of some readers:Telling Congress to \u201cgo to hell\u201d after the Republican majority declared many federal employees, including those in the federal court system to be \u201cnon-essential personnel.\u201dTelling the U.S. Supreme Court to S.T.F.U."}
