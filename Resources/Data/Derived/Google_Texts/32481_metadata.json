But without the support of friends and family, how many of us could survive something such as the loss of a spouse, a debilitating physical illness, or the loss of employment? Many of the people living on the streets today were struck by a personal tragedy and lacked a support system to get help when they needed it. But you can help right now. By giving of your time, money, services or skills, you can make the difference in the life of a homeless person. Here's how:\n\n1. Educate yourself. There are myriad reasons why a person becomes homeless \u2014 lack of affordable housing, loss of a job, divorce, illness, substance abuse, domestic abuse, et cetera. One of the first steps you can take toward helping the homeless is trying to understand how they got there in the first place.\n\n2. Show some respect. Don't treat a homeless person as if she were invisible. Say, \"good morning,\" when you pass or strike up a conversation on a park bench. Many people experiencing homelessness say that the loss of dignity that accompanies their situation is harder to bear than the actual loss of physical things.\n\n3. Donate. Clothing is a big one here \u2014 as are shoes and food. Non-perishable items are always in short supply at food pantries and homeless shelters. Other items that might be needed include blankets, coats, books and small kitchen items such as cups and utensils. If you are donating to a homeless shelter or another organization that helps the homeless, consider donating office supplies, electronics, appliances, phone cards or other items that might help those who help the homeless.\n\n4. Volunteer. Sign up to work an evening shift at your local homeless shelter. Answer phones, sort mail, serve food, wash dishes, distribute clothes, babysit kids, clean floors, fix a leaky toilet. Find out what they need and how you can help.\n\n5. Teach. Put your skills to good use by sharing them with the homeless. Organize classes through your local shelter to teach typing, accounting, plumbing, carpentry, child care, nutrition or even a new language. Those skills can help a homeless person find work and maybe even a better life.\n\n6. Reach out. Invite a homeless person to your place of worship or a local community event. Organize an outing to take homeless kids to the movies or an ice skating rink. Offer moral support when you can.\n\n7. Seek out job opportunities. Encourage your church or community center to hire a homeless person to paint, clean, type, answer phones, or any other work that might fit. Many homeless people want to work but can't find regular employment.\n\n8. Get techy. Use your smartphone or other gadget to help the homeless. In San Francisco, download the app HandUp to read the stories of homeless people in your area and donate directly to those in need. In New York, the Help the Homeless app can help you learn how to get involved. And in Atlanta, every post you upload on the Luv4wrd app equals a coat, blanket or pair of gloves to someone living on the streets. Live somewhere else? Use a Google search to find a homeless app to help the people in your community.\n\n9. Advocate. Call your local homeless shelters to find out what items are needed, then contact your local scout troops or civic organizations to organize food drives or other fundraising events to pull those items together. Follow local politics and speak up at town council meetings on issues of homelessness and programs for the homeless. Write editorial letters to your local newspaper about the issue of homelessness in your community and what people can do to help.\n\nRelated on MNN:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Give of your time, money, resources or skills to help make a difference in the life of a homeless person.", "og": {"site_name": "MNN - Mother Nature Network", "description": "Give of your time, money, resources or skills to help make a difference in the life of a homeless person.", "title": "9 ways you can help the homeless", "url": "http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/responsible-living/blogs/9-ways-you-can-help-the-homeless", "image": "http://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2014/12/homeless.jpg.600x315_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.mnn.com", "description": "Give of your time, money, resources or skills to help make a difference in the life of a homeless person.", "title": "9 ways you can help the homeless", "url": "http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/responsible-living/blogs/9-ways-you-can-help-the-homeless", "image": {"src": "http://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2014/12/homeless.jpg.560x0_q80_crop-smart.jpg"}, "site": "mothernaturenet", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "homelessness, end homelessness, how to help the homeless"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda475\"", "article_summary": "In New York, the Help the Homeless app can help you learn how to get involved.\nIf you are donating to a homeless shelter or another organization that helps the homeless, consider donating office supplies, electronics, appliances, phone cards or other items that might help those who help the homeless.\nUse a Google search to find a homeless app to help the people in your community.\nBy giving of your time, money, services or skills, you can make the difference in the life of a homeless person.\nIf you are one of the lucky ones, the world of a homeless person is completely foreign from your own."}
