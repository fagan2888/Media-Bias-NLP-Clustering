Dear Editor: I just wanted to share some helpful information. I recently discovered about a government funded health clinic in Centerville, Texas that serves this area.

It’s been there about 10 years, but it’s not in the phone book and doesn’t advertise, so few people around here even know it exists.

They take regular health insurance, Obamacare policies, and folks who have NO insurance. If you have no insurance at all, they charge on a sliding scale based on your income.

The doctor is there every Monday and a physician’s assistant and nurses are there Monday-Friday.

The main clinic for this district is in Bryan, and they have their own pharmacy there where you can get name-brand very expensive drugs for a fraction of the price.

They are located just off 75 South at 607 W. Lassater in Centerville, and their number is 903-536-3687.

I have been there several times this spring, and have been very impressed with the quality of care, the management of the clinic (very efficient), and the low prices. Rozanne McKinney
