MIAMI (AP) -- A woman needing a lung transplant has died after her family says they tried to have her transferred to Jackson Memorial Hospital and were denied.

The family of 38-year-old Maria Huaman tells the Miami Herald hospital officials denied her transfer first because they believed she was an undocumented immigrant, then because she was uninsured -- and ultimately because she was too ill to move.

Medical records show Huaman had accidentally drank from a cup containing weed killer the day before going to West Kendall Baptist Hospital in mid-December. She was admitted with kidney failure, abdominal pain and other symptoms.

Social workers tried to transfer Huaman to Jackson Memorial so she could receive a lung transplant. Huaman's family says Jackson Health requested a $350,000 deposit for her admittance. She died Wednesday.

Jackson Memorial wouldn't comment, citing patient privacy laws.
