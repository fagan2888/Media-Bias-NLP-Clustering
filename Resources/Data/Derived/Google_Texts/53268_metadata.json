The bane of everyone's existence. On one hand, first semester finals scare us to death because it means that the school year is already half-way over. On the other hand, they also scare us because they're FINALS. (By the way, do not ask me what I'm doing writing this instead of studying for my terrifying AP US History final because I don't know, either.)\n\nIn honor of having survived the first half of the school year (almost) and in honor of first semester exams, I decided to write a little something...\n\nFuriously hoping for an entire week of snow days.\n\nI think I'm going crazy.\n\nReally hoping I don't forget to put my name on my exam.\n\nSo many things to remember.\n\nTake a good night's rest? Yeah, right.\n\nSooooo, does anybody know what any of this means?\n\nEveryone is in a full-blown panic. I feel THE FEELS.\n\nMaybe the teacher will forget about finals?\n\nErr, what do you mean, the semester exam will take up two 90-minute class periods?!\n\nSave me save me save me save me.\n\nTo whoever invented finals: WHY.\n\nEven Eeyore is happier than I am.\n\nRIP the students who took too many finals and died of overdose.\n\nFinal day of finals = brain dead and past caring.\n\nIs it over yet?\n\nNobody thinks they passed.\n\nAnd it's over. We survived. Barely.\n\nLa la la la la I'M FREE!!!!\n\nShoot. Winter break homework. WHY.\n\nThat's basically how most of us feel on finals week, whether it's first semester finals or end-of-the-year finals, right? Right? (I better be right because otherwise this is really bad mojo for finals.) Anyways, I have my fingers crossed for great results and for maybe two hours of sleep per night, and I hope everyone else has a great finals week! (Well, as great as finals week can get.)\n\nFollow Isabel Song on Twitter: www.twitter.com/IsabelSong", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ah, finals. The bane of everyone's existence.
