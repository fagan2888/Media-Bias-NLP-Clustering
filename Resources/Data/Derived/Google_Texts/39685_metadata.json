Under the terms of the hospital exemption, DCVax-L must be manufactured in Germany, but is free to be given to non-German citizens in German hospitals. The hospital exemption clause has an effective period of five years. The approval itself is remarkable because, in just shy of three years, only two other products have received the \"hospital exemption\" and none of the prior two exerted a pharmacological effect within the human body. It also expands the use of DCVax-L to all glioma brain cancers, which is a much wider indication than its current U.S. trials.\n\nIn addition, Northwest Biotherapeutics also notes that the German reimbursement authority has deemed its DCVax-L treatment eligible for reimbursement from Sickness Funds, which is another term for German health insurers. As expected, only hospitals can apply for reimbursement, and Northwest notes that six hospitals have thus far applied for reimbursement eligibility.\n\nNow what: Clearly, this is a big win for Northwest Biotherapeutics, which has a wholly clinical-stage pipeline at present. It's unclear how much revenue this could provide Northwest in the interim, but Northwest's press release mentions that there are roughly 7,000 newly diagnosed cases of gliomas per year in Germany. This exemption could also go a long way to validating its immunotherapy platform, which uses dendritic cells to educate the immune system to attack cancer cells. Immunotherapy platforms are all the rage on Wall Street right now, so this approval couldn't possibly come at a better time.\n\nDespite the news, I would still suggest existing shareholders be cautious. Historically, small-cap biotech companies with cancer-fighting compounds have a very poor track record of drug approval. In addition, if DCVax-L were to be turned away by the FDA, there would be a steep gap all the way back to its next closest product in development, DCVax-Direct, for solid tumor cancers -- DCVax-Direct is currently only in phase 1/2 trials at the moment. In other words, with a valuation north of $300 million, investors' optimism may be more than priced in following today's news.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "14:23", "date": "2014-03-10T18:23:00Z", "description": "Northwest Biotherapeutics shares soar after receiving two special exemptions in Germany.
