The current salary for members of Congress is more than three times the median family income – and that doesn't include another $80K tossed in each year toward a pension.

According to a 2008 Congressional Resource Service report [PDF], members of Congress in 1789 were paid a per diem rate of $6. The first major increase (to $3,000/year) came about 65 years later. By 1925 those salaries had climbed to $10,000 per year – and by 1990, to almost $100,000 annually. Today, according to David Williams of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance (TPA), the base salary for Congress is $174,000 a year.

"The median family income is $55,000 a year," he notes. "So you can see the huge disparity between members of Congress, who get nothing done, and the real working men and women of this country, who get everything done."

Taking into account benefits such as pension, healthcare, and vacation time, Williams says members of Congress make about $286,000 a year.

"You only have to serve a few terms before you get your pension. What happens is on top of the $174,000, $82,000 is put in towards your pension," he explains. "So this is money that taxpayers are paying for – and that's why the $286,000 number is so big, because the pension is a huge chunk of that."

Earlier this year, retiring Congressman Jim Moran (D-Virginia) told CQ Roll Call that members of Congress are underpaid, saying they have to pay for housing in Washington plus their home districts. Moran went on to say that he understands "that it is widely felt they underperform, but the fact is that this is the board of directors for the largest economic entity in the world."

Williams says that's easy for Moran to say, given that he's retiring and doesn't have to worry about the political blowback.
