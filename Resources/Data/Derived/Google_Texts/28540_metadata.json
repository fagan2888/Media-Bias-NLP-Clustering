They often do not know about the risks of childbirth and do not get sufficient pre-natal care.\n\n\"Community outreach and community engagement with pregnant moms is really something that has worked in other places - and we need more of that in Washington DC,\" she said.\n\nSOMALIA WORST COUNTRY FOR MOTHERS\n\nThe United States as a whole performed poorly in Save the Children's annual flagship State of the World's Mothers report, slipping two places to number 33 out of 179 countries surveyed.\n\nNorway came first, from second place in 2014, scoring highly on all five indicators: maternal and child health, children's access to education and women's political and economic status.\n\nThe worst country to be a mother was Somalia, for the second year running. Almost 15 percent of Somali children do not live to see their fifth birthday, the charity said.\n\nThe United States had the highest maternal death rates in the developed world. American women face a 1 in 1,800 risk of maternal death compared to less than 1 in 19,000 in Poland.\n\n\"An American woman is more than 10 times as likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth as a Polish woman,\" Save the Children said in a statement.\n\nThe United States has the highest healthcare costs in the world, according to a 2014 study by The Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based research foundation.\n\nSome 37 percent of Americans skipped a recommended test, treatment or medication in the last year because of its cost, compared to four percent in Britain, it found.\n\nPeople rely on health insurance to recover money spent on healthcare. But 12 percent of Americans do not have health insurance, according to an April poll by Gallup.\n\nHowever there has been some progress since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 to insure more Americans and slow the growth in healthcare spending by giving tax subsidies to help poorer Americans buy private health insurance.\n\nIn the five years since the law was passed, the number of uninsured Americans has fallen by more than 11 million to 37 million from 48.6 million, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.
