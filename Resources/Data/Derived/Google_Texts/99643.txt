When the ObamaCare debate was raging five years ago, advocates insisted that the law would have only a minimal impact on employer-provided health plans.

“A key goal of the bill,” explained ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber, “was to leave those who are happy with their employer-sponsored insurance alone.”

But a survey by Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, Mich., adds further evidence that this promise was completely bogus.

The survey focused on companies in the southwestern region of the state that have 50 or fewer full-time employees. Companies this size don’t face the ObamaCare employer mandate, but were supposed to be helped by the law’s ban on medical underwriting and the competitive small business insurance markets it promised to unleash.

The survey found the opposite. A quarter of firms that that had offered insurance to their employees last year were canceling their health plans this year, and another 25% said they planned to do so next year.

More telling is the fact that 68% of those dropping coverage this year are directing their employees to the Healthcare.gov website to buy coverage on their own.

In other words, these companies are shifting their health insurance costs onto taxpayers. That’s the very outcome ObamaCare architects like Gruber said wouldn’t happen.

Wait, there’s more.

Nearly half of the firms surveyed say they’ve limiting or reducing new hires because of the law — presumably to avoid coming up against the employer mandate should they go over 50 workers. And 28% said they are considering cutting back their overall workforce because of the law.

In his latest State of the Union speech, President Obama, after bragging about the recent economic growth, said he’d make sure “government doesn’t halt the progress we’re making.”

A good place for him to start living up to that promise would be with ObamaCare.
