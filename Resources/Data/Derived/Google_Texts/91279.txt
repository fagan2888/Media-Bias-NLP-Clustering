The Department of Natural Resources has proposed a series of changes to the trout regulations that, given support from the public, Natural Resources Board, Legislature and governor, would take effect in 2016. The Wisconsin inland trout fishing regulations were last changed in 2003.

DNR fisheries manager Scot Stewart will give a summary of proposed changes and answer questions at the Tuesday meeting of Southeast Wisconsin Trout Unlimited, Thunder Bay Grille, N14, W24130 Tower Place, Pewaukee.

Key proposed changes include: start the early catch-and-release trout fishing season Jan. 1 rather than the first Saturday in March; close the regular trout season Oct. 15 rather than Sept. 30; eliminate the five-day closure between the end of the current early catch-and-release season and the opening of the regular season; create a simplified system of three regulation classes (red, green and yellow).

The club's meeting begins with an optional dinner at 6 p.m., with presentations to follow at about 7:15. The meeting is free and open to the public. For more information, visit www.sewtu.org or contact Jim Wierzba at sustain@sewtu.org.

Trout book updated: "Exploring Wisconsin Trout Streams, The Angler's Guide" was updated last year by its quartet of in-state authors, Steven Born, Jeff Mayers, Andy Morton and Bill Sonzogni. The second edition, published by University of Wisconsin Press, has 316 pages of stream profiles, trout fishing tips and conservation history. It is available through multiple sources, including University of Wisconsin Press and Amazon.com.
