We were wrong. It already is terrible!\n\nIf McConnell can fend off Alison Lundergan Grimes in his reelection race tomorrow, and if Republicans win enough seats to take control of the Senate, Majority Leader McConnell is going to face some pressure to perform legislative feats that will not be mathematically possible. There will be pressure to repeal Obamacare. It took conservatives years, climaxing in a government shutdown, to realize that they would not be able to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with control of only one chamber of Congress. How long will it take them to realize that they won\u2019t be able to repeal it with both chambers either, as long as Barack Obama or another Democrat is president?\n\nMcConnell tried to manage these expectations on a recent Fox News appearance, urging conservatives to \u201cremember who\u2019s in the White House for two more years.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt would take 60 votes in the Senate. No one thinks we\u2019re going to have 60 Republicans, and it would take a presidential signature.\u201d\n\nThis prematurely launched the heckling from conservatives that we\u2019ll hear plenty of if and when Republicans take control of the Senate: McConnell doesn\u2019t have the spine to either trigger the \u201cnuclear option\u201d on legislation or work a full Obamacare repeal through the budget reconciliation process, two procedural moves that would allow the GOP Senate to pursue repeal with a 51-vote majority.\n\nAfter receiving its first taste of conservative fury, McConnell\u2019s office told the Washington Examiner that, sure, whatever, maybe he\u2019ll try reconciliation after all.\n\n\u201cLeader McConnell is and has always been committed to the full repeal of Obamacare, and he\u2019ll continue to lead efforts to repeal and replace it with patient-centered reforms that enable greater choice at lower costs. He knows it won\u2019t be easy, but he also believes that if Republicans are fortunate enough to take back the majority we\u2019ll owe it to the American people to try through votes on full repeal, the bill\u2019s most onerous provisions, and reconciliation,\u201d McConnell spokesman Brian McGuire wrote in an emailed statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mitch McConnell won't be able to repeal Obamacare with a Senate majority.
