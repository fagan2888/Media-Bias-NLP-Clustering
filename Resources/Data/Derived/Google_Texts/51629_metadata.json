Wade, Life News\n\nMary Ziegler teaches law at Florida State University, where she holds the Stearns Weaver Miller chair in the College of Law. Her book, \u201cAfter Roe: The Lost History of the Abortion Debate,\u201d traces the evolution of American political dynamics surrounding abortion. In this conversation with Valerie Tarico she discusses how the debate became so polarized, why some abortion foes will not be satisfied until abortion is criminalized, and how advocates for women and healthy families might find common cause with others.\n\nI see abortion as a social good\u2014like the guardrails right before someone\u2019s life goes off a cliff. As a mom of two daughters, I sure want the rails there. But my dream is for my daughters and all young people to become parents when they feel ready so they can fulfill the promise of their lives and form families of their choosing and stack the odds in favor of their kids.\n\nThe intense emotional energy around abortion, both pro and con, makes it really hard to have this broader conversation about chosen lives and flourishing families\u2014about young women and men pursuing their dreams or about healthy, cherished children raised by parents who aren\u2019t stretched to the breaking point. So I desperately want to understand whether there is some way through this impasse.\n\nPeople would be surprised by how much less toxic gender politics were in the 1970s than they are now. Given how much abortion opponents seem to have fixated on the overruling of Roe, I expected the conflict in the decade after the decision to be particularly bitter, but it wasn\u2019t that way. What it means to be \u201cpro-life\u201d or \u201cpro-choice\u201d isn\u2019t as static as it seems. Some people on both sides were doing surprising and productive things back then to make abortion less necessary. Even today, when we talk about how polarized things are, we\u2019re talking about the movement leadership. But there are people on both sides who can\u2019t join either movement because neither fits what they believe. Many of those active in the 1970s would have been shocked at how dysfunctional things have become at this point.\n\nHow did we get to this point\u2014with inflammatory rhetoric inciting violence against abortion providers and a wholesale assault on services that empower women to manage their fertility? We have Congress trying to defund everything Planned Parenthood does except abortion, trying to defund the very services that make abortion less necessary. It\u2019s to the point that I sometimes call Cruz, Huckabee and the others \u201cchampions of unplanned parenthood.\u201d\n\nPeople blame the Roe v. Wade decision, but the broad cultural wars against women weren\u2019t an inevitable result of what the Court decided in 1973. In fact, the polarization took a while to develop, and it had more to do with money and politics than the ideology of people in either movement.\n\nFor much of the 1970s, pro-life groups were trying to get politicians to adopt a platform that opposed abortion, but instead both parties tried to appeal to people on either side of the issue. In the 1970s, it was possible to be a conservative Republican and support abortion access. It was possible to be in support of robust anti-discrimination laws for women but oppose abortion. If you look at Biden or Gephardt, for example, there were lots of ways public figures tried to navigate this politically. Ronald Reagan signed an abortion access measure in California. George Bush was at least nominally pro-choice. But in 1976, the Republicans recognized the potential of abortion to mobilize swing votes. By the 1980s, positions crystalized. What happened was a political party realignment.\n\nWhy a political realignment? How did opposition to abortion get bundled together with opposition to worker rights and opposition to government services and opposition to gun control? They don\u2019t seem to go together very well.\n\nAbortion opponents wanted Roe v. Wade overturned. For a long time, they had fought for a constitutional amendment that would outlaw all abortions, but that obviously hadn\u2019t worked. By the 1980s, it was pretty clear that the only way they were going to get anywhere was to change the Court, which meant they needed to change presidential elections. Marriage of the pro-life movement and Republican Party was not inevitable and has always been troubled, meaning that there are people in the movement who are naturally conservative and people who are not. Some hold their noses when they vote Republican, hoping for judges and laws that they like.\n\nAn \u201cObamacare simulation\u201d at Washington University dropped the abortion rate to 75 percent below the national average by making top-tier contraceptives available free of charge. Why can\u2019t we at least agree on reducing unwanted pregnancy and making abortion less necessary?\n\nWe could have done things to make abortion less necessary. There was a moment in time when that was politically possible. In the 1970s there was a big fight \u2013 should we be for the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the Equal Rights Amendment, or better access to contraception? Some in the pro-life movement made this argument: They were trying to ban abortion, but they recognized that women would still seek it out if they didn\u2019t have alternatives. Politically, they can\u2019t easily make that argument anymore because that would jeopardize the Republicans\u2019 ability to stack the Supreme Court. But some people still feel that way. All Our Lives is one group that supports services and choices, except for abortion.\n\nOK, so instead of Obamacare, let\u2019s just talk about improvements in contraceptive technologies. In Washington state, the annual number of abortions has dropped from around 30,000 to around 18,000 without any increase in restrictions or decrease in access. The primary factor seems to be increased use of IUDs and contraceptive implants \u2014 also, Plan B (aka \u201cthe morning after pill\u201d). And science suggests that all of the long-acting contraceptives and emergency contraceptives operate by preventing conception itself, rather than by booting out an embryo. Why aren\u2019t pro-lifers lobbying loudly on behalf of better birth control?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Polarization around abortion took a while to develop, and it had more to do with money & politics than ideology", "title": "After Roe: It\u2019s hard to believe now, but the abortion debate wasn\u2019t always so toxic.
