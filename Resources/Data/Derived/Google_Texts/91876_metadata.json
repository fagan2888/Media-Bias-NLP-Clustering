But similar measures have been struck down in other states.\n\n\n\nA bill filed by Republican Senator Kelli Stargel of Lakeland mandates hospital admitting privileges for abortion providers. Stargel wants these doctors to have relationships with local hospitals, allowing them to bring in patients for care. Stargel says the bill is about women\u2019s health and safety.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not affecting the woman\u2019s right to choose, what I\u2019m trying to do is making sure that when she\u2019s made that choice, it\u2019s a safe choice,\u201d she said.\n\nBut similar laws were ruled unconstitutional, and struck down in Wisconsin, Mississippi and Alabama. The Supreme Court is scheduled to take up the Texas admitting privilege law later this year. The questionable constitutionality aside, opponents call the measure medically unnecessary and aimed at shutting down abortion clinics. And Senate Minority Leader Arthenia Joyner of Orlando agrees with them.\n\n\u201cThis body would never, ever pass anything that would restrict a man\u2019s right to do what he wants to do with his body. And it\u2019s time for us to consider that as women, the majority of the voters in this country and this state, that we should have that right to decide what\u2019s best for us,\u201d she said.\n\nResearch suggests that abortions are already safe. A recent study published in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, found that abortion is safer than childbirth. Women are 14 times more likely to die giving birth, than to die from an abortion. Public health experts are challenging the argument for admitting privileges. According to the American Public Health Association, these laws make it especially difficult for low income patients to get abortions. Senator Eleanor Sobel of Hollywood says the bill is a stumbling block for healthcare providers.\n\n\u201cSo the witch hunt has to stop against Planned Parenthood. Currently there is no state funding for abortion in the state of Florida and I\u2019m afraid that the reaction to what we\u2019re experiencing today hurts prevention,\u201d she said.\n\nThe bill would also ban public funding for abortion clinics. But Planned Parenthood and others don\u2019t only provide abortions, they provide contraception, pap smears and STD tests. Opponents worry the provision will restrict access to preventative healthcare for low income Floridians. Senator Oscar Braynon of Miami Gardens says defunding healthcare providers isn\u2019t a fix.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s almost as if we\u2019re simply saying we don\u2019t want low income women to have a place to go to receive these services if we continue to take options off of the table. And I just can\u2019t in good conscience do that. I just can\u2019t!\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate Health Policy Subcommittee heard emotional testimony from both sides of the issue Tuesday. Gabriel Garcia-Vera represents the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Rights.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable. And as someone who is both a birth advocate, and someone who has supported women through the difficult decision of abortion, we as a community stand con nuestra gente, nuestra communidad y nuestras familias. With our people, our communities and our families in standing in opposition to this bill,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn Stemberger represents the Florida Family Policy Council.\n\n\u201cThe Clinton admin developed a phrase that came to characterize what it meant to be pro-choice or pro-abortion rights. And that phrase was, we want to see abortion to be safe, rare, and legal. If that is still the definition of what it means to be pro-choice or pro-abortion rights, then you can still affirm this bill,\u201d he said.\n\nStargel says abortion regulation shouldn\u2019t be taboo.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m tired of the double standard, when you\u2019re talking about abortion we can\u2019t have a conversation, we\u2019re talking about the other things we can. I want to make sure we\u2019re on the same page and that we as policymakers are adequately regulating abortions the same way that we\u2019re regulating similar-situated facilities,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Senate Health Policy Subcommittee voted Tuesday to continue that conversation. Stargel\u2019s bill passed 5 to 3.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The Florida Legislature is moving forward with a bill that could restrict abortion access.
