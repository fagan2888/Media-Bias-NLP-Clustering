In striking down the net neutrality rules, the court said the FCC has some authority to regulate Internet providers but could not justify its net neutrality rules.\n\n\u201cI think that 706 has been abused\u201d and \u201cshould be returned to its original intent,\u201d O\u2019Rielly said Monday.\n\nThe FCC\u2019s authority over Internet providers was \u201cintended by Congress to be rather narrow,\u201d he said, citing his time as a Hill staffer during the 1996 Communications Act rewrite that led to the Telecommunications Act.\n\nO\u2019Rielly also commented on the FCC\u2019s role in the ongoing national debate over government surveillance, including the controversial National Security Agency program that collects information about virtually all American phone calls.\n\nAs the regulator of the communications companies, some have called on the FCC to keep phone companies from selling customer data to third parties, including government agencies.\n\nO\u2019Rielly said the FCC will likely weigh in on the issue and stands ready to coordinate with other agencies, but he is \u201cnot sure this is something the Commission should spend a considerable amount of time on going forward.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The recent federal court ruling overturning the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules will not radically change the
