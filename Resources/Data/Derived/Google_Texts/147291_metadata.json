On Thursday, the House Democrat Leader invoked pro-life Pope Francis in the name of her pro-abortion agenda:\n\nRepublicans are moving forward with a GOP reconciliation package that once again lays the groundwork for another Republican government shutdown. It\u2019s a waste of time. It will go nowhere in the Senate. It will be their 61st vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and they will of course be wanting to defund Planned Parenthood, destroy the Affordable Care Act, dismantle newfound health security for millions of Americans. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Instead we could be working together recognizing a Republican Congress, a Democratic president, the ability for Democrats to use their leverage legislatively to have compromise for the good of the American people. That\u2019s what Pope Francis told us to do. He said leaders should have transparency. That would be wonderful \u2013 openness, he said. He used the word openness and pragmatism, and he said we have to move forward for the good of the people. Let\u2019s in the spirit of Francis do that.\n\nYes, Pelosi has devolved to arguing that the Pope wants politicians to accept a budget that gives millions of dollars to the abortion industry. Let that sink in a minute.\n\nStill with me? Good. Naturally, Pope Francis said no such thing in the speech to which Pelosi refers. He made general statements about \u201cgood political leaders [\u2026] with the interests of all in mind, seiz[ing] the moment in a spirit of openness and pragmatism,\u201d and \u201ccooperating generously for the common good\u201d\u2014generic statements of responsible governance that can\u2019t possibly be construed as prescribing what the federal budget should and shouldn\u2019t include. I could just as easily say cooperation and pragmatism compel Barack Obama to sign a budget that doesn\u2019t fund Planned Parenthood.\n\nOf course, the even more basic problem here is that it\u2019s inconceivable that Francis would urge promotion of something his religion clearly marks as a grave evil. It\u2019s hard to claim your invocation of a religious leader should be binding when you\u2019re so selective about which of his and the religion\u2019s dictates you honor.\n\nAs we discussed a few weeks ago, Pelosi\u2019s public remarks on abortion are so cartoonishly vapid because she\u2019s never faced enough of a challenge to force her to put actual thought into it, and this is easily the most over-the-top example yet. Unfortunately, there are two reasons why she gets away with it.\n\nFirst, because Republicans let her. Pelosi\u2019s been in Congress for almost thirty years, and you mean to tell me none of her colleagues on the other side of the aisle ever gave her a real confrontation in that time, along the lines of Rick Santorum challenging Barbara Boxer on the Senate floor in 1999?\n\nThat exchange is dear to many a pro-lifer\u2019s heart, but in a better political world it actually wouldn\u2019t stand out \u2014 not because it wasn\u2019t fantastic, but because every lawmaker who got into office claiming to be pro-life would do the same every day. That something, which should be the norm, is considered so exceptional ought to be a wakeup call.\n\nSecond, we have to revisit Pope Francis\u2019 relative silence on abortion during his U.S. visit. The generic nature of much of his comments, lack of discussion of the preborn, and his willingness to get specific on lesser political issues combined to form a blank slate onto which non-Catholics and cafeteria Catholics felt free to project their own notions of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ccompassionate.\u201d\n\nEven factoring in her hubris, it is inconceivable that Pelosi would have pulled this if the Pope had made the murder of preborn children an issue during the trip. Had he stood up before Congress and lectured them about abortion at least as passionately and strongly as he did on, say, climate change, she would have known that any mention of the Pope would remind people that he intensely disapproved of her actions, too.\n\nThe more outrageous an abortion advocate\u2019s public statements are, the longer a leash the opposition has him or her on. What pro-lifers need now is not to tut-tut at Pelosi and move on, but to have a serious talk about what more our political and religious leaders should be doing on holding them accountable for it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even factoring in her hubris, it is inconceivable that Pelosi would have mentioned the Pope if he had made abortion an issue during his U.S. visit.", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "Even factoring in her hubris, it is inconceivable that Pelosi would have mentioned the Pope if he had made abortion an issue during his U.S. visit.", "title": "Pelosi drafts Pope Francis into Planned Parenthood funding push", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 672, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Nancy-Pelosi-672x372.jpg", "height": 372}, "updated_time": "2015-10-29T03:27:36-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/pelosi-drafts-pope-francis-planned-parenthood-funding-push/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even factoring in her hubris, it is inconceivable that Pelosi would have mentioned the Pope if he had made abortion an issue during his U.S. visit.", "creator": "@liveactionnews", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Nancy-Pelosi-672x372.jpg", "title": "Pelosi drafts Pope Francis into Planned Parenthood funding push", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "religion", "published_time": "2015-10-28T22:22:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-29T03:27:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Naturally, Pope Francis said no such thing in the speech to which Pelosi refers.\nThat\u2019s what Pope Francis told us to do.\nSecond, we have to revisit Pope Francis\u2019 relative silence on abortion during his U.S. visit.\nOn Thursday, the House Democrat Leader invoked pro-life Pope Francis in the name of her pro-abortion agenda:Republicans are moving forward with a GOP reconciliation package that once again lays the groundwork for another Republican government shutdown.\nI could just as easily say cooperation and pragmatism compel Barack Obama to sign a budget that doesn\u2019t fund Planned Parenthood."}
