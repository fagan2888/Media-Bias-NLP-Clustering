(Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nSen. Ted Cruz recently headed to a shooting range in Johnston to announce the formation of a \u201cSecond Amendment Coalition\u201d made up of his campaign supporters. The Republican presidential candidate deserves a jab for the timing of the announcement, which was within days of two high-profile shootings in Colorado and California. (In June, he demonstrated his lack of tact by holding a \u201cCelebrate the Second Amendment\u201d gathering three days after nine churchgoers in South Carolina were killed by a gunman). Cruz earns a thistle, however, for his lack of originality. Perhaps he doesn\u2019t realize a coalition of Second Amendment enthusiasts already exists. It\u2019s called the National Rifle Association. A one-year membership is $25 and right now comes with a free \u201cheavy duty\u201d camouflage duffel bag that appears roomy enough to hold a lot of hot air.\n\nArose to the Wellmark Foundationfor giving back to Iowa communities by funding efforts to improve the health of residents. Its first year of \u201ccommunity kickstarter\u201d grants provides nearly $300,000 to 32 projects, including a playground in West Point, a park renovation in Leon, and an ice rink in Prairie City. The foundation, affiliated with Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa, is also providing $75,000 in grants for six \u201ccomplete streets\u201d projects in central Iowa. Working with the Des Moines Area Metropolitan Planning Organization, residents will find it easier to use city streets with the addition of bike racks, trail connections, bike lanes and an expanded bicycle-share program.\n\nA rose to Cyclones fans for remembering their team's opponents are real people. As the men's basketball team took on Buffalo on Monday night, Crystal Oats, wife of first-year head coach Nate Oats, was back home in New York fighting double-hit lymphoma, a rare and difficult to treat form of cancer. An ESPN article last month reported the family's insurance didn't cover Crystal's alternative therapy. Insurance also doesn't cover the full-time nanny the family hired to help Crystal care for their three children. Cyclone fans made sure Oats walked away from Ames with something. An online fundraiser started by Cyclone Fanatic publisher Chris Williams has raised more than $12,500 to help the family.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1QFvoyl", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Health insurer promotes healthier living", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Health insurer promotes healthier living", "title": "Roses and Thistles: Cruz has arsenal of bad ideas", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/12/13/roses-and-thistles-cruz-has-arsenal-bad-ideas/76985412/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health insurer promotes healthier living", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d6738a8f7ac9f2cd9f8633fb8cac277e73d36101/c=1238-308-3993-3063&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/20/IAGroup/DesMoines/635704110529309948-0621-Ted-Cruz-Johnston-10.jpg", "title": "Roses and Thistles: Cruz has arsenal of bad ideas", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/Ted Cruz 2016 Presidential Campaign", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Events/Ted Cruz 2016 Presidential Campaign", "title": "Roses and Thistles: Cruz has arsenal of bad ideas", "author": "The Register's Editorial", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b20a879d83b22ae98070fc1fec2235b8770e8a2/c=1497-0-4023-3368/local/-/media/2015/06/20/IAGroup/DesMoines/635704110529309948-0621-Ted-Cruz-Johnston-10.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a268684174b31ba79ffc3363bf4b4a57d68f7e4a/c=1238-308-3993-3063/local/-/media/2015/06/20/IAGroup/DesMoines/635704110529309948-0621-Ted-Cruz-Johnston-10.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67f2ebc3c496dc3077a64bea6e4444376f16da6a/c=434-119-4607-3257/local/-/media/2015/06/20/IAGroup/DesMoines/635704110529309948-0621-Ted-Cruz-Johnston-10.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9eafdc9febb2425e73bef0b9f2ffeb441a8890f6/c=451-416-4611-2766&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/06/20/IAGroup/DesMoines/635704110529309948-0621-Ted-Cruz-Johnston-10.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-13T19:06:10.853000-06:00", "shorthed": "Thistle: Cruz has arsenal of bad ideas", "articleid": 76985412, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/af1179d4f151a5c36e1efc05432fc8fc175c0964/c=451-416-4611-2766/local/-/media/2015/06/20/IAGroup/DesMoines/635704110529309948-0621-Ted-Cruz-Johnston-10.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed392f39dcb0a24d6ed969f772f7593698ad96e0/c=1401-0-3287-3368/local/-/media/2015/06/20/IAGroup/DesMoines/635704110529309948-0621-Ted-Cruz-Johnston-10.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)Buy PhotoSen.
