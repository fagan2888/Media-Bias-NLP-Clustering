VERLOT, Wash. (AP) â€” A hiker injured in a deadly ice cave collapse has been released from a Seattle hospital, while the conditions of two others have been upgraded.

One person died and remains buried in the debris after a partial collapse Monday at the Big Four Ice Caves, a popular hiking destination about 70 miles northeast of Seattle.

Harborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg said Tuesday morning that a 35-year-old woman who was injured in the collapse was treated and released late Monday.

Gregg says a 25-year-old man in intensive care has been upgraded from critical to serious condition. A 35-year-old man is no longer in intensive care, and his condition is satisfactory.

Authorities have posted warnings about the danger at the caves because of warm weather.
