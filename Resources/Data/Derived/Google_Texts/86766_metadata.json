The drugs no longer stopped her daughter\u2019s epileptic seizures and the little girl had become so numb to pain, she would tear off her own fingernails and leave her small fingers bleeding.\n\nBobadilla was driving on a mountain road with Javiera, intent on ending it all by steering their car off a cliff.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted to do was to die along with her,\u201d the 34-year-old mother recalled of that day in April 2013. \u201cI told her: \u2018This is it.\u2019 But then she said, \u2018Mommy, I love you.\u2019 I looked at her and I knew I had to continue fighting.\u201d\n\nBobadilla\u2019s desperation to ease her daughter\u2019s condition is an emotion familiar to other Chilean parents who say medical marijuana can help their children and who, rather than wait for Congress to act, have taken matters into their own hands.\n\nDespite the risk of jail time, about 100 parents have formed a group, Mama Cultiva or \u201cMama Grows,\u201d to share knowledge about cultivating marijuana to extract cannabis oil for their seizure-stricken children.\n\nIn clandestine meetings, the parents exchange tips and listen to cultivation experts explain how to grow and reproduce plants. Bobadilla and most of the members grow marijuana in their backyards, even though they could face up to 15 years in jail for doing so.\n\nChile allows consumption of the drug, but growing, selling or transporting it is illegal. Approval to use the drug as medicine is hard to win, and requires navigating a bureaucratic puzzle that most see as a waste of time. A proposal to decriminalize such use is making slow progress before lawmakers.\n\nDuring a recent meeting of Mama Cultiva, a mother named Susana patiently separated leaves from a marijuana stem in preparation to extract oil while, nearby, her husband tended to their son who screamed as he convulsed in a seizure.\n\nSusana, who declined to give her last name for fear of being prosecuted, and other parents later practiced the steps needed to reproduce plants with cuttings \u2014 a lesson that left them smiling with satisfaction.\n\nGrowing plants is slow work and members complain they sometimes must resort to buying from illegal dealers. Susana said one dealer even tricked her into buying the male strand of the plant, which does not produce the prized oil.\n\n\u201cI explained to him that it was for my sick son, that I needed marijuana from the female plant, but he sold me the male one,\u201d she said.\n\nGabriela Reyes, 23, credits the cannabis oil with saving her 7-month-old son. Lucas spent the first months of his life in a hospital, suffering up to 300 epileptic seizures a day, she said. When he no longer responded to anticonvulsion medication, doctors told her his condition was terminal.\n\nReyes learned about cannabis oil as an option and began adding a couple of drops to Lucas\u2019 baby bottle. Since then, she said, the seizures have dropped to about a dozen a day and the infant now is able to eat normally and recently tasted his first mashed potatoes.\n\nIn the case of Bobadilla\u2019s now 7-year-old daughter, giving her a few drops of the oil each day has made their lives bearable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chilean moms growing support for medical marijuana", "title": "Chilean moms growing support for medical marijuana", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Chilean moms growing support for medical marijuana", "title": "Chilean moms growing support for medical marijuana", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/24/chilean_moms_growing_support_for_medical_marijuana/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/chile-marijuana-moms.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chilean moms growing support for medical marijuana", "title": "Chilean moms growing support for medical marijuana", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/chile-marijuana-moms.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eva Vergara", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Reyes learned about cannabis oil as an option and began adding a couple of drops to Lucas\u2019 baby bottle.\nGabriela Reyes, 23, credits the cannabis oil with saving her 7-month-old son.\nIn the case of Bobadilla\u2019s now 7-year-old daughter, giving her a few drops of the oil each day has made their lives bearable.\nLucas spent the first months of his life in a hospital, suffering up to 300 epileptic seizures a day, she said.\nDespite the risk of jail time, about 100 parents have formed a group, Mama Cultiva or \u201cMama Grows,\u201d to share knowledge about cultivating marijuana to extract cannabis oil for their seizure-stricken children."}
