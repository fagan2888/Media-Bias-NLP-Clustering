After losing four of her limbs due to severe bacterial meningitis, Crespo was convinced modeling without arms or legs was not even remotely possibly. Thanks to the help of fashion designer Carrie Hammer, Crespo became the first ever quadruple amputee to appear on the runway at New York Fashion Week 2014 last Friday.\n\n\u201cI had so much fun,\u201d Crespo told ABC News. \u201cI\u2019m happy that it\u2019s over, and I\u2019m pooped. But I\u2019m ready to see the next step. I saw Danielle Sheypuk last year in the wheelchair and I was like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I have to email Carrie Hammer and let her know how I feel. I thought, \u2018This is amazing how someone would break the boundaries and let someone in a wheelchair be in New York Fashion Week.\u2019\u201d\n\nCrespo\u2019s dream of modeling felt even more out of reach after her $100,000 prosthetic limbs were stolen off of her porch upon being delivered to her house back in November 2013. Thankfully, Hammer stepped in with the help of Hanger Inc., to provide her model with a brand new set of prosthetic limbs. Hammer\u2019s \u201cRole Models Not Runway Model\u201d fashion campaign has been built around empowering stories like Crespo and Sheypuk to show that beauty doesn\u2019t stop at the \u201cideal\u201d model walking down the runway.\n\n\u201cShe sent me the most lovely, touching and down-to-earth email that made me sob,\u201d Hammer explained. \u201cIt was just the most incredible email. I wrote her back immediately and said, \u2018Oh my God, I would love to chat with you and would love to have you walk in our next show.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "new, york, fashion, week, 2014, quadruple, amputee", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Quadruple amputee Karen Crespo became the highlight of New York Fashion Week 2014 with the help of designer Carrie Hammer.", "title": "Quadruple Amputee Model Shines At NY Fashion Week [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-york-fashion-week-2014-watch-quadruple-amputee-model-karen-crespo-steal-show-301828", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/08/karen-crespo.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Quadruple amputee Karen Crespo became the highlight of New York Fashion Week 2014 with the help of designer Carrie Hammer.", "title": "Quadruple Amputee Model Shines At NY Fashion Week [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-york-fashion-week-2014-watch-quadruple-amputee-model-karen-crespo-steal-show-301828", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/08/karen-crespo.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/08/karen-crespo.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-08T12:20:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-08T12:37:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Quadruple amputee Karen Crespo became the highlight of New York Fashion Week 2014 with the help of designer Carrie Hammer."}, "article_summary": "Thanks to the help of fashion designer Carrie Hammer, Crespo became the first ever quadruple amputee to appear on the runway at New York Fashion Week 2014 last Friday.\nHammer\u2019s \u201cRole Models Not Runway Model\u201d fashion campaign has been built around empowering stories like Crespo and Sheypuk to show that beauty doesn\u2019t stop at the \u201cideal\u201d model walking down the runway.\nImmediately after watching wheelchair-bound Dr. Danielle Sheypuk make her way down the runway this past February, 31-year-old Karen Crespo felt a wave of inspiration.\nAfter losing four of her limbs due to severe bacterial meningitis, Crespo was convinced modeling without arms or legs was not even remotely possibly.\nThankfully, Hammer stepped in with the help of Hanger Inc., to provide her model with a brand new set of prosthetic limbs."}
