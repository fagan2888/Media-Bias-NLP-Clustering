Ms. Baldwin has often been critical of the department.\n\nMs. Baldwin has been working behind the scenes to strengthen the community\u2019s response to sexual assaults, an effort that gained significant momentum, she said, after an article in The New York Times examined the Winston case and other sexual assaults on Florida State students.\n\nThe Times article, published in April amid rising national concern about sexual assaults on college campuses, found that the police had conducted virtually no investigation of the rape allegation against Mr. Winston, leading in part to the prosecutor\u2019s decision not to file criminal charges against him. Florida State knew about the allegation as well but waited nearly a year to ask Mr. Winston about it, and only then after he had led the university\u2019s football team to the national championship.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Winston, who has never been questioned by the police, said he had consensual sex with his accuser and did not assault her. The university has declined to discuss any aspect of the Winston case, citing privacy laws.\n\nChief DeLeo said in an interview that his department was working on its sexual assault complaint policy with the advocacy group End Violence Against Women International. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at our procedures, how we document things, to make them better,\u201d he said.\n\nThe chief did not offer a timetable as to when recommendations might be carried out. \u201cWe completely review them until we\u2019re all comfortable with it,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a community forum organized by Ms. Baldwin on Wednesday, major players in the local criminal justice system, including Chief DeLeo; William N. Meggs, the state attorney who investigated the Winston case; and Florida State\u2019s police chief, David Perry, heard experts on sex crime investigations emphasize the importance of prosecuting sexual assaults based on the evidence, not the likelihood of conviction.\n\nMs. Baldwin said that among those women in the area who had reported assaults to local law enforcement, most became discouraged with the process. Only 20 percent of sexual assaults reported to the prosecutor\u2019s office resulted in arrests, charges and trial or plea, she said.\n\nMs. Baldwin said Tallahassee was not the first community to push for systemic change in sex crime investigations. She cited cities such as Baltimore, New Orleans, Philadelphia and Washington as having \u201calready gone to the drawing board\u201d to encourage overhauls, transparency and accountability in their handling of sexual assault complaints.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140612214302, "twitter": {"description": "The police department in Tallahassee, Fla., which handled a rape
