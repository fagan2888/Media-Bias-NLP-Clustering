CVS Caremark (NYSE:CVS) reported a mixed Q1, although the fundamentals may have been stronger than the headlines indicated. After all, adjusted EPS grew by 22.5% to $1.02, while revenue increased 6.3% to $32.7 billion.

And while the Pharmacy Services Segment (the PBM portion of the business) led the charge with a 10.3% bump in revenue, retail pharmacy revenue still increased by 2.7%, driven by a same store sales increase of 1.4%. And MinuteClinic revenue climbed 11%. This all happened despite some pretty nasty winter weather which affected foot traffic across the retail space.

The company maintained its guidance, for 5.3% to 6.5% revenue growth and 10% to 14% growth in adjusted EPS, which highlights the company's continued growth prospects.
