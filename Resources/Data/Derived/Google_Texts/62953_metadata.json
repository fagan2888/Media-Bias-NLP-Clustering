He claims that under new federal nondiscrimination rules, the program is obligated to give him a hysterectomy.\n\nPennsylvania is one of several states that excludes coverage for transition-related transgender care, but proposed new federal rules for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which have not yet been implemented, would ban such exclusions. New York and Oregon ended such exclusions in 2014.\n\nAccording to lawyer Julie Chovanes, a transgender woman who represents Doe and run the Trans Resource Foundation, Obamacare says that the state must provide the coverage. \u201cIt can\u2019t be discriminatorily not provided when medically necessary and prescribed by a doctor,\u201d she said. (The man\u2019s doctors have deemed the procedure medically necessary.)\n\nThe man\u2019s case has a precedent. Last March, a Minnesota trans man won a key victory when a federal court ruled that health providers and hospitals who take federal Medicare or Medicaid funds are subject to the ACA\u2019s ban on discrimination based on sex, which extends to transgender people.\n\nThe Advocate picked up the story from the conservative Washington Times, which denied the plaintiff\u2019s gender identity in its first sentence: \u201cA woman from Pennsylvania who now identifies as a transgender man wants to have his uterus surgically removed\u2026\u201d\n\nAccording to The Advocate: \u201cIf the Pennsylvania lawsuit is successful, it could help prompt a change in the ACA\u2019s interpretation that may allow for greater coverage of gender-affirming surgery\u2026 Such an inclusive interpretation would also allow transgender patients to access to broader mental health and transition-related health care\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Story Filed Under", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Healthcare, Medicaid, Pennsylvania, Transgender", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "LGBTQ Nation", "description": "And new federal rules would seem to support his cause", "title": "This Pennsylvania trans man is taking on Medicaid to get a hysterectomy", "url": "http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/03/this-pennsylvania-trans-man-is-taking-on-medicaid-to-get-a-hysterectomy/", "image": {"width": 610, "identifier": "http://static.lgbtqnation.com/assets/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-12.24.19-PM.png", "height": 393}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://static.lgbtqnation.com/assets/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-12.24.19-PM.png?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 162245191716, "app_id": 139331137822}, "viewport": "width=940", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-09T22:00:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-09T21:43:51+00:00"}, "bitly-verification": "d05cd30d47d0"}, "article_summary": "He claims that under new federal nondiscrimination rules, the program is obligated to give him a hysterectomy.\nAccording to lawyer Julie Chovanes, a transgender woman who represents Doe and run the Trans Resource Foundation, Obamacare says that the state must provide the coverage.\nA 30-year-old transgender male schoolteacher going simply by \u201cJohn Doe\u201d is suing Pennsylvania\u2018s Medicaid system, reports The Advocate.\nPennsylvania is one of several states that excludes coverage for transition-related transgender care, but proposed new federal rules for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which have not yet been implemented, would ban such exclusions.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be discriminatorily not provided when medically necessary and prescribed by a doctor,\u201d she said."}
