Jim Condon told Vermont Watchdog it\u2019s time for Gov. Peter Shumlin to shelve the ambitious plan immediately.\n\n\u201cThe deadlines for proposing financing have been missed two years in a row now, so to me that\u2019s very disappointing. It\u2019s becoming clearer and clearer that there is no financing plan,\u201d Condon told Vermont Watchdog.\n\nAs Vermont Watchdog reported, an independent report by the Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm Avalere Health concluded that the costs of Green Mountain Care would require Vermont to raise tax revenue roughly equal to the state\u2019s tax collections from all sources today.\n\nCondon, a Democrat from Colchester, said he thinks a single-payer system in Vermont would \u201ccost more\u201d than a couple of previous estimates. Those estimates pegged the cost for single-payer at anywhere from $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion annually.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a government program [so] I think it\u2019s going to cost more than that. Given that, I think it would be in the best interest of Vermonters to redirect our energies away from single-payer health care to trying to improve the system we\u2019re in now,\u201d Condon added.\n\nCondon was one of three \u201cBlue Dog Democrats\u201d to vote against Act 48, the legislation establishing the transition to a single-payer health care system. According to Act 48, Green Mountain Care cannot have any negative implications for Vermont\u2019s economy. But Condon said he\u2019s not aware of any other way to pay for it outside of federal funding or raising taxes. And for that reason, Condon said he\u2019s urging Gov. Shumlin not to seek a waiver from Obamacare, which the state must obtain from the federal government in order for single-payer to be implemented.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be able to ask for [the Obamacare waiver] until the economic analysis is done, and we cannot do an economic analysis until we have a financing plan. So, right now I suppose it\u2019s in limbo,\u201d he said.\n\nIn that limbo, both the administration and lawmakers continue to allocate state resources in hopes the state will still be able to provide health care to of all its residents by Jan. 2017, something Condon said is a \u201cwaste of resources at this point. Just to submit an application for a waiver from the Affordable Care Act is probably going to take half a year to determine, in and of itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are people working on it [who] could be doing other things,\u201d he added.\n\nHow many people are working on Green Mountain Care is unclear. Lt. Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, said during an interview with Vermont Watchdog last week that he\u2019s not even sure who exactly is working on the implementation of single-payer.\n\n\u201cI know we have a lot of people who are working on the exchange. I know we have the Green Mountain Care Board that is working on cost controls. But I\u2019m still not sure who is working on the single-payer initiative,\u201d Scott said.\n\nSen. Bobby Starr, another Democrat who voted against Act 48, told Vermont Watchdog in January there\u2019s \u201cno way\u201d single-payer can work without new taxes. Indeed, no lawmaker has introduced any bill that would finance single-payer health care without also raising taxes.\n\nOne bill, introduced by Sen. Peter Galbraith (D-Windham), would impose a 13-percent payroll tax (11 percent on employers and 2-percent on employees) as well as a 10-percent tax on non-wage income. A second bill, also introduced by Galbraith, would phase in single-payer financing beginning in 2015 with a \u201ctransitional fund.\u201d Galbraith\u2019s second proposal would levy a 1.5-percent self employment tax increase in addition to reserving 7.7 percent of state income taxes for single-payer.\n\nContact Jon Street at jstreet@watchdog.org and find him on Twitter @JonStreet.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "BURLINGTON, Vt. \u2013 End single payer.
