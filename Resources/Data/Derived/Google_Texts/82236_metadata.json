More and more, though, these lobbyists are working for groups financed by unfamiliar donors. In fact, their identity is secret.\n\nSuch groups are nonprofits officially known as 501C4s, a designation that refers to a provision of the IRS\u2019 tax code. Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2010 known as \u201cCitizens United,\u201d these organizations can get involved in politics in favor or opposition of candidates, just like political action committees.\n\nBut 501C4s don\u2019t have to report their donors or file detailed reports on their spending, as PACs must do. Even so, some nonpartisan groups that track campaign money estimate that 501C4s have doubled their political spending since the Citizens United ruling.\n\nThe one caveat in protecting their nonprofit status is that 501C4s must spend at least 51 percent of their money on issues or other \u201csocial welfare\u2019\u2019 matters-- not campaigns. But documenting that spending can be difficult.\n\nIn any case, that national explosion in the creation of 501C4s is spreading to Missouri.\n\nNew 501C4 opposes Medicaid expansion\n\nAmong the state\u2019s newest 501C4s is the Missouri Century Foundation, a fiscally conservative group that was founded by several of the state\u2019s best-known Republican consultants.\n\nThe chairman is Gregg Keller, a St. Louis native who previously was executive director of the D.C.-based American Conservative Union. Keller had worked for Mitt Romney during his first 2008 presidential campaign and has served for several Missouri politicians, most notably former U.S. Sen. Jim Talent, R-Mo.\n\nTalent's former spokesman Rich Chrismer is the foundation\u2019s communications director. Other key posts are held by Jim Gwinner, Mike Hafner and Holly Gogel \u2013 all respected conservatives with strong credentials.\n\nThe Missouri Century Foundation\u2019s key mission over the next several months will be to lobby against any expansion of Medicaid in Missouri and to promote restrictions on the political activities of public-employee unions.\n\n\u201cOur No. 1 issue, with a bullet, is to stop Medicaid expansion and Obamacare,\u201d Keller said. He explained that conservatives were concerned that some Republican legislators in the Missouri General Assembly last session appeared more receptive to Medicaid expansion.\n\nKeller didn\u2019t mention that one reason for that concern may be the pro-Medicaid lobbying by certain business groups, such as the Missouri Chamber. The chamber has hired former U.S. Sen. Christopher \u201cKit\u201d Bond, R-Mo., who\u2019s also a former two-term governor, to help make the pro-expansion case.\n\nIn any case, the foundation plans to issue \"white papers'' and lobby legislators to make its case. There are no plans to run TV or radio ads, Keller said.\n\nSeek to keep donors\u2019 identities a secret\n\nAnother key concern for the foundation is preserving the anonymity of its donors, who hail from inside and outside the state. That means it opposes any state legislation that would require 501C4s to identify their donors.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very central to what we\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d Keller said. \u201cWe\u2019re partnering with the American Center for Law and Justice, the nation\u2019s premier First Amendment law firm\u201d for a possible court fight.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re building a case on now, is a constitutional question,\u201d Keller said.\n\nHe added later, \u201c\"Freedom of speech, including anonymous speech, has a long and proud history in the United States, from the revolutionary pamphleteers to the civil rights supporters in the South. So long as there are public controversies there is a need to protect speakers from punishment and retaliation, and anonymous speech is often the only means of protection.\"\n\nCritics say other issues are at stake. \u201c501C4s are really a threat to democracy because they hide the identity of who\u2019s trying to influence campaigns,\u201d said Terry Jones, political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.\n\n\u201cThey enable one or more wealthy interests to influence elections, but the public cannot know it and the media cannot uncover it.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, is sponsoring a bill to require 501C4s to identify their donors if more than a quarter of their spending in Missouri is political. But it\u2019s unclear if that provision will get any legislative traction this session.\n\nMissouri Attorney General Chris Koster, a Democrat running for governor, also has called for requiring 501C4s that engage in politics to identify their donors. If the General Assembly acts, said Koster spokeswoman Nanci Gonder, \u201cWe stand ready to defend legislation requiring disclosure of donors.\u201d\n\nSuch possible actions, and the Missouri Century Foundation\u2019s commitment to fight, reflect how some Missouri politicians in both parties are beginning to pay closer attention to 501C4s.\n\nLast fall, for example, the 501C4 arm of the Missouri Club for Growth (which also has a regular PAC) spent $1.5 million to help pass Amendment 10, which restricts the governor's powers when it comes to crafting the state budget.\n\nThe group used its regular PAC to pay for $250,000 on ads to help Jay Ashcroft, the Republican candidate for state Senate in the 24th District in St. Louis County, as he competed against Democrat Jill Schupp.\n\nThe money spent by the PAC can be tracked. The source of Club for Growth\u2019s 501C4 money couldn\u2019t be tracked.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, a 501C4 called Better Government for Missouri emerged and gave $100,000 to a political action committee, which in turn used it as part of an effort to defeat Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, who was facing a Republican primary challenge from then-state Sen. Brad Lager, R-Savannah. Kinder still won the primary.\n\nAgain, there was no way to determine who put up the anti-Kinder money in the quest to help Lager.\n\nSome insiders in both parties contend that wealthy financier Rex Sinquefield, the state\u2019s top political donor, has helped bankroll some of the conservative 501C4s operating in Missouri. But he hasn\u2019t said and there\u2019s no way to verify it.\n\nProgressive 501C4 makes its mark\n\nAlthough most of the 501C4s engaging in Missouri politics are conservative, one of the most active is a liberal one: Progress Missouri, a Democratic-leaning group that is believed to be funded in part by labor and teacher groups. But as with other 501C4s, Progress Missouri does not identify its donors.\n\nProgress Missouri executive director Sean Nicholson said the group has a 501C4 arm because that classification gives it more flexibility when it comes to lobbying and engaging in political activity.\n\n\u201cWe want to be aggressive advocates to change the way the state does business,\u201d he said.\n\nFor example: Progress Missouri monitors lobbyists\u2019 spending and regularly releases its findings. It also makes videos of many of the proceedings in the state Capitol, which lately has prompted a fight with some Republican legislators over how to interpret the state\u2019s Sunshine Law.\n\nProgress Missouri often has become the state\u2019s prime group jabbing Republicans.\n\nOn Tuesday, for example, Progress Missouri was filling social media with links to the national magazine Salon, which had posted a disparaging story -- and video -- of 2016 Republican gubernatorial candidate Catherine Hanaway's recent appearance at a conservative conference in St. Louis.\n\nIn a speech to the group, Hanaway appears to link \u201cliberal sexual permissiveness\u2019\u2019 to child pornography. Hanaway maintains that the Salon article misrepresents what she was trying to say.\n\nStates seek more 501C4 transparency\n\nMaryland recently joined several other states \u2013 including Idaho, Montana, Maine, Utah, New York and California \u2013 that have passed laws requiring that 501C4s identify at least some of their donors.\n\nThat growth in regulation is among the reasons Michael Wolff, a former state Supreme Court justice and now dean of St. Louis University\u2019s School of Law, doesn\u2019t buy Keller\u2019s argument that 501C4s can\u2019t be regulated in Missouri.\n\n\u201cIf money is speech, as the U.S. Supreme Court as said, then the state has the right to know who\u2019s speaking,\u2019\u2019 Wolff said.\n\nWolff added that the no-regulation reasoning could prompt candidates to set up their own 501C4s and use their own money or that of their allies to fund them anonymously. The groups, in turn, could spend money to help the candidate\u2019s campaign \u2013 and nobody would know of the candidate\u2019s financial ties.\n\nWolff said such a move would allow candidates to circumvent state or federal campaign-finance limits or disclosure requirements.\n\nUnless states or the federal government step in, Wolff said, \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop them?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "As Missouri legislators roam the state Capitol, they frequently run into familiar lobbyists.
