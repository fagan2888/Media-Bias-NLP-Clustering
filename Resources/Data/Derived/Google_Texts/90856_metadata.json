(Shawn Millsaps/Special to News Sentinel)\n\nBy Kristi L. Nelson of the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nAt 25, Julian Battise is living a life he enjoys.\n\nBattise, who has some intellectual and developmental challenges, lives with three roommates in an apartment complex in Northwest Knoxville. With help, he manages his finances and decides how to spend his time. He works around 30 hours a week at a Publix supermarket \u2014 not through a program specifically for people with disabilities, but as a regular employee, at full pay.\n\nAll this, Battise accomplished with help from his house manager, Mamour Majang.\n\nMajang works for Support Services, a nonprofit agency that contracts with the state to provide assistance for Battise and others with intellectual or developmental disabilities. He spends weekdays with Battise and his roommates, helping them with everything from budgeting and medication management to job skills and transportation to work. The goal of the state, the national government and the provider organizations is to see them \"fully integrated\" into the community.\n\nThe job can be physically and emotionally draining, Majang said, but seeing clients like Battise succeed keeps him going.\n\nYet it's not lost on Majang that he could go a few miles down the road and make about the same hourly wage working in retail or even a fast-food establishment \u2014 a job that would demand far less of his time and energy.\n\nSupport Solutions is among providers petitioning the state to raise the compensation for caring for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Such an increase is necessary for them to raise the base pay of their employees, said the providers, two-thirds of whom are members of a statewide trade association, Tennessee Community Organizations, or TNCO.\n\n\"It's putting the industry we serve in jeopardy, because we can't compete with the salaries being paid by other employers,\" said Jarrod Adams, executive director for Evergreen Life Services\u2014Knoxville.\n\nAdams said on average, employees providing direct support to clients make about $8.50 an hour. TNCO would like to raise the base pay to $9.50 an hour. The organization estimates it would cost the state about $16 million to raise compensation enough to make that possible.\n\nIn Tennessee, around 430 providers employ more than 20,000 people to give support services to around 8,000 clients.\n\n\"These jobs are not easy jobs, and as the economy has rebounded, we know that providers have had to compete with many other companies and businesses to recruit and retain these employees,\" said Cara Kumari, spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, which administers the services, paid for by TennCare, through the Home and Community Based Waivers program.\n\nCompensation per client varies by the level of care each client needs, but for the coming fiscal year, the department has budgeted $86,258 for each person receiving services through the waivers.\n\nIn 2014, the department requested and was granted a 1.1 percent increase specifically to raise the rate for direct support professionals, Kumari said. In 2013, the Legislature approved a 0.9 percent increase for providers. Before that, the last provider increase was in 2006.\n\nMeanwhile, providers have had to deal with new Affordable Care Act requirements around providing health insurance for employees, Adams said. Regulations have also gotten increasingly specific about the ever-smaller number of clients who can live together, in an effort to move even farther away from \"institutionalization.\" More sites mean more employees, Adams said.\n\nThis year, the department asked for a small provider increase, but it wasn't in Gov. Bill Haslam's budget, he said.\n\nIn the upcoming budget, \"the governor was very generous with the disability community, proposing $24 million to start a new program for people with disabilities, called Employment and Community First CHOICES\" that will be administered through TennCare, Kumari said.\n\nRight now, Tennessee has almost 6,000 Tennesseans on a waiting list to receive services, although around 2,000 of them have said they don't need services currently. Some of those who need services could receive them through the new program.\n\nAdams said TNCO is \"excited to see\" that, but \"it doesn't do anything to help the people who are already receiving services\" be able to continue receiving them.\n\nTurnover among direct support staff is about 50 percent, Adams said, with a survey indicating 90 percent of support staffers left because \"they weren't making enough money to do this type of job. It was easier to go make that same amount of money doing something a lot easier.\"\n\nSix years ago, Majang, 29, started with Support Solutions while finishing his bachelor's degree. What he saw then as a temporary job turned into a calling, he said. Helping clients \"reach their full potential \u2014 that's the reward,\" he said. \"That's the joy.\"\n\nBut Majang is a parent, with a family here as well as family in Africa who depend on him for support. He works multiple shifts for Support Solutions, sometimes as long as 16 hours a day.\n\n\"I want to like what I am doing, but at the same time I want to be able to sustain my family,\" he said. \"I have to sacrifice. Sometimes I will sleep four or five hours a day, just so I can go to my job and be doing what I need to do when I am there.\n\n\"Nobody wants to go through that. You want to have one job where you can go in and give it your all, and go home and have time for yourself. This situation, it forces people to not have that option.\"\n\nLeatha Shuster, regional program director for Support Solutions, said most of the direct caregivers work more than one job \u2014 and many also have children or other family members with disabilities at home.\n\n\"The few people who feel the call to work with the intellectually and developmentally disabled, they work all this overtime, and they're exhausted,\" Shuster said. \"These positions require a lot from our staff.\"\n\nHigh turnover also costs providers money, she said, because providers invest several weeks of paid training in new employees before they're ever even able to work a shift independently.\n\n\"With this population, consistency and structure is huge in helping them stay stabilized,\" Shuster said. \"When you have a constant revolving door of staff, it's hard to give them the environment they need.\"\n\nBattise thinks of Majang as an older brother: one who taught him budgeting, laundry, cooking and other skills so he could live independently. Majang initially went to Battise's job with him daily, until he was confident at work. He also \"taught me to be more responsible for my own actions,\" Battise said.\n\nWhen he reaches his goal of living alone in his own apartment, Battise said, he'll have Majang to thank.\n\n\"We want legislators to understand the dire situation we're in,\" Adams said. \"It's growing more and more difficult to provide these services. We don't want to see that go away.\"", "article_metadata": {"title": "Providers: Low wages make it hard to find and keep caregivers", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/providers-low-wages-make-it-hard-to-find-and-keep-caregivers-2c0f5dba-f0fc-0d4d-e053-0100007f7187-370198561.html", "image": {"width": 900, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/K0012667649--242413.JPG", "height": 668}, "type": "article", "description": "Organizations that provide state-contracted support services to people with intellectual and developmental disabilies say low wages make it hard to compete with less-demanding jobs that pay better.
