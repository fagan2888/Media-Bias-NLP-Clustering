On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the PillCam Colon, an easier way to check for colon cancer via a pill-sized camera that is simply swallowed and passes gently through the patient\u2019s gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\"PillCam COLON will improve patient care by offering a new and effective colon imaging option for patients who have experienced an incomplete colonoscopy,\u201d Dr. Douglas Rex, from the Indiana University Hospital, said in a statement. \u201cAmong the limited alternatives available after incomplete colonoscopy, PillCam COLON gives us a minimally invasive, radiation-free option that provides endoscopic images of the same basic type that have made colonoscopy so useful.\"\n\nManufactured by one the world\u2019s leading GI medical device companies, Given Imagin Ltd., the PillCam features two color video cameras with a battery and LED light that measures 12 mm x 33 mm. After the device is swallowed by the patient, a video is recorded capturing the entire GI tract, including the colon, for the next 10 hours. RAPID software transfers data from the video capsule to a computer for the gastroenterologist\u2019s viewing pleasure.\n\nThe PillCam, already approved by 80 countries including Japan, Canada, Australia, and others in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, was recently tested in clinical trials that set out to determine the device\u2019s accuracy and safety. Researchers performed 16 on site clinical trials including 884 patients. In detecting adenomas of six millimeters or larger, the PillCam recorded 88 percent for sensitivity and 82 percent of specificity. The device is currently priced at $500, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\"We have made tremendous strides in increasing the number of people who are getting screened for colon cancer, starting at age 50 for the average risk individual,\u201d explained Eric Hargis, CEO of the Colon Cancer Alliance. \u201cColonoscopy is the most comprehensive option, but for up to 10 percent of individuals, achieving a complete colonoscopy may not be possible. For those individuals, PillCam COLON capsule endoscopy could be an effective option to allow their gastroenterologist to complete a colon examination.\u201d\n\nA colonoscopy involves a long and narrow tube that is fitted with a tiny light and camera, also known as a scope, and placed inside of a patient\u2019s rectum to view any swollen tissue, ulcers, or polyps. Around 750,000 colonoscopies are considered incomplete each year due to a patient\u2019s history of abdominal surgery, abnormal or enlarged colon, or any disease affecting the colon.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, colon cancer, also known as colorectal or rectum cancer, is a cancer that affects part of a patient\u2019s GI tract. Approximately 96,830 new cases of colon cancer will be diagnosed in 2014, making it the third most common cancer among men and women. Colorectal cancer is expected to cause 50,310 deaths in 2014, a number that is significantly less than what it was 20 years ago. Earlier screening and quicker treatment of colorectal cancer has saved over one million lives in the U.S.\n\n\"The clearance of PillCam COLON by the FDA represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of Given Imaging as a GI medical device leader,\u201d said Homi Shamir, president and CEO of Given Imaging. \u201cThis important event caps a string of significant regulatory milestones for our company including clearance of PillCam COLON in Japan and PillCam SB 3 in both the U.S as well as Japan. We look forward to working closely with the U.S. gastroenterology community to bring this clinically-proven, diagnostic tool to patients who need to have a thorough colorectal exam following an incomplete colonoscopy.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pillcam, colon, cancer, colonoscopy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Say goodbye to colonoscopies!
