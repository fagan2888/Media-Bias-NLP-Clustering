"Ascension") senior debt ratings of Aa2, Aa2/VMIG 1, and Aa2/P-1, subordinated debt ratings of Aa3 and Aa3/VMIG 1, and commercial paper rating of P-1. The outlook is stable. SUMMARY RATING RATIONALE The Aa2 long-term senior rating is based on Ascension's status as the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in the United States with $20 billion in total operating revenues, a large portfolio of sizable hospitals and non-acute care business lines that provide geographic and operating diversity, favorable governance and management restructuring and consolidation initiatives to achieve revenue diversification and cost reductions, prominent market positions in individual markets, large investment portfolio and the availability of $1 billion in bank facilities supporting manageable liquidity needs, moderate leverage and limited debt structure risks, and a nearly fully funded and frozen pension plan. The system's challenges include moderate operating margins (even with recent improvement) suppressed by significant investments in a major enterprise resource project ("Symphony"), concentration in states that have not yet expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and competition in most markets. The rating rationale for the short-term ratings are discussed below. OUTLOOK The stable outlook reflects expectations that improved FY 2015 margins will be sustained given reductions in costs of and expected benefits from the Symphony project. Revenue diversification strategies and additional cost reduction initiatives related to restructuring of governance and operations are expected to offset challenges of lower rate increases and relatively flat volumes. The stable outlook anticipates no new debt outside of acquisitions and that any acquisitions or mergers are not materially dilutive to key credit measures nor present high execution risk. WHAT COULD MAKE THE RATING GO UP - Significant and sustained improvement in operating margins - Completion of Symphony project, reducing significant investment and execution risk - Further balance sheet improvement, including liquidity growth and deleveraging - Continued diversification of non-acute care revenues WHAT COULD MAKE THE RATING GO DOWN - Sustained decline in operating cashflow margin - Significant increase in debt - Materially dilutive merger or acquisition OBLIGOR PROFILE Ascension is the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in the U.S. with $20 billion in revenue, operating in 23 states and D.C. The system operates 130 hospitals (including 100 acute care hospitals), provides senior care and home health services, and employs over 5,000 physicians. LEGAL SECURITY Security for the senior bondholders is a revenue pledge of the senior credit group. Security for the subordinated bondholders is an unsecured general obligation of Ascension and the bonds are subordinate to all outstanding senior bonds. No debt service reserve funds are in place. Covenants include minimal debt service coverage test and no additional indebtedness tests. Members of the subordinate credit group are identical to those in the senior credit group. The VMIG 1 ratings are based on Ascension's own large and liquid investment portfolio, which provides support for tenders of demand debt and purchase of serial mode bonds. Close to $1 billion of debt related to Alexian and the Health Systems comprising the former Marian Health System are separately secured by the respective organizations under each master trust indenture. However, given Ascension's control of these organizations and high degree of integration, our assessment of Ascension includes the entire system.

The additional methodology used in this rating was Rating Methodology for Municipal Bonds and Commercial Paper Supported by a Borrower's Self-Liquidity published in January 2012.
