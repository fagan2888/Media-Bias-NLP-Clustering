(AP) - The annual Mississippi State-Kentucky football matchup may never have a place among the Southeastern Conference\u2019s most celebrated rivalries.\n\nBut for the Bulldogs (5-2, 1-2 SEC) and Wildcats (4-2, 2-2), it\u2019s become a very important part of the schedule, and a bellwether for which program is rising and which one is struggling.\n\nThe programs - squaring off for the 26th straight season - are permanent cross-division opponents under the SEC\u2019s current scheduling setup.\n\n\u201cYou kind of know each other and I think that it brings a little different edge,\u201d Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen said.\n\nMississippi State has won the last six games in the series, though several have been close. It\u2019s no coincidence that the Bulldogs have been a very good program during that stretch, advancing to five straight bowl games for the first time in school history.\n\nKentucky, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t been to the postseason since 2010.\n\nThere\u2019s indicators that streak could be snapped this year: The Wildcats have been competitive in all six games and appear in good position to finish with more than two SEC wins for the first time since 2009.\n\n\u201cThe truth is we\u2019re a better football team,\u201d Stoops said. \u201cI think our body of work through half the season makes that pretty evident.\u201d\n\nMississippi State is trying to build some momentum after a mildly disappointing first half of the season. The Bulldogs missed what would have been a game-winning field goal in a 21-19 loss to undefeated LSU and fell 30-17 to Texas A&M; on Oct. 3.\n\nSince then, the Bulldogs have won two straight games over Troy and Louisiana Tech. Now they step back into conference play.\n\nTo end its losing streak in the series, Kentucky will likely need a big game from Patrick Towles, who has had an up-and-down season with 1,512 yards passing, eight touchdowns and seven interceptions.\n\nTowles was fantastic in last year\u2019s 45-31 loss against the then No. 1-ranked Bulldogs, throwing for 390 yards, running for 76 more and accounting for four touchdowns.\n\nMullen said that game opened the Bulldogs\u2019 eyes to how good he can be.\n\n\u201cHe had a huge game at their place,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cThe best way to trump any quarterback is to have home field advantage, to our student body and fans on their feet making an awful lot of noise, and making it uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nWith two SEC losses already, including one to first-place LSU, the Bulldogs are a longshot to win the Western Division.\n\nBut a victory over Kentucky would help Mississippi State become an intriguing team in November, especially since it has home games against division rivals Alabama and Mississippi.\n\n\u201cIf we play well we have a chance to win the rest of our games,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cIf we play poorly, we won\u2019t win anymore. You have to come out and play at an extremely high level to have an opportunity to win when you are playing SEC games.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP .\n\n___\n\nAP College Football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The annual Mississippi State-Kentucky football matchup may never have a place among the Southeastern Conference's most celebrated rivalries.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The annual Mississippi State-Kentucky football matchup may never have a place among the Southeastern Conference\u2019s most celebrated rivalries.", "title": "Mississippi State-Kentucky game has plenty of significance", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/20/mississippi-state-kentucky-game-has-plenty-of-sign/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/20/2f00bb72b0551d2e850f6a7067009296.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/20/2f00bb72b0551d2e850f6a7067009296.jpg", "description": "The annual Mississippi State-Kentucky football matchup may never have a place among the Southeastern Conference's most celebrated rivalries.", "card": "summary", "title": "Mississippi State-Kentucky game has plenty of significance"}, "Author": "DAVID BRANDT", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The programs - squaring off for the 26th straight season - are permanent cross-division opponents under the SEC\u2019s current scheduling setup.\n\u201cYou kind of know each other and I think that it brings a little different edge,\u201d Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen said.\nBut a victory over Kentucky would help Mississippi State become an intriguing team in November, especially since it has home games against division rivals Alabama and Mississippi.\nMississippi State has won the last six games in the series, though several have been close.\n(AP) - The annual Mississippi State-Kentucky football matchup may never have a place among the Southeastern Conference\u2019s most celebrated rivalries."}
