The rally was held in the gymnasium with ticket check and a full Secret Service search to get in the door. The press area took up almost half of the gym but the rest of the area filled up with people jam-packed in like sardines.\n\nPhoto by Kimberly Morin scraped from Rightside Broadcasting video\n\nThere were people from all ages and walks of life in attendance. Some were hard core Trump supporters; some were there because they attend Great Bay; others were undecideds in the election and some were simply \u201cgawkers,\u201d there to see the celebrity from Apprentice.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s speech he said the usual things. How he\u2019s going to \u201cdo this and do that\u201d but never explains how he is going to do these things. He also spoke about healthcare again. His latest stance seems to continue with Universal Healthcare:\n\nI have a heart. You know, people don\u2019t realize that I\u2019m much warmer than other people. I wanna help people. I wanna get rid of Obamacare and get you something great. We have some people that won\u2019t be able to live. We have to help people. Don\u2019t we have to help? What are we going to do let \u2018em die in the street? We\u2019re going to have great plans, they are going to be less expensive. Obamacare is out of control. And how about your deductibles? You have to be dead before you can use them.\n\nOf course, Trump never explains HOW he\u2019s going to do any of this nor does he seem to realize that we already do not allow people to \u201cdie in the street\u201d as we have Medicaid for the sick and disabled. Emergency rooms are required to take care of anyone who walks through their doors regardless of ability to pay. Unfortunately his supporters don\u2019t seem to question Trump about his statements and what his policies are to back them up OR how Americans will pay for it all.\n\nIn a recent interview with an Undeclared New Hampshire voter who attended a Trump rally, the interviewee said it was her first political rally ever and that she went because she wanted to see him due to his celebrity. She thought it was interesting at first but was disappointed that he was mostly saying negative things about the other candidates. She liked some of the things he was saying he was going to do if elected but she wanted to know how he planned on doing these things.\n\nThis is an interesting observation from someone who isn\u2019t political at all. She actually left the event early because she got bored but it\u2019s telling that a voter like this is questioning Trump\u2019s plans. This is a voter who doesn\u2019t pay attention to the news or politics but votes in every general election.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit understandable. Trump flies from one subject to the other without fully completing the thought on the topic he starts out with. This is probably why he never explains how he\u2019s going to do any of the things he talks about doing.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of \u201cI, me and my\u201d from Trump. He likes to tout how great he thinks he is and people cheer him on. It\u2019s almost reminiscent of the current resident of the White House. Unfortunately his supporters also seem reminiscent of Obama\u2019s supporters in that they seem to be all about the \u201chope and change\u201d hype without actually knowing what that change is going to be.\n\nThe New Hampshire primary is coming up on February 9th. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how Trump\u2019s massive appeal during rallies plays out at the ballot box. Trump just started an actual ground game a few weeks ago. It\u2019s unclear how many volunteers and staffers he has making calls and going door to door but it may not even matter. Trump\u2019s appeal seems to be what he says he\u2019ll do, not how he\u2019ll actually get it done.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last night Donald Trump held a rally at Great Bay Community College in Portsmouth.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/observations-of-a-trump-rally-new-hampshire", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/05/49/0549d54177b8d481f1c253159c95b55c.jpg?itok=nF6zAufa", "type": "article", "title": "Observations of a Trump rally in New Hampshire"}, "twitter": {"description": "Last night Donald Trump held a rally at Great Bay Community College in Portsmouth.
