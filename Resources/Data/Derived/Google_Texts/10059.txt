Times staff writer Curtis Krueger is covering the special election for Congressional District 13. Follow him on Twitter @ckruegertimes. Today he has a look at the five candidates and where they stand on some key issues and their connections to Pinellas County. An intro:

Pinellas County is about to send a new representative to Congress and the race so far seems centered on two questions:

Who's really from Pinellas County? Who can really get things done in Washington?

Five candidates are running, with three facing off in a Republican primary Jan. 14. The GOP nominee will then go up against Democrat Alex Sink and Libertarian Lucas Overby in the March 11 general election.

The special election was called after the death of longtime Republican U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, and the candidates are scrambling to ramp up their campaigns in the district, which extends from south Pinellas to Dunedin, with downtown and southern St. Petersburg cut out.

Here's a look at how they are beginning their campaigns and where they stand on important issues such as the controversial changes to flood insurance regulations, the recent government shutdown, and "Obamacare."
