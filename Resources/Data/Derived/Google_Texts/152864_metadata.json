He collected seven wins and won the CART Series championship, then picked up three more series victories the next year.\n\nBut there was only one goal in 2000, the year Chip Ganassi Racing returned to the Indianapolis 500 after a four-year absence. Ganassi pushed hard for an Indy 500 win, and Montoya delivered in a monstrous way: The Colombian star led 167 of the 200 laps as he routed the field and beat runner-up Buddy Lazier by more than seven seconds. Then he was gone, off to Formula One for 5\u00bd years and then for seven seasons in NASCAR. Montoya never looked back, never once considered another run at the Indianapolis 500.\n\nUntil now.\n\nNow 38, Montoya is back in Indy- Car, driving for storied Team Penske, and after four races and two weeks of practice at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, he\u2019s comfortable again in the race car.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to get cockier and cockier and cockier in the car,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cYour confidence starts to grow. To be honest, I think I have a really good shot at winning it. I really do. With my oval experience in NASCAR and knowing this place really well, and being with Team Penske, chances of winning don\u2019t come much better than that.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the attitude fans expected when Montoya made his return. But it wasn\u2019t just like riding a bike for Montoya, who needed months of testing to relearn the car. It was make-or-break time at the season opener in March, when many fans thought Montoya would once again make the series look like his own personal playground.\n\nHe was not one of them.\n\n\u201cIn the first race, I couldn\u2019t outbrake anybody,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cIn NASCAR, you never pass anybody into the corner, you pass everybody out of the corner. Here, you don\u2019t pass anybody out of the corner. Everything is in the braking, and I haven\u2019t outbraked anybody in seven years. So I had to relearn.\u201d\n\nMontoya had the fastest four-lap average \u2014 231.007 mph \u2014 among drivers ineligible to win the pole and will start 10th on Sunday.\n\nIndy 500 starting grid\n\n1.
