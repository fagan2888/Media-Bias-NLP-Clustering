Of the 16 quality measures that achieved a 95 percent performance level, 14 were publicly reported by CMS, and four more CMS measures are among those improving fastest, according to the report. Seventy percent of publicly reported CMS measures that weren't retired or removed show improvement over time.\n\nDespite the positive news, disparities in healthcare persist, according to the AHRQ's 2013 National Healthcare Disparities Report. More than one-quarter of Americans report difficulties getting care, particularly low-income or racial and ethnic minorities. Most quality disparities relating to income, ethnicity or race showed no major changes, but more disparities improved than worsened for Hispanics, Asians, blacks and low-income people, according to the report.\n\nHospitals made progress on hospital-acquired infections, according to the AHRQ, a finding consistent with previous reports. Care quality is also on the rise for HIV treatment measures, colon cancer surgical care and adolescent vaccination, while quality worsened for measures relating to diabetes checkups, maternal deaths and delivery, Pap smears and preventive care for asthmatic patients, according to the report.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the quality report (.pdf)\n\n- read the disparities report\n\n- read the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n1 in 25 patients acquire hospital infections\n\nHAIs down in US, but more work needed\n\nBetter quality measures mean better quality care\n\nAHA supports NQF's proposed quality measure recommendations", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals improved in 75 percent of care quality measures, according to a new report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals improved in 75 percent of care quality measures, according to a new report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).", "title": "Report: Hospital care quality improves", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/report-hospital-care-quality-improving/2014-05-16", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Agency for Healthcare Reseach and Quality (AHRQ),hospital-acquired infections (HAI),low-income patients,Partnership for Patients,Patient Care & Outcomes,Quality Measurements,Racial Disparities", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4a0\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the quality report (.pdf)- read the disparities report- read the statementRelated Articles:1 in 25 patients acquire hospital infectionsHAIs down in US, but more work neededBetter quality measures mean better quality careAHA supports NQF's proposed quality measure recommendations\nHospitals improved in 75 percent of care quality measures, according to a new report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).\nCare quality is also on the rise for HIV treatment measures, colon cancer surgical care and adolescent vaccination, while quality worsened for measures relating to diabetes checkups, maternal deaths and delivery, Pap smears and preventive care for asthmatic patients, according to the report.\nDespite the positive news, disparities in healthcare persist, according to the AHRQ's 2013 National Healthcare Disparities Report.\n\"Hospitals are clearly engaged in efforts to improve healthcare quality in the United States,\" AHRQ Director Richard Kronick, Ph.D., said in the statement."}
