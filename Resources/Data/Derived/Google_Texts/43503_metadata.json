Make sure your information is correct.\n\nMaybe you got married, added a child to the family or moved. Even if last year was uneventful, read through the information your insurance carrier has to ensure all of your details are accurate.\n\n2. Look at what\u2019s changing.\n\nRarely do plans remain static from one year to the next. Your employer could be among the many that the National Business Group on Health says will be offering only high-deductible plans, or your out-of-pocket expenses like copays and coinsurance could be increasing. Even if you\u2019re shopping in a state exchange or the ACA marketplace, look for changes. Though not all ACA premiums are expected to rise, narrowed networks and increased cost-sharing are just a few ways insurers are saving money \u2014 which could end up costing you more.\n\n3. Estimate next year\u2019s health care expenses.\n\nEspecially if you are considering a policy change, try to determine what sort of expenses you\u2019ll have in the coming year, such as prescriptions, care for chronic conditions and potential surgeries. Having a general idea of what these items will cost will help you choose the right coverage. Planned procedures and accompanying imaging (such as CT or MRI scans), appointments and medications can get expensive. Selecting a plan with a higher level of coverage can help you to manage these costs when they start piling up.\n\n4. Consider a health savings account.\n\nHealth savings accounts (HSAs) allow consumers with high-deductible plans to set aside pre-tax dollars for health care expenses. Whether you choose a high-deductible plan, or if it\u2019s your employer\u2019s only available option, an HSA can make out-of-pocket expenses more manageable. In some cases, employers also contribute to these accounts.\n\n5. Reapply for the premium tax credit and health care subsidies.\n\nIf you\u2019re shopping for a plan on a marketplace, apply for assistance in covering the cost of insurance. Even if your income didn\u2019t change over the past year, qualification standards did. Your eligibility for assistance is based on the federal poverty level, which is adjusted every year for inflation.\n\n6. If you have questions, ask. The changes you make now will last a year, so it\u2019s important to move forward without regrets.
