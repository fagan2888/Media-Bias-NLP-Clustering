The event was a final expression of gratitude for the brainpower, tears, and sweat they had poured into her cause for more than a year.\n\nOn this day, the sweat kept coming. It was a sweltering Friday in the nation\u2019s capital, with violent summer storms brewing in the suburbs, and Clinton\u2019s air-conditioned house was off-limits to guests, except for one bathroom that was accessible from the outside. Some of her aides kicked off their shoes and dipped their feet in the pool for relief. Hillary ignored the heat and stifling humidity to work one last crowd, taking pictures with midlevel staffers in sweat-soaked shirts.\n\nLike a weekend griller, Bill Clinton held court in his own backyard, complaining about \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Tim Russert to just about anyone who would listen. Russert had called the time of death on Hillary\u2019s campaign a month earlier on the night of the North Carolina and Indiana primaries. \u201cSometimes in campaigns the candidate is the last to recognize the best timing,\u201d Russert had said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like being on life support. Once they start removing the systems, you really have no choice.\u201d\n\nMuch as Bill blamed big-media types for jumping on the Obama bandwagon, Russert was just reporting a truth that was evident even to Hillary. The narrowness of Hillary\u2019s victory in Indiana, where she had run the field operation for Jimmy Carter\u2019s 1976 presidential campaign, was just as telling as the pounding she took in North Carolina that night. The day after those primaries, on a conference call with the campaign\u2019s top executives, she issued the edict to cease and desist on attacks that could hurt Obama in the general election. The final month of the campaign was a slow march to her inevitable fate.\n\nAt the end of that slog, the backyard party had the feel of a wake, a bittersweet goodbye. Though the Washington air was thick with speculation about whether Obama might pick Hillary to be his running mate, the two former rivals had met the night before at Senator Dianne Feinstein\u2019s D.C. home and, unbeknownst to the partygoers at Hillary\u2019s house, Obama made clear that he did not intend to ask her. For the most part, the extended Clinton family of friends and aides tried to keep the mood in the backyard upbeat. But surface conviviality couldn\u2019t hide the fact that this journey was ending on the north lawn of the Whitehaven house rather than on the South Lawn of the White House.\n\nWhile Hillary listened to battlefield stories, shared laughs, and posed for pictures, she gave no hint of the emotional and politically delicate task that lay ahead of her that night. As the last of the political operatives and press aides shuffled off the property, Hillary headed to her dining room to write the final draft of the highly anticipated concession speech that she would deliver the next morning to a nation of Democrats waiting to see whether she could endorse Obama with conviction. The dining room, separated from the foyer by sliding French doors, is the business center at the Clintons\u2019 Washington home, a 5,500-square-foot Georgian temple to the 1950s that they bought in 2000 so Hillary would have a place to live while she served in the Senate.\n\nBy the time Hillary sat down late that afternoon with aides Doug Hattaway and Sarah Hurwitz, the latest draft of the speech reflected the scars of a staff still riven. Nearly all agreed that Hillary had to endorse Obama and acknowledge her own supporters, but they couldn\u2019t come to terms on the best approach. For several days, her various communications advisers had been e-mailing drafts back and forth, fighting one another through edits to the text. The bigger camp, made up mostly of high-priced advisers like chief strategist Geoff Garin, demanded a full-throated endorsement of Obama that would convince his team, the Democratic Party, and the rest of the country that she was completely on board.\n\nThe smaller set, which included several of the women closest to Hillary, as well as Hattaway and Hurwitz, insisted that she couldn\u2019t credibly make the case for Obama if she didn\u2019t deliver a powerful acknowledgment of the historic nature of her own candidacy and particularly of the women who had supported it. At the heart of the matter was an existential question that had plagued the campaign from its earliest days: how should Hillary handle being the first viable female candidate for president?\n\nFor most of the campaign, she had sided with old-school professionals who believed she needed to project strength and thus keep the talk about being a woman to a minimum. She hadn\u2019t given a speech that called attention to her gender the way Obama had made a race speech. But her campaign had been resurrected by vulnerability, in a moment of emotional exhaustion, when a tear rolled down her face at a stop in New Hampshire. Those who felt she performed better when she showed her underdog side believed the concession speech gave Hillary an opportunity to talk about the very aspect of her persona that she had held back for so long and that appealed to so many voters.\n\nWhen Hillary sat down with Hurwitz and Hattaway, the draft they reviewed included both an endorsement of Obama and an oratorical run about her place in history. For months, she had resisted the close circle of advisers who had wanted her to frame her candidacy in terms of history, the way Obama had. Now the text in front of her did just that. Jim Kennedy, a longtime Clinton hand, had come up with the phrase that melded Hillary with her voters in the continuum of the women\u2019s movement. Text-messaging his thoughts from his home in Venice Beach, California, earlier in the week, Kennedy said Hillary should speak of the \u201ceighteen million cracks\u201d that her campaign had put in the most fortified glass ceiling of them all.\n\nHillary had always favored making a robust endorsement, her aides said. But as she reviewed the latest draft at her dining room table, she still wasn\u2019t sold on the riff about her place in history. She was more inclined to show first and foremost that she was a team player\u2014an attribute she prized in herself and that was important to preserving her political future. She had to be brought around to putting so much emphasis on honoring her achievement as the woman who had come closest to winning a major party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nShe scrawled a question mark in the margin beside the paragraphs about her.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about being a woman,\u201d Hillary said.\n\n\u201cThink about talking not about you as a woman but to the women who supported you,\u201d Hattaway countered, framing his argument in terms that might appeal to the midwestern Methodist who reflexively worried about the potential unseemliness of calling attention to herself. \u201cThis is a big accomplishment for them.\u201d\n\nHillary wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cHer head wasn\u2019t there,\u201d said one source. Then Hurwitz, a Harvard-educated lawyer and speechwriter who had been taking notes quietly, leaned forward and made the case. For one young woman with proximity to power, this was the moment to speak for the millions of women her own age, as well as for the mothers and grandmothers, who had stuck by Hillary. They burned to see the first woman in the Oval Office, choosing that cause over another cherished hope for many of them\u2014to elect the first black president. This, above all else, mattered. It wasn\u2019t that Hurwitz was consumed with hatred for Obama. Within weeks, she would join his campaign, and she ended up landing a coveted job on the White House speechwriting team. But this moment mattered for so many women who had pinned their hopes on Hillary. In the end, Hurwitz\u2019s passion, and her reason, won out.\n\nOkay, Hillary said, it stays.\n\nThe denouement was pivotal, as much for what it said about the evolution of Hillary\u2019s persona in the coming years as it did for the tenor of the speech she would give the next day. Hillary\u2019s toughness and her femininity weren\u2019t mutually exclusive; they were bound together. Voters, particularly women, identified with her precisely because she was a woman with an iron spine. Over that summer, from her dining room table in June to the Democratic National Convention in Denver in August, she started to develop a new narrative in which she embraced being a trailblazing political force in her own right.\n\nThough the point in her speech was resolved, Hillary\u2019s night was far from over. There was a lot riding on this address, and she needed to strike the perfect chord with the endorsement. She couldn\u2019t afford to alienate her remaining loyalists. Her advisers even feared that supporters might walk out if she was too strong in her endorsement. She knew that 10 percent of them would never go over to Obama, but she had to make sure she could move the other 90 percent. Yet neither could she come up short in praising Obama. It wasn\u2019t really an either-or proposition. If she failed to give a hearty enough endorsement, she might severely and permanently damage her own standing in the Democratic Party. No one wanted to relive the awful moment when Ted Kennedy refused to join hands with Jimmy Carter after their 1980 primary fight.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As 2016 nears, the amazing story of how Clinton and Obama united -- and how her aides explained her '08 collapse", "title": "Hillary and Obama: Can they stand each other?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As 2016 nears, the amazing story of how Clinton and Obama united -- and how her aides explained her '08 collapse", "title": "Hillary and Obama: Can they stand each other?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/16/hillary_and_obama_can_they_stand_each_other/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/11/hillary_obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As 2016 nears, the amazing story of how Clinton and Obama united -- and how her aides explained her '08 collapse", "title": "Hillary and Obama: Can they stand each other?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/11/hillary_obama.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Books, David Axelrod, Editor's Picks, Hillary Clinton, HRC", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd73\"", "article_summary": "Nearly all agreed that Hillary had to endorse Obama and acknowledge her own supporters, but they couldn\u2019t come to terms on the best approach.\nRussert had called the time of death on Hillary\u2019s campaign a month earlier on the night of the North Carolina and Indiana primaries.\nWhen Hillary sat down with Hurwitz and Hattaway, the draft they reviewed included both an endorsement of Obama and an oratorical run about her place in history.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about being a woman,\u201d Hillary said.\nHillary ignored the heat and stifling humidity to work one last crowd, taking pictures with midlevel staffers in sweat-soaked shirts."}
