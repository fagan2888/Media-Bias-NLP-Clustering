Sioux Falls, SD

The streets of downtown Sioux Falls turned undead today as hundreds of Zombies of all ages gather for the eighth annual Zombie Walk. The brain hungry hoard along with several floats in the Boo-Falls Parade flood several blocks down Phillips Avenue.

“The parade is only about four blocks, three blocks, but it's zombies everybody moves pretty slow, it's quite a zombie shuffle, but we're just going to have a lot of fun,” Sioux Falls Roller Dollz' Joy Falencik said.

The walking dead crowd headed to the battle of the bands to party like a zombie. Proceeds from the Zombie Walk benefit the State Theatre and the Sioux Falls Roller Dollz.
