But federal officials were not required to examine that long-term track record, which included a highly publicized failure to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers.\n\nBy 2011, CGI Federal already had been cleared to do government work at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency overseeing the rollout of the new health-care law.\n\nThe company had been included in a pool of pre-screened, approved contractors in 2007, during the George W. Bush administration, and only firms in that pool were later allowed to bid for the Affordable Care Act work. It was at that earlier time that the problems at American Management Systems, the Fairfax County IT contractor acquired by CGI, would have figured into the assessment of CGI Federal, contracting experts say.\n\nIn hindsight, one former CMS official said, the AMS record \u201ccould well have knocked [CGI Federal] out of the competition, and probably should have.\u201d\n\nView Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points.\n\nIn light of the bungled launch of the health-care Web site, critics have repeatedly asked how CGI Federal got the contract, and there has been widespread speculation on online news sites and blogs that the firm was selected because of political ties to the Obama administration.\n\nBut a review of internal documents and interviews with former and current federal officials show that the selection process was walled off from politics.\n\nCareer officials at CMS, working out of an obscure Baltimore-based contracting office, focused in 2011 on the proposals submitted by four bidders, examining technical competency and cost while giving relatively little attention to past performance. Since 2007, CGI Federal had won 17 other CMS jobs under the pre-screened contract, worth several hundred million dollars.\n\nThe review of CGI Federal concluded there was \u201cno evidence of performance risk,\u201d according to a CMS document, portions of which were read to The Washington Post by a person familiar with the contracting process.\n\nCGI Federal won the $93 million contract, now worth $293 million, in September 2011.\n\nAt the time of the earlier selection process in 2007, CGI Federal was still relatively new to federal contracting. It had grown out of CGI Group\u2019s acquisition in 2004 of AMS, which had a recent history of troubled projects, including a Philadelphia school computer system that sent paychecks to dead people and a Mississippi tax system so dysfunctional that a jury awarded a $474 million verdict against the firm.\n\nThree former CMS officials said in recent interviews that the AMS problems should have raised red flags.\n\n\u201cShould CMS have recognized that \u2018Okay, here\u2019s CGI Federal. It\u2019s a new company, but, oh, my God, it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday\u2019?\u201d asked one former CMS official familiar with the contracting process who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. \u201cYes. I would consider that dropping the ball.\u2019\u2019\n\nTasha Bradley, a CMS spokeswoman, said in a statement that the agency \u201cadheres by a long-\n\nestablished contracting process where expert, career contracting officials evaluate and award contracts based on criteria outlined in the contract solicitation, including past performance, technical expertise and proposed contract value.\u201d\n\nCMS declined to comment on specific questions about how closely CGI Federal\u2019s past performance was evaluated and whether that review looked at AMS.\n\nFormer AMS executives have defended that company\u2019s performance, and CGI officials have rejected any comparison with AMS\u2019s earlier failures.\n\nCGI Federal has also defended its work on HealthCare.gov, despite an October launch that White House officials have acknowledged was disastrous. Federal officials have faulted the company\u2019s performance, saying it missed deadlines, understaffed the job and overstated its progress.\n\nPeople familiar with the project have said it was also hampered by administration mismanagement, fierce Republican opposition and political sensitivities that delayed policy and regulatory decisions.\n\nThe federal online marketplace that is selling health plans in 36 states under the 2010 health-care law has been functioning better in recent weeks, but officials are still working to fix lingering problems, including errors in enrollment records sent to insurance companies. CGI Federal remains intimately involved in the project, writing computer code in attempts to fix various aspects of the system.\n\nLinda Odorisio, CGI\u2019s vice president for global communications, said the company \u201ccontinues to work closely with CMS and all of its vendor partners to deliver continuous enhancements in system performance and the user experience\u201d on the Web site.\n\nShe added that CGI Federal \u201ccontributed to the significant improvements made to the system over the last two months, resulting in more than half a million Americans enrolling in just the first three weeks of December.\u201d\n\nUmbrella contract\n\nIn December 2006, CMS put out a request for proposals. The agency said it was seeking \u201cworld-class IT services\u201d to improve and maintain the massive systems that run Medicare and Medicaid, according to contracting documents. Thirty-one bidders responded, including CGI Federal.\n\nCMS used a procurement method that has become increasingly common over the past decade. The agency first awarded an umbrella contract to a group of firms, and those firms were then eligible to bid on future IT work. Experts say this saves the government time because it shortens the subsequent bid process.\n\nIn evaluating the bids, CMS was to scrutinize each company\u2019s performance on previous contracts, according to an internal agency document obtained by The Post. The document described a \u201crisk assessment\u201d of cost control, on-time delivery and other factors.\n\nFederal law requires that past performance be considered for all federal contracts worth more than $150,000, with limited exceptions. Federal regulations also say CMS should have considered the record of \u201cpredecessor companies,\u201d such as AMS. Several former officials familiar with the 2007 selection said no concerns about CGI Federal were raised inside the agency.\n\nAMS projects had run into trouble at the federal level and in at least 12 states, according to government audit reports, interviews and news accounts. The purchase of AMS was CGI\u2019s entree into the U.S. government market, and AMS executives flocked to CGI Federal. Today, more than 100 former AMS employees are senior executives or consultants working for CGI in the Washington area.\n\nOne former CMS official said the agency especially should have examined the most publicized AMS failure, an effort to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers. AMS was fired in 2001 by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board after going $60 million over budget, writing computer code that turned out to be useless and never delivering a workable system, according to government reports.\n\nAMS had settled lawsuits arising from the project in 2003. \u201cThat should have stood out,\u2019\u2019 the former official said.\n\nCGI Federal was ultimately chosen for an umbrella contract, worth up to $4 billion in future work, along with 15 other firms, including Lockheed Martin and IBM.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether agency officials examined the AMS track record, former CMS officials said it probably would not have made much difference, because past performance has long been an overlooked component of federal contracting.\n\nDeadline pressure\n\nIn the summer of 2011, the Obama administration was racing to figure out who would build the Affordable Care Act\u2019s all-important Web site. \u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d said an internal CMS draft request for proposals, dated June 24, 2011.\n\nWith deadlines looming, officials limited the bidders to the winners of the 2007 umbrella contract. \u201cThere was very great time pressure,\u201d recalled a former CMS official familiar with the process. \u201cThe feeling was we had a lot of big IT powerhouses and they knew our work.\u2019\u2019\n\nFour firms applied: IBM, Computer Sciences Corp., Quality Software Services and CGI Federal.\n\nAs is tradition, the selection process was strictly sheltered from political considerations and political appointees at CMS or elsewhere in the administration, according to numerous former and current CMS employees.\n\n\u201cI deliberately stayed out of contracting,\u2019\u2019 said Leslie Norwalk, the agency\u2019s acting administrator under President George W. Bush. \u201cIf that had changed, I would have heard rumblings.\u2019\u2019\n\nAgency documents show that a career contracting officer, in the CMS Office of Acquisition and Grants Management, was in charge of awarding the contract for the Web site. The selection process focused on bidders\u2019 business and technical proposals, which described the proposed cost, hardware and software required, proposed infrastructure design, security requirements, and key personnel.\n\nThe companies\u2019 past performance was not a priority. The CMS document listed it as the second least important of seven technical evaluation factors. And the review would look only at past work under the 2007 umbrella contract, the document said.\n\nWhile the review found no performance risk for CGI Federal, agency officials had not always been satisfied with the company\u2019s work. In 2010, CMS rejected CGI Federal\u2019s bid under the umbrella contract to perform work on four health IT systems, in part citing unspecified performance issues in carrying out an earlier contract, according to a Government Accountability Office ruling. CGI Federal protested the CMS decision, but the GAO upheld it.\n\nAnd the review did not take into account problems that several other CGI projects had encountered, including years of delay and system failures on a state computer system in Hawaii. State auditors in 2010 partially faulted another CGI subsidiary, CGI Technologies and Solutions, for those issues.\n\nCGI says its overall work is high-quality and nearly always on time and on budget, and the company has also had many successes. In the past two years, CGI Federal has been awarded contracts with at least 25 federal agencies.\n\nDocuments and interviews show that CGI Federal was selected because of what was deemed to be the company\u2019s technical prowess, even though the price of the firm\u2019s proposal was higher than that of at least of one competitor.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "CGI Federal and Affordable Care Act contract", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "CGI Federal was cleared for contract work in 2007 as part of an umbrella contract", "title": "HealthCare.gov contract: Politics not a factor, but neither were firm\u2019s ties to failed projects", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/healthcaregov-contract-politics-not-a-factor-but-neither-were-firms-ties-to-failed-projects/2013/12/22/61728fca-6753-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/10/Interactivity/Images/crop-115278450.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JerryMarkon"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/healthcaregov-contract-politics-not-a-factor-but-neither-were-firms-ties-to-failed-projects/2013/12/22/61728fca-6753-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "CGI Federal and Affordable Care Act contract", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "61728fca-6753-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "CGI Federal was cleared for contract work in 2007 as part of an umbrella contract"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23d4\"", "article_summary": "At the time of the earlier selection process in 2007, CGI Federal was still relatively new to federal contracting.\nBut a review of internal documents and interviews with former and current federal officials show that the selection process was walled off from politics.\nCGI Federal remains intimately involved in the project, writing computer code in attempts to fix various aspects of the system.\nSince 2007, CGI Federal had won 17 other CMS jobs under the pre-screened contract, worth several hundred million dollars.\nCGI Federal won the $93 million contract, now worth $293 million, in September 2011."}
