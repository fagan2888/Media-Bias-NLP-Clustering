Instead, the government workers in question have been promoted or rehired, and their supervisors have not faced disciplinary action.\n\nIn one instance, a claims worker at a VA facility in Nashville \u201cdownloaded and installed unapproved software to his VA-issued laptop for the purpose of sexting,\u201d according to a report published by the VA\u2019s inspector general. He also misused $31,000 in travel funds before eventually being promoted to a position in Washington.\n\nRelated: Lifelong Pensions for Vets Could Be Whacked Under Pentagon Proposal\n\nJonah Czerwinski, who at the time was the director of the VA\u2019s Center for Innovation, was faulted by the VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General for failing to supervise the unnamed employee\u2019s actions. No disciplinary action was taken against Czerwinski since he left the agency to take a job in the private sector. His LinkedIn profile says he now works for The Advisory Board Company.\n\nA separate account showed that the VA rehired a former employee, Jed Fillingim, who had resigned from his previous post following a drunk-driving incident that resulted in the death of a colleague. An investigation by NBC4 News in Washington discovered Fillingim was rehired at a VA facility in Georgia despite an ongoing federal investigation into his misconduct. Investigators later ruled that he was intoxicated while driving a government vehicle, the news report said.\n\nFillingim is still employed by the VA.\n\nRelated: Holder and Mueller Spent $7.8 Million on Personal Travel\n\nThe VA, meanwhile, continues to chip away at its backlog of benefits claims, an issue that has plagued the agency in recent years and left veterans waiting months and sometimes years to be compensated or reimbursed for medical care. The number of claims pending for more than 125 days fell to 343,794 at the end of March, compared with 405,938 at the beginning of the year.\n\nYet the persistent backlog, combined with the troubling job-related incidents, have drawn the ire of lawmakers. It also doesn\u2019t help that hundreds of vets were exposed to Hepatitis B and C at a VA facility in Dayton, Ohio, adjacent to Boehner\u2019s congressional district.\n\n\u201cWhile this was under investigation, the director of the hospital received a five-figure bonus, and then he was promoted,\u201d Boehner said on Thursday at a press conference on Capitol Hill. \u201cYou know, I thought I\u2019d seen the worst of government, but this goes beyond the pale. If you\u2019re presiding over a bureaucracy that\u2019s failing our veterans, you shouldn\u2019t be receiving bonuses. You should be gone.\u201d\n\nThe Senior Executives Association, a group that advocates for career federal officials, sees things differently.\n\nRelated: Spies Like Us: The NSA Is Intrusive and Incompetent\n\n\u201cThis legislation [from Boehner] does not achieve the goal of accountability and instead is a quick fix sound-bite that does not address the very real issues of backlogs and access to care,\u201d Carol Bonosaro, president of the group, said in a statement. The group added that there\u2019s already an established method for removing senior officials, and that last year the VA dismissed several executives.\n\nRep. Jeff Miller (R-FL), chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, introduced the measure on Feb. 11. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki has not requested the authority detailed in Miller\u2019s bill.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "House Republicans are moving forward with a bill that would make it easier to fire or demote senior executives at the Department of Veterans Affairs following a string of reports detailing drunk driving and sexting that didn\u2019t result in dismissals or even disciplinary action.", "title": "Sexting and Drunk Driving Lead to Job Security at VA", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/06/Sexting-and-Drunk-Driving-Lead-Job-Security-VA", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04042014_Veterans_Affairs.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/06/Sexting-and-Drunk-Driving-Lead-Job-Security-VA", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04042014_Veterans_Affairs.png", "creator": "@timothyrhoman", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "House Republicans are moving forward with a bill that would make it easier to fire or demote senior executives at the Department of Veterans Affairs following a string of reports detailing drunk driving and sexting that didn\u2019t result in dismissals or even disciplinary action.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfce5\"", "article_summary": "It also doesn\u2019t help that hundreds of vets were exposed to Hepatitis B and C at a VA facility in Dayton, Ohio, adjacent to Boehner\u2019s congressional district.\nThe group added that there\u2019s already an established method for removing senior officials, and that last year the VA dismissed several executives.\nA separate account showed that the VA rehired a former employee, Jed Fillingim, who had resigned from his previous post following a drunk-driving incident that resulted in the death of a colleague.\nAn investigation by NBC4 News in Washington discovered Fillingim was rehired at a VA facility in Georgia despite an ongoing federal investigation into his misconduct.\nInstead, the government workers in question have been promoted or rehired, and their supervisors have not faced disciplinary action."}
