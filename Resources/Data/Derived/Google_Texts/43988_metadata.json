Chief executives since Ulysses S. Grant have made the trek for the fresh ocean air and wide open wetlands and woods.\n\nThis weekend, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton will arrive for a visit that may include a get-together with the Obamas. She'll likely attend the birthday party of Democratic elder Vernon Jordan, and is expected to appear at a fundraiser at a wealthy supporter's compound in Edgartown.\n\nThe Secret Service long ago figured out how to secure the traveling White House amid the writers, artists and other celebrities, as well as thousands of non-famous people, who own or rent summer homes here. The island's population swells from 15,000 in the winter to more than 100,000 in August.\n\nPresident Clinton loved the pastoral views, long Atlantic beaches and ice cream shops - where he stood in line with other customers - so much that he came every summer of his presidency but one. Now on his sixth summer visit, Obama may well match that record.\n\n\u201cIf the motorcade is going by I\u2019ll stop and watch,\u201d said Thomas Dresser, a year-round resident and author of several books about the Vineyard. \u201cBut we\u2019re not racing down the street every time we hear he\u2019s headed to the golf course.\u201d\n\nSince arriving by helicopter last weekend, Obama's schedule has included a familiar mix of mornings with his family and afternoons on one of the island's golf courses with his buddies, including summer resident and comic Larry David.\n\nIt's easy to stay connected to Washington at the spacious beachfront compound the Obamas have rented on the island's north shore, which faces the placid Vineyard Sound and not the unruly Atlantic.\n\nNational Security Advisor Susan Rice is here to brief him on Syria, Iraq and elsewhere, while deputy chief of staff Anita Decker Breckenridge keeps him up to speed on White House efforts to win support for his nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nA series of TV and radio interviews taped just before he left Washington, along with a letter to the editor in the New York Times about the Voting Rights Act, have kept up a light presidential presence on the news. But barring a sudden crisis, the White House warned weeks ago that Obama planned no public events during his holiday.\n\nIt\u2019s the remote nature of the Vineyard \u2013 most people come on a 45-minute ferry from Cape Cod or by air \u2013 that has drawn presidents over the years.\n\nGrant learned of it during the Civil War, when two Vineyard ferries were conscripted into the Union Navy. Years later, in 1874, he came as president and stayed in a rustic cottage in the Methodist Wesleyan Grove Campground. The gingerbread cottages still draw tourists to Oak Bluffs, one of six towns on the island.\n\nGrant \"put the Vineyard on the map, and it became a place where tourists would go,\u201d said Dresser, author of \u201cMartha\u2019s Vineyard, a History\u201d and a local historian. \u201cHaving the president choose the place kind of drew the national attention, just as it does today.\u201d\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt headed here in August 1941, telling reporters he needed to get away from the heat in Washington.\n\nInstead he sneaked off the presidential yacht and onto a Navy heavy cruiser, the Augusta, in the waters off Menemsha, one of the six Vineyard towns, and sailed in secret to Newfoundland, Canada, to meet British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who arrived on his own warship\n\nIt was at that summit, even before the Pearl Harbor attacks brought the U.S. into the war, when they forged the principles of the Atlantic Charter, a policy statement that set Allied goals for the postwar world.\n\nAlthough President Kennedy maintained a family compound in Hyannis, across the sound on Cape Cod, he liked to sail near the Vineyard. His widow, Jacqueline Kennedy, later bought a remote 377-acre property along the windswept Atlantic dunes along Moshup's Trail, in the westernmost part of the island.\n\nHer daughter, Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, has put several parcels of the property up for sale, but has kept most of the pristine property from development.\n\nSince then, the Vineyard has mostly drawn Democratic presidents, not a great surprise since Massachusetts remains among the most reliably blue of states in presidential elections.\n\nRonald Reagan preferred chopping wood at his ranch in the mountains north of Santa Barbara. George H.W. Bush raced speedboats at his family compound on the rugged, rocky coast in Kennebunkport, Maine.\n\nHis son, George W. Bush, preferred the wilting heat of his ranch in Crawford, Texas. \"Most Americans don't sit in Martha's Vineyard, swilling white wine,\" he famously said there in 2002.\n\nThat appeared a jab at the Clintons, who had revived Martha\u2019s Vineyard as a presidential retreat. The president enjoyed sitting in with musical bands, visiting the yearly agricultural fair and browsing the bookstores.\n\n\u201cIt became sort of blas\u00e9,\u201d said Dresser. \u201cYou would say, \u2018Okay, here comes the president walking down the street. Again.\u2019 It became more or less common.\u201d\n\nObama is the beneficiary of that familiarity. Close advisors say he appreciates the chance to blend in, at least a little. But compared to Clinton, he spends little time in public.\n\nThe Obamas stay on a Chilmark property large enough that they don\u2019t have to leave it to go biking and hiking.\n\nThey stayed one summer at a compound that faces the Atlantic, but changed locales after neighbors complained about a five-mile detour the Secret Service imposed on local traffic while they were there. They spent the first few years at another property, but it was sold and the new owner took it off the rental market.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Summer White House no big deal on Martha's Vineyard", "Description": "President Obama\u2019s motorcade snaked through the woods here the other night, past open fields of Queen Anne\u2019s lace and a lone doe, but none of the crowds that usually gather for presidential visits to small towns.
