MANCHESTER, N.H. — A group supporting Gov. Chris Christie 2016 Republican rival U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio is set to air a scathing ad in New Hampshire that slams the New Jersey governor for a perceived cozy relationship with President Obama.

The Rubio super PAC ad criticizes Christie for supporting Common Core and expanding Medicaid in New Jersey — two lightening rod issues among conservative Republican voters.

"One high tax, Common Core, liberal energy loving, Obamacare Medicaid expanding president is enough," the narrator says while images of Christie and Obama meeting in the wake of Hurricane Sandy flash on screen.

Christie's "embrace" of Obama and his kind words for the president in the aftermath of Sandy have dogged the governor as he runs for the Republican nomination. As a candidate, Christie has blasted the Democratic president over everything from foreign policy to gun control.

The governor criticized Rubio in New Hampshire last month for missing votes on the Senate floor, accusing the rival of not showing up for work. The comment spurred Rubio to criticize Christie for spending too much time on the road and not focusing on his job as governor.

Christie responded to the latest Rubio attack by using the senator's own words during a recent Republican debate against him.

"I just wonder what happened to the Marco who so indignantly looked at Jeb Bush and said 'I guess someone must have convinced you that going negative against me helps you,'" Christie said on Bloomberg TV's "With All Due Respect."

"I guess that same person must now have convinced Marco that going negative against Chris Christie is what he needs to do," Christie said.

Both White House hopefuls are currently battling for votes from the establishment wing of the party.

The ad is slated to run in New Hampshire TV markets beginning Tuesday.
