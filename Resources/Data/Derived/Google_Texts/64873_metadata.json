The idea was a simple one: By enrolling more people in the program and stressing preventive care, officials hoped to head off more expensive medical bills down the line.\n\n\"We are not backing down,\" then-Gov. Pat Quinn said in 2012 when the Supreme Court affirmed a voluntary state expansion. And 13 months later, he signed the bill into law.\n\nStarting in 2017, Illinois and other states that also expanded their programs are required to start paying a small portion of the bill, rising to no more than 10 percent of the total tab. State health officials estimated in 2012 that Illinois' portion of the expansion would cost $573 million from 2017 through 2020.\n\nBut far more people signed up in 2014, the expansion's first year, than the state expected. Based on multiple interviews and a Tribune analysis of government data, Illinois will pay at least $907 million from 2017 through 2020 because of those new members. The tab could surge even higher, though.\n\nA document sent by Quinn's office to the federal government over the summer significantly raised the per-person estimated cost, bumping the state's total outlay to $2 billion, using 2014 enrollment numbers, more than three times the original estimate.\n\nIllinois has budgeted about $20 billion in 2015 for its Medicaid program. About half of that will be reimbursed with federal funds, officials said.\n\nHow an economically struggling state will pay for the bigger tab is now a question for Gov. Bruce Rauner. The newly installed Republican governor declined to comment on the Tribune's analysis. But in a meeting last year with the Tribune Editorial Board, he said he didn't think the full federal funding for the expansion would \"last.\"\n\n\"That's going to end in a couple of years and when that ends, we're going to look at each other and go, \"Oh my goodness. What happens now?'\" Rauner said at the time. \"And we could blow a hole in our budget that could maybe dwarf our pension problem. So we got to get on it now, be proactive. I don't know today what can be rolled back and what can be modified.\"\n\nQuinn could not be reached for comment on the higher per-person estimate. A co-sponsor of the Illinois legislation, Sen. Heather Steans, D-Chicago, said language in the Illinois law specifies that the expansion would end should the federal contribution drop below 90 percent.\n\nOriginal projections anticipated that 199,000 residents would sign up in 2014, potentially rising to no more than 342,000. State officials estimated a monthly, per person cost of $454, and revised that number upward to $882 in the document sent to in June to federal officials.\n\nBut through December, 540,877 joined Medicaid's ranks. State officials said thousands more likely signed up through January.\n\n\"That surprised us,\" Jim Parker, Department of Healthcare and Family Services deputy administrator, said of the pace of new enrollees. \"Was it there were just more uninsured people out there than we thought? Or was the take up faster than we thought? ... We think both of those things are true. There were more uninsured than all of the studies projected, but also people are signing up faster than we thought they might.\"\n\nOne free market group said Illinois could have underestimated the number of people who would sign up for Medicaid because some dropped their private health insurance when they became eligible for Medicaid under the expansion.\n\n\"We can't quantify how much that's happening, but we know that it's happening,\" said Nic Horton, policy impact specialist with the Foundation for Government Accountability, which has lobbied against Obamacare's state Medicaid expansions.\n\nBefore the Medicaid expansion, only children, parents, the disabled and elderly were eligible for coverage. The expansion added childless adults and set the eligible income limit at $16,105 for an individual or $32,913 for a family of four.\n\nNationwide, at least 9.7 million people have gained coverage through the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion.\n\nSome states that expanded eligibility for their Medicaid programs, such as Arkansas, are talking about making changes.\n\nThe Arkansas Senate voted last week to keep its Medicaid expansion through mid-2016, but formed a task force to look at alternatives after that. And though New Hampshire Republicans helped craft a compromise expansion plan in their state, some now want to repeal it.\n\nLast week, Indiana became the 28th state to agree to expand Medicaid, and the latest state with a Republican governor to do so, extending coverage to about 350,000 uninsured residents.\n\nThe basic level for those below 100 percent of the federal poverty level in Indiana does not require payments from enrollees. But they are required to make co-pays for all services. And a second tier of improved coverage is available if enrollees pay a monthly fee ranging from $1 to $25 into a health savings account.\n\nThose who fail to make payments would face penalties that include mandatory co-payments for services and loss of coverage.\n\nRep. Sara Feigenholtz, D-Chicago, who also sponsored the Medicaid expansion bill in Illinois, said the expansion eliminated a prejudice in the system: A diabetic with a child got coverage, for instance, but a diabetic without a child, did not.\n\n\"This is a system change. It's a philosophical change,\" Feigenholtz said. \"Before we expanded health care to poor people who were childless adults, we paid for their health care in other parts of the state budget, in grants and other types of payments that we got no match for.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed.\n\nehirst@tribpub.com\n\nTwitter @ellenjeanhirst", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Illinois Medicaid expansion could carry hefty price", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "One thing is clear with respect to Medicaid expansion in Illinois: It will cost more than anticipated.", "title": "Illinois Medicaid expansion could carry hefty price", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-medicaid-expansion-cost-0203-biz-20150202-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54d016c5/turbine/ct-medicaid-expansion-cost-0203-biz-20150202", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp04.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Medicaid expansion, Medicaid cost, Illinois Medicaid, Medicaid debt, Medicaid spending, Obamacare", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/82702886", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-02-03", "Description": "With more Medicaid enrollees than anticipated, Illinois' cost could top $2 billion leaving officials wondering how the state will cover the cost.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Medicaid expansion, Medicaid cost, Illinois Medicaid, Medicaid debt, Medicaid spending, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd84d5\"", "article_summary": "One thing is clear with respect to Medicaid expansion in Illinois: It will cost more than anticipated.\nState health officials estimated in 2012 that Illinois' portion of the expansion would cost $573 million from 2017 through 2020.\nThe Arkansas Senate voted last week to keep its Medicaid expansion through mid-2016, but formed a task force to look at alternatives after that.\nPat Quinn said in 2012 when the Supreme Court affirmed a voluntary state expansion.\nNationwide, at least 9.7 million people have gained coverage through the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion."}
