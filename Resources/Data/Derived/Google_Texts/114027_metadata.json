It is obvious that Robertson is going for laughs. That doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t trying to make a point (his wife was 16 when they married) but there is no question he is performing and exaggerating to entertain a crowd that is entertained.\n\nGood heavens, it is so controversial that a happily married and successful man would suggest others follow his same path!\n\nGlaringly missing from that CNN report is Robertson adding \u201cCheck with Mom and Dad about that, of course.\u201d \u201cThat\u201d being marrying as a teenager.\n\nAnother fact CNN leaves out of its hit-piece is that with parental permission, in more than ten states, teenagers as young as 15 can marry.\n\nIn the media capitol of the world, New York, teenagers as young as 14 can marry.\n\nIn the state of Georgia, where CNN is headquartered, teenagers can marry at 16.\n\nIf Phil Robertson were a leftist woman using similar humor to make the same point about marrying men, CNN would hail her as an edgy genius saying something \u201cworth talking about.\u201d\n\nThe religious cultural bigotry CNN and others in the elite media have displayed throughout this entire \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d non-troversy has been breathtaking. But when you are an ignorant, narrow-minded provincial whose only experience in the American South is an overnight stay with the rest of the elite media at a Holiday Inn a few blocks from a presidential campaign speech, this is what you get.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Duck Hunt: CNN Fabricates New Phil Robertson Controversy", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Duck Hunt: CNN Fabricates New Phil Robertson Controversy", "title": "Duck Hunt: CNN Fabricates New Phil Robertson Controversy - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2013/12/27/phil-robertson-face-paint-a-e.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2014/01/02/duck-hunt-cnn-fabricates-new-phil-robertson-controversy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Duck Hunt: CNN Fabricates New Phil Robertson Controversy", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2013/12/27/phil-robertson-face-paint-a-e.jpg", "title": "Duck Hunt: CNN Fabricates New Phil Robertson Controversy - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "CNN, MSNBC, Twitter,Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-01-02T10:25:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde642\"", "article_summary": "Glaringly missing from that CNN report is Robertson adding \u201cCheck with Mom and Dad about that, of course.\u201d \u201cThat\u201d being marrying as a teenager.\nThe CNN report below, covering Robertson\u2019s humorous relaying of marriage advice, is taken ultra-seriously by the CNN correspondent, and asks, \u201cWhat is the tipping point to getting kicked off the air?\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u2014\u2014Does CNN not hear the crowd laughing?\nAnother fact CNN leaves out of its hit-piece is that with parental permission, in more than ten states, teenagers as young as 15 can marry.\nIn the state of Georgia, where CNN is headquartered, teenagers can marry at 16.\nIn the media capitol of the world, New York, teenagers as young as 14 can marry."}
