The \u201cInternational Tax Competitiveness Index\u201d by Kyle Pomerleau and Andrew Lundeen found that \u201cthe United States has the 32nd most competitive tax system out of the 34 OECD member countries.\u201d In other words, the United States is a bad place to invest from a tax perspective.\n\nFactors behind America\u2019s poor score include \u201cthe highest corporate tax rate in the developed world\u201d and the fact that we are \u201cone of the six remaining countries in the OECD with a worldwide system of taxation.\u201d\n\nAnother cause of our poor score is our high property taxes. Many U.S. jurisdictions impose property taxes not just on land and buildings, but also on business machinery and equipment. These taxes are a strong deterrent to capital investment, and they should be repealed. U.S. state and local governments collect a huge $242 billion a year in business property taxes, according to E&Y.\n\nIn an upcoming Fiscal Report Card on America\u2019s Governors, Nicole Kaeding and I mention efforts to cut property taxes on business equipment, including reforms in Indiana and Michigan. I suspect one reason for Detroit\u2019s economic demise has been its very high property tax burden.\n\nUsing Tax Foundation data, the chart shows property taxes as a percent of gross domestic product for the 34 OECD countries.\n\nRyan Ellis highlights some more of the Tax Foundation results here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The United States is a bad place to invest from a tax perspective.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "The United States is a bad place to invest from a tax perspective.", "title": "Cutting Business Property Taxes to Improve Competitiveness", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/cutting-business-property-taxes-improve-competitiveness", "image": "http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/wp-content/uploads/prop_tax.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/cutting-business-property-taxes-improve-competitiveness", "title": "Cutting Business Property Taxes to Improve Competitiveness", "description": "The United States is a bad place to invest from a tax perspective.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2014/9/16", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-17T08:50:14-04:00"}, "publication_date": "2014/9/17", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "U.S. state and local governments collect a huge $242 billion a year in business property taxes, according to E&Y.\nMany U.S. jurisdictions impose property taxes not just on land and buildings, but also on business machinery and equipment.\nUsing Tax Foundation data, the chart shows property taxes as a percent of gross domestic product for the 34 OECD countries.\nIn an upcoming Fiscal Report Card on America\u2019s Governors, Nicole Kaeding and I mention efforts to cut property taxes on business equipment, including reforms in Indiana and Michigan.\nI suspect one reason for Detroit\u2019s economic demise has been its very high property tax burden."}
