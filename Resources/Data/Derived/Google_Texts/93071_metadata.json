An estimated \u00a37 billion has been spent on the tournament, and a national holiday was declared to mark the opening. But for employers that are indigenous to or operate in Brazil, what are their legal obligations to their workers?\n\nXpertHR\u2019s guide to employment law in Brazil gives a full breakdown, including these 10 interesting facts:\n\n1. Employing foreign nationals\n\nOrganisations with three or more employees that employ foreign nationals must ensure that at least two-thirds of their workforce is Brazilian. Foreign nationals require a visa to work in Brazil.\n\n2. Be aware of quotas\n\nEmployers with 100 or more employees are required to employ a minimum quota of employees with disabilities or who have undergone rehabilitation by the social security authorities.\n\n3. \u201c13th month payment\u201d\n\nEvery year, employees are entitled to be paid a \u201c13th month\u201d of salary by their employer. This is also known as the Christmas bonus and is paid in two instalments.\n\n4. No annual leave without 12 months\u2019 service\n\nStaff are not able to take paid annual leave until they have completed 12 months\u2019 service with their employer. They are only able to take \u201ccollective\u201d holidays (where an employer imposes holiday that all employees must take at the same time).\n\n5. Redundancy doesn\u2019t exist\n\nThere is no legal concept or definition of redundancy in Brazil. An employee who is dismissed due to the employer\u2019s financial difficulties, insufficient work or a company restructuring would face a \u201cdismissal without cause\u201d, and this entitles him or her to a notice period and severance package.\n\n6. Use of agency workers is limited\n\nEmployers can only use temporary agency workers in certain circumstances \u2013 where they need to meet an exceptional increase in workload or cover employees who are absent. Temporary work agencies must be registered with the Ministry of Labour and Employment to be able to employ workers and assign them temporarily to \u201cuser\u201d companies.\n\n7. Positive action is permitted in certain circumstances\n\nBrazilian employment law permits, although does not require, organisations to adopt temporary \u201cpositive action\u201d measures aimed at establishing equality between women and men. They are allowed to launch initiatives to correct \u201cdistortions\u201d that affect women\u2019s access to employment, working conditions and training.\n\n8. Employer contributions\n\nAll employees have an account with the national Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Servi\u00e7o (Service Guarantee Fund), into which their employer must pay the equivalent of 8% of the employee\u2019s pay per month. Employees are entitled to withdraw the balance as a severance payment in certain circumstances.\n\n9. Contracts can be terminated at any time\n\nAn employer or employee can generally terminate a contract at any time without any particular reason, providing proper notice is given. There are protections for those in certain circumstances, such as pregnancy or maternity.\n\n10. No obligation to inform or consult\n\nThere is no general statutory obligation to inform and consult employees or their representatives. Trade unions do not have a general right to be informed and consulted, for example on collective redundancies or business transfers. If they are, this entitlement will be based only on collective agreements.", "article_metadata": {"gwa_Account": "rbiuk-personneltoday, rbiuk-hrmarket", "gwa_contentType": "article|free", "gwa_authStatus": "logged out", "gwa_siteSection1": "news", "generator": "WooFramework 5.5.5", "og": {"site_name": "Personnel Today", "description": "The World Cup got underway last Thursday with a colourful opening ceremony in Sao Paolo.
