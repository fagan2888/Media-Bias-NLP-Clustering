REUTERS/Enrique De La Osa\n\n4507623\n\nIn public remarks made on Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan claimed he helped advise President Barack Obama on the creation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nErdo\u011fan, speaking at the opening of a health complex, told a story about meeting a group of tourists in Istanbul who were impressed by the Turkish medical system\u2019s effectiveness. According to Hurriyet Daily News, he said some of the tourists \u201cknew that I would be visiting the United States the following week. They asked me how we could be so successful in healthcare and wanted me to tell about it to Obama.\u201d\n\nThe president blamed a \u201cnegative reflex\u201d in America for Obamacare\u2019s failure, saying that as a result Obama \u201ccould only solve the problem partly.\u201d\n\nHe also claimed that European leaders have visited Turkey in attempts to replicate the magic of the country\u2019s health system: \u201cthey try to take us as a model and build similar systems in their country.\u201d\n\nErdo\u011fan was previously prime minister of Turkey, a post he held from 2003 to 2014. His terms as prime minister included a series of health care policy reforms under his Islamist-leaning AKP party. The overhauls included an expansion of the private health market as an alternative to the country\u2019s existing state-funded medical system.\n\nNevertheless, the Ministry of Health continues to dominate the medical market in Turkey. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development which tracks economic progress in countries including Turkey, has said the country \u201chas a significant way to travel to deliver high-quality health services to its population.\u201d\n\nSince entering Turkish national politics, Erdo\u011fan has developed something of a reputation for egotism. A proud champion of Turkey\u2019s past as seat of the Ottoman empire, he recently welcomed visitors to his lavish new 1,150-room palace with a phalanx of guards in elaborate historical costume, leading one columnist to ask, \u201cIs Erdogan losing touch with reality?\u201d\n\nAnd earlier this month, in an instance of self-fulfilling prophecy, a student received a 14-month jail sentence for calling Erdo\u011fan a \u201cdictator.\u201d\n\nFollow Ivan Plis on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
