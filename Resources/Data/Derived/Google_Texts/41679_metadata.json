And they\u2019re going to vet him and vet him and vet him and we\u2019ll see where it comes out.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump uses grandiose language with a bellicose bearing and he promises much in broad, general terms. But on this week\u2019s Sunday shows, there seemed to be an urge from some hosts and guests to seek more specifics on policy from Mr. Trump and to get him to follow through on promises.\n\nFor instance: On ABC\u2019s This Week, host George Stephanopoulos reminded Mr. Trump that he\u2019s been promising to make public his tax returns for many weeks. In that the right-wing and Republican-leaning Wall Street Journal editorial page urged their release before Super Tuesday on March 1, doesn\u2019t Mr. Trump owe it to the public to release them by then?\n\n\u201cWell, well, first, no, I won\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNo, no, no. I won\u2019t. I\u2019m working on them. We\u2019re working on them. They\u2019re massive.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump went on to denounce The Journal in general.\n\n\u201cI have no respect whatsoever for The Wall Street Journal,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they know what they are doing. They have taken me on so much. It\u2019s so ridiculous. Every day, editorials, bad editorials . . . I don\u2019t even want to read it anymore.\u201d\n\n\u2018He is now the face of the Republican Party \u2026they have made their bed. They\u2019ve got to lie in it.\u2019\n\nIn South Carolina, Mr. Trump (33 percent) finished ahead of Florida Senator Marco Rubio (22 percent) and Texas Senator Ted Cruz (22 percent). The other three were in single digits. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush quit the race but Ohio Governor John Kasich and retired surgeon Dr. Ben Carson remain for now.\n\nOn most of the shows, the conversation turned to the idea that Republicans must consolidate around one candidate to deny Mr. Trump their nomination. One was Sara Fagan, a Republican strategist, who told Mr. Stephanopulos:\n\n\u201cHow do we get folks out of this race so somebody can accumulate enough delegates at a convention to beat him? You\u2019ve not seen much money spent against him to date. And what\u2019s more, the challenge is we\u2019ve not been able to get behind an alternative. Unless we cull the field to one alternative, Donald Trump may not be stopped.\u201d\n\nThis seemed to delight Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan and a Democrat who supports Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.\n\nMs. Clinton, the leading Democratic candidate, beat Bernie Sanders Saturday night at the Nevada caucuses. They face off Saturday in South Carolina.\n\n\u201cOnly four percent of the Republican super PAC money has been spent attacking Donald Trump,\u201d Ms. Granholm said. \u201cDonald Trump being anti-Mexican, anti-Muslim, anti-women, anti-immigrant and anti-science. Hillary Clinton is putting together this coalition that looks like America. It will be an incredible contrast. He is now the face of the Republican Party \u2026they have made their bed. They\u2019ve got to lie in it.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2014no longer just phoning it in\u2014met by remote video with most of the shows, as did most other candidates. Ms. Clinton visited only Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s State of the Union and spoke in pleasant generalities about the liberal and progressive agenda that sounded poll-tested and scripted.\n\nBut there was a moment of what sounded like candor in a discussion about surveys that show low public trust for her.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an underlying question that may be the reality in the back of people\u2019s mind and that is, you know, \u2018Is she in it for us or is she in it for herself?\u2019\u201d Ms. Clinton said. \u201cI know I have to make my case.\u201d\n\nOn a tamer-than-usual Face the Nation on CBS, Mr. Rubio spoke with host John Dickerson of Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cAnyone can go over the top and say things that sound strong,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cBut sounding strong is not enough. You have to know exactly how you\u2019re going to do it. His views on Vladimir Putin are troubling. I don\u2019t think he fundamentally understands who Vladimir Putin is and what he is trying to do.\u201d\n\n\u2018I can act as presidential as anybody that\u2019s ever been president\u2014other than the great Abraham Lincoln.\u2019\n\nAlso on Face the Nation, Reittan Salam of The National Review said Mr. Rubio could make a blue-collar pitch against Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cLook, this guy is a plutocrat charlatan and I have a real agenda for working families,\u201d Mr. Salam said. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he talking about it?\u201d\n\nWithout offering alternatives, Mr. Trump said he would abolish Obamacare and provide better care more cheaply. Mr. Trump saying he would not let people die on the sidewalks and the streets. He seemed unaware that Medicaid is used by people like this and he cited no numbers of dead people in the streets.\n\nBecause Mr. Trump knows how to divert the conversation so quickly, here was little talk about last week, when he exchanged insults with the Pope and insulted former Republican President George W. Bush by saying Mr. Bush and others knowingly lied to get us in the Iraq war of 2003. It was old news.\n\nThe impulse to investigate Mr. Trump was heard at CNN on Reliable Sources when Juana Summers\u2014the public editor of Mashable\u2014said \u201cI think the media are going to take him so much more seriously . . . What exactly has his business been like?\u201d\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Mr. Trump sounded again candid (or maybe just calculating) when he answered a Chris Wallace question about the need to \u201cact more presidential\u201d as he gets closer to that office.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWell, probably I do. I can act as presidential as anybody that\u2019s ever been president\u2014other than the great Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n\nWALLACE: \u201cWhen are you going to start?\u201d\n\nMr. Wallace and others asked Mr. Trump if he is doing a \u201chostile takeover\u201d of the GOP. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m not at all.\u201d\n\nAsked again if he might consider a third-party candidacy, Mr. Trump said that this was doubtful although ominously warned that the Republican Party has not been treating him with the deference he deserves by stacking debate audiences with allies of other candidates and their donors\n\nStill on Fox, Karl Rove said that if Mr. Trump gets nominated, \u201cWe will have nominated the guy who is tied for having the worst favorable/unfavorable rating among all candidates.\u201d The other, Mr. Rove said, is Ms. Clinton.\n\nMr. Wallace once again whined that Ms. Clinton is the only candidate who will not darken that network\u2019s doorway. Fox called two Clinton flacks and \u201cNeither of them had the courtesy to answer our phone calls and emails. (Hmmmmm. Wonder why?) How dare they?\n\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Joe Lapointe", "sailthru.author": "Joe Lapointe", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/screen-shot-2016-02-22-at-8-05-42-am.png?w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/screen-shot-2016-02-22-at-8-05-42-am.png?w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "2016 elections, Ben Carson, Bernie Sanders, David Gergen, Donald Trump, George Stephanopoulos, George W.
