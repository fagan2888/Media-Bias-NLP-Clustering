They were cheering, saying [the protesters] deserved it.\u201d\n\nWhy? The officer cited anger over long hours during the course of the seven-day protest, and a widespread sense that demonstrators had violated the dignity of the profession by blocking police vehicles and demanding to search them for weapons.\n\n\u201cThey hate the protesters,\u201d the officer said.\n\nOn the streets in Mong Kok on Saturday, the police were present in greater numbers than the day before, when tensions ran highest. Still, when scuffles broke out in sections of the crowd, protesters felt it was necessary to chant, \u201cArrest Him!\u201d or \u201cShame on police!\u201d to gain the authorities\u2019 attention.\n\nThough the atmosphere was calmer on Saturday, anger and suspicion were still running hot. Throughout the day Hong Kong residents shared videos from the Friday mel\u00e9e that allegedly showed anti-occupy activists groping women or committing violence, and then being released by police without arrest.\n\nOthers lamented that one of the victims of Friday\u2019s attacks, who was taken bloodied to the hospital, was arrested for disturbing public order after his treatment, while his alleged attackers walked free.\n\nThe police, for their part, issued a statement in response to rumors that they were deliberately allowing gang members to beat and bloody students in order to clear the occupied areas. The police confirmed that eight of 19 people arrested in violence on Friday had triad connections.\n\n\u201cPolice acted swiftly,\u201d said Lai Tung-Kwok, secretary of security for the police, in the statement. \u201cThe Police officers at the scene tried their best to handle the situation under chaotic conditions and to maintain order in an impartial way. I note that some people have claimed that the government allowed triads or even worked with triads. These allegations are totally untrue, unfounded and beyond belief.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tensions are running high in the commercial district of Mong Kok after weeks of protests  VIDEO", "title": "Why Hong Kong police are \u201ccelebrating\u201d the attacks on protesters", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Tensions are running high in the commercial district of Mong Kok after weeks of protests  VIDEO", "title": "Why Hong Kong police are \u201ccelebrating\u201d the attacks on protesters", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/11/why_hong_kong_police_are_celebrating_the_attacks_on_protesters_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/AP546754975502-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tensions are running high in the commercial district of Mong Kok after weeks of protests  VIDEO", "title": "Why Hong Kong police are \u201ccelebrating\u201d the attacks on protesters", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/AP546754975502-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Benjamin Carlson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Protests, Mong Kok, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7b8\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Hong Kong, Hong Kong Protests, Mong Kok, Video, Politics NewsHONG KONG \u2014 Thousands of protesters are enraged at the police for allegedly allowing them to be attacked last night by a mob in the commercial district of Mong Kok.\nAnd though they won\u2019t say it publicly, Hong Kong\u2019s police are furious with the protesters in turn.\nThroughout the day Hong Kong residents shared videos from the Friday mel\u00e9e that allegedly showed anti-occupy activists groping women or committing violence, and then being released by police without arrest.\n\u201cThey hate the protesters,\u201d the officer said.\nI note that some people have claimed that the government allowed triads or even worked with triads."}
