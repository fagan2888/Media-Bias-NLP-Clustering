A popular German Christmas tradition wrapped up in the river city today.

The German-American society showed off the best of their heritage with the sixth annual Kristkindlmarkt.

Families came out to see Santa, listen to music or just grab a bite to eat.

Nearly 30 vendors also took part, and showed off their artwork and unique gifts.

The German-American society says they're proud to have the largest celebration in this area.

"Christmas markets in the US in the like this are done in major cities and so, we're kind of a small player right now, we're probably the closest Kristkindlmarkt within a two and a half to three hour drive,‚Äù said Jeff Pulfer of the German-American Society.

All of the money raised from this event, goes to the German-American society for future events.
