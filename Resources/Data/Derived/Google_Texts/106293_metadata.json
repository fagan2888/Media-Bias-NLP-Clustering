(Photo: File Photo)Buy Photo Story Highlights Mayor says proposed tax break for developer is too large\n\nDemocrats say agreement will avoid huge tax increase, attract developers\n\nCouncil meeting is 7:30 p.m. Tuesday\n\nRepublican Mayor Bob Fazen and the Democrats on the Borough Council are headed to a political showdown this week over how to bridge a budget gap that could raise municipal property taxes by 14 percent.\n\nThe Democrats, who hold a majority on the council, have passed an ordinance restructuring the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) agreement with the developer of the Meridia Main Station apartments that would require the developer to pay $800,000 upfront in a 30-year agreement. That amount would close the budget gap.\n\nBut Fazen has vetoed that action, saying that it concedes too much money to the developer. Fazen said the agreement with Meridia needs to be re-negotiated.\n\nThe showdown will come to a head at the council meeting at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday in Borough Hall.\n\nBut the fireworks may begin at 6 p.m. Monday when the council\u2019s finance committee will conduct an open public meeting at Borough Hall to discuss the budget gap and the PILOT proposal.\n\nThe showdown comes at a critical time for Bound Brook.\n\nBecause NJ Transit\u2019s Raritan Valley Line has a station on East Main Street, developers have started to show interest in redeveloping parts of the downtown in the hope that the commuter line will offer more one-seat rides into New York City.\n\nMunicipalities, including Somerville, along the Raritan Valley Line have been offering PILOT agreements as incentives for developers.\n\nDevelopers\u2019 interest in downtown Bound Brook has also been sparked by the completion of the long-awaited Green Brook Flood Control project.\n\nThe downtown has never fully recovered from several catastrophic floods dating to 1971. With the completion of the flood control project, developers can believe that their properties won\u2019t be washed away.\n\nAdding to the dynamics of this struggle is this year\u2019s mayoral race between Fazen and Councilman Anthony Pranzatelli, whose wife Beverly also sits on the council.\n\nIn last year\u2019s election, Bound Brook voters delivered a split partisan verdict, choosing Fazen to fill a one-year unexpired term while returning control of the council to Democrats.\n\nThose factors have set the stage for an old-fashioned power struggle in the borough known for its bare-knuckled political tactics.\n\nWhat triggered this showdown earlier this year was when officials began drafting this year\u2019s municipal budget and discovered a $1 million gap.\n\nBeverly Pranzatelli said officials managed to whittle the budget gap to $800,000, but that would cause a 14 percent increase in municipal taxes.\n\nBound Brook, with a total tax rate of $3.42 per $100 of assessed value, has the highest property tax rate in Somerset County. Its school tax rate, $1.97 per $100 of assessed value, and municipal tax rate, $1.08 per $100 of assessed value, are also the highest in the county.\n\nAs officials pondered how to avoid the tax hike, Meridia came to the borough with a proposal to restructure its existing PILOT agreement.\n\nBecause the developer was seeking a 30-year mortgage to complete the apartment project, a bank was now requesting a revised PILOT agreement lasting the term of the mortgage.\n\nTo sweeten the pot, Meridia offered to pay $800,000 up front, which would have wiped away the budget gap.\n\nBut Fazen objected, saying that in the long run, the borough would lose money because the revised PILOT numbers in later years of the agreement would be lower because of the larger initial payment.\n\nThe mayor also said that the $800,000 would solve only this year\u2019s budget gap, but not close a possible budget gap in 2016 and only delay the large tax increase.\n\nFazen has also contended that the PILOT agreement is too generous to Meridia, whose property tax bill is calculated by the amount of rents collected.\n\nBut the Democrats say that Meridia needs the revised agreement because it has also shown interest in building another apartment house on Main Street near the train station.\n\nThe Democrats also say that the borough has to be aggressive in drafting PILOT proposals because all towns along the Raritan Valley Line are competing for developers.\n\n\u201cWithout the PILOT we will have nothing,\u201d Beverly Pranzatelli said.\n\nAn override of Fazen\u2019s veto requires four votes. Democrats have a 4-2 margin on the council.\n\nBut Beverly Pranzatelli said she suspects the Republicans will try to disqualify she and her husband from voting because her husband\u2019s Main Street business is near where Meridia wants to build its second apartment building and their votes would be a conflict of interest.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1Iw0u9x", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Republican Mayor Bob Fazen and the Democrats on the borough council are headed to a political showdown this week over how to bridge a budget gap that could raise municipal property taxes by 14 percent.
