She didn\u2019t disclose the name of the firm, but she told me that it wasn\u2019t Twitter.\n\nAt a meeting with students at Fudan University in Shanghai a few days earlier, I was struck by how anxious some of the Chinese students were about the question: \u201cAm I going to have a job?\u201d If you\u2019re a software engineer in China, you\u2019ll do fine, also a factory worker \u2014 but a plain-old college grad? The Times reported earlier this year that in China today \u201camong people in their early 20s, those with a college degree were four times as likely to be unemployed as those with only an elementary school education.\u201d\n\nStories like these explain why I really hope that Obamacare succeeds. Say what?\n\nHere\u2019s the logic: The Cold War era I grew up in was a world of insulated walls, both geopolitical and economic, so the pace of change was slower \u2014 you could work for the same company for 30 years \u2014 and because bosses had fewer alternatives, unions had greater leverage. The result was a middle class built on something called a high-wage or a decent-wage medium-skilled job, and the benefits that went with it.\n\nThe proliferation of such jobs meant that many people could lead a middle-class lifestyle \u2014 with less education and more security \u2014 because they didn\u2019t have to compete so directly with either a computer or a machine that could do their jobs faster and better (by far the biggest source of job churn) or against an Indian or Chinese who would do their jobs cheaper. And by a middle-class lifestyle, I don\u2019t mean just scraping by. I mean having status: enough money to buy a house, enjoy some leisure and offer your kids the opportunity to do better than you.\n\nBut thanks to the merger of globalization and the I.T. revolution that has unfolded over the last two decades \u2014 which is rapidly and radically transforming how knowledge and information are generated, disseminated and collaborated on to create value \u2014 \u201cthe high-wage, medium-skilled job is over,\u201d says Stefanie Sanford, the chief of global policy and advocacy for the College Board. The only high-wage jobs that will support the kind of middle-class lifestyle of old will be high-skilled ones, requiring a commitment to rigorous education, adaptability and innovation, she added.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut will even this prescription for creating enough jobs with decent middle-class incomes suffice, asks James Manyika, who leads research on economic and technology trends at the McKinsey Global Institute. While these prescriptions are certainly \u201ccorrect,\u201d notes Manyika, they \u201cmay not be enough to solve for the scale and nature of the problem.\u201d The pace of technologically driven productivity growth, he said, suggests that we may not need as many workers to drive equivalent levels of output and G.D.P.\n\nAs the M.I.T. economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee show in their book \u201cRace Against the Machine,\u201d for the last two centuries productivity, median income and employment all rose together. No longer. Now we have record productivity, wealth and innovation, yet median incomes are falling, inequality is rising and high unemployment remains persistent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo be sure, notes Manyika, a similar thing happened when we introduced technology to agriculture. We did not need as many people to produce food, so everybody shifted to manufacturing. As the same thing happened there, many people shifted to services.\n\nBut now, adds Manyika, \u201ca growing share of high-paying services and knowledge work is also falling prey to technology.\u201d And while new companies like Twitter are exciting, they do not employ people with high-paying jobs in large numbers. The economy and the service sector will still offer large numbers of jobs, but many simply may not sustain a true middle-class lifestyle.\n\nAs a result, argues Manyika, how we think about \u201cemployment\u201d to sustain a middle-class lifestyle may need to expand \u201cto include a broader set of possibilities for generating income\u201d compared with the traditional job, with benefits and a well-grooved career path. To be in the middle class, you may need to consider not only high-skilled jobs, \u201cbut also more nontraditional forms of work,\u201d explained Manyika. Work itself may have to be thought of as \u201ca form of entrepreneurship\u201d where you draw on all kinds of assets and skills to generate income.\n\nThis could mean leveraging your skills through Task Rabbit, or your car through Uber, or your spare bedroom through AirBnB to add up to a middle-class income.\n\nIn the end, this transition we\u2019re going through could prove more exciting than people think, but right now asking large numbers of people to go from being an \u201cemployee\u201d to a \u201cwork entrepreneur\u201d feels scary and uncertain. Having a national health care safety net under the vast majority of Americans \u2014 to ease and enable people to make this transition \u2014 is both morally right and in the interest of everyone who wants a stable society.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20131109153009, "twitter": {"description": "In a world where middle-class work is in transition, we need a strong health care safety net.", "creator": "tomfriedman", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/friedman-why-i-still-support-obamacare.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002543523"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Why I (Still) Support Obamacare", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/friedman-circular/friedman-circular-thumbLarge.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/friedman-why-i-still-support-obamacare.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002543523", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/friedman-why-i-still-support-obamacare.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "hdl_p": "Why I (Still) Support Obamacare", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 9, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Labor and Jobs,Income Inequality,Entrepreneurship,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Freelancing  Self-Employment and Independent Contracting", "description": "In a world where middle-class work is in transition, we need a strong health care safety net.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Thomas L.
