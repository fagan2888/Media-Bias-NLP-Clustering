Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s flailing campaign.\n\nThat and immigration reform.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret to the former Maryland governor\u2019s supporters or campaign that he extended in-state tuition to undocumented students and advocated for driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented people \u2014 or \u201cNew Americans,\u201d as he refers to them. But with low poll numbers \u2014 and low cash \u2014 the task of proclaiming O\u2019Malley\u2019s immigration plan is a tedious and meticulous one.\n\nGabriela Domenzain, senior advisor to O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign, told TheBlaze in an interview at the conclusion of a several day tour of Iowa, that the campaign\u2019s plan to promote the governor\u2019s record and policy positions was a simple one \u2014 meet with as many people as possible and reiterate the message over and over again without straying from his views.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only person who actually has a record of results on immigration. So as governor and mayor he implemented the most pro-immigrant, pro-New American policies,\u201d Domenzain said. \u201cReally he\u2019s been at the forefront of this issue from the beginning,.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Maryland he\u2019s known as the Latino governor. So over the course of this race, he\u2019s been leading on immigration precisely because it\u2019s one of the biggest contrasts he has between Sen. [Bernie] Sanders and Secretary [Hillary] Clinton but it\u2019s also one of the really clear examples that the governor can actually get things done,\u201d she continued.\n\nAnd while that dig at O\u2019Malley\u2019s Democratic presidential opponents seemed subtle, the campaign\u2019s rhetoric has been peppered with them \u2014 especially when it comes to Clinton.\n\n\u201cI stand before you today as the only candidate in this race of the three of us seeking the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination who can actually point to a record of actions, not just words, but actions of actually getting things done,\u201d O\u2019Malley said at a rally last week.\n\nAnd again during Saturday\u2019s Democratic debate, O\u2019Malley offered pointed distinctions between himself and the other candidates on gun legislation, the Islamic State and immigration. He drew staunch objections from the other two when he made the claim that the Islamic State encourages its supporters to buy guns at American gun shows as \u201dit\u2019s because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s on immigration that the O\u2019Malley camp seems to draw the sharpest contrasts.\n\n\u201cYou have Secretary Clinton who has been all over the place on this issue,\u201d Domenzain emphatically told TheBlaze over the weekend. \u201cSo when she goes up to New Hampshire and somebody asks her what she is going to do about illegal immigrants, she responds and says she\u2019s happy and proud that she\u2019s voted time and time again for more money on the border to keep illegal immigrants out. But when she goes to Arizona and it comes to a predominantly Latino audience she talks, extols the virtues of undocumented immigrants who are the heart and soul of the country. She says one thing to one audience and another to another. That\u2019s not leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, she is leading with polls, not principles. She doesn\u2019t agree that New Americans should have full access to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Domenzain continued. \u201cShe took money from private prisons until she was protested. So she has been the typical paradigm of Democrats who check a box that says they are for comprehensive immigration reform and unless immigration activists are protesting her, she will never be where they need her to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as we know now, Clinton has said she wants to expand, but has not been specific how. She said she wants to go beyond the Dreamers. We are waiting to hear details,\u201d Lynn Tramonte, deputy director at America\u2019s Voice, an immigrant advocacy group, told NBC News in November.\n\nClinton drew ire with Hispanics on Tuesday after her campaign released a blog post titled, \u201cSeven Ways Hillary Clinton is Just Like Your Abuela,\u201d using the Spanish word for grandmother. Soon, the hashtag \u201c#NotMyAbuela\u201d was trending on Twitter as activists took offense.\n\n#NotMyAbuela why do candidates think it's ok to throw out a Spanish word w every sentence and expect Latino votes? \u2014 Maria Anez (@MariaAnez2) December 23, 2015\n\nMy abuelita brought the family here from Mexico. Made tortillas for 40+ years. She kept everyone's secrets. Hillary is #NotMyAbuela \u2014 Jason Redick (@JayReddy) December 23, 2015\n\nOur experiences cannot be equated to those of a rich and privileged white woman. It's shameful and disrespectful to try #NotMyAbuela \u2014 Lupita Gonzalez (@pitaslug) December 23, 2015\n\nMy Abuela raised 6 children alone, and can't afford cancer treatment. #NotMyAbuela \u2014 Adamantium Dovahkiin (@raerraven) December 23, 2015\n\nSanders isn\u2019t exempt from the O\u2019Malley camp\u2019s attacks. Domenzain argued that as the self-proclaimed socialist has represented the state of Vermont for more than 20 years, immigration \u201cisn\u2019t an issue he\u2019s had to deal with.\u201d According to recent census data, Vermont is 95 percent white.\n\nWhile Domenzain praised Sanders for drafting an immigration plan similar to O\u2019Malley\u2019s \u2014 albeit, she said that theirs \u201cgoes further\u201d \u2014 the immigration activist slammed the senator for publicly stating in an interview that immigrants can take jobs from other Americans and deflate wages. How can voters be sure that he \u201cis going to change all of a sudden versus that he\u2019s just a typical politician that says what he needs to tell us,\u201d she said.\n\nCompared to Clinton\u2019s and Sander\u2019s, O\u2019Malley\u2019s immigration plan is the \u201cmost progressively pro-immigrant,\u201d as Domenzain put it, and \u201cstunningly explicit,\u201d as left-leaning The Nation put it. Among many other things, the plan extends the Affordable Care Act coverage to undocumented people in the U.S.\n\n\u201cCertainly compared to any of the other Democrats and all of the Republicans, [O\u2019Malley\u2019s platform] is so far more detailed and thorough than anyone else has been willing to express,\u201d Beth Werlin, director of policy at the Immigration Policy Center, told The Nation.\n\nBesides immigration, O\u2019Malley\u2019s camp has drawn a hard line between him and the other candidates on another issue out of the hands of both of his opponents \u2014 age.\n\nThe former Maryland governor received angry boos during Saturday\u2019s debate when he said, \u201cmay I offer a different generation\u2019s perspective on this.\u201d But the debate wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s made such a contrast.\n\nIn an interview with The Nation earlier in December regarding how his faith plays into his politics, O\u2019Malley said ideologically the \u201cprogressive\u201d label fits.\n\n\u201cI tend more toward \u2018progressive\u2019 because one of the distinguishing factors among the three of us as candidates \u2014 in terms of our experience \u2014 is that while the other two have talked about the things they wanted to get done, I\u2019ve actually gotten these things done,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cSome of them \u2014 like repealing the death penalty, getting marriage equality \u2014 I could not have done without Republican votes. You don\u2019t get progressive things done by clinging to divisive old ideologies, and you don\u2019t do it by declaring all Republicans your enemies. You do it by being clear about your principles [and] pulling people together.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s positions are progressive, to say the least, but Domenzain said that might not be a deterrent to independent or Republican voters.\n\n\u201cI think that an independent voter \u2014 or even some Republican voters \u2014 might disagree with, initially, with some of the progressive policies that he is putting up, but I do think that American voters have a high respect for principled leaders who don\u2019t waver,\u201d she told TheBlaze. \u201cBut what [voters] don\u2019t respect is someone who comes up to you and pretends to be anti-immigrant and then go into a pro-immigrant crowd and pretending to be pro-immigrant.\u201d\n\nBecause, as Domenzain said, for O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign, \u201cit\u2019s a matter of leading with principle, not polls.\u201d\n\n\u2014", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Putting principle over polls seems to be the mantra of Democratic Gov.
