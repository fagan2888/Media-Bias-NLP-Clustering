The Rockies begin a weekend series at Washington on Friday, then play four at New York beginning Monday.\n\n\u201cThis win does something to get our confidence back, and that\u2019s huge because we have to go against the Mets and Nationals,\u201d said Carlos Gonzalez, whose three-run, line-drive, 468-foot homer in the sixth got the Rockies back into the game. \u201cWe still have something to play for.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies (45-61) are on pace for a 93-loss season. This is a team taking on water at a rapid pace because of leaky starting pitching and a hide-your-eyes bullpen.\n\nThe possibility of the first 100-loss season in franchise history remains.\n\n\u201cI just want to see us keep fighting,\u201d said manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cWe have played some really tough games, over the last week and a half especially. We answered the bell today, and there have been many examples of that lately.\u201d\n\nThe road ahead is brutal. The Rockies were swept in the three games at Nationals Park last season, and also swept in three games by the Mets at Citi Field. Colorado, which began the season 6-0 on the road, has gone 14-32 since . The Rockies\u2019 road on-base percentage is .291, worst in the National League.\n\nThey will be fielding a team with a lot of new parts as they head east. Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki is gone to Toronto, Jose Reyes has taken his place and Kyle Parker is getting time at first base and the outfield. The Rockies are using a closer by committee, by default.\n\nThird baseman Nolan Arenado says that what the Rockies do now is important for setting a tone for next season and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe rest of this season is a big deal, and this road trip is a big road trip,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy not go out there and spoil it for those two teams?\u201d\n\nMcKenry, who hit the first walk-off homer of his career, furnished one of the best quotes of the year.\n\nHe was talking about his own home run, but he could have been talking about his team.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s tough, but just keep running forward,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the escalator is going down and you\u2019re running up.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders @denverpost.com or twitter.com/ psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saunders: Walk-off win makes Rockies remember how it feels", "title": "Saunders: Walk-off win makes Rockies remember how it feels", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/05/saunders-walk-off-win-makes-rockies-remember-how-it-feels/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-05T22:00:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:43:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Patrick Saunders"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe009e\"", "article_summary": "Sure, it\u2019s just one game in a Rockies season that, for postseason aspirations, was essentially over after an 11-game losing streak in May.\nThe Rockies\u2019 road on-base percentage is .291, worst in the National League.\nThe Rockies were swept in the three games at Nationals Park last season, and also swept in three games by the Mets at Citi Field.\nThe Rockies begin a weekend series at Washington on Friday, then play four at New York beginning Monday.\nMichael McKenry\u2019s two-run, walk-off homer in the 11th inning Wednesday at Coors Field was a life preserver."}
