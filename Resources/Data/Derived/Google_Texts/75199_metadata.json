Online security experts say the \u201cnew and improved\u201d Healthcare.gov site may actually be more insecure now than before it was fixed!\n\nAn operational progress report quoted Jeffrey Zients, a management consultant on repairs to the Obamacare site, as stating, \u201cThe bottom line -- HealthCare.gov on December 1st is night and day from where it was on October 1st.\u201d Well if this is \u201cday,\u201d then it\u2019s an Arctic Alaskan daytime with no sunlight as \u201cexperts\u201d blindly attempt to bolt on security to a system that was developed without a care about the security or privacy of Americans.\n\nDavid Kennedy, founder and principal security consultant of TrustedSec, warned that the Healthcare.gov was not secure. In fact, Kennedy previously told CNBC that it\u2019s hard to bolt on security after a site is developed and that \u201cno security was ever built into the Obamacare site.\u201d\n\nSo how many of the security risks were eliminated now that the administration \u201cfixed\u201d the site? None according to what Kennedy told the Washington Free Beacon. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear that any security fixes were done at all.\u201d He added:\n\n\u201cThere are a number of security concerns already with the website, and that\u2019s without even actually hacking the site, that\u2019s just a purely passive analysis of [it]. We found a number of critical exposures that were around sensitive information, the ability to hack into the site, things like that. We reported those issues and none of those appear to have been addressed at all.\u201d \u201cThey said they implemented over 400 bug fixes,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you recode the application to fix these 400 bugs\u2014they were rushing this out of the door to get the site at least so it can work a little bit\u2014you\u2019re introducing more security flaws as you go along with it because you don\u2019t even check that code.\u201d\n\nWell that\u2019s just peachy keen and that\u2019s before considering the \u201chacker\u201d threat. But, hey, it\u2019s not like the feds are required to notify citizens if there is a breach; after all, it\u2019s so much easier to leave that headache to each state. Just ask Vermont, since Vermont Health Connect had to admit to a security breach that allowed \u201cimproper access to another user\u2019s Social Security number and other data.\u201d\n\nKennedy also said that:\n\nthe team working on Healthcare.gov is more likely to hide its security flaws than address them. When it was revealed that the most popular searches on the website were hack attempts\u2014confirmed by entering a semicolon in the search bar\u2014the website simply removed the tool. \u201cThe top results were hacker attempts,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cTheir fix for it wasn\u2019t, \u2018Hey let\u2019s restrict people from inputting malicious code into the website,\u2019\u2014because that\u2019s how hackers break into websites\u2014it was, \u2018we\u2019re just going to completely disable that entire function completely, and not even show the search results back.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve deployed 12 large, dedicated servers,\u201d states the operation progress report. Oh goodie gumdrops, it \u201ccan now handle about as many shoppers as the average custom T-shirt site,\u201d pointed out Human Events. The site has \u201ca remodeled 404 Error page that pretends to be a \u2018waiting room,\u2019 where you can \u2018queue up\u2019 and leave an email address to be notified\u201d when it\u2019s your turn to fill out all your private info.\n\nJulie Bataille, Director of Communications, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, summed up the newly \u201cfixed\u201d site\u2019s progress report [pdf] as having an upgraded and reconfigured firewall that protects the system while allowing \u201cmore than five times the network throughput.\u201d The \u201cimproved shopping\u201d experience on Healthcare.gov supposedly can handle 50,000 people logged on to the website at once, and \u201cmore than 800,000 visitors a day;\u201d but even with a lower number of \u201cshoppers,\u201d the Associated Press reported that many visitors faced \u201cthe same old sputters and even crashes.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Mike Rogers said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that \u201cthe security of this site and its ability to safeguard health and income information 'does not meet even the minimal standards of the private sector'.\u201d Americans \u201cshould not tolerate the sheer level of incompetence securing this site. And remember how much personal information is not only there, but all of the (federal government data) sites that the (healthcare.gov) hub accesses would expose Americans\u2019 personal information in a way that is breathtakingly bad.\u201d\n\nWhile Rogers believed the Obama administration was more concerned about timeline fixes than the security of Americans\u2019 private information, a person need look no further than NSA surveillance to confirm the fact that citizens\u2019 privacy is trivial to President Obama. He said he welcomes a national debate over the surveillance policies, adding \"that's a debate we wouldn't have had five years ago.\" But as Jay Leno said, \"It's a debate we wouldn't have had two weeks ago if they all hadn't gotten caught.\"\n\nRegarding the new and improved Heathcare.gov, Kennedy warned, \u201cI\u2019m a little bit more skeptical now, and I would still definitely advise individuals to not use the website because it\u2019s definitely something that I don\u2019t believe is secure and neither did the four individuals that testified in front of Congress. I think there\u2019s some major security concerns there around privacy and information, and they haven\u2019t even come close to being addressed, and won\u2019t be in the short term.\u201d\n\nIf you go ahead use the website, then you may get close to the end when an error pops up that states, \"Verification system temporarily unavailable.\" Or you may think you actually completed the task. But AHIP spokesman Robert Zirkelbach told FoxNews that \"in some cases, plans are not getting the enrollment files at all\" and that \"getting that fixed,\" is \"critical.\"", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "date": "2013-12-03", "parsely-link": "http://www.computerworld.com/article/2475683/application-security/healthcare-gov-more-vulnerable-to-hacking---privacy-breaches-after--fix-.html", "author": "Darlene Storm", "og": {"url": "http://www.computerworld.com/article/2475683/application-security/healthcare-gov-more-vulnerable-to-hacking---privacy-breaches-after--fix-.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Computerworld", "title": "Healthcare.gov more vulnerable to hacking & privacy breaches after 'fix'"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.computerworld.com/article/2475683/application-security/healthcare-gov-more-vulnerable-to-hacking---privacy-breaches-after--fix-.html", "site": "@computerworld", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://core4.staticworld.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2014/08/20/16/healthcare.gov_more_vulnerable_to_hacking_privacy_breaches_after_fix-100387608-orig.gif", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "DC.date.issued": "2013-12-03T15:55-05:00", "google-site-verification": "_JEYLpDBDU_w1eI6P77BYlB1lvpukoxFcYDS_-Aznko", "parsely-title": "Healthcare.gov more vulnerable to hacking & privacy breaches after 'fix'", "fb": {"app_id": 123026274413041, "pages": 103687894679}, "parsely-author": "Darlene Storm", "parsely-type": "NewsArticle", "sailthru.tags": "application-security,data-privacy,cybercrime-hacking,healthcare-it,darlene-storm,security-is-sexy,opinion,medium", "parsely-section": "Application Security", "parsely-tags": "blog: Security Is Sexy,type: opinion,source: computerworld,original", "parsely-image-url": "http://images.techhive.com/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2014/08/20/16/healthcare.gov_more_vulnerable_to_hacking_privacy_breaches_after_fix-100387608-orig.gif", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-12-03T23:55:49Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6dd\"", "article_summary": "Online security experts say the \u201cnew and improved\u201d Healthcare.gov site may actually be more insecure now than before it was fixed!\nNone according to what Kennedy told the Washington Free Beacon.\nDavid Kennedy, founder and principal security consultant of TrustedSec, warned that the Healthcare.gov was not secure.\nWe found a number of critical exposures that were around sensitive information, the ability to hack into the site, things like that.\nOh goodie gumdrops, it \u201ccan now handle about as many shoppers as the average custom T-shirt site,\u201d pointed out Human Events."}
