The influx of new restaurants, bars and condos in D.C. is the result of new wealth that has poured into the city in recent years, but that wealth has hardly been distributed evenly.

There were 18,000 more poor residents in the District in 2014 than before the Great Recession and the black population has taken the hardest hit, according to new Census income and poverty data analyzed by the DC Fiscal Policy Institute.

The number of residents living in poverty jumped from 92,000 to 110,000 people between 2007 and 2014. The city’s total population grew by more than 80,000 people during that time, but the percentage of people living in poverty remained the same, at about 18 percent.

The racial breakdown of those living in poverty shows the drastic disparities. African-American residents were the only racial and ethnic group that saw a jump in its poverty rate since 2007. In 2014, more than one in four African-American families lived on less than $24,000 a year for a family of four. By comparison, 7 percent of non-Hispanic white families made as little money, according to the DC Fiscal Policy Institute.

The median income for all D.C. households increased by nearly $10,000 to $71,648 between 2007 and 2014. The median income for African-American families, however, was stagnant at about $41,000.

But, because of the Affordable Care Act, Census data show that there was a “drastic decrease in the number of residents without health insurance.” The number of uninsured residents dropped 20 percent, from 48,000 people to 37,000 people. Ninety-five percent of residents in the District are now insured, including 98 percent of children.

“Thanks to the District’s decision to expand Medicaid and build a marketplace for affordable health plans, more people can get the care they need and make ends meet. This proves that we have the tools to level the playing field and expand economic opportunity,” said Ed Lazere, executive director of the DC Fiscal Policy Institute.
