John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the effort to defund Obamacare \"was not achievable\" in an interview with Texas Monthly, where he also opened up about his relationship with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\n\n\"I have to give Ted a lot of credit for capturing the imagination of people who are angry at Washington. We did have a disagreement about tactics, but it wasn\u2019t about policy,\" Cornyn told Brian D. Sweany of Texas Monthly. \"I think we have different styles, and that may be because I was a judge for thirteen years, so my style of discourse is more suited for the courtroom. I\u2019ve had a fair amount of success in the Senate, which has been good for Texas, and I\u2019m number two in the leadership, which is good for advancing the Texas model in Washington, D.C. But I don\u2019t think there is any daylight in terms of our philosophy.\"\n\nSweany asked Cornyn about his hope \"that the people who advocated a government shutdown\" -- which includes Cruz, who led the fight to defund Obamacare -- \"had learned a lesson.\" Cornyn called the fight against Obamacare \"not achievable\":\n\nI would say that I hope we\u2019ll be less confrontational. It\u2019s a difference of opinion within the family about the tactics of achieving a goal, not the goal itself. But you\u2019re right, I thought the effort to defund Obamacare was not achievable, and I think the facts bear that out. I\u2019ve made mistakes in how I\u2019ve approached certain things, and I\u2019ve learned from every one of them. That\u2019s part of being a rational human being. I\u2019ve read that a number of the folks who were proponents of the defund Obamacare on the continuing resolution are not going to pursue that tactic again, and I think that\u2019s good. The shutdown did not help our cause. What did help our cause was the president\u2019s implementation of Obamacare, which has overwhelmed everything else. I don\u2019t hear anyone thinking that another government shutdown is the way to achieve our goals.\n\nCornyn's criticism of Cruz has him in hot water ahead of the 2014 elections. Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) announced Monday he'll challenge Cornyn, citing the way the senator \"treated his fellow congressmen\" as his main reason for joining the race.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely disappointed in the way [Cornyn] treated his fellow congressmen and broke the 11th commandment and undermined Ted Cruz\u2019s fight to stop Obamacare,\" Stockman said Monday. \"We think he needs to be held accountable for his decisions.\"\n\nRead Texas Monthly's entire interview with Cornyn here.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Sen.
