That\u2019s not an issue in the pipe, where the 27-year-old is untouchable. He easily qualified in the top spot for Saturday\u2019s Dew Tour halfpipe finals.\n\nSlopestyle is another story for White, who has been eclipsed in recent contests by powerful Canadians like Sebastien Toutant and Mark McMorris. White dashed any doubts on Friday, with a solid run that featured unwavering double-cork trickery, but not the triple-corks that earned McMorris a Dew Tour title last year.\n\nBreckenridge\u2019s Eric Willet qualified second, joining fellow Americans Chas Guldemond, Sage Kotsenburg, Brandon Davis, Eric Beauchemin and Spencer Link among the 16 finalists in Sunday\u2019s slopestyle showdown.\n\nSnowboarder Jamie Anderson continued her snowboard slopestyle dominance with a gold on Friday. The 23-year-old South Lake Tahoe rider boosted a huge backside 540 on the final hit of her second run \u2013 the last run of the event \u2013 to cinch gold, besting Finland\u2019s Enni Rukajarvi and Norway\u2019s Silje Norendal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nerve wracking,\u201d Anderson said of her final run. \u201cBut it\u2019s good for the heart and good for the soul.\u201d\n\nThe halfpipe skiing fellows debuted their soon-to-be-Olympic talents under the lights Friday night, with the most technical tricks of the Dew Tour so far. Of the 26 competitors, eight hailed from Colorado, including 18-year-old Torin Yater-Wallace of Aspen, whose massive first hits and floating 1260s on both runs drew gasps from the crowd at the base of the pipe.\n\nYater-Wallace grabbed the top qualifying spot, besting Frenchman Kevin Rolland. Crested Butte 17-year-old Aaron Blunck qualified third. Seven Colorado skiers made it into Saturday\u2019s finals, including 19-year-old Alex Ferriera of Aspen, 23-year-old Taylor Seaton from Avon, Boulder 19-year-old Lyman Currier, Telluride 22-year-old Gus Kenworthy, (who also qualified for slopestyle finals) and Broby Leeds, 19, of Vail.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Dew Tour,Shaun White", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "Snowboarders Shaun White and Jamie Anderson and halfpipe skier Torin Yater-Wallace shine in second day of Breckenridge Dew Tour", "title": "Shaun White, Jamie Anderson and Torin Yater-Wallace shine in Dew Tour", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2013/12/13/shaun-white-jamie-anderson-and-torin-yater-wallace-shine-in-second-day-of-breckenridge-dew-tour/25991/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2013/12/shaun-white.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Snowboarders Shaun White and Jamie Anderson and halfpipe skier Torin Yater-Wallace shine in second day of Breckenridge Dew Tour", "creator": "@jasonblevins", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2013/12/13/shaun-white-jamie-anderson-and-torin-yater-wallace-shine-in-second-day-of-breckenridge-dew-tour/25991/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2013/12/shaun-white.jpg", "title": "Shaun White, Jamie Anderson and Torin Yater-Wallace shine in second day of Breckenridge Dew Tour", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Snowboarders Shaun White and Jamie Anderson and halfpipe skier Torin Yater-Wallace shine in second day of Breckenridge Dew Tour"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc992f\"", "article_summary": "He easily qualified in the top spot for Saturday\u2019s Dew Tour halfpipe finals.\nWhite dashed any doubts on Friday, with a solid run that featured unwavering double-cork trickery, but not the triple-corks that earned McMorris a Dew Tour title last year.\nBreckenridge\u2019s Eric Willet qualified second, joining fellow Americans Chas Guldemond, Sage Kotsenburg, Brandon Davis, Eric Beauchemin and Spencer Link among the 16 finalists in Sunday\u2019s slopestyle showdown.\nThe halfpipe wizard is aiming to compete in both slopestyle and halfpipe in the Sochi Winter Olympics.\nEmbed See More Videos at AlliSports.comShaun White\u2019s anticipated slopestyle debut at Breckenridge\u2019s Dew Tour shined bright on Friday, with the snowboarding kingpin locking down a top qualifying spot heading into Sunday\u2019s finals."}
