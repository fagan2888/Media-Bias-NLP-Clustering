For House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), the “war on women” and victimhood are always in style when election season rolls around.

According to CNS News.com, on Thursday, Pelosi said on a conference call that American women have been victims throughout the history of the nation.

“It was a struggle all the way,” Pelosi said. “Women marched. Women starved. Women were starved. Women were force-fed. Women could barely speak up in their own homes.”

She continued:

Women left their homes to take the message. And it was successful, and the right to vote, again, so precious, so hard fought. … We hope women will continue to exercise forcefully, because then all of the issues we care about, whether it’s equal pay for equal work, paid sick leave, affordable quality child care, raising the minimum wage, women’s health and–and safety issues will all be well-served.

Democrats are pushing their agenda, titled “When Women Succeed, America Succeeds,” and they hope to win the female vote by convincing women they are victims and can only succeed with the government by their side throughout their lives.

While Pelosi addressed the government’s giving women “freedom” from “oppressive student loans” and the importance of affordable child care, Rep. Doris Matsui (D-CA) discussed women’s paid sick leave, the Violence Against Women Act, and free birth control now available through Obamacare.

“So if you’re [an] entrepreneur and you want to start your own business or you want to be in a work situation where you can not [sic] have to worry about family as you try to do your job,” Pelosi said, “all of it comes back to quality, affordable child care, which, by the way, is the best thing we can do for our children, for our country, and for our future.”
