But instead of assessing students\u2019 skills, this year only, the exam \u2013 which was delayed a week from its previous March 18 start date \u2013 will be used to help officials evaluate the quality of the test questions to ensure that they\u2019re valid and fair for all students, and it will assess the adequacy of computers and technology linking the state\u2019s 10,000-plus schools to the Internet.\n\nStudent scores won\u2019t matter until next spring, when the online tests officially replace the California Standards Tests and other assessments that formed the state\u2019s Standardized Testing and Reporting program, known as STAR, for the past 15 years. Instead of the bubble-in, multiple-choice tests that have been the hallmark of standardized testing in the state, the online assessments will require students to demonstrate a deeper level of knowledge through persuasive writing, problem solving and explaining how they found their answers.\n\nJudging by the numbers, California appears to have at least the minimum technology needed for the test. The latest figures from a survey conducted by the Department of Education show that 88 percent of school districts and 83 percent of schools are connected to the K-12 High Speed Network, a high-speed Internet connection for schools funded by the state Department of Education.\n\nBehind the connectivity numbers, the standard of readiness is imprecise and inconsistent.\n\n\u201cWhat does \u2018ready\u2019 mean? That\u2019s what we\u2019re about to find out,\u201d said David Plank, executive director of Policy Analysis for California Education, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research center. \u201cI think we\u2019re all flying blind on this and we\u2019re going to find out what we\u2019re able to do.\u201d\n\n(See companion piece on the skills students need for the new test.)\n\nWhat is certain is that just being connected to the K-12 High Speed Network isn\u2019t enough. Hundreds of schools don\u2019t have sufficient computers, keyboards and headphones for all their students, or have sufficient bandwidth to run the data-heavy test that uses videos, animated graphics and interactive graphs in the questions. Some children will be bused to other schools in their district that have better computer access. Some campuses are leasing mobile computer labs. Still others are testing a few students at a time to avoid a network crash.\n\n\u201cPeople are finding ways to have their students tested,\u201d said Deb Sigman, deputy superintendent of the California Department of Education. \u201cWe\u2019re not hearing horror stories from folks.\u201d\n\nDuring this last mile before the field test, Sigman said the Educational Testing Service, ETS, a state contractor helping districts prepare for the field test, \u201chas a team of people doing site visits and helping schools find creative solutions\u201d to technological challenges.\n\nMobile computers, mobile students\n\nCalifornia had the opportunity to take part in a free evaluation offered by the nonprofit EducationSuperHighway that would have identified schools without the necessary bandwidth to handle the Smarter Balanced field test, but decided against it. Completing the assessment would have taken each school a couple of minutes to log into the organization\u2019s speed test site and run the program. Founded by entrepreneur Evan Marwell, the organization received $9 million from the Gates and Zuckerberg foundations for its initiative to connect every school in the country to high-speed Internet.\n\nCalifornia Department of Education spokesperson Tina Jung said the department opted out because it was focused on getting schools to complete the department\u2019s tech readiness survey, a self-reported inventory to determine if schools meet the minimum requirements for bandwidth, operating systems and available computers and other equipment.\n\n\u201cWe were heavily promoting that, at the same time that the EducationSuperHighway came out. So we didn\u2019t want to overburden or confuse our schools during this critical time,\u201d Jung said.\n\nIn San Mateo County, 23 districts took the speed test and found the results helped pinpoint their connectivity needs. The County Office of Education asked the districts to participate as part of a larger project to develop models of teaching using technology. Overall, the county\u2019s schools are in better shape than those in most of the country, although only about a third of schools have adequate bandwidth for the field test, according to the EducationSuperHighway.\n\nAs a direct consequence of the speed test, San Mateo County districts on the borderline of readiness had time to improve their technology, said Brian Simmons, director of accountability, innovation and results for the County Office of Education.\n\n\u201cThe good thing about this fire drill is that the system has responded,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI was in one district that had just gotten a bunch of Chromebooks, so I think that (the speed test) has had that impact.\u201d\n\nThere are still a few outliers. Simmons said some 5 to 10 percent of the districts will need support during testing, such as using portable computer labs and bringing in mobile hotspots to expand bandwidth.\n\nCreative solutions\n\nA number of California districts are making do with MacGyver-like resourcefulness.\n\nCuyama Joint Unified School District serves about 240 students in a remote farming community surrounded by mountains in Santa Barbara County. As the crow flies, it\u2019s midway between Bakersfield, 64 miles to the east, and Santa Maria, 60 miles to the west, which is also the nearest link to the K-12 High Speed Network. As network cables lie, well, fuggedaboutit.\n\nWhen testing begins, the 101 students in grades 3-8 at Cuyama Elementary School will be bused to the high school over several days to take the field test in Cuyama Valley High\u2019s computer lab.\n\nDeath Valley Unified School District, which covers 6,000 square miles of the Mojave Desert and has skimpy cell phone service, is going to test its 20 students one at a time, said Cindy Kazanis, director of educational data management at the California Department of Education. The math and English sections are each expected to take three to four hours to complete and districts say they\u2019ll spread that out over several days. Fortunately, at nearly 12 weeks, the window for the field test is long enough to do this.\n\nSuburban Sacramento\u2019s Natomas Unified School District has limited bandwidth, said Kazanis, and found that it couldn\u2019t test classrooms next to each other without crashing the computers, so the district scheduled testing for every other classroom.\n\nMatt Kinzie, chief technology officer for the nearly 57,000-student San Francisco Unified School District, said the district \u201cis feeling pretty confident about the field test.\u201d About 15 schools don\u2019t have enough computers, so the district ordered laptops that can easily be moved from school to school during the testing period.\n\nOne potential pitfall is that San Francisco schools run at least three different operating systems: Apple, Windows and Google Chromebooks. The latter poses the biggest challenge because Chromebooks only operate in the cloud on Google\u2019s browser.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t have the same experience as Obamacare,\u201d Kinzie joked, a reference to website woes that plagued the roll-out of the health care program.\n\nKazanis is also advising districts with minimum bandwidth to try to keep the network as open as possible during testing by holding off on some administrative tasks.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind that the networks are already being utilized to a certain capacity and this takes it above and beyond that, so part of the guidance that we\u2019ve been giving is don\u2019t do your payroll Monday morning when getting ready to take the big test,\u201d Kazanis said.\n\nThe state does have emergency plans for the testing period in the event that a student presses a key and his or her screen goes blank, or the network freezes and there\u2019s no tech expert on site. ETS specialists will be on hand through a toll-free number on the California Technical Assistance website.\n\nJust a few billion more\n\nA common thread linking districts with technology gaps is money; more specifically, not enough of it.\n\nSan Francisco Unified has spent $836,000 this year for new computers, keyboards and headsets for testing, and has plans to buy 5,300 Apple computers next year to start standardizing the district on a single operating system.\n\nCuyama Joint Unified bought 28 new computers this year for the high school lab. Superintendent Roland Maier said he wants to add a lab at the elementary school and make other system upgrades, at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nBoth districts used their portion of funds from the $1.25 billion one-time Common Core implementation grant that Gov. Jerry Brown put into the May budget revision last spring. That money, about $200 per student, could be used for technology, professional development and textbooks or other instructional materials.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping more than anything is that the governor will decide to put another $1.25 or $2 billion into (implementation),\u201d Maier said, \u201cbecause we need a lot more and I know most schools do need a lot more.\u201d\n\nAssemblywoman Susan Bonilla, D-Concord, who advocated for the funding last year, said she\u2019s heard that appeal from many superintendents, principals and teachers. Earlier this month, she introduced legislation seeking another one-time round of transition funds to implement Common Core State Standards. Assembly Bill 2319 doesn\u2019t list a specific dollar amount, but in an interview, Bonilla said she\u2019d like an additional $1.5 billion, which is what she had hoped for last year.\n\nThat will only cover half of what schools need to prepare for Common Core, contends Wes Smith, executive director of the Association of California School Administrators. ACSA is calling for two set-asides: $1.5 billion for technology and $1.25 billion for professional development, curriculum development and instructional materials.\n\nHe said superintendents told him they\u2019re worried that without adequate preparation California will \u201csuffer the same fate as other states\u201d \u2013 New York in particular, which caused a backlash against Common Core by testing students before they were ready.\n\nEquity issues\n\nSmith\u2019s fundamental concern, however, is the consequences of an unequal distribution of technology for the state\u2019s poorest students, and not just on the field test, but also having access to the full potential of the new standards. Technology skills, from basic keyboarding to research, are embedded throughout Common Core.\n\n\u201cWe believe at the heart of all this is opportunity. We\u2019re at a crossroads where we can provide opportunity for all children and really invest in a real transition,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re really concerned here that we have a civil rights issue brewing that some of our wealthiest communities have access to technology and have for some time.\u201d\n\nLow-income students and their schools could feel that deficit next spring when the Smarter Balanced assessment is graded. During the first three years of the actual exam, schools can give a traditional paper-and-pencil version, but those students will miss out on familiarizing themselves with the online version, which will be required in 2018, and they\u2019ll lose opportunities for personalized learning. The computerized version of the test is adaptive; it adjusts the difficulty of questions based on students\u2019 answers. That gives teachers more information about where their students need help.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any world where that\u2019s equitable,\u201d Smith said.\n\nState officials point out that the purpose of the field test is to get an accurate accounting of each school\u2019s technological capabilities before the exam has consequences so there\u2019s time to address the glitches.\n\n\u201cFor the most part districts see this as a great opportunity,\u201d said CDE\u2019s Kazanis. \u201cIf something is going to fail, this is the year for that to occur. Mistakes are going to happen and we want to make them when the stakes are low.\u201d\n\nContact senior reporter Kathryn Baron and follow her on Twitter @TchersPet.
