And by caring about your neighbors\u2019 bills, he means finding a way to avoid them.\n\nWhat evidently provoked Dr. Emanuel to fret about your medical bills was something called a PCSK9 inhibitor, a recently approved class of biologics that, according to a preliminary study, reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke by half.\n\nIf you are prone to cardiovascular disease, you might think this is good news. Dr. Emanuel does not. He cites press accounts indicating that the medicine will cost more than $14,000 per patient per year, though no insurer or government agency will pay that price because they negotiate discounts.\n\nSo why is Dr. Emanuel worried? He cites a recent New England Journal of Medicine article, which estimates that the drug might raise everyone\u2019s insurance premiums by $124 per year. Despite uncertainty around that estimate, the new drug will be costly, and Dr. Emanuel clearly doesn\u2019t think the benefit it could produce for millions of people is worth $124 to him.\n\nHis solution goes beyond price controls. They are, he writes, \u201ca good start and necessary\u201d but they \u201cwill not solve the systemic problem of super-high drug costs.\u201d Instead of controlling prices, Dr. Emanuel wants to control access.\n\nHe sings in what he calls \u201ca growing chorus\u201d that wants to require insurance companies and government programs to \u201cpay for value.\u201d Value-based purchasing is not a cutting-edge idea. It\u2019s what you do every time you go to the supermarket and decide whether to pay $13 for an organic roasted chicken or $5 for the non-organic alternative. \u201cIn the rest of the economy,\u201d he writes, \u201cwe let individuals determine value. They decide whether a new gadget is worth the expense.\u201d\n\nBut that won\u2019t do in health care, Emanuel informs us. Letting doctors and patients make medical decisions is a dangerous thing. \u201cIt is not just patients\u2019 perspectives we need to take into account. Patients get the benefit, but all of us are paying the bill.\u201d\n\nDecisions about clinical value should not be made in the clinic, Emanuel argues. \u201cBecause we all pay, all Americans have to have a voice in determining value.\u201d\n\nBy \u201call Americans\u201d he means government, guided by people of his academic pedigree.\n\nDr. Emanuel offers a formula, borrowed from the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service (NHS), for \u201cdetermining value\u201d and thus for deciding whether your medicine, surgery or treatment is worth the price. The NHS calculates \u201cQuality-Adjusted Life Years\u201d [QALY], a metric that takes into account both the quantity and quality of life generated by medicines and other treatments.\n\n\u201cIn England, they have a flexible target,\u201d he writes, \u201cwherein above $45,000 per QALY require an increasingly strong case for coverage.\u201d The PCSK9 inhibitor, as you may have guessed, misses the target. Indeed, Emanuel estimates that the biologic would cost \u201cas much as $300,000 for every quality-adjusted life-year they add.\u201d\n\nEthical concerns aside (should government determine how much an additional \u201cquality-year\u201d of life is worth?), government policies have so distorted medical prices as to render the sorts of calculations Emanuel favors suspect. Before considering whether to import England\u2019s algorithm for determining value, policymakers would do well to reflect on the wreckage that previous government forays into the health care marketplace have wrought.\n\nThe government, for example, imposes price controls in the VA system. It also operates a Medicaid \u201crebate\u201d program, which requires drug makers to mark down the price of medicines in that burgeoning program. It mandates similar price concessions to a growing list of clinics and hospitals. Manufacturers also must slash prices by 50 percent for Medicare beneficiaries who have fallen into the drug benefit\u2019s \u201cdonut hole.\u201d\n\nWhen the government requires manufacturers to provide steep discounts to such a broad swath of the market, they predictably charge higher prices to everyone else.\n\nThen there are the limitations that government enforces on the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies. Disney still holds exclusive rights to Mickey Mouse (introduced in 1928), but knock-off versions of the drug Abilify (first approved to treat schizophrenia in 2002) hit the shelves this year. That means manufacturers have to recoup all of the development costs of a product (and sustain ongoing research and development efforts) in a very short period of time, putting further upward pressure on prices.\n\nEmanuel doesn\u2019t just overlook the distorting effect government actions have had on drug prices, but he also fails to see how government has deformed health insurance markets. Federal programs have long divorced premiums from risk. ObamaCare has extended that practice into the individual and small group markets, creating a program in which people who wait until they are sick to buy insurance pay the same rates as those who maintained continuous coverage when they were healthy.\n\nIt has thus made insurance a good deal for people who have pre-existing medical conditions and a bad deal for people who don\u2019t. That is a major reason why the vast majority of uninsured people in reasonably good health who don\u2019t qualify for government premium and cost-sharing subsidies have so far chosen to remain uninsured. It also helps explain how insurance companies have managed to lose money under the program, even after pocketing billions in corporate welfare payments.\n\nThe accretion of government intrusions into the health care marketplace has distorted medical prices beyond recognition. Good intentions have motivated every intervention, each of which has engendered a new round of problems that, in turn, have inspired further well-meaning interventions. The result is a costly and inefficient system where prices are unhinged from value.\n\nGovernment is bad at paying for value. For consumers, it is a core competency. Instead of smoldering over other people\u2019s medical bills, Emanuel would do well to devote his considerable intellect to scraping away regulatory barnacles that prevent price discovery. Instead of more government, we need a health care system that functions like the rest of the economy where, as Emanuel put it, \u201cindividuals determine value.\u201d\n\nIn a system like that, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry so much about other people\u2019s medical bills.\n\nDoug Badger is a retired White House and U.S. Senate policy adviser and a Senior Fellow at the Galen Institute.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Galen Institute", "description": "By Doug Badger Nov. 12, 2015 Zeke Emanuel is tired of paying for your expensive medicine.
