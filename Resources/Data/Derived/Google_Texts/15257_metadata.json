But these molecules are byproducts of normal metabolic activity, are not toxic, he said, and do not need to be flushed away.\n\nAs for the belief that massage helps remove lactic acid from sore muscles, \u201cthere\u2019s pretty good evidence now that lactic acid is not harmful,\u201d Perlman said. A 2010 study found that postexercise massage did not remove lactic acid effectively anyway.\n\nBut the findings do not mean that a glass or two of water after a massage should be avoided.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line,\u201d he said, \u201cis that while we don\u2019t know that drinking water after a massage is helpful, it\u2019s not likely to be harmful. So if you feel like it, drink up.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Gretchen Reynolds, The New York Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/06/1003054377-FL_SAR_hffitbrie.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b7f\"", "article_summary": "Q: Does drinking a lot of water after a massage really help flush away toxins, or otherwise augment the massage\u2019s benefits?\n\u201cThe bottom line,\u201d he said, \u201cis that while we don\u2019t know that drinking water after a massage is helpful, it\u2019s not likely to be harmful.\nAs for the belief that massage helps remove lactic acid from sore muscles, \u201cthere\u2019s pretty good evidence now that lactic acid is not harmful,\u201d Perlman said.\nBut the findings do not mean that a glass or two of water after a massage should be avoided.\nA 2010 study found that postexercise massage did not remove lactic acid effectively anyway."}
