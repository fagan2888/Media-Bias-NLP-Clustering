She envisioned her oldest son carrying his younger brother, Braden, some 300 miles from their home in Temperance, Mich., to the northern Michigan town of Mackinac. Hunter, 14 and an avid wrestler, relished the idea of carrying Braden, who suffers from cerebral palsy, to generate awareness for the disorder.\n\n\u201cSo we just started playing with the idea and we realized that to do something like that, to go to Mackinac, would take two weeks walking 20 miles every day, and we just didn\u2019t have the time,\u201d Danielle Gandee told The Ann Arbor News. Instead, they set their sights on the University of Michigan \u2014 roughly 40 miles from their home \u2014\u201cand it seemed to be the perfect distance,\u201d Gandee said.\n\nAnd so on Saturday morning, beginning at Bedford Junior High School\u2019s gymnasium in Temperance, and with the support of his parents, younger siblings, and friends from high school and the surrounding community, Hunter and Braden set off.\n\nHunter Gandee, 14, carried his brother Braden, 7, on a 40-mile trek from Bedford to #AnnArbor. http://t.co/WWcpQ8d0kL pic.twitter.com/LmOGEQkLUV \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The Toledo Blade (@toledonews) June 8, 2014\n\nCerebral palsy is marked by severe neurological and nervous system deficiencies, such as difficulty learning, remembering, hearing, seeing, and moving. In Braden\u2019s case, his condition mostly affects his muscle tone, coordination, and reflexes. While atop his brother\u2019s back, Braden\u2019s greatest hindrances came from chafing on his legs. For Hunter\u2019s part, the student council member took periodic breaks to rest and stretch, including an overnight rest period at the 25-mile mark. He completed the final 15-mile leg the next day.\n\nDespite his obvious fatigue, Danielle Gandee said, her son continued to push others and motivate them to stay along for the ride. \u201cThat\u2019s just Hunter,\u201d she told The Ann Arbor News. \u201cThis is what he wanted to do. I knew he\u2019d do it, and I had faith in him the entire time.\u201d The family\u2019s real concern was the 7-year-old on Hunter\u2019s back, Gandee said. Braden \u201chad some injuries and blistering and stuff like that from some of the equipment and just the heat and sweat, so we were worried we were going to have to push him in his stroller.\u201d\n\nThe entire Gandee family credits wrestling as the linchpin for Hunter\u2019s success. Fellow wrestlers from U of M supported Hunter in the walk, which was planned to end at the University\u2019s Bahna Wrestling Center. At each of Hunter\u2019s matches, said Sam Gandee, the boys\u2019 father, Braden keeps track of Hunter\u2019s stats and knows exactly where his older brother stands in the tournament leaderboards. \u201cWithout wrestling this wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Sam Gandee said.\n\nA group of people stood cheering at the Wrestling Center as Hunter and Braden approached on Sunday afternoon. The Gandee clan expressed gratitude to everyone that donated their time for the walk, and celebrated the awareness for Braden\u2019s cerebral palsy that the walk generated. Braden was also especially grateful for having a back to cling to over those grueling 40 miles and explained what it meant to have an older brother who cares so much.\n\n\u201cHe always looks out for me,\u201d Braden said. \u201cIt means so much to have a brother like this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "michigan, teen, carries, brother, cerebral, palsy, his, back, 40, miles, generate, disorder", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Hunter Gandee carried his younger brother, Braden, some 40 miles across Michigan to generate awareness for cerebral palsy.", "title": "Why One Teenager Carried His Brother On His Back For 40 Miles [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/michigan-teen-carries-brother-cerebral-palsy-his-back-40-miles-generate-disorder-awareness-287322", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/09/huntergandee.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hunter Gandee carried his younger brother, Braden, some 40 miles across Michigan to generate awareness for cerebral palsy.", "title": "Why One Teenager Carried His Brother On His Back For 40 Miles [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/michigan-teen-carries-brother-cerebral-palsy-his-back-40-miles-generate-disorder-awareness-287322", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/09/huntergandee.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/09/huntergandee.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-09T16:06:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-09T16:06:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Hunter Gandee carried his younger brother, Braden, some 40 miles across Michigan to generate awareness for cerebral palsy."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a31\"", "article_summary": "Hunter Gandee, 14, carried his brother Braden, 7, on a 40-mile trek from Bedford to #AnnArbor.\nShe envisioned her oldest son carrying his younger brother, Braden, some 300 miles from their home in Temperance, Mich., to the northern Michigan town of Mackinac.\nHunter, 14 and an avid wrestler, relished the idea of carrying Braden, who suffers from cerebral palsy, to generate awareness for the disorder.\nThe Gandee clan expressed gratitude to everyone that donated their time for the walk, and celebrated the awareness for Braden\u2019s cerebral palsy that the walk generated.\nInstead, they set their sights on the University of Michigan \u2014 roughly 40 miles from their home \u2014\u201cand it seemed to be the perfect distance,\u201d Gandee said."}
