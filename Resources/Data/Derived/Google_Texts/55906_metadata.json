Wolfe\n\nT&I AIMING FOR TRANSPO BILL MARKUP AT MONTH\u2019S END: Leaders of the House Transportation Committee are prepping a highway and transit bill markup for the last week of October, right around the time the current authorization will expire. In a chat off the House floor Tuesday night, Chairman Bill Shuster told MT he\u2019s still working to nail down exact timing, noting things can change quickly. The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Peter DeFazio, was a little more forthcoming \u2014 he told MT the markup would \u201cprobably\u201d happen the week of Oct. 26. DeFazio said he and Shuster are meeting today to \"see if we can finalize our policy discussions, and agree or disagree over certain things, and chart a path forward.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat of course means lawmakers will have to do another extension, since current policy expires Oct. 29. But that\u2019s no surprise since Shuster has been saying for weeks they\u2019d likely need one more short-term patch to bridge the gap until they can get agreement with the Senate on a long-term bill.\n\nFULL STEAM AHEAD ON FUNDING: It\u2019s one thing for the T&I Committee to push out a long-term transportation bill, but the big question still remains \u2014 how do you fund the thing? Well, Ways and Means member Dave Reichert said Tuesday night the committee still plans to move ahead with a six-year highway and transit bill funded with revenue from repatriation, even though talks with Sen. Chuck Schumer seemed to fall apart late last week. \u201cI think that because the talks have reached a point where, you know, we haven\u2019t come to agreement yet, that I think both sides have agreed that they should move ahead with their ideas on both the Senate and the House side so that we don\u2019t lose any time,\" Reichert told MT, noting that \"whether it\u2019s a three-year or six-year bill hasn\u2019t been determined yet.\u201d\n\nAre you gonna go my way? Senate EPW Chairman Jim Inhofe has lots of good things to say about House highway and transit bill negotiations, even as lawmakers in the lower chamber remain pretty tight-lipped. Inhofe told MT he thinks there\u2019s a silver lining to the ongoing chaos surrounding the House leadership race \u2014 it actually makes transportation bill negotiations easier. And he thinks House negotiators might be more amenable to the idea of accepting key tenets included in the Senate bill. \u201cI think, you know, that the leadership problems over there in the House probably reduced some of the reluctance or opposition that was there because now they can concentrate on this. And before they were thinking of anything they could think of to where [the bills] could be different from each other. Well that\u2019s behind them now,\u201d Inhofe said.\n\nLet\u2019s talk pay-fors: The affable Okie also said he thinks the Senate pay-fors, which would cover transportation policy for three years, are now a more attractive option for House negotiators following the breakdown of international tax talks last week. \u201cI think the one thing everyone is saying, they are all saying yes [to] a six-year bill, no it doesn\u2019t have to be all six years paid for,\u201d he told MT on Tuesday afternoon following a morning chat with Shuster. \u201cWe need to get it done before \u2014 they\u2019re shooting to do it before [Oct. 29],\u201d he added.\n\nWE MADE IT TO WEDNESDAY.

FAA Deputy Administrator Michael Whitaker will testify along with Tim Canoll, president of the Air Line Pilots Association. Representatives from the U.S. Forest Service and the Academy of Model Aeronautics will also take lawmakers\u2019 questions. Expect the scary number of reported drone near misses and encounters \u2014 as of August, pilots reported 650 drone sightings this year \u2014 to be at the top of lawmakers\u2019 line of questioning as they continue to mull policy ahead of a multi-year FAA reauthorization.\n\nDeFazio sent a letter (http://politico.pro/1VCfbPg) to DOT in late August asking for specifics on what Congress could do to make it easier for the FAA to prevent collisions between airplanes and drones and step up its policing of bad drone operators.\n\nDo your homework: Want to catch up on all things drone before the hearing? Here\u2019s a nifty summary prepared by staffers on the aviation subcommittee: http://1.usa.gov/1JQrds1\n\nAnd can\u2019t miss \u2014 FAA cracks down on bad drone operators: The FAA wants folks to know it means business when it comes to unmanned vehicles, issuing its largest penalty to date for bad drone behavior. The agency is seeking a $1.9 million fine against a Chicago-based company for allegedly operating drones without its permission. The fine, against SkyPan International Inc., is for operating 65 aerial photography flights between 2012 and 2014 without proper equipment and without proper approvals, many of which were performed in restricted airspace around New York City.

There are upsides to both approaches: getting bicameral agreement on a PTC-specific bill means the House could pass the legislation under suspension of the rules, positioning the Senate to then clear it by unanimous consent.\n\nBut: That can only happen if everyone agrees on a strategy for giving railroads more time to comply. Attaching an extension to another legislative vehicle, especially a mammoth one like the highway and transit bill covering myriad priorities, makes it easier for members to hold their nose and vote \u201caye\u201d \u2014 even if they don\u2019t completely love the PTC end-game. While that\u2019s Thune\u2019s preferred outcome, he told reporters Tuesday that opponents of the House and Senate proposals \u2014 he name-checked Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Cory Booker \u2014 likely couldn\u2019t maintain an objection for long, \u201cjust because they know it's got to be fixed.\" Read more: http://politico.pro/1L5jPep\n\nMT Mailbag: The U.S. Conference of Mayors endorsed the House PTC bill this week.

Michael Horn, president and CEO of VW\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, will testify first. Two EPA officials \u2014 Christopher Grundler, director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality, and Phillip Brooks, director of the enforcement office\u2019s air division \u2014 round out the second panel.\n\nA background memo (http://politico.pro/1VCgbTx) posted to the committee\u2019s website Tuesday notes that the panel expects to receive documents and additional information as part of its investigation into the allegations \u201cin coming weeks that will illuminate the facts and circumstances of these events.\u201d Lawmakers are sure to press Horn on the details of the alleged deception and its impact on VW customers. Per the memo, they may also address the \u201cEPA\u2019s role in any measures to bring affected VWs into compliance,\u201d a big unknown in the weeks since the agency made its accusations public. The EPA officials may also face grilling on why the agency itself didn\u2019t uncover the alleged wrongdoing.\n\nWhat about the Senate? Thune said the Commerce Committee hasn\u2019t written off looking into the Volkswagen case, but noted that plenty of other panels and federal agencies were investigating the allegations. \u201cWe\u2019re following that issue very carefully,\u201d he said.\n\nTotal recall: Reuters reported late Tuesday that VW will begin a recall of affected diesels in Europe in January; a U.S. recall would have to be agreed upon by the EPA. Check it out here: http://reut.rs/1McWWK8\n\nExtra CAFE credit: The New York Times reports that VW pushed for special treatment for its diesel cars before the Obama administration announced more stringent fuel economy standards in 2011.

Workers at all other FCA plants would continue to work until the supply of whatever the striking plant produces forces engine and transmission plants, then assembly plants, to lay off workers. Striking workers would be eligible for strike pay from the union. Those who are laid off would be eligible to file for unemployment compensation. Even so, the strike notification alone raises a host of new questions and escalates the urgency for both sides to reach an agreement on a new contract.\u201d Full story: http://on.freep.com/1OW7OOr\n\nTHE AUTOBAHN (SPEED READ):\n\n\u2014 Blumenthal, Casey reintroduce criminal penalty bill after GM settlement.
