It\u2019s already making a real difference for patients and providers.\n\nLast month, when the Supreme Court again upheld the Affordable Care Act, the debate focused on the tax credits that subsidize monthly premiums. But the case also provided a glimpse into the progress of health reform itself, and some gains are promising.\n\nPatients who bought coverage on the health exchange were much more likely to avoid emergency rooms and use outpatient facilities.\n\nWomen, who often need additional services, took advantage of new treatment options: Those with coverage were over three times as likely to get an ultrasound for a breast lump, for instance.\n\nPatients with coverage usually shared in their medical costs, paying $390 on average for each visit to a large hospital chain. That compares with 9 in 10 uninsured patients who paid nothing for their care.\n\nThese were among the examples cited in a legal brief filed by HCA Inc., also known as Hospital Corp. of America. It\u2019s the nation\u2019s largest private provider and a major player here, with over $2 billion in patient revenue in Dallas-Fort Worth.\n\nHCA\u2019s early experience shows that the health law is achieving some of its core objectives: encouraging people to get care in the most appropriate setting; promoting personal responsibility and cost-sharing; and enabling better access for many at risk.\n\nAll are important goals for improving health care and trying to bend the cost curve.\n\nCost-sharing, for example, is a common feature of most private health insurance today. Congress wanted patients in the new system to have skin in the game, too.\n\n\u201cDoing so was a way to promote personal responsibility, smarter health care choices, and the use of less expensive modes of care,\u201d HCA wrote in its filing in King vs. Burwell.\n\nHCA urged the Supreme Court to retain the tax credits offered in federally run exchanges, which include the marketplace in Texas. In a 6-3 decision, the court upheld the subsidies, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing: \u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them.\u201d\n\nAccess in Texas\n\nSince Obamacare passed in 2010, an estimated 16.4 million people who were uninsured now have coverage. That\u2019s affected their behaviors and boosted results for providers, especially in states that expanded Medicaid coverage.\n\nTexas leaders have refused to expand Medicaid, leaving billions of federal dollars on the table. But nearly 1 million Texans have enrolled through the exchange, and that\u2019s had a positive effect.\n\n\u201cWe could do even more in Texas, but I hear the same anecdotes about improvements in care here,\u201d said Steve Love, CEO of the Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council. \u201cThe intent of the law is to expand coverage and access in a cost-effective manner, and thus far, that\u2019s been pretty much achieved.\u201d\n\nCritics often said the health law would kill jobs and drive costs higher. That hasn\u2019t happened so far. The region and the nation have been adding jobs at a rapid clip and health costs have grown more slowly than projected.\n\nIn 2013, the increase in health care costs was less than half the rate of a decade earlier. And in the exchanges, this year\u2019s average monthly premium rose 2.9 percent for the lowest-cost silver plan, according to a report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nThe average premium for the same coverage in Dallas rose 5.7 percent, the group said.\n\nGood start\n\nThis year, the Congressional Budget Office also lowered projections of total federal spending on health because of lower premiums and fewer enrollees than originally anticipated.\n\nOver a decade, the government is now expected to spend $600 billion less than projected before health reform, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nAt HCA, the uninsured were three times more likely to go to the emergency room for care, the company said. And patients with insurance from the exchange were almost twice as likely to go to an outpatient facility.\n\nThat\u2019s a good start, Love said, because the uninsured usually face a learning curve in health care. They have to grasp rules about deductibles, co-pays and primary care doctors, and react accordingly.\n\nHCA\u2019s results mirror the experience of other providers. Ascension Health, a major not-for-profit health system, has hospitals in 16 states, including Texas. The Kaiser Family Foundation compared its results in states that expanded Medicaid and those that did not.\n\nIn expansion states, Medicaid outpatient revenue grew over twice as fast as inpatient revenue, Kaiser reported. The costs of charity care also fell 40 percent in Ascension\u2019s expansion states, compared with a decline of 6 percent in the others.\n\nTenet Healthcare, a national chain based in Dallas, reported a 50 percent decline in uninsured and charity admissions for the first quarter. In two years, its quarterly costs for charity and uncompensated care have fallen by $174 million.\n\nPoliticians may still be fighting over Obamacare. But in many ways, it\u2019s already working.\n\nFollow Mitchell Schnurman on Twitter at @mitchschnurman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From fewer ER visits to more cost-sharing, Obamacare is already starting to pay off for patients and providers alike.", "og": {"description": "From fewer ER visits to more cost-sharing, Obamacare is already starting to pay off for patients and providers alike.", "title": "Schnurman: The Affordable Care Act passes its checkup", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20150713-schnurman-the-affordable-care-act-passes-its-checkup.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20150713-jump.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/Jump.jpg", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-07-14T02:12:21Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-07-14T02:08:16Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Schnurman: The Affordable Care Act passes its checkup\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20150713-schnurman-the-affordable-care-act-passes-its-checkup.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20150713-jump.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/Jump.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2362687\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-14T02:08:16Z\", \"section\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"author\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20150713-jump.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/Jump.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-14T02:08:16Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24f3\"", "article_summary": "In 2013, the increase in health care costs was less than half the rate of a decade earlier.\nAll are important goals for improving health care and trying to bend the cost curve.\n\u201cDoing so was a way to promote personal responsibility, smarter health care choices, and the use of less expensive modes of care,\u201d HCA wrote in its filing in King vs. Burwell.\nThat compares with 9 in 10 uninsured patients who paid nothing for their care.\nThe region and the nation have been adding jobs at a rapid clip and health costs have grown more slowly than projected."}
