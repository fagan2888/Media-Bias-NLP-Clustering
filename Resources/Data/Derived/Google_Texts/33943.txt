In an interview this week, investigative journalism Hall of Famer and still-associate editor at the Washington Post Bob Woodward told Larry King that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was nobody's hero, and anyway should have come to Woodward instead of the likes of Glenn Greenwald:

"I wish [Snowden] had come to me instead of others, particularly The Guardian,” Woodward said in an interview on "Politicking with Larry King" that airs Thursday on Hulu. "I would have said to him ‘let’s not reveal who you are. Let’s make you a protected source and give me time with this data and let’s sort it out and present it in a coherent way.'"

If you were thinking to yourself, "Wait, didn't the Washington Post's Barton Gellman publish a lot of Snowden-sourced scoops?", or if you merely savor a little in-house journalistic fratricide, then you might enjoy Gellman's retort to The Huffington Post:

"The 'others' he dismissed include [The Washington Post's] Greg Miller, Julie Tate, Carol Leonnig, Ellen Nakashima, Craig Whitlock, Craig Timberg, Steven Rich and Ashkan Soltani -- all of whom are building on the Snowden archive with me to land scoop after scoop," Gellman continued. "I won't get into why Snowden came to me or didn't come to Bob. But the idea of keeping Snowden anonymous, or of waiting for one 'coherent' story, suggests that Bob does not understand my source or the world he lived in."

A source on deep background indicated that an old man could be seen near an Arlington strip mall waving his fist and yelling at a cloud.
