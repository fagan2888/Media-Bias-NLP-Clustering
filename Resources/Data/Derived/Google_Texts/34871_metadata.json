Call an Experienced Attorney Caregiver & Elder Care News New Elder Abuse Roadmap Outlines Critical Path to Protecting Seniors Efforts led by Justice Department, Health and Human Services to gather input from hundreds of private stakeholders; free training for attornies \"Under the Affordable Care Act, we enacted the Elder Justice Act. Through this law, the Federal Government has invested in identifying, responding to, and preventing elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Because eliminating this pervasive crime requires coordinated action, we are bringing together Federal agencies; non-profit and private sector partners; and State, local, and tribal governments. Together, we can build a more responsive criminal justice system, give seniors the tools to avoid financial scams, and determine the best ways to prevent elder abuse before it starts. - President Barack Obama, declaration of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, June 11, 2014 July 10, 2014 \u2013 The Obama Administration yesterday released The Elder Justice Roadmap, which is a program outline developed by experts in the field. It will be used by the Elder Justice Coordinating Council and others to develop strategic plans to prevent and combat elder abuse. The government and civilian leaders in the fight against elder said The Elder Justice Roadmap will provide guidance in tackling the highest priority challenges to elder abuse prevention and prosecution, and called on all American to take a stand against the serious societal problem of elder abuse, neglect and financial exploitation. Research suggests that 1 in 10 Americans over the age of 60 has experienced elder abuse or neglect, and that people with dementia are at higher risk for abuse. Supported by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Elder Justice Roadmap was developed by harnessing the expertise of hundreds of public and private stakeholders from across the country and by gathering their input. The goal of these expert summits was to identify the most critical priorities and concrete opportunities for greater public and private investment and engagement in elder abuse issues. \u201cThe Roadmap Project is an important milestone for elder justice,\u201d said Associate Attorney General Tony West. Red Flags of Elder Abuse Neglect \u2022 Lack of basic hygiene, adequate food, or clean and appropriate clothing \u2022 Lack of medical aids (glasses, walker, teeth, hearing aid, medications) \u2022 Person with dementia left unsupervised \u2022 Person confined to bed is left without care \u2022 Home cluttered, filthy, in disrepair, or having fire and safety hazards \u2022 Home without adequate facilities (stove, refrigerator, heat, cooling, working plumbing, and electricity) \u2022 Untreated pressure \u201cbed\u201d sores (pressure ulcers) Financial abuse/exploitation \u2022 Lack of amenities victim could afford \u2022 Vulnerable elder/adult \u201cvoluntarily\u201d giving uncharacteristically excessive financial reimbursement/gifts for needed care and companionship \u2022 Caregiver has control of elder\u2019s money but is failing to provide for elder\u2019s needs \u2022 Vulnerable elder/adult has signed property transfers (Power of Attorney, new will, etc.) but is unable to comprehend the transaction or what it means Psychological/emotional abuse \u2022 Unexplained or uncharacteristic changes in behavior, such as withdrawal from normal activities, unexplained changes in alertness, other \u2022 Caregiver isolates elder (doesn\u2019t let anyone into the home or speak to the elder) \u2022 Caregiver is verbally aggressive or demeaning, controlling, overly concerned about spending money, or uncaring Physical/sexual abuse \u2022 Inadequately explained fractures, bruises, welts, cuts, sores or burns \u2022 Unexplained sexually transmitted diseases The National Center on Elder Abuse (NCEA) directed by the U.S. Administration on Aging, helps communities, agencies and organizations ensure that elders and adults with disabilities can live with dignity, and without abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The National Center on Elder Abuse and Neglect, U.C. Irvine, prepared materials for this effort with the support of the Archstone Foundation, the National Institute of Justice, the National Institute on Aging, UniHealth Foundation, and individual donors.

And the fastest-growing population is people 85 years old, or older,\u201d says Kathy Greenlee, HHS\u2019 assistant secretary for aging and administrator of the Administration for Community Living. \u201cStemming the tide of abuse will require individuals, neighbors, communities, and public and private entities to take a hard look at how each of us encounters elder abuse\u2014and commit to combat it.\u201d To support the mission of elder abuse prevention and prosecution, DOJ has developed an interactive, online curriculum to teach legal aid and other civil attorneys to identify and respond to elder abuse. The first three modules of the training cover what lawyers should know about elder abuse; practical and ethical strategies to use when facing challenges in this area; and a primer on domestic violence and sexual assault. This training will expand to include six one-hour modules covering issues relevant to attorneys who may encounter elder abuse victims in the course of their practice. HHS is supporting the mission by developing a voluntary national adult protective services (APS) data system. Collecting national data on adult mistreatment will help to identify and address many gaps about the number and characteristics of adults who are the victims of maltreatment and the nature of services that are provided by APS agencies to protect these vulnerable adults. The data will also help better inform the development of improved, more targeted policy and programmatic interventions. In addition to informing federal elder justice efforts, the Roadmap has already inspired private stakeholders to take action. For example, as a result of the Roadmap, the Archstone Foundation has funded a project at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California to develop a national training initiative. Other funders, such as the Weinberg Foundation, have begun to consider inquiries and projects outlined in the Roadmap. The Brookdale Center for Healthy Aging at Hunter College, The Harry and Jeannette Weinberg Center for Elder Abuse Prevention at the Hebrew Home at Riverdale, and the New York City Elder Abuse Center will be co-sponsoring a symposium in September focusing on innovations and challenges related to elder abuse multidisciplinary teams, a priority area identified in the Roadmap. \u201cWhile federal and state governments certainly have critical roles to play, the battle against elder abuse can only be won with grassroots action at the community and individual level,\u201d said Greenlee. \u201cTurning the tide against elder abuse requires much greater public commitment, so every American will recognize elder abuse when they see it and know what to do if they encounter it.\u201d Two steps local communities, families, and individuals can take are: \u2022 Learn the signs of elder abuse. The National Center on Elder Abuse, a program of the Administration on Aging at ACL, has developed a helpful Red Flags of Abuse Factsheet (PDF) that lists the signs of and risk factors for abuse and neglect. \u2022 Report suspected abuse when you see it. Contact your local adult protective services agency. Phone numbers for state or local offices can be found at the National Center for Elder Abuse website, or call 1-800-677-1116.
