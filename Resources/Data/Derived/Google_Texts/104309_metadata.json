(AP) - There\u2019s an injured baby raptor on the rural outskirts of the city.\n\nBut fear not, these aren\u2019t the clever girls from the 1993 movie \u201cJurassic Park.\u201d These are the owls and other birds of prey at Oaken Acres Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, which has nursed injured wildlife back to health for 31 years.\n\nChristy Gerbitz, director of operations, is in charge of caring for the animals in enclosures resembling their natural habitat outside, then taken inside the facility for proper medical treatment.\n\n\u201cThese are outdoor enclosures where they\u2019re conditioned back to life before release,\u201d Gerbitz said. \u201cI tend to a lot of their health issues, get them healthy, then get them back outside as close to their native habitat so they can start to develop their wild assets.\u201d\n\nOaken Acres has a baby owl, two baby raccoons, an adult northern flicker with a broken wing and several squirrels orphaned by last week\u2019s tornado.\n\nIt\u2019s just the beginning: May through July is the prime time for baby animals being born in the wild, and a busy time for Oaken Acres.\n\nMostly, Oaken Acres sees injured animals brought in by the public, Gerbitz said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do 500 animals this year,\u201d she said. \u201cHalf will be birds and will be in May. Some of those little ones need care every 15 minutes of the day. That\u2019s why we need all hands on deck.\u201d\n\nOne issue Gerbitz said she sees with injured baby animals handed over to Oaken Acres is that they\u2019ve been imprinted on by the people who cared for them. Hence, why Gerbitz currently feeds the center\u2019s owl with an owl hand puppet.\n\nWhen coming across wild animals, Gerbitz said precautions should be taken - don\u2019t engage the animal immediately, watch and listen, assess the surroundings, then protect yourself and the animal.\n\n\u201cThe best way to capture it is to put a box over the animal and slide a lid underneath it,\u201d Gerbitz said.\n\nAmilee Maher of Cortland interned for a year at Oaken Acres before become a staff member. She said she hopes to one day finish her degree at Kishwaukee College and pursue a career in veterinary medicine.\n\nIt\u2019s a joyous experience when the Oaken Acres staff nurses a wounded animal back to health, she said. Most of the animal releases Maher has been part of have been raccoons taken to a nearby forest preserve.\n\n\u201cYou just open the cages and see them cautiously peak their heads out,\u201d Maher said. \u201cThey\u2019ll run and climb up trees. It\u2019s really exciting to see they adapted so well from outdoor enclosures to climb trees.\u201d\n\nFounder Kathy Stelford said Oaken Acres has grown from receiving 20 animals and $80 in donations a year to taking in 500 animals a year and enough donations to support that, Stelford said.\n\nIn 2007, Stelford published her book, \u201cEvery Live Matters: Inspiring Stories of Wildlife Rescues and Releases,\u201d which chronicles the lives of some of the animals that have gone through Oaken Acres.\n\n\u201cSometimes, you get very attached,\u201d Stelford said. \u201cYou spend hours daily with certain animals in very serious condition. Even when it\u2019s hard, you know the reason you do it is to release them back in the wild so they can live a normal life. They\u2019re all special, but some tug at your heartstrings.\u201d\n\nStelford recalled a time about 20 years ago when a fox, dubbed Georgie Girl, was hit by a car and had stainless steel pins in both of its hind legs that eventually was nursed back to full health, and released.\n\n\u201cNo one thought she would make it,\u201d Stelford said. \u201cIt was wonderful to see her run off.\u201d\n\nAnimals that don\u2019t recover are usually euthanized, and it\u2019s merciful when it does happen.\n\n\u201cWildlife rehabilitation has one of the highest mortality rates of all the animal welfare jobs, because wild animals are not capturable unless they\u2019re in very critical condition,\u201d Gerbitz said. \u201cWe celebrate our victories from the mountaintop because with every victory we have, there\u2019s a number of losses we\u2019ve endured, so those victories are made all the more sweeter.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSource: The (DeKalb) Daily Chronicle, http://bit.ly/1FPyWW4\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Daily Chronicle, http://www.daily-chronicle.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's an injured baby raptor on the rural outskirts of the city.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "There\u2019s an injured baby raptor on the rural outskirts of the city.", "title": "EXCHANGE: Oaken Acres helping injured wildlife for 31 years", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/13/exchange-oaken-acres-helping-injured-wildlife-for-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/13/c9d494c668845515760f6a7067005ea0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/13/c9d494c668845515760f6a7067005ea0.jpg", "description": "There's an injured baby raptor on the rural outskirts of the city.", "card": "summary", "title": "EXCHANGE: Oaken Acres helping injured wildlife for 31 years"}, "Author": "ADAM POULISSE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Mostly, Oaken Acres sees injured animals brought in by the public, Gerbitz said.\nAmilee Maher of Cortland interned for a year at Oaken Acres before become a staff member.\nSYCAMORE, Ill.
