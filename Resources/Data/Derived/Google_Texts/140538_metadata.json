While writing it, he thought, \u201cpeople were going to be pissed off. Black people were going to be pissed off and white people were going to be pissed off, and they were all going to be pissed off for slightly different reasons.\u201d That\u2019s because Johnson\u2019s narrator, Warren Duffy, is \u201cmixed,\u201d the child of a black mother and an Irish-American father; he identifies as black, but his light-colored skin often leads strangers to mistake him for white.\n\nWarren \u2014 who has failed as a comics artist, comics store owner and husband \u2014 returns to Philly from Wales, where he\u2019s been hiding out from the conundrum of his own identity. He comes back to sell the decrepit mansion he inherited from his recently deceased father, a partially roofless and entirely creepy 18th-century estate house looming over the surrounding ghetto, a defunct \u201cartifact of rich white folks\u2019 attempt at dynasty.\u201d Once there, he discovers he has a teenage daughter, Tal, the result of a one-night stand with a Jewish classmate. Vowing to do right by her, Warren becomes entangled with the M\u00e9lange Center, an eccentric organization that runs a charter school for mixed-race people who want to claim multiple identities. Warren calls it \u201cMulattopia,\u201d and suspects it of being a cult, but Tal does love that school.\n\nMeanwhile, Warren has seen two strange figures darting around corners and into outbuildings on the grounds of his mansion by night. Tal thinks they\u2019re the ghosts of the first interracial couple. Warren is sure they\u2019re just crackheads. Since \u201cLoving Day\u201d is Johnson\u2019s follow-up to his celebrated 2011 novel, \u201cPym\u201d \u2014 a brazen fusion of academic satire and two-fisted Arctic adventure yarn \u2014 the truth is likely to be very strange indeed.\n\nI spoke with Johnson recently about his membership in the tribe of black nerds, his love-hate relationship with Twitter and why humor is an indispensable tool when you\u2019re writing about race.\n\nBefore we talk about \u201cLoving Day,\u201d I wanted to say how much I enjoy your Twitter feed. You send out these beautiful, enigmatic, polished telegrams, although once I started reading the book, I realized some of them are lines from the novel.\n\nWere they? I think I unintentionally plagiarized myself, because I wasn\u2019t consciously doing that. Twitter has become a lot of different things at different points, but there was a time when I would float ideas or I\u2019d come up with a good sentence and I\u2019d tweet it, and then I\u2019d go put it in the book afterwards.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that your writing flows back and forth between two such different media. Do you ever have bad experiences with Twitter?\n\nOh yeah, I hate it.\n\nReally?\n\nIt\u2019s become hellish. Honestly, if I didn\u2019t need it, I probably would have been off by now. I probably shouldn\u2019t say that out loud. But when I got on Twitter, it was 2008 and basically I was in a tiny group of writers I knew from across the country, a little cocktail party. It changed before I realized it had changed. It became a broadcast medium. Really, when they created the retweet button, that\u2019s when everything got dramatically different.\n\nHaving worked with and on the Internet for nearly 25 years, I\u2019ve seen over and over again this pattern where the early adopters of an online community have a great, almost utopian initial experience. Then that attracts more and more people, and these randos come in and they\u2019re hostile or they\u2019re trollish. Or they\u2019re just clueless and you have to explain everything to them and they don\u2019t get the jokes. Suddenly you\u2019re constantly putting out fires all the time, and it stops being fun.\n\nExactly. I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s taken Twitter so long to reach this point, because the problem isn\u2019t Twitter, the problem is humans. The more humans you get on there, even if you\u2019re dealing with the 1 percent of people who are just balls of anger and rage, who are exploding, they have a disproportionate voice and it gets ugly. I remember once being so excited to be on Facebook, really enjoying Facebook, and then it grew to a point where I couldn\u2019t say anything because I would offend my uncle or somebody I went to third grade with. That\u2019s exactly when I left to go to Twitter. There, it was early adopters who tended to be a lot more sophisticated, who understood nuance and were a lot less orthodox.\n\nYou never know what people are going to take offense to. You have to develop ninja skills for ignoring stuff because if you let it get to you and you respond, it just becomes so much worse.\n\nIt almost always goes wrong. Although people don\u2019t think of it this way, identity in general tends to be a toxic succession. Identity depends on group consensus. If you say something that other people [in your group] don\u2019t believe, their response tends to be violent; they depend on that group consensus. It\u2019s a defensive technique.\n\nThe other thing I think is wrong with this moment of great offense is that you get a cookie for getting offended about something. People are like, \u201cIf I get offended about that, it means I\u2019m righteous.\u201d On Twitter, you get a cookie not only from more people approving of you but from more people following you. You raise your profile by being offended. So the natural consequence of that is that people get more and more offended. Because the thing is, there\u2019s nothing to risk by being offended. Once you\u2019re offended, you\u2019re partly saying, \u201cI\u2019m more pure than this, and as such I reject this.\u201d There\u2019s just nothing at risk.\n\nIt seems to be a difficult habit to break.\n\nPart of the cool thing about humor is, I think it\u2019s going to help an increasing backlash. There should be something at risk with getting offended. You should risk looking like a pompous, orthodox ass. I get offended too, and I have to stop myself sometimes when I\u2019m annoyed at something, because a lot of times I\u2019ll see something, I\u2019ll be instantly annoyed, and I know if I say something immediately I\u2019ll get 500 follows. So I have to hold myself back and think about it, because while I feel that critique is important and essential, we have to make getting offended riskier so that people actually take the time to think about what they\u2019re doing. If it\u2019s important enough, then they\u2019ll make the critique, as opposed to just randomly defecating.\n\nYou\u2019re a brave man to write a satire about something people are so invested in.\n\nNo, I\u2019m not brave, and that\u2019s the fucking problem. I just can\u2019t write about anything else but what I actually care about. While I was writing this novel, I kept thinking, black people are going to resent that this discussion [of mixed-race identity] is even happening because some people are going to see it as people trying to distance themselves from blackness. Some people are going to see it as divisive and taking away much needed power in the black community by making it even smaller. Mixed people, my fellow mixed people, don\u2019t tend, as a group, to have a great sense of humor about this stuff. They\u2019re very sensitive about it and there\u2019s a lot of trauma there, so even if they only slightly disagree with me, they\u2019re going to be incredibly furious about that. White people, some of them are going to react by saying, \u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d Because a lot of them are in the position where they don\u2019t have to acknowledge how integral identity is as part of their lives. Then I was like, well who\u2019s left?\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking and writing recently about jokes, and how you have to have enough shared culture with other people to be able to make jokes and feel sure that they\u2019ll know that it\u2019s a joke and they\u2019ll get it. That\u2019s why humor is so explosive at the moment, because it\u2019s founded on the idea that we have a shared culture, and social media is constantly exposing us to people who aren\u2019t part of that circle. You and I, even if we\u2019re not quite in the same community, we have enough of a shared culture that we get many of each other\u2019s jokes. That\u2019s one of the things that defines who\u2019s in a group and who\u2019s not in it. With satire, in particular \u2014 the most sophisticated form of humor \u2014 if you\u2019re going to do that about identity and race, then, oh my god, that\u2019s tricky. That is really tricky.\n\nAny time I make some sort of joke along racial lines or dealing with racial politics, I know that immediately there\u2019s going to be a wave of positive response from people who know where I\u2019m coming from and who share a basic aesthetic. The first five minutes, I know that I\u2019m going to get positive responses. Then, minute six, it starts to go beyond that little bubble. Some people come in who don\u2019t even recognize the humor, because humor is a declaration of in-group status. The further away you go from the center, the less they understand the context of it. Twitter is not just American. Race is completely based on context, so as soon as the discussion goes out of America, say once it gets to Britain, it gets a slightly different take. Then it goes past that and things get more and more absurd. Once that wave hits outside of America, all of a sudden people are looking at my picture going, \u201cWhy is this guy talking like he\u2019s black?\u201d\n\nHow do you cope with that?\n\nWell, I also think people are just shitty. The thing is, I see offensive stuff online all the time. If I have a negative reaction, what I do is I click to the profile, and I look at the context of the tweet. Even if it\u2019s a completely alien environment, usually by doing that I can understand it. But the people who tend to react negatively \u2014 well, there\u2019s a group of them that are just malicious and they\u2019ve had horrible lives and they want to hurt other people as a sort of panacea for their own pain. But there\u2019s another group who just don\u2019t even think. They see it and they just respond instantly. This is just a symptom of a larger issue of not really reading closely or researching closely what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nOften they\u2019re not even really responding to what you wrote.\n\nNo. Everyone is talking about themselves: \u201cThis is me.\u201d And also, \u201cWell you talked, so now I get to talk about me and I\u2019m going to pretend it\u2019s me talking about you.\u201d Everybody is coming in with their own baggage and pain when it comes to identity. Even white people are coming in with the same sort of thing. I\u2019m not trying to validate it, but there are white people out there who are like, \u201cI\u2019ve worked so hard my whole life and the world was against me. I managed to do this thing, I managed to succeed, and now you\u2019re coming and telling me my success doesn\u2019t matter because it was all easy for me because I\u2019m white.\u201d There\u2019s pain there. Or, \u201cI failed completely and now you\u2019re telling me I had a 10 minute head start.\u201d I\u2019ve tried to look at, OK, this person is really angry, why are they angry? What do you think is there? They\u2019re trying to hurt me, or others who think the way I do, so why is that? And that to me is a really good way to defuse the bomb.\n\nThis gets to the heart of your new book, with the concept of identity as having a body of shared feelings, ideas and experiences with someone. Warren\u2019s problem, when he\u2019s trying to decide if he wants to be part of M\u00e9lange, is that he also hears the voice of his old friend Tosha, the voice of the black community. She is really, really skeptical of the mixed community. One of the reasons why people don\u2019t want to look at the context of that is because they\u2019re so invested in the idea that everybody in this identity has to believe certain things or feel certain things.\n\nRight. Any time you have a belief system that is dependent on group consensus, you\u2019re going to get violent reactions. The biggest example is religion. People ask me that question that every author gets, \u201cIs this you?\u201d My set response is, \u201cEvery character is me.\u201d Tosha\u2019s way of looking at it is how I looked at it for most of my life. That voice, that fundamental voice, still pops up in my head sometimes. When I was writing this, I would call my editor up, Chris Jackson, who\u2019s a prominent African-American editor, and I\u2019d be like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this. This is crazy, this is sacrilege. Maybe we should kill this now.\u201d We had to talk our way through it. He\u2019d say, \u201cWhy do you feel that way?\u201d And sometimes when you start examining the why\u2019s, something that feels very rigid and solid all of a sudden becomes very porous and loose. I just wrote a piece defending the word \u201cmulatto.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of knee-jerk response to the word \u201cmulatto.\u201d\n\nYou just really go for it, don\u2019t you?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The author of \"Pym\" talks about his new novel, his love-hate relationship with Twitter and being a black nerd", "title": "\u201cYou get a cookie for being offended\u201d: Mat Johnson on the fine art of racial satire", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The author of \"Pym\" talks about his new novel, his love-hate relationship with Twitter and being a black nerd", "title": "\u201cYou get a cookie for being offended\u201d: Mat Johnson on the fine art of racial satire", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/24/you_get_a_cookie_for_being_offended_mat_johnson_on_the_fine_art_of_racial_satire/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/mat_johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The author of \"Pym\" talks about his new novel, his love-hate relationship with Twitter and being a black nerd", "title": "\u201cYou get a cookie for being offended\u201d: Mat Johnson on the fine art of racial satire", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/mat_johnson.jpg", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Author Interviews, Biracial, Books, Fiction, humor, Loving Day, Mat Johnson, Race, Satire", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "She is really, really skeptical of the mixed community.\nOnce you\u2019re offended, you\u2019re partly saying, \u201cI\u2019m more pure than this, and as such I reject this.\u201d There\u2019s just nothing at risk.\nAny time you have a belief system that is dependent on group consensus, you\u2019re going to get violent reactions.\nThe first five minutes, I know that I\u2019m going to get positive responses.\nWith satire, in particular \u2014 the most sophisticated form of humor \u2014 if you\u2019re going to do that about identity and race, then, oh my god, that\u2019s tricky."}
