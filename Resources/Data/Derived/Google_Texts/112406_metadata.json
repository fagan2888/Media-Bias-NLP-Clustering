Seven of them actually.\n\nCard experts in Southern California said Wednesday that they have verified the legitimacy \u2014 and seven-figure total value \u2014 of seven identical Ty Cobb cards from the printing period of 1909 to 1911. Before the recent find, there were only about 15 known to still exist.\n\nJoe Orlando, the president of Professional Sports Authenticator in Newport Beach, California, who verified the find, said it is \"spectacular\" and \"miraculous\" to have come across such a cache.\n\n\"I am not sure if any other baseball card find is more remarkable than this new discovery,\" Orlando said in a statement.\n\nThe family who discovered the cards in a neglected paper bag at the run-down house of a deceased great-grandfather has asked to remain anonymous.\n\nPublicist Donn Pearlman, who helped announce the finding, said only that they are from a southern state and that the cards were first taken to a dealer in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina\n\nThat dealer, Rick Snyder of MINT State Inc., said his initial reaction after getting a voicemail from the family was \"absolute skepticism.\"\n\n\"I doubted they were authentic because finding seven of these cards at one place at one time seemed almost impossible,\" Snyder said. But after examining photos and then finally seeing the cards themselves a week later, he became convinced.\n\nOrlando said he was also dubious at first. But after his office and an outside expert examined the cards, he became a believer.\n\nThe cards with the famed Detroit Tigers slugger come from a lot known as T206, the group most prized by collectors that also includes the Honus Wagner card, arguably the most famous sports card ever.\n\nThey say on the back \"TY COBB \u2014 KING OF THE SMOKING TOBACCO WORLD\" in green ink.\n\nThe cards' value is sure to shift now that there are so many more in existence, and an exact figure is difficult to pin down. But Orlando said the total worth of the whole cache should exceed $1 million. It's not yet clear what the family who found them intends to do with them.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, 10 being mint condition, the cards range from 3.5 to 4.5, which is high for cards that are more than a century old.\n\n\"This is one of the greatest discoveries in the history of our hobby,\" Orlando said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Miraculous' cache of 7 century-old baseball cards found - AP News: LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 From a crumpled paper bag in .05/26/2016 11:19:59AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 From a crumpled paper bag in a dilapidated house came a", "title": "AP News - 'Miraculous' cache of 7 century-old baseball cards found", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/general/2016/03/02/miraculous-cache-of-7-centuryold-baseball-cards-found-n2127968", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\62\\3776bcdd-6a44-402e-8677-351b94dd4174.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 From a crumpled paper bag in a dilapidated house came a", "title": "AP News - 'Miraculous' cache of 7 century-old baseball cards found", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/general/2016/03/02/miraculous-cache-of-7-centuryold-baseball-cards-found-n2127968", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/62/3776bcdd-6a44-402e-8677-351b94dd4174.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "'Miraculous' cache of 7 century-old baseball cards found, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe160d\"", "article_summary": "The cards' value is sure to shift now that there are so many more in existence, and an exact figure is difficult to pin down.\nCard experts in Southern California said Wednesday that they have verified the legitimacy \u2014 and seven-figure total value \u2014 of seven identical Ty Cobb cards from the printing period of 1909 to 1911.\n\"I am not sure if any other baseball card find is more remarkable than this new discovery,\" Orlando said in a statement.\nOn a scale of 1-10, 10 being mint condition, the cards range from 3.5 to 4.5, which is high for cards that are more than a century old.\n\"I doubted they were authentic because finding seven of these cards at one place at one time seemed almost impossible,\" Snyder said."}
