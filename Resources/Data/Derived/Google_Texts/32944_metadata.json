His father, David Webber, is a retired associate professor of political science at MU.\n\n\u201cWhen I was sitting in Fallujah, the place I wanted to come back to was Boone County, it wasn\u2019t anywhere else in the world,\u201d Webber said. \u201cThe community has invested a lot in me and I want to make sure we invest in the next generation of Missourians.\u201d\n\nSchaefer was elected in 2008 and is the first Republican to represent Boone County in the Senate for two terms. Four GOP lawmakers \u2014 Reps. Caleb Jones and Caleb Rowden of Columbia, Chuck Basye of Rocheport and Dave Muntzel of Boonville \u2014 live in the 19th District.\n\nThe 19th District includes Boone and Cooper counties, with more than 90 percent of the district\u2019s constituents in Boone County.\n\nSchaefer is barred from another term under the constitution, as is Webber, who is in his fourth term in the House.
