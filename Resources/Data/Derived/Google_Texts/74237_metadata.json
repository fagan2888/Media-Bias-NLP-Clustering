It would require all family health plans to include a per-individual deductible and a per-individual out-of-pocket limit.\n\nAs of now, some family policies require individual family members to reach separate deductibles, while others make individuals reach a much larger family deductible.\n\nCovered California already requires this for plans sold on the state insurance exchange.\n\nAssembly member Rob Bonta (D-Oakland) wrote the bill, and Gov. Jerry Brown has until Oct. 11 to sign or veto it.\n\nCheck out this post on KPCC's Impatient blog, or listen to this segment on Take Two, for more information on this and other consumer health bills making their way through Sacramento.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "Assembly bill 1305 would require all family health plans to include a per-individual deductible and a per-individual out-of-pocket limit.", "title": "State legislature approves limiting family plan deductibles", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/09/10/54340/state-legislature-approves-limiting-deductibles-fo/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/83e1e6a558d42da3814230b61efdf3ca/85405-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 575}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
