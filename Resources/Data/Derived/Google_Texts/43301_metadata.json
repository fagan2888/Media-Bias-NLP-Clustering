Afterward, he lived in constant fear of what he called the \u201cdeath machines\u201d that circled above him in the sky.\n\n\u201cI see them every day and we are scared of them,\u201d he said to the Guardian. \u201cA lot of the kids in this area wake up from sleeping because of nightmares from them and some now have mental problems. They turned our area into hell and continuous horror, day and night, we even dream of them in our sleep.\u201d\n\nAnd then, on Jan. 26, a drone killed Mohammed. The Guardian asked both the CIA and the Pentagon whether they\u2019d identified the 13-year-old boy as an Al Qaeda militant. Neither agency gave a comment.\n\nIt\u2019s just the latest tragedy caused by the controversial US drone campaign.\n\nSix years ago, on Jan. 23, 2009, President Barack Obama launched his first drone strikes just three days into his presidency, killing at least nine civilians in the course of two strikes in North Waziristan.\n\nSince then, US drones have killed more than 2,400 people in strikes targeting markets, homes, funerals and even weddings, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a UK-based nonprofit. Between 2004 and 2013, drone strikes killed an estimated 2,525 to 3,613 people.\n\nIn May 2013, Obama defended the drone strikes, saying they were legal, effective, and saved American lives. He said civilian casualties would \u201chaunt\u201d him for the rest of his life, but that he needed to weigh the loss of civilian lives against the threat to life posed by terrorists.\n\nThere are doubts, though, about how effective Obama\u2019s drone campaign has been when it comes to avoiding civilian casualties and killing terrorists. Researchers found that only 12 percent of drone strike victims in Pakistan could be identified as militants and fewer than 4 percent were indentified as members of Al Qaeda. More than a third of those who were described as militants \u201cwere not designated a rank\u201d and nearly 30 percent were not even linked to a specific group.\n\nUnmanned aircraft have done more than just kill and injure thousands of civilians, according to the program\u2019s critics, which include the United Nations, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Drones terrorize and traumatize the population, forcing people to keep their children home from school, avoid large gatherings that may prove suspicious, and remain hidden, lest they be killed before proven innocent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pervasive fear for people every second of the day,\u201d said Sarah Knuckey, one of the lead researchers and editors of the 2012 report, \u201cLiving Under Drones\u201d to MSNBC. \u201cIt has a significant mental health impact for people living there.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t just listen to drone critics. Listen to the people of Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia in their own words.
