Masonite Installs USA Wood Door, as Construction Deals Rise

The purchase comes after Masonite bought National Hickman and Performance Doorset Solutions

Door manufacturer Masonite International Corp. (NYSE: DOOR) completed the $13 million purchase of privately-held USA Wood Door.

USA Wood president John Krause says the deal is logical because the company already distributes Masoniteâ€™s Algoma and Mohawk brands. In addition to distributing, Thorofare, New Jersey-based USA Wood also fabricates and resizes wooden doors, generating about $18 million in annual sales.

Masonite has been active in deal making recently. In 2015, the Tampa, Florida-based company bought National Hickman for $82 million and Performance Doorset Solutions for $16 million.

Construction deals have been on the rise as the housing market continues to recover. For example, Advent International-backed Morsco is buying Murray Supply Co.; Quanex (NYSE: NX) has plans to purchase Woodcraft Industries for $248.5 million in cash; and Summit Materials Inc. (NYSE: SUM) is acquiring LeGrand Johnson Construction Co.
