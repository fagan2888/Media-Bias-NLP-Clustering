What is worse is him thinking that he doesn\u2019t have to abide by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling because he disagrees with it.\n\nThe fact is \u2013 and the way this whole thing is set up \u2013 if the Supreme Court says something is constitutional, it is constitutional.\n\nGrade-schoolers know this stuff. Why doesn\u2019t Santorum?\n\nWe may not like what the Supreme Court says \u2013 the Hobby Lobby ruling being a case in point, or Citizens United \u2013 but it\u2019s the law of the land, period. The best we can do in response (short of a new system of government) is a Constitutional Amendment, which changes the Constitution and therefore what the Supreme Court can rule about it.\n\nBut Rick Santorum, fresh from entertaining a voter or two in Iowa, told Glenn Beck a bunch of Bartonesque BS \u2013 namely that marriage equality will force boys and girls to share locker rooms (Mike Huckabee\u2019s fantasy of showering with teenage girls becoming reality) \u2013 before he went on to claim,\n\nThis is tantamount to government establishing religion. When the United States government comes in and says this is what you are going to believe, this is how you\u2019re going to practice your faith, this is a new religion. This violates, in my opinion, the Establishment Clause in the Constitution that says that Congress shall make no law with respect to an establishment of religion. If the government goes around and tells churches what they have to believe in and what their doctrine is, that is something that is a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nFar from telling you what to believe, the Supreme Court would be telling you that you DON\u2019T HAVE TO BELIEVE what the Religious Right is selling you. It would be affirming that you have a right to your own beliefs, as opposed to having Rick Santorum\u2019s beliefs stand in for your own.\n\nWhat Santorum\u2019s claim comes down to is this: \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe what I, Rick Santorum believe, you are violating the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nUntil Rick Santorum understands the First Amendment, he should stop talking about it. You can read it for yourself. It doesn\u2019t say anything about marriage of any kind. Marriage isn\u2019t religion. To claim marriage is religion is to establish religion by forcing everybody else to accept your definition of marriage.\n\nMy fourth grader understands that. But then he\u2019s reading at a 10th to 12th grade level. Based on the available evidence \u2013 and assuming Santorum is not just obscenely dishonest \u2013 I suspect things are reversed for Santorum.\n\nTo listen to him, you would think a Supreme Court ruling in favor of marriage equality would force straight people to marry members of their own sex. They protest so much you almost wonder if that isn\u2019t secretly what they want.\n\nClearly, we could ignore Santorum simply on the basis of what CNN calls his \u201cempty diner\u201d strategy. When only one voter shows up at your campaign stop, you know you\u2019re not popular.\n\nHowever, in what passes for a political party on the right these days \u2013 but which is actually a religious cult \u2013 extremism feeds extremism, and that is the real danger in claims like these.\n\nWhat one candidate says, another has to at least match, and more often, surpass, in order to keep up with the demands of the feckless multitude. Jesus would have fed them loaves and fishes. Republican candidates feed them extremism.\n\nRick Santorum, who was pro-choice until he found it expedient to be anti-choice when he ran for office, has apparently found it expedient to be completely stupid, and to be honest, it\u2019s not working out very well for him. Unless his entire goal was to appear to be a buffoon, in which case it has worked out very well indeed.\n\nWhat is amazing is that Republican candidates can say these things without any response at all from the mainstream media.\n\nCan you imagine what would happen if President Obama announced that he would just ignore anything the Supreme Court ruled with regard the Affordable Care Act because he\u2019s the final arbiter of what is and is not constitutional? Obama, unlike Santorum, at least specializes in Constitutional Law.\n\nAnd there is precedent, after all, in Gov. Brownback of Kansas threatening to eliminate the Kansas judiciary if they rule against him. And this seems to be what Santorum is hinting at, when he says,\n\n\u201cIf they get it wrong and the consequences are what I suspect they will be toward people of faith (those consequences being a bunch of stuff David Barton made up the day before) then this president will fight back.\u201d\n\nWell, Rick, right now you are not even the president of one person in Iowa \u2013 she wouldn\u2019t endorse him till she gets all the facts \u2013 And that is more than Santorum has bothered to do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rick Santorum says says you refusing to believe what he wants you to believe is a violation of the First Amendment", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Rick Santorum says says you refusing to believe what he wants you to believe is a violation of the First Amendment", "title": "Rick Santorum Says He Decides What is Constitutional, Not the Supreme Court", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/06/11/rick-santorum-decides-constitutional-supreme-court.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Santorum-Beck.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-11T07:58:18+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,Glenn Beck,Iowa,Politics of the United States,Rick Santorum,Supreme Court,United States,United States Constitution,United States government,White House,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-06-11T07:58:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-11T07:58:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Glenn Beck, Iowa, Politics of the United States, Rick Santorum, Supreme Court, United States, United States Constitution, United States government, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e13\"", "article_summary": "What Santorum\u2019s claim comes down to is this: \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe what I, Rick Santorum believe, you are violating the First Amendment.\u201dUntil Rick Santorum understands the First Amendment, he should stop talking about it.\nThe fact is \u2013 and the way this whole thing is set up \u2013 if the Supreme Court says something is constitutional, it is constitutional.\nWe may not like what the Supreme Court says \u2013 the Hobby Lobby ruling being a case in point, or Citizens United \u2013 but it\u2019s the law of the land, period.\nThe best we can do in response (short of a new system of government) is a Constitutional Amendment, which changes the Constitution and therefore what the Supreme Court can rule about it.\nFar from telling you what to believe, the Supreme Court would be telling you that you DON\u2019T HAVE TO BELIEVE what the Religious Right is selling you."}
