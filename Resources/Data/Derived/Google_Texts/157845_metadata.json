Burwell, argue that Obamacare only provides subsidies for insurance marketplace \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d Those last four words, quoted from the law\u2019s text, are key to their argument that Obamacare cannot legally provide subsidies to states with federal exchanges:\n\nThe answer, from interviews with more than two dozen Democrats and Republicans involved in writing the law, is that the words were a product of shifting politics and a sloppy merging of different versions. Some described the words as \u201cinadvertent,\u201d \u201cinartful\u201d or \u201ca drafting error.\u201d But none supported the contention of the plaintiffs, who are from Virginia.\n\nBut Gruber, who became infamous last fall when video surfaced of him discussing the \u201cstupidity\u201d and \u201clack of economic understanding\u201d of American voters while lauding \u201clack of transparency\u201d in getting Obamacare passed, said what the plaintiffs are arguing. And without federal subsidies for millions of Americans, the law collapses.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important to remember politically about this is if you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits, but your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill,\u201d Gruber said. \u201cSo you\u2019re essentially saying to your citizens, \u2018You\u2019re going to pay all the taxes to help all the other states in the country.\u2019 I hope that that\u2019s a blatant enough political reality that states will get their act together and realize there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up these exchanges and that they\u2019ll do it, but once again, the politics can get ugly around this.\u201d\n\nGruber later told The New Republic he was speaking off the cuff and made a mistake. Gruber has used that excuse before; when he testified before Congress about his series of insulting remarks about American voters and too-honest ones about Obamacare, he repeatedly apologized for being too \u201cglib.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A New York Times article about ambiguous language on tax subsidies in the Affordable Care Act, that could derail the law, quotes multiple authors of the legislation who claim it was simply a mistake, except that's not what Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber had to say in January 2012.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A\u00a0New York Times article about ambiguous language on tax subsidies in the Affordable Care Act, which could derail the law,\u00a0quotes multiple authors of the legislation who claim it was simply a mistak", "title": "Contra NYT Report, Gruber Said States Without Exchanges Wouldn\u2019t Receive Tax Credits", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/contra-nyt-report-gruber-said-states-without-exchanges-wouldnt-receive-tax-credits/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Jonathan-Gruber1-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A\u00a0New York Times article about ambiguous language on tax subsidies in the Affordable Care Act, whic", "creator": "@DavidRutz", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Jonathan-Gruber1-150x150.jpg", "title": "Contra NYT Report, Gruber Said States Without Exchanges Wouldn\u2019t Receive Tax Credits", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Some described the words as \u201cinadvertent,\u201d \u201cinartful\u201d or \u201ca drafting error.\u201d But none supported the contention of the plaintiffs, who are from Virginia.\nAnd without federal subsidies for millions of Americans, the law collapses.\nGruber has used that excuse before; when he testified before Congress about his series of insulting remarks about American voters and too-honest ones about Obamacare, he repeatedly apologized for being too \u201cglib.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important to remember politically about this is if you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits, but your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill,\u201d Gruber said.\nBut Gruber, who became infamous last fall when video surfaced of him discussing the \u201cstupidity\u201d and \u201clack of economic understanding\u201d of American voters while lauding \u201clack of transparency\u201d in getting Obamacare passed, said what the plaintiffs are arguing."}
