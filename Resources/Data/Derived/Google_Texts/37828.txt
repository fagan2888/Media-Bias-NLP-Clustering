“Real Time” host Bill Maher last night called out Republicans’ “empathy gap” in a glorious edition of his signature “New Rules” segment.

“You can’t spend the first half of a debate bitching about how immigrants are ruining the country,” Maher began, “and the second half talking about the uplifting stories of your immigrant parents.”

“While Republicans generally do lack the empathy gene … there is an exception to this,” he continued. “They do often get on the human side of an issue when it hits them right in their own home.”

Maher first noted Dick Cheney, who’s “so conservative, he got an artificial heart just to make sure he never felt sorry for anyone.” Cheney is, however, a “big supporter of gay marriage because he has a gay daughter and he needs to stay on her good side in case she needs a kidney.”
