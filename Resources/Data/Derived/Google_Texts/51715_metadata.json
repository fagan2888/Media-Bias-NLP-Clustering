Louie Gohmert said in opening comments during a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is government waste, fraud and abuse to the extreme,\u201d Gohmert said.\n\nGohmert is referring to Interior\u2019s project to create a department-wide law enforcement database called the Incident Management, Analysis, and Reporting System, or IMARS. DOI started working on the database shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and it\u2019s supposed to help officials track \u201cuse of force reporting, weapons qualification tracking, offline incident reporting, various mapping options, and more,\u201d according to a House hearing memo.\n\nDOI hasn\u2019t fully implemented IMARS. It\u2019s only been partially rolled out and suffers from numerous issues, according to Gohmert. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials have also refused to use IMARS and won\u2019t fund the program.\n\nLawmakers are clearly not happy there\u2019s been slow progress on IMARS despite spending $50 million over more than a decade to implement the program. DOI even admitted in its 2017 budget request only 14 percent of verified, reportable incidents were put into IMARS in 2015. That\u2019s not good enough for Congress.\n\n\u201cWhile IMARs initially held major promise to help officers report and track important data, the department\u2019s implementation of the system has been slow and expensive,\u201d Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell said. \u201cWe need to know why. We need to understand.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning, IMARs was beset by problems. DOI paid Lockheed Martin $4.4 million in 2006 for \u201cfor a pilot project to develop an integrated information technology system to improve Interior\u2019s law enforcement, emergency management, and security operations.\u201d\n\nThat contractor apparently \u201cbotched the job,\u201d according to Dingell. In fact, a 2009 DOI inspector general report found \u201cthere were delays in the IMARS contract solicitation process.\u201d The IG noted \u201crepeated delays and excessive cost have caused some bureaus to lose confidence in the IMARS program and question whether it will ever be operational.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, DOI paid Niche Technology $9.9 million to finish the project, but even so IMARS has not been fully implemented across Interior\u2019s seven law enforcement agencies.\n\nHarry Humbert, the head of resource protection and emergency services at DOI, had a much rosier picture of the state of IMARS, saying the database was operational and was already improving law enforcement on federal lands.\n\n\u201cThe IMARS is now operational and allows the bureaus to readily share law enforcement information across the Department,\u201d Hubert told lawmakers, according to his prepared testimony.\n\n\u201cTo date, five of the seven Department law enforcement programs,\u201d he said. \u201cIn total, close to 4,000 of the Department\u2019s 4,900 law enforcement officers and operations personnel currently use IMARS.\u201d\n\nUpdate: An earlier version of this story stated DOI spent $15 million on IMARS, but that\u2019s just what the department spent on contractors. The actual cost of IMARS is well over $50 million, according to figures compiled by the House Committee On Natural Resources.\n\nFollow Michael on Facebook and Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
