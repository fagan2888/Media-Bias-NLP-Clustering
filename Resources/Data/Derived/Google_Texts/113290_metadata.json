Magnitude 2.9 and 2.5 temblors were also recorded Sunday near Medford.\n\nNo injuries or damage are reported.\n\nThe quakes come after 17 earthquakes were recorded in the area from Friday night through Saturday afternoon -- including magnitude 4.2 and 4.1 temblors near Medford that were reported felt in Oberlin, Kansas, some 400 miles away.\n\nThe Oklahoma Geological Survey has said many recent earthquakes in the state likely were triggered by the injection of wastewater from oil and natural gas drilling operations.\n\nNearly a dozen earthquakes have rattled parts of Oklahoma and Kansas since Friday afternoon.\n\nThe latest temblor felt in Kansas was a magnitude 4.2. The U.S Geological Survey says the quake occurred at 12:29 p.m. Saturday about 10 miles north-northwest of Medford, Oklahoma. It was the strongest of the 12 quakes to shake up the region in less than 24 hours.\n\nOf the 11 other quakes, 10 of them occurred in north-central Oklahoma. They ranged in magnitude from 2.5 to 3.5. One of them, however, was a 4.1 and also happened near Medford at 5:11 a.m..\n\nThough the two strongest Oklahoma quakes were felt in south-central Kansas, only one of them actually occurred in the Sunflower State. It was a magnitude 2.9 that hit around 1 a.m. Saturday in Harper County.\n\nClick here to see more earthquake reports.\n\nAn earthquake was reported from Oklahoma this morning.\n\nThe US Geological Survey reported a 4.1-magnitude earthquake was centered 9 miles northwest of Medford.\n\nThe strongest quake was recorded at 5:11 a.m. and viewers in Kansas could feel the quake.\n\nFive other quakes have also been reported in that area at 5:22 a.m., 5:31 a.m., 5:54 a.m., 5:55 a.m., and 6;24 a.m.\n\nFor more information, click here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A dozen earthquakes have rattled parts of Oklahoma and Kansas since Friday afternoon.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Oklahoma-earthquake-felt-in-Kansas-342407011.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/569*315/earthquake+quake+generic+ws.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A dozen earthquakes have rattled parts of Oklahoma and Kansas since Friday afternoon.", "title": "UPDATE: Series of moderate earthquakes continue in northern Oklahoma"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A dozen earthquakes have rattled parts of Oklahoma and Kansas since Friday afternoon.", "title": "UPDATE: Series of moderate earthquakes continue in northern Oklahoma", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Oklahoma-earthquake-felt-in-Kansas-342407011.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/earthquake+quake+generic+ws.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "UPDATE: Series of moderate earthquakes continue in northern Oklahoma", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Series of moderate earthquakes"}, "article_summary": "A series of moderate earthquakes continues to shake northern Oklahoma, near the Kansas border.\nThough the two strongest Oklahoma quakes were felt in south-central Kansas, only one of them actually occurred in the Sunflower State.\nThe U.S Geological Survey says the quake occurred at 12:29 p.m. Saturday about 10 miles north-northwest of Medford, Oklahoma.\nOne of them, however, was a 4.1 and also happened near Medford at 5:11 a.m..\nNearly a dozen earthquakes have rattled parts of Oklahoma and Kansas since Friday afternoon."}
