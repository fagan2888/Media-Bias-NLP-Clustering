(New Boston Post photo by Kara Bettis)\n\nNEWTON \u2013 While many Massachusetts campuses have become battlegrounds over acceptable forms of expression \u2013 such as what constitutes \u201chate speech\u201d or should be considered \u201csafe spaces\u201d \u2013 resistance to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d has also cropped up in what amounts to a debate over a fundamental American freedom.\n\nEven President Barack Obama commented at a town hall in September that he didn\u2019t agree that \u201cstudents at colleges have to be coddled or protected from different points of view.\u201d\n\nBOSTON COLLEGE\n\nAround 100 students and faculty packed a Boston College lecture hall April 5 to hear civil liberties lawyer Harvey Silverglate and BC law professor Kent Greenfield debate the moral and social implications of hate speech in the context of Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cCounter speech,\u201d or verbally rebutting hateful or offensive remarks, Greenfield argued, isn\u2019t the silver bullet against hate speech that many make it out to be.\n\nGreenfield said that allowing hate speech to go unpunished could encourage similar expressions, such as racist remarks, or lead to violence. But Silverglate warned that punishing hateful comments could lead to a dangerous silencing of those who make disagreeable statements that offend others and a muffling of honest debate over controversial subjects.\n\nBoth sides acknowledged exceptions under the law, but differed on how today\u2019s disagreements over what constitutes acceptable speech should be handled in a college or university setting, and to what extent talk can be controlled on campus or in a classroom.\u201cThere is no confidence on campus today about who likes you and who does not,\u201d Silverglate said. \u201cIf you prevent the punks from voicing their punkishness \u2013 you\u2019ve made a terrible mistake.\u201d\n\nHe added that he thought it was \u201cbackwards\u201d that the same speech can be uttered off campus with impunity but punished if made within the confines of an academic setting. Silverglate helped start the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which espouses free speech.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to control their souls, you want to mold their minds,\u201d Silverglate said of college students. \u201cYou can\u2019t inhibit what they say.\u201d\n\nUMASS AMHERST\n\nFaculty members at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst gathered April 8 to discuss whether to pass a resolution to ban \u201chate speech\u201d on campus but free-speech advocates won a delay, buying time to press their argument that such a ban isn\u2019t necessary and would be hazardous.\n\nSut Jhally, a communication professor at the state school, called the resolution \u201ca dangerous overreaction\u201d and questioned whether it was the appropriate response to such incidents.\n\n\u201cIf I were an untenured younger teacher I would think twice about teaching a controversial issue,\u201d he told the Springfield Republican newspaper\u2019s MassLive.com website.\n\nConcern\u2019s arose on campus in response to incidents that began in 2014 and have continued into this year. Recently, the school was among several universities targeted by an off-campus hack attack that caused library printers to spew out anti-Semitic posters. In another incident, the words \u201cstop Islam\u201d were found written in chalk at the Fine Arts Center.\n\nSeeking a structured way to address controversial topics, a handful students have formed the University Union, modeled after Oxford University\u2019s Oxford Union debate society in the U.K.\n\nLed by junior Owen Wiggins, 21, from Norwell, Massachusetts, the group hosted their third debate on April 12, looking at affirmative action. The forum featured Randall Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor, and Peter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, a group that advocates for free speech on campus.\n\nWiggins started the Union after realizing UMass lacked a formal debate club, and that many lectures he attended seemed unbalanced.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether they are conservative or liberal. There\u2019s not a lot of debate, just one-sided lectures,\u201d Wiggins said in a recent interview. \u201cThe point of the University Union is to expose students to ideas they might not necessarily support, to learn from those ideas. You hear ideas you don\u2019t agree with, and then hear someone respond to them.\u201d\n\nHe added a favorite quote from John Stuart Mill, the 19th century philosopher who proverbially remarked that, \u201cHe who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.\u201d\n\nWiggins disputes the notion that freedom of speech and expression represents a threat to minority rights or related values.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the opposite of diversity and inclusion is free speech,\u201d he said.\n\nOpponents of the UMass faculty resolution won a postponement of the vote until month\u2019s end.\n\nRELATED: Massachusetts college students resist politically correct campus culture\n\nWilliams College in Williamstown also hosts a student-led group, Uncomfortable Learning, to bring speakers with controversial views to campus. But several of their events have been canceled because of student protests or by administrative action.\n\nHARVARD UNIVERSITY\n\nIn Cambridge, tensions over various demands by Harvard University students, including over issues such as the crest long used by Harvard Law School, have drawn some criticism by others who say they\u2019re being shut out or that administrators employ double standards.\n\nRELATED: Amid activism, some Harvard Law students feel silenced\n\nMembers of an advocacy group known as Reclaim Harvard Law School have occupied a student lounge at the Ivy League institution since February to press their demands, which include the implementation of a critical race theory program, lower tuition rates for students of color and those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and the creation of a committee on diversity and inclusion. The group also joined others in the community to get the school to dump its seal, which reflects the coat of arms of an 18th century family whose wealth came partly from slavery.\n\nBill Barlow, a third-year law student from Los Angeles, has pushed for what he calls his right to free speech and has been outspoken in criticizing the Reclaim group. On a wall in the occupied student lounge, Barlow earlier this month put up his own posters, one of which read: \u201cReclaim = Trump: Both Support a Racist Ideology, Both Support Censorship of Dissent.\u201d It was removed.\n\nHe claims he put up more than 60 posters that activists removed. He\u2019s detailed the timeline of events at the Harvard Law Record.\n\n\u201cI have an underlying disagreement with Reclaim\u2019s ideology and goals, I think it has a negative impact on academic freedom,\u201d Barlow, 26, said. \u201cI think that if you don\u2019t exercise your rights you\u2019re apt to slowly lose them.\u201d\n\nHe added that many students won\u2019t vocally disagree or voice their opinions at the law school for fear of being ostracized by the activists.\n\n\u201cPeople stay silent long enough that just becomes codified. I decided that I needed to exercise that right and part of that was engaging with Reclaim,\u201d Barlow said.\n\nHe said he was not happy with the administration\u2019s response, which was to prevent the activists to remove his posters.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken a faculty meeting, 68 signs, multiple emails, a Record article to take any action on signs being taken down for free speech,\u201d he said.\n\nContact Kara Bettis at [email protected] or on Twitter @karabettis.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/04/16/demands-for-safe-spaces-lead-to-campus-debates/", "article_author_name": "Kara Bettis", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/BC-FREE-SPEECH-1.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "American freedom, boston, Boston College, campus controversies, colleges, free speech, Harvard University, hate speech, Massachusetts, political correctness, universities, university of massachusetts"}, "description": "While many Massachusetts campuses have become battlegrounds over acceptable forms of expression \u2013 such as what constitutes \u201chate speech\u201d or should be considered", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/BC-FREE-SPEECH-1.jpg"}, "keywords": "political correctness,hate speech,boston,american freedom,boston college,campus controversies,colleges,free speech,harvard university,massachusetts,universities,university of massachusetts", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Demands for \u2018safe\u2019 spaces lead to campus debatesPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/04/16/demands-for-safe-spaces-lead-to-campus-debates/Boston College's Kent Greenfield, left, listens as Harvey Silverglate discusses the issue of free speech on campus.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the opposite of diversity and inclusion is free speech,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken a faculty meeting, 68 signs, multiple emails, a Record article to take any action on signs being taken down for free speech,\u201d he said.\nHe\u2019s detailed the timeline of events at the Harvard Law Record.\nSilverglate helped start the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which espouses free speech."}
