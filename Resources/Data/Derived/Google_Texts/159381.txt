Donald Trump shared his surefire plan for victory with reporters on Wednesday, saying: "I'm a complainer, I complain and I complain, I whine and I whine, until I win, then I win."

The Republican presidential candidate said the only thing constant in the race is "Trump," and “he's not going anywhere.” Since he has "a lot of money," Trump also won't be accepting funds from anyone. "I turned down $5 million last week," he said. "I said, 'I don't want your money.' I think it resonates with people."

Trump said the United States is "run by people who are not very good at what they do, they are incompetent," and it's up to him to "win for the American people." What can you expect from President Trump? "We're going to take care of this country," he said. "Get rid of ObamaCare and come up with something spectacular." Catherine Garcia
