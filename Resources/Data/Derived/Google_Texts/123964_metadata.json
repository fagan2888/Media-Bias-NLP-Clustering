The polite 26-year-old from Muncie, Indiana, has terrorized opposing quarterbacks, particularly in the second half of the season. His career-high 13 1/2 sacks this year are tied for fifth-most in the NFL, and his five forced fumbles \u2014 including a textbook strip-sack in Saturday\u2019s 27-24 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles \u2014 are tied for the most by any player in the league.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Kerrigan was selected only as an alternate for the Pro Bowl, prompting several players to take to Twitter and express both shock and frustration at what they believed to be a snub. Washington\u2019s coaching staff agreed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed. I think he is also,\u201d defensive coordinator Jim Haslett said. \u201cIt comes with winning and losing, I guess. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d\n\nKerrigan\u2019s productivity has been especially impressive given the dearth of complementary pass-rushers on the Redskins\u2019 defense this season. Three-time Pro Bowler Brian Orakpo, who was supposed to start opposite Kerrigan, tore his pectoral muscle in late October. Defensive end Jason Hatcher, who recorded 11 sacks for the Dallas Cowboys last year, has been both ineffective and injury-prone.\n\nYet through it all, Kerrigan has still managed to notch a sack in five consecutive games, becoming the first Redskins player since 1991 to achieve such a feat.\n\n\u201cWhen teams play us, I think he is probably the first guy they think of as far as rushing the passer,\u201d Gruden said last week. \u201cHe is a great kid, great player and great competitor, and he\u2019s one of those guys that just fits in a great core of guys that we\u2019d like to have here for a long time.\u201d\n\nKerrigan bruised his right wrist in a loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Nov. 30, and his play has steadily improved as the wrist has improved. But the fourth-year player says he\u2019s also changed his mental approach in the second half of the season after a conversation with outside linebackers coach Brian Baker.\n\nFollowing a Week 11 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Baker told Kerrigan that he was looking cautious in his rushes. \u201cDon\u2019t let the fear of failure override the chance of success,\u201d Baker told him.\n\n\u201cThat kind of resonated with me, because I was playing tentative a little bit. And ever since then, I\u2019ve just kind of let it go,\u201d Kerrigan said. \u201cSometimes I\u2019d get caught up in making sure the quarterback was contained, kind of slowing my rushes to make them a little less effective. But ever since Bake told me that, I\u2019ve kind of just not gotten so caught up in that. [I\u2019m] just rushing.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Kerrigan, multiple players and coaches used the same word: relentless. It describes not only his work ethic in the film room and practice, but also his rushing style on Sundays.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been consistent since he\u2019s been here, from Day 1 when he started as a rookie,\u201d Haslett said last week. \u201cAnd he\u2019s getting better and better with rush game moves, using his hands \u2014 getting away from that rip technique that he has, onto different things. And I think he\u2019s going to be much better as we go on.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s younger pass-rushers have taken notice. Murphy, who was placed on injured reserve Tuesday with a broken hand, said that he views Kerrigan, his neighbor in the locker room, as a role model. Jeffcoat, another rookie who is expected to start opposite Kerrigan on Sunday, agreed.\n\n\u201c[I\u2019m] just trying to see what he does and emulate things,\u201d Jeffcoat said. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to watch him all season on film, sitting there and seeing what he does, seeing how he sets guys up, seeing how he can pick up grown men and move them to the side. It\u2019s just cool to watch him do that stuff. I can add some things from his game to mine, and that helps.\u201d\n\nKerrigan\u2019s 13 1/2 sacks this season put him in the company of several Redskins greats, including Dexter Manley, Ken Harvey and Charles Mann. His regular-season sack total would rank among the top-five in the NFL in four of the past five seasons, and he still has one game remaining.\n\nThere is a fine line between great pass-rushers and elite pass-rushers, and sack numbers go a long way toward establishing those reputations. Kerrigan said sacks are \u201csuch a funny thing\u201d because there are so many factors involved in recording one, from the secondary\u2019s coverage to the defense\u2019s play-call, but pass-rushers are ultimately defined by them.\n\n\u201cSometimes you get a lot of pressures and hits and you don\u2019t get sacks,\u201d Haslett said. \u201cRyan\u2019s getting both of them right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kerrigan has 13 1/2 sacks this season, a career-high that ranks fifth in the NFL.
