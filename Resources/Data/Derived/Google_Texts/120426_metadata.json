However, at about 11 a.m., the weather service showed the river slightly rising.\n\nWeather service meteorologist Dave Tomalak said there will be a slight chance of afternoon showers in the mountains on Monday and Tuesday but expects the storm will completely clear the area by Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere might be a very slight chance of showers over the metro area later this week but it does look like today will be the worst of it,\u201d Tomalak said. \u201cToday will be the last really big push of this widespread precipitation.\u201d\n\nRain is expected to continue through the day, with accumulations of 2-inches in some areas throughout the foothills and high country, but relief is in sight, according to the weather service.\n\ntom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a6e\"", "article_summary": "Flash flood warnings were in place in all or portions of the following counties: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield and Denver.\nBy the end of Sunday total rainfall amounts could increase by between 1 and 4 inches, according to the weather service.\nAs the rain continued to pound the region, the weather service issued the flash flood watch until 4:30 p.m. for the Front Range foothills and adjacent plains.\nA flash flood warnings for the Fourmile Canyon burn scar in Boulder County and other areas around the region were issued Sunday by the National Weather Service in Boulder.\nWhile a lot of rivers in the flood area are receding, Louis said flooding is still possible."}
