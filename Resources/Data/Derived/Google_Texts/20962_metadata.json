Ortiz, ranked No. 1 in 5A, won a 3-0 decision as the Eagles took second in the team race. ( Cliff Grassmick )\n\nLAFAYETTE -- The idea was to prove a point.\n\nAfter a weekend at the Top of the Rockies tournament that always plays out tougher than state when one factors in the multiple classifications and visitors from out of state, Thompson Valley's wrestling team hit its target.\n\n\"I think they started making a name for themselves last week at Arvada West, then it trickled into here,\" TVHS coach Dave Juergensen said. \"Coming into a tournament like this, which in my opinion is tougher than state, I think they made a big name for themselves.\"\n\nThe Eagles walked out of the Centaurus gym in second place with 155.5 points as Arvada West took the title with 202. The Eagles finished better than any other 4A team, including top-ranked Broomfield (144) as more than half of the lineup placed in the draw.\n\nThe Eagles had one finalist on the day, freshman Mike Berg, who has been back in the lineup for just two weeks after suffering an injury in the early going. Ranked a modest ninth in 4A at 152 pounds, it's a number that is sure to rise as he took down three ranked wrestlers on his trek to the finals. Among them was Arvada West's Taylor Bergquist, ranked third in 5A, with a 6-5 decision in the quarterfinals.\n\nIn his final match, he faced Rocky Mountain's Ramon Ortiz, ranked No. 1 in 5A and having beaten Berg by technical fall early in the season. Berg lost 3-0 in the championship, but the result represented growth in his eyes.\n\n\"I don't like to lose, but I'm pretty proud of keeping it within a few points this time,\" Berg said. \"Overall, I'm feeling all right.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBerg started the season in the lineup and then sustained an injury that kept him out six weeks. With all the mat time he's had over the years, he felt getting back in the flow wasn't difficult. For him, it will be fine-tuning things to be at his peak at the end of the season.\n\nPlacing so high at the Top of the Rockies was a huge boost, he said.\n\n\"It helps a lot. I've been wrestling for such a long time, it doesn't take too long to get back into it,\" he said. \"The coaches have done a really good job trying to push me in practice and keep my intensity up to where I was at the beginning of the season.\"\n\nThompson Valley s Parker Simington keeps control of Carlos Salazar of Kelly Walsh (Wyo.) in their 145-pound match for third place at the Top of the Rockies. Simington pinned Salazar in 3:24. ( Cliff Grassmick )\n\nIn certain draws, you take what you can get. Ben Hewson took fifth at 138, which may not catch one's eye, but it was how he earned that medal that stands out. After losing in the quarters, his reward was a match with defending state champ Isaac Naro of Pueblo South. Hewson, ranked third, had never faced Naro, never even seen him wrestle. But with the match tied at 1 late in the third after Hewson fought to stay out of a cradle for 45 seconds, he hit the winning takedown on the edge of the mat as time expired.\n\nAfter that, it was No. 1 in 5A, Danny Murphy of Rocky Mountain, who won a 7-5 decision. Still, Hewson walked away from the tournament with a newfound confidence for the stretch run.\n\n\"It's incredibly tough, the whole tournament,\" Hewson said. \"I knew coming in my bracket was just going to be really tough, so I set my goals up to place. I knew Naro was there, and when I got the opportunity to wrestle him, I was really stoked. I really wanted that match this weekend. I really wanted to beat him. He's been on my list for awhile, so beating him is just awesome.\"\n\nParker Simington took third at 145, while Morgan Fogg (106), Jake Schwarz (160) and David Eusea (182) all placed fifth, with Patton Graff sixth at 195. Putting seven of the 13 wrestlers on the podium was a chore, one Juergensen knows his team will use to bolster their final run.\n\n\"We're moving in the right direction,\" he said. \"We still don't have everyone doing their part, but I think we'll get there by the end of the season.\"\n\nTylar Francis took sixth at 120, Roosevelt's only placer. It was a tough weekend for coach Darren Hankins' young team, but his goal is they came away with some valuable lessons.\n\n\"I think probably a lot of these young kids, it's setting an expectation of setting the caliber of the level they have to be at, the improvements they have to make going into the next few weeks as well as going into next year,\" Hankins said. \"It's one of those tournaments that you kind of see -- and hopefully they watch the wrestling -- what it takes to wrestle at this level.\"\n\nMike Brohard can be reached at 635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and @mbrohard and @RHpreps\n\nTop of the Rockies At Centaurus HS\n\nTeam scores -- Arvada West 202, Thompson Valley 155.5, Broomfield 144, Rocky Mountain 130, Cheyenne East (Wyo.) 129, Cherry Creek 125.5, Pomona 117, Scottsbluff (Neb.) 115, Omaha North (Neb.) 114, Omaha North (Neb.) 114, Grand Island (Neb.) 106.5, Pueblo South 105.5, Brush 98, Ponderosa 92.5, Rio Rancho (N.M.) 83.5, Mountain Range 79, Fort Morgan 74, Fort Lupton 69, Legacy 54.5, Holy Family 54, Brighton 50.5, Greeley West 49, Kelly Walsh (Wyo.) 47.5, Mead 43, Cheyenne Central (Wyo.) 41.5, Alamosa 37, Bennet 33.5, Roosevelt 27, Grand Junction Central 26, Denver East 21, Centaurus 11, Durango 10.\n\nChampionship matches 106 -- Tomas Guiterrez, Pomona, d.
