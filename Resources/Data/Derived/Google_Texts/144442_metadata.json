Take this morning , for example.\n\nThe U.S. economy grew at a 5.0% annual pace in the third quarter, matching the best performance since the third quarter of 2003. The increase in real gross domestic product was revised up from 3.9%, mainly because of consumer spending and business investment, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted GDP would be revised up to a seasonally adjusted 4.4%. Consumer spending, the main source of economic activity, was revised up to 3.2% from 2.2%.\n\nRemember, GDP growth at 3.9% looked pretty good when the preliminary tally was released a month ago. But 5% growth is amazing \u2013 and the strongest growth Americans have seen in 11 years.\n\nAlso keep in mind, all of this covers just the third quarter \u2013 July through September \u2013 which came before the sharp drop in gas prices. In other words, there\u2019s ample reason to be optimistic about the fourth quarter, too.\n\nAs for the politics of the economy\u2019s sharp improvement, it seems Republicans are going to struggle quite a bit to explain these developments.\n\nAs we discussed a month ago, GOP lawmakers have invested enormous amounts of energy pushing a very specific case: the combination of the Affordable Care Act, federal regulations, Dodd-Frank reforms, and higher taxes approved last year are a brutal \u201cwet blanket\u201d on economic growth. It\u2019s all proof, they claim, that President Obama\u2019s economic agenda has been a disaster for the country.\n\nAnd in light of the recent jobs boom and the strongest economic growth in 11 years, the Republican talking points are starting to look a little silly.\n\nBefore we move on, let\u2019s also note, in case GOP officials try to suggest there\u2019s a connection between their election and the growth surge, the third quarter economic report points to data that ended in September \u2013 before anyone knew what the election results would be.\n\nI\u2019m also trying to imagine what the political world\u2019s conversation would look like right now if we were in the second year of the Romney presidency. One can only assume there would be parades organized in the Republican hero\u2019s honor and \u201cMitt\u201d would suddenly become a popular name in conservative households.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "President Obama's argument about an \"American Resurgence\" is looking increasingly credible.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/us-economic-growth-soars-reaches-11-year-high", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "President Obama's argument about an \"American Resurgence\" is looking increasingly credible.", "title": "U.S. economic growth soars, reaches 11-year high", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/us-economic-growth-soars-reaches-11-year-high", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/12.23.14_tease.jpg?itok=IpkTLaLf", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/us-economic-growth-soars-reaches-11-year-high", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/12.23.14_tease.jpg?itok=4bE0U50M", "title": "U.S. economic growth soars, reaches 11-year high", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President Obama's argument about an \"American Resurgence\" is looking increasingly credible."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-23T09:10:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "U.S. economic growth soars, reaches 11-year high", "tags": "democrats,economy,gdp,rachel-maddow-show-charts,republicans,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "12/23/2014 09:10:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/us-economic-growth-soars-reaches-11-year-high"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "President Obama's argument about an \"American Resurgence\" is looking increasingly credible.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Economy, Republicans, GDP, Rachel Maddow Show Charts"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd62a6\"", "article_summary": "But 5% growth is amazing \u2013 and the strongest growth Americans have seen in 11 years.\nAnd in light of the recent jobs boom and the strongest economic growth in 11 years, the Republican talking points are starting to look a little silly.\nIt\u2019s all proof, they claim, that President Obama\u2019s economic agenda has been a disaster for the country.\nConsumer spending, the main source of economic activity, was revised up to 3.2% from 2.2%.\nAs we discussed a month ago, GOP lawmakers have invested enormous amounts of energy pushing a very specific case: the combination of the Affordable Care Act, federal regulations, Dodd-Frank reforms, and higher taxes approved last year are a brutal \u201cwet blanket\u201d on economic growth."}
