UNC staff worked with Army officials at Fort Bragg to figure out how to translate troops\u2019 medical experience into jobs.\n\n\u201cNothing I\u2019ve done really translates over [to civilian jobs] beyond basic EMT,\u201d said Manning, who served 15 years in the Navy and five more in the Army. \u201cTrying to find something in the medical field without any credentials, without any licensure is tough. There\u2019s nothing out there.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. military veteran Dave Manning served two combat deployments in Iraq and was the sole medical provider for more than 100 people on a Navy ship. But as he contemplated his post-military job prospects, he struggled.\n\nManning\u2019s story is becoming more common as the U.S. winds down wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it\u2019s especially important for North Carolina, which is home to eight military bases, including some of the country\u2019s largest installations. Manning has experience that can\u2019t be found in a classroom, and some in the UNC medical community wanted to capitalize on that.\n\n\u201cThe medics and the corpsmen are often very skilled in acute medical care of younger people,\u201d said Paul Chelminski, the director of UNC\u2019s new Physician Assistant Program. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely skilled in trauma care if they\u2019ve been deployed.\u201d\n\nBut Chelminski said there are some gaps in the veterans\u2019 ability to diagnose and manage chronic illness, which is a large part of civilian health care. UNC\u2019s program will fill in those gaps. The program will also accept some field experience in lieu of other, more standard, training.\n\nThe insurance company Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina is donating $1.2 million to help launch the training program and provide scholarships. North Carolina Blue Cross CEO Brad Wilson said the program will also help with a growing need for primary-care providers in the state as more people get insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe customers who are accessing the health-care system through the ACA are using more services than any other groups,\u201d he said. \u201cMany are in need of primary care, and the physician assistant plays a key role in delivering high-quality, high-value health care.\u201d\n\nPhysician assistants work under the supervision of doctors but still diagnose and treat patients.\n\nThe first class is underway with 20 students, including nine veterans. The program is open to students of all backgrounds and takes two years to complete. Chelminski said this first class has an extraordinary amount of clinical experience compared to the national average. Its members are also a few years older than what is typical, with an average age of 33.\n\nUNC research shows many troops with medical training are more interested in becoming a physician assistant than a doctor, and Manning, who is 43, said he is definitely in that camp.\n\n\u201cAs I was coming out of the military in my early 40s, I didn\u2019t want to spend a decade training and being in school,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to get in and get out, and physician assistant is perfect for that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new training program helps them find health-care jobs back home by filling in the gaps in their medical knowledge.", "author": "Michael Tomsic", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A new training program helps them find civilian health-care jobs by filling in the gaps in their medical knowledge.", "title": "When Military Medics Return Home", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/01/RTR2UPJN/facebook.jpg?1452709869", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/01/military-medics-physician-assistants/423981/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The insurance company Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina is donating $1.2 million to help launch the training program and provide scholarships.\nUNC staff worked with Army officials at Fort Bragg to figure out how to translate troops\u2019 medical experience into jobs.\n\u201cThe medics and the corpsmen are often very skilled in acute medical care of younger people,\u201d said Paul Chelminski, the director of UNC\u2019s new Physician Assistant Program.\n\u201cI just wanted to get in and get out, and physician assistant is perfect for that.\u201d\nManning\u2019s story is becoming more common as the U.S. winds down wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it\u2019s especially important for North Carolina, which is home to eight military bases, including some of the country\u2019s largest installations."}
