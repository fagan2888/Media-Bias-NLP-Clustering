(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s not just about having a winning smile.\n\nMichigan\u2019s kids in families with low incomes, seniors and pregnant women are not getting the dental care they need to stay healthy, a new report concludes.\n\nTroubled chompers can lead to other serious problems.\n\nKids with dental pain miss more school and have poorer grades. Pregnant women can pass along bacteria responsible for dental cavities to their infants during birth. Worse, poor oral health has been linked to preterm births.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that oral health disparities still exist despite efforts to combat this problem,\u201d said Karlene Ketola, executive director of the Michigan Oral Health Coalition, which helped release the report, \u201cOral Health in Michigan.\u201d\n\nThe report found that despite more people with dental insurance and an improving economy, problems persist. It was conducted by the University at Albany, State University of New York, for the Michigan Council for Maternal and Child Health.\n\nFor example, nearly two out of three children insured by Medicaid did not have dental care in 2013, despite qualifying for the service. Three out of four new mothers did not receive any care during their most recent pregnancy in 2008. Additionally, nearly half of seniors living in long-term care facilities in 2010 had not seen a dentist in the prior year.\n\nThe Capital area is lucky enough to have strong \u201csafety net\u201d clinics for the uninsured, including a clinic at the Ingham County Health Department and clinics in Charlotte and St. Johns opened in 2010 and 2011, said Kim Singh, director of community and governmental affairs for the Michigan Community Dental Clinic, which operates the Charlotte and St. Johns clinics.\n\nThat\u2019s helped expand care for the uninsured, especially for adults in recent years.\n\nStill, not all are being served, Singh said.\n\n\u201cI think the more we can highlight this the better,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThe mouth is the gateway to the body. We\u2019re finding out more and more just how important access to a dentist and dental home is.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s harder for families struggling with transportation to get appointments and Singh said that adults with access to the dentist are more likely to make sure their kids get to the dentist.\n\nThe state has also invested in a Healthy Kids Dental program, which offers additional payments to private dentists to accept kids on Medicaid. Only Wayne, Oakland and Kent counties do not have it, though the budget year that starts Oct. 1 budget will expand the program for kids up to age 12 in those counties. Ingham County was added at the end of 2013.\n\nMichigan also has two dental schools (University of Michigan and University of Detroit Mercy) and 10 dental hygienist schools, including one Lansing Community College. Those produce a steady stream of dental health professionals.\n\nAnd the Healthy Michigan Plan, the expanded Medicaid plan passed as part of the federal Affordable Care Act, included dental services.\n\nDespite those advantages, the report will be used by the Michigan Council on Maternal and Child Health to start a discussion on what can be done to close the identified gaps, said Amy Zaagman, the group\u2019s executive director.\n\n\u201cWe will be engaging stakeholders over the coming months to identify the key policy changes to impact the access picture as well as educating and raising awareness about the need to take action,\u201d Zaagman said.\n\nImmediate takeaways? Don\u2019t skip your dental visits, especially if you are pregnant. Call your health department to find out how to get your kids to a dentist if they aren\u2019t going. Ask about dental care for your loved one in a long-term care facility.\n\nFor lawmakers and Gov. Rick Snyder, pat yourselves on the back for including dental in the Healthy Michigan Plan and for expanding Healthy Kids Dental to all 83 counties (though teens in the final three counties deserve coverage, too), but don\u2019t let up.\n\nThere\u2019s more that just a smile at stake.\n\nFind the report online at www.mcmch.org\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1MfPzif", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The report, \"Oral Health in Michigan,\" found that despite more people with dental insurance and an improving economy, problems persist.
