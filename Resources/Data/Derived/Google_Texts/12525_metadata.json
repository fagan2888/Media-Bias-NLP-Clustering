Year-over-year, China\u2019s holdings rose 11.3% from $1.183 trillion.\n\nThe $1.317 trillion figure exceeds China\u2019s previous record high in July 2011 of $1.315 trillion, according to the government data.\n\nChina\u2019s appetite for government debt has been driven by its huge amount of foreign-exchange reserves, which surged to a record of $3.82 trillion at the end of 2013. The demand for Treasurys does not appear to have been seriously eroded by concerns about the U.S. fiscal situation.\n\nIn recent months, the U.S. has managed to slash the federal deficit thanks to higher tax revenue and payments from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

This group of countries held about $290.9 billion of Treasury securities in November, down from $291.9 billion in October.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/MARKETS,/FOX BUSINESS/MARKETS/China,/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/Government Spending,/FOX BUSINESS/MARKETS/Bonds,/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-09 06:35:54 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2014/01/16/china-now-owns-record-1317t-us-government-debt.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/politics/2014/01/16/china-now-owns-record-1317t-us-government-debt/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452382556275.jpg?ve=1", "description": "China continues to display an appetite for U.S. government debt, expanding its holdings of Treasurys to a record of $1.317 trillion in November.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "China Now Owns a Record $1.317T of U.S. Government Debt"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/MARKETS\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/MARKETS/China\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/Government Spending\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/MARKETS/Bonds\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS\"],\"author\":\"Matt Egan\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"China Now Owns a Record $1.317T of U.S. Government Debt\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/politics/2014/01/16/china-now-owns-record-1317t-us-government-debt/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452382556275.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-16T17:15:29Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2014/01/16/china-now-owns-record-1317t-us-government-debt.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"809d71b2-eed9-4b9b-82ad-5b1125a4913d\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "China continues to display an appetite for U.S. government debt, expanding its holdings of Treasurys to a record of $1.317 trillion in November.", "dc.description": "China continues to display an appetite for U.S. government debt, expanding its holdings of Treasurys to a record of $1.317 trillion in November.", "dc.identifier": "809d71b2-eed9-4b9b-82ad-5b1125a4913d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "classification-isa": "markets,chinamarkets,bonds", "prism.channel": "fbn", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "politics", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "China Now Owns A Record $1.317t Of U.s.
