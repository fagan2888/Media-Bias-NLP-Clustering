Asked about a gleaming \u201cExcalibur\u201d hanging on a wall in his office, Mr. Sanders made it clear he knows his reputation.\n\n\u201cThat is from Ross Perot,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cHe said: \u2018When media gives you a problem, take it out! Threaten them!\u2019 \u201d (It was actually a gift for his work on the veterans bill.)\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s disdain for the things he views as unimportant is matched by his single-minded focus on the things he says are of real consequence, like the future of Social Security.\n\nAt the Democratic caucus lunches, at which he is a fixture, \u201call he ever talks about is Social Security,\u201d one congressional aide said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even try to relate it to the topic at hand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat focus was on display a few weeks ago when, on an especially slow day in the Senate with only a minor vote on the schedule, caucus members piled onto buses for a White House meeting with President Obama. Looking around the room, Mr. Obama was surprised to see Mr. Sanders.\n\n\u201cBernie?\u201d he said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be out in New Hampshire?\u201d There was a chuckle, and then the president asked Mr. Sanders what was on his mind.\n\n\u201cSocial Security,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.\n\nWhile Mr. Sanders takes pride in his record of providing for his home state, Mr. Leahy made it clear that when it comes to bringing money back home to Vermont, \u201cI\u2019m usually the one who does that.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders \u201cis more interested in the larger macroeconomic issues,\u201d said Eric L. Davis, a political science professor at Middlebury College in Vermont.\n\nAsked about his legislative accomplishments over a congressional career that includes 14 years in the House and eight in the Senate, Mr. Sanders cited some amendments that passed the House, and several more recent highlights. One was getting billions of dollars of investment in energy-efficient technologies as part of the stimulus bill. Another was inserting $11 billion for community health centers in the Affordable Care Act and tripling funding for the National Health Service Corps, which forgives debts for medical students who commit to working in underserved fields and communities.\n\nHe acknowledged that he has gotten little attention for what he has done. \u201cThis is the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI work in areas that nobody knows what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nThe way he sees it, his career has not been that of a gadfly on the margins of Congress, but rather that of a moral force pulling the mainstream toward his positions.\n\n\u201cStay with me on this one because this is important,\u201d Mr. Sanders said as he sat in an armchair under Excalibur. Passing legislation is \u201creal,\u201d he said, but so is influencing opinion over the long term by speaking out early and often.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI am a voice,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody talks about income inequality. Well, check it out. Find out who was talking about it 20 years ago.\u201d\n\nWith the aid of a yellow legal pad on his lap, he went through a litany of instances in which his opposition to an issue now positions him in the Democratic mainstream.\n\nHe voted against the Defense of Marriage Act (\u201cPresident Clinton signed it, everyone was for it\u201d), the deregulation of Wall Street (\u201cCheck the record! Do it. Go to YouTube, look up \u2018Bernie Sanders, Alan Greenspan\u2019 \u201d), the war in Iraq, the Patriot Act and welfare reform. On all the issues, he suggested, he has moved the party.\n\nBut Mr. Sanders has been more of an outlier than a leader throughout his congressional career. When he was a congressman, elected as an independent, and House Democrats decided to allow him to caucus with them to increase their depleted numbers, Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico called him \u201ca homeless waif\u201d and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts bemoaned his \u201cholier-than-thou attitude.\u201d\n\nSince his election to the Senate in 2006, Mr. Sanders has become more reliable in his alignment with the Democrats, though he was a determined, and effective, opponent to Mr. Obama\u2019s effort to reach a grand bargain on the budget in 2011 because of the possibility of cutting Social Security.\n\nTom Coburn, the former Republican senator from Oklahoma, who was also a part of those budget negotiations as a member of the bipartisan Gang of Six, said that Mr. Sanders had a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d approach to legislating. He recalled the time he held up one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s bills in the Senate.\n\nFirst Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018If you\u2019re going to hold my bill, I\u2019m not going to negotiate with you.\u2019 And I said: \u2018That\u2019s fine, I\u2019m holding your bill then. If you want to adjust your bill and meet some of our concerns, then I\u2019ll be happy to work with you,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Coburn said. \u201cBut he never once did want to do that.\u201d\n\nWhen Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a moderate Democratic member of the Gang of Six working for the budget deal, was asked if Mr. Sanders understood the give-and-take of legislating, he smiled and said, \u201cYou always know where he stands,\u201d before disappearing into an elevator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDemocrats often left their weekly caucus lunch fuming over Mr. Sanders\u2019s latest immovable stance.\n\n\u201cI know there are other people who are kind of resentful of that, who sit down with Republicans and make a whole lot of concessions before the debate begins,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s not my style.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders is now the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, and as such would generally be expected to lead the tense and consequential budget negotiations this fall.\n\nBut according to congressional aides familiar with the Senate Democratic leadership\u2019s thinking, they have no intention of letting someone so averse to compromise lead the talks.\n\nMr. Sanders disagrees. He pointed to the compromise he struck on the veterans bill in June 2014 with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.\n\nMr. McCain compared the negotiations to an invective-strewn World Wrestling Federation match, but added: \u201cI didn\u2019t resent that at all. I respected it as a matter of fact because he had strongly held views.\u201d\n\nA year later, as a presidential candidate, Mr. Sanders has shown an ability to use the Senate as another platform for his campaign. On June 14, as senators gushed over Mrs. Clinton when she addressed the Democrats\u2019 caucus lunch in the Capitol, he slipped out early to take advantage of the television cameras outside. And he regularly introduces legislation, and gives emphatic floor speeches, echoing his campaign message.\n\n\u201cHe was very enthusiastic for someone speaking to an empty room,\u201d Janet Crnich, 44, of Wisconsin, said approvingly after watching Mr. Sanders rail against the influence of money in politics from the Senate\u2019s viewing gallery last week.\n\nAsked in his office \u2014 a space decorated with books (\u201cWage Theft in America\u201d), framed roll calls and pictures of him and President Bill Clinton \u2014 if he was a better politician than colleagues gave him credit for, Mr. Sanders put his finger to his lips.\n\n\u201cShh,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t give it away. You are going to ruin it for me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150814090020, "twitter": {"description": "Mr. Sanders pulls big crowds as he seeks the Democratic presidential nod, yet still battles perceptions of him as a gadfly on the Senate periphery.", "title": "Bernie Sanders, an Outlier?
