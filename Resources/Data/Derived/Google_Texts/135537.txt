Lucy Aitken Read stopped using shampoo after she read it might have potentially harmful chemicals.

When we go to wash our hair, we usually use shampoo, right?

Well, meet Lucy Aitken Read. Shampoo hasn't touched her red locks in more than three years.

Instead, every 10 days, Aitken Read pours vinegar on her hair or cracks an egg over her head.

"If you can't eat it, don't wash your hair with it. If you can eat it, then you should jolly well try and see what it does for your hair! It might be amazing!" Aitken Read says in a video on her blog.

On her blog, Lulastic and the Hippyshake, Aitken Read wrote her hair is actually shinier and grows faster than it did when she used shampoo.

The Huffington Post reports Aitken Read stopped using shampoo after she learned it could contain potentially harmful chemicals: "I always thought I'd used organic, healthy shampoo, but when I went upstairs and grabbed the bottle I was using I realized the ingredients were full of synthetic chemicals I'd never heard of."

So what are some other alternatives to shampoo besides eggs and vinegar?

A writer for Mother Earth Living suggests massaging baking soda into wet hair, saying it "removes styling product buildup."

And The Hippy Homemaker blog gives a few other options, such as using herbal infused tea, clay and honey in place of shampoo.

For healthier hair, Aitken Read also suggests washing your hair less often each week.
