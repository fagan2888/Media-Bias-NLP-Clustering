By Katie Watson and Jason Hart | Watchdog Radio

Code Blue is Watchdog Radio’s weekly look at heath issues, ranging from the latest public health debates to small government views on health care reform.

Medicaid and Medicare are breaking the budgets of states and the federal government, but there are other options out there. Is Obamacare the best we can do?

In this week’s episode, hosts Katie Watson and Jason Hart take a look at the politics of Medicaid expansion. Governors, like Rick Scott in Florida, who once opposed the idea of expanding Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act, are coming around — enticed by the promise of federal cash flowing to their state budgets.

But does Medicaid expansion mean quality care for the poor? Most studies say no.

Also: should nurse practitioners be allowed to work without contracting through a doctor? Reducing regulations like that could help improve care and lower costs.
