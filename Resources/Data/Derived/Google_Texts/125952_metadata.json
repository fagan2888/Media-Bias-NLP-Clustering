This we know. What we don\u2019t know is everything else. Death is the biggest mystery of all, leaving many of us clueless when it comes to comforting someone who\u2019s lost a loved one.\n\nWhat do you say? What don\u2019t you say? Do you mention the dead person by name? Do you try to offer good advice, to be helpful and loving? \u201cDo not give advice,\u201d advises Edie Hartshorne, a master of social work, longtime therapist, former Fulbright Scholar and award-winning author of \u201cLight in Blue Shadows,\u201d a wise and inspiring book about death, compassion and transforming grief.\n\nAfter her 20-year-old son Jonathan died, unexpectedly, tragically, Edie went on a dark and deep journey into her own pain and unraveling. When she came out the other side and wrote her book \u2014 \u201ca journey of loss and grief that leads to a place of wonder,\u201d says Isabel Allende on the jacket cover \u2014 Edie had a new awareness of many things, including what it means to comfort, and be comforted.\n\n\u201cMany times when we feel uncomfortable with another person\u2019s loss, we offer advice, hoping to make everything better.\u201d\n\nResist, says Edie. The person grieving doesn\u2019t need advice. She needs to be heard, to have her loss acknowledged. She needs her friends, her family, to be fully present, listening to whatever she has to say.\n\nHere are some more empowering Edie-isms to help you through the inevitable:\n\n\u25a0 Don\u2019t say you know just how the grieving person feels. Don\u2019t equate or compare your grief to the other person\u2019s. When you say, \u201cI know just how it is. I lost my mom a year ago,\u201d it can trivialize the other person\u2019s pain.\n\n\u201cThis can be particularly true when a parent has lost a child,\u201d Edie writes. \u201cIt\u2019s better to make no comparisons.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Don\u2019t remain silent. Very often, because we fear saying the wrong thing, we say nothing at all about the truth of what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s a mistake, Edie counsels. It\u2019s isolating for the person grieving to be surrounded by silent friends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important to validate the other person\u2019s reality,\u201d she writes. Share your truth plainly. \u201cI just heard your terrible news. I am so sorry and sad. I just want you to know I am holding you in my heart.\u201d\n\nSay it your way, with your true voice, but don\u2019t hide in silence.\n\n\u25a0 Don\u2019t try to fix your friend or family member. This goes along with Not Giving Advice, but you can\u2019t hear it often enough: \u201cThere is nothing to fix,\u201d Edie writes. It\u2019s natural for someone to feel grief when a loved one dies, and it's very painful.\n\nYour job is to \u201cstay present to the other person\u2019s pain.\u201d Just be there. There is nothing to repair.\n\nDon\u2019t ask, \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d Just do it. Take the initiative. When people grieve, Edie says, they\u2019re often too overwhelmed to sort out what needs to be done, too shy to ask for help. Notice what needs to be done and take action: Bring over dinner; drop off flowers; walk the dog. This requires a sensitive touch, but if you wait to be asked, you may miss the opportunity to truly be of service.\n\nSo much for the Do Not\u2019s. The Do\u2019s are closer to Edie Hartshorne\u2019s true nature. She\u2019s a poet, a musician, a peacemaker and a very positive person:\n\n\u25a0 Be present to exactly where your grieving friend is in the moment. If six months have passed, and he suddenly bursts into tears, \u201ctake a deep breath to bring yourself fully into the moment; speak slowly and lovingly. Listening fully and with a big heart is the most powerful medicine.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Make phone calls to your friend or family members during that first year. Grieving people are fully aware of the birthdays and anniversaries involving the person who died.\n\nSay something! says Edie, who writes beautifully about this in her book. It feels very lonely when those dates go by, unacknowledged.\n\nMarilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
