Dept. of Human Services awards annually \u0097 the average for last five years, making the department the biggest font of contracts in state government \u0097 pertains to Medicaid.\n\n\n\n\u0097 The Trentonian\n\nNew Jersey\u0092s Medicaid program is a raging river of tax dollars, flowing at a rate of nearly $1 million a minute, around the clock, seven days a week, 365 days a year, without letup.\n\nAnd even before the anticipated expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, the state is struggling to keep the river from overflowing its banks and washing away countless millions of dollars in waste or fraud.\n\nIn this struggle, the state\u0092s Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, in the Department of Human Services, pays contractors millions of dollars to help make sure Medicaid\u0092s billions of dollars reach the hard-up people for whom they\u0092re intended.\n\nBut some of these contractors have emerged recently at the center of controversy themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA company that was hired to recover funds owed to Medicaid has been paid millions of dollars for \u0093unbillable outcomes\u0094 under its contract, reports the Office of the State Auditor. The office is part of the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services.\n\nTwo other companies hired to provide health care under Medicaid failed to take the anti-fraud actions stipulated in their contracts, according to reports of the Office of State Comptroller.\n\nThe \u0093unbillable outcomes\u0094 case focuses on an outside company the state retains to pursue \u0093third-party liability recovery\u0094 claims. These claims involve money the state is owed to reimburse it for Medicaid assistance it paid out to people who had other coverage.\n\nAccording to the audit report, New Jersey\u0092s Medicaid program paid the company $7.5 million for identifying third-part-liability coverage which the firm previously had already identified and \u0093where no new insurance coverage was identified.\u0094 A state audit team reported finding these under \u0093codes\u0094 associated with new identifications.\n\nThe audit report did not allege any wrongdoing on the company\u0092s part or even identify the firm by name. State Auditor Stephen M. Eells confirmed to The Trentonian that the company alluded to in the audit is HMS, a nationwide enterprise with local offices in Hamilton and East Windsor. The firm boasts of having recovered more than $2.5 billion for government clients nationwide in 2011 and having enabled them to avoid more than $7 billion in misspent funds.\n\nThe audit report also said state Medicaid administrators had \u0093waived\u0094 status reports on unresolved HMS money-recovery cases but \u0093could not provide any documentation supporting the waivers.\u0094\n\nThe audit was addressed to Medicaid\u0092s state administrator, the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, and to the Office of State Comptroller\u0092s Medicaid Fraud Division.\n\nMark Anderson, director of that division \u0097 which itself has ferreted out tens of millions of dollars in fraud or questionable spending in New Jersey Medicaid program \u0097 said Medicaid administrators have \u0093consistently\u0094 taken the position since 2008 that \u0093re-verification\u0094 of Medicaid recipients\u0092 other coverage \u0093was intended to be a billable outcome.\u0094\n\nAnderson conceded, however, that on this point \u0093the language of the contract is lacking in clarity\u0094 and should be tightened. The contract, previously extended five times, runs out at the end of this month.\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey\u0092s top Medicaid administrator, Valerie Harr, acknowledged that in some cases the contractor\u0092s \u0093claim amounts have been inaccurate.\u0094 She said \u0093various corrective actions have been taken\u0094 and that she will \u0093continue to monitor the situation and take further corrective actions as needed.\u0094\n\nElsewhere in the struggle to minimize Medicaid dollars lost to waste or fraud, the Office of State Comptroller under Matthew Boxer last July faulted United Health Care Community Plan of New Jersey for insufficient vigilance against waste and fraud.\n\nCommunity Plan failed to maintain the level of anti-fraud staffing and training its $800 million-a-year contract stipulates, the comptroller reported. Total questionable costs Community Plan reported averting came to only one-tenth of 1 percent of the sum Medicaid pays it annually, the comptroller added.\n\nAlso previously faulted by the comptroller for lax efforts in guarding against Medicaid waste and fraud was Horizon N.J. Health.\n\nOther recent controversies bedevilling New Jersey\u0092s Medicaid have included:\n\nA report that $7.1 million in improper Medicaid payments went to New Jersey prison inmates. (The prison system provides its own medical services for inmates. Inmates on Medicaid when they enter prison are not supposed to continue receiving it beyond the end of the month they were incarcerated.)\n\nA spot check audit of 50 pending claims submitted by the Adult Medical Day Care program reported that 90 percent of the claims lacked documentation to support payment.\n\nAllegations that a dentist in East Orange, banned from participating in state contracts, submitted Medicaid claims in the names of unlicensed colleagues at Gentle Dental Group. The Office of State Comptroller is seeking $1.3 million in Medicaid reimbursements.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Politics news, Trenton Politics news, NJ Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "title": "STATE WATCH: Medicaid ailments: waste & fraud", "og": {"url": "http://www.trentonian.com/article/TT/20131027/OPINION/131029619", "image": {"width": "500px", "identifier": "http://www.trentonian.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/TT/20131027/OPINION/131029619/AR/0/AR-131029619.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "508px"}, "type": "article", "title": "STATE WATCH: Medicaid ailments: waste & fraud"}, "twitter": {"domain": "trentonian.com", "description": "New Jersey\u0092s Medicaid program is a raging river of tax dollars, flowing at a rate of nearly $1 million a minute, around the clock, seven days a week, 365 days a year, without letup.", "title": "STATE WATCH: Medicaid ailments: waste & fraud", "url": "http://www.trentonian.com/article/TT/20131027/OPINION/131029619", "image": {"src": "http://www.trentonian.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/TT/20131027/OPINION/131029619/AR/0/AR-131029619.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@trentonian", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "/id563339138", "iphone": "/id503293221", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.trentonian"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Politics, Politics news, Trenton Politics news, NJ Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "New Jersey\u0092s Medicaid program is a raging river of tax dollars, flowing at a rate of nearly $1 million a minute, around the clock, seven days a week, 365 days a year, without letup."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2faf\"", "article_summary": "Other recent controversies bedevilling New Jersey\u0092s Medicaid have included:A report that $7.1 million in improper Medicaid payments went to New Jersey prison inmates.\n\u0097 At $8.5 billion, Medicaid in New Jersey is the second biggest item in the state budget behind public school aid.\nThe Office of State Comptroller is seeking $1.3 million in Medicaid reimbursements.\n\u0097 Medicaid (not to be confused with Medicare, a payroll-tax funded program for seniors) is funded jointly by the federal and states taxes.\nof Human Services awards annually \u0097 the average for last five years, making the department the biggest font of contracts in state government \u0097 pertains to Medicaid."}
