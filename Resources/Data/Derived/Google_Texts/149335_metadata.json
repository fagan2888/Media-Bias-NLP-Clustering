Such is life for thousands of Santa Barbara County residents, according to a study on poverty commissioned by the Board of Supervisors in January 2012, the findings of which were presented Tuesday.\n\nThe fact that there are poor people in Santa Barbara County is not a revelation. But the study\u2019s hard numbers and its presentation of the discrepancy between what federal standards say poverty means and what other metrics say is necessary for basic survival point to room for change in how the county\u2019s poor are served. First District Supervisor Salud Carbajal, who proposed the study in 2011, said that for all of the study\u2019s gloom, there is not necessarily doom. \u201cThe silver lining is that this provides us a tool to be more strategic in better serving that population in future years,\u201d he said, explaining that he wants the statistics to help the county find ways to better align services with the people who need them and keep track of this data in the future.\n\nThe study, conducted by the Oakland-based Insight Center for Community Economic Development, focused on areas according to Census tracts and zip codes, and culled its data from the 2006-2010 American Community Survey, historical records, and primary input from more than 100 area service providers and 16 leaders of nonprofit and private organizations.\n\nIt also took into account the dueling metrics used to measure poverty. For example, the federal guidelines \u200b\u2014 \u200bthe thresholds of which are based on 1950s spending patterns and don\u2019t vary by location \u200b\u2014 \u200bclassify a single person as living in poverty if they make just under $11,000 a year. For a family of three, that number increases to about $18,000. The Self-Sufficiency Standard is another metric, which is used by the majority of states and can vary by county. Santa Barbara County\u2019s Self-Sufficiency Standard says that a single adult needs at least about $27,000 a year to pay for basic needs, while a single parent with two young children needs close to $60,000 per year \u200b\u2014 \u200ban amount not covered by even three full-time, minimum-wage jobs.\n\nTo find the county\u2019s most-suffering pockets, the report designated high-poverty areas as those whose Census tracts exceeded 20 percent of its residents living in poverty. And after crunching the numbers, the researchers found the county\u2019s poorest areas concentrated in Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, Lompoc, and Isla Vista.\n\nOut of the county\u2019s 400,000-plus residents, nearly 74,000 \u200b\u2014 \u200balmost a fifth of the population \u200b\u2014 \u200bare living in poverty. Some other staggering findings include:\n\n\u2022 In high-poverty areas, the child poverty rate is 40 percent, adults 30 percent, seniors 10 percent.\n\n\u2022 Only about 16 percent of residents have a bachelor\u2019s degree in high-poverty areas.\n\n\u2022 High-poverty areas are home to 40 percent of the county\u2019s residents using alternative transportation.\n\n\u2022 About 34 percent of families in poverty live in South County, but they receive about half of the county\u2019s public housing units and Section 8 vouchers.\n\n\u2022 Nearly 72 percent of the unmet child-care needs are in the high poverty areas, with a huge portion in Santa Maria.\n\n\u2022 In high-poverty areas, the average age of death is three years younger.\n\nThe study also found startling comparisons between how average wages for full-time jobs have changed between 2000 and 2010. While residents countywide only suffered an average yearly loss of about $21, those living in the high-poverty areas saw cuts of more than $2,000 a year. The most popular types of jobs in high-poverty areas were in agriculture, retail, and accommodation and food services \u200b\u2014 \u200bwith all three sectors averaging only about $12 per hour.\n\nFood stamp use also varied greatly between the county overall and the high-poverty areas, with about 15 percent of county households versus 32 percent of high-poverty area households using the program. The high-poverty areas in Santa Maria and Lompoc were the greatest participants.\n\nOut of the 71,000 people countywide lacking health insurance, more than 20,000 are living in the high-poverty areas. Dr. Takashi Wada, the director and health officer for the county\u2019s Public Health Department, said the Affordable Care Act (otherwise known as Obamacare) is projected to lower those figures over the next several years.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://media.independent.com/img/croppedphotos/2013/09/11/08202013-Salud-Carbajal-2.jpg", "description": "Countywide Study Delivers Startling Results.", "title": "1 in 5 in Poverty"}, "verify-v1": "ILofteeXjEGSBFwUf9oRyP4hdhxQ7F35jPp2MwAQrUE=", "y_key": "33d4a6dfbd23f58a", "description": "Countywide Study Delivers Startling Results.", "title": "1 in 5 in Poverty"}, "article_summary": "Some other staggering findings include:\u2022 In high-poverty areas, the child poverty rate is 40 percent, adults 30 percent, seniors 10 percent.\n\u2022 Nearly 72 percent of the unmet child-care needs are in the high poverty areas, with a huge portion in Santa Maria.\nTo find the county\u2019s most-suffering pockets, the report designated high-poverty areas as those whose Census tracts exceeded 20 percent of its residents living in poverty.\nOut of the county\u2019s 400,000-plus residents, nearly 74,000 \u200b\u2014 \u200balmost a fifth of the population \u200b\u2014 \u200bare living in poverty.\nSuch is life for thousands of Santa Barbara County residents, according to a study on poverty commissioned by the Board of Supervisors in January 2012, the findings of which were presented Tuesday."}
