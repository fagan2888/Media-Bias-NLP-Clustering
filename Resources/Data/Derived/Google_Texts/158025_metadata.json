She\u2019s also advocating for the right to \u201copt out\u201d of such content.\n\nAfter \u201cdelays\u201d with the Virginia Board of Education, Murphy took her fight to the legislative level, where she helped advance legislation that would require public schools to notify parents of sexually explicit material in the classroom; allow parents to review that content; and, upon request, grant them the ability to opt out.\n\nOn Monday morning, the bill passed the Education Committee 22-0, with the full support of both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\u201cIf you can opt out in the health classroom, and if you can opt out in the biology classroom, shouldn\u2019t you be also allowed to opt out in the English classroom?\u201d Murphy asked. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about consistency.\u201d\n\nSome of the books assigned to her children, Murphy said, referenced sensitive topics such as \u201cbestiality,\u201d \u201csex,\u201d and \u201crape.\u201d Two books in particular\u2014written by Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Toni Morrison\u2014caught Murphy\u2019s attention: \u201cBeloved\u201d and \u201cThe Bluest Eye.\u201d\n\nOne passage taken from \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d reads:\n\nHe must enter her surreptitiously, lifting the hem of her nightgown only to her navel. He must rest his weight on his elbows when they make love, to avoid hurting her breasts\u2026When she senses some spasm about to grip him, she will make rapid movements with her hips, press her fingernails into his back, suck in her breath, and pretend she is having an orgasm. She might wonder again, for the six hundredth time, what it would be like to have that feeling while her husband\u2019s penis is inside her.\n\nAnother, taken from \u201cBeloved,\u201d reads:\n\nAll in their twenties, minus women, fucking cows, dreaming of rape, thrashing on pallets, rubbing their thighs and waiting for the new girl.\n\nMurphy said the content was so explicit that four years ago, when she tried to email \u201cverbatim quotations\u201d to the Virginia Board of Education, the government\u2019s firewall blocked her email from being delivered because they were obscene and potentially harmful to children.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make it up,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nThen, when another parent copied and pasted passages onto the comment section of the Virginia Town Hall website, Murphy said the Virginia Department of Planning and Budget, which oversees the comments, made the decision to remove the text due to its explicit nature.\n\n\u201cThey removed it because it was obscene and could be harmful to children,\u201d she said. \u201cHow ironic.\u201d\n\nBut some education experts believe that government intervention is unnecessary.\n\n\u201cOf course parents have the right, and even the obligation, to participate in their children\u2019s education,\u201d said James LaRue, Director of the American Library Association\u2019s Office for Intellectual Freedom in Chicago, Ill. \u201cBut do we need a new law to accomplish that? Can\u2019t parents take a look at the curriculum on back-to-school night? Can\u2019t they talk to the teachers? Can\u2019t they ask their sons or daughters what they\u2019re talking about in class, and what they think about it? It could be the start of a wonderful conversation.\u201d\n\nMurphy acknowledged that many teachers in Fairfax County, including some of her sons\u2019 teachers, already inform students and parents of \u201csensitive\u201d material.\n\n\u201cSome have even gone so far as to provide warnings on their syllabus,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, \u201cthere are some teachers who refuse to identify books containing sexually explicit material because they believe that parents should let the teachers teach and that notifying parents of books with sexually explicit content will ultimately lead to censorship.\u201d\n\nFor that reason, Murphy said, the legislative step was necessary.\n\nIf the bill makes it through the full Virginia legislature and schools are required to inform parents of sexually explicit content, critics raised concerns over the practicality of the measure.\n\n\u201c\u2019Sexually explicit\u2019 means what, and who decides?\u201d LaRue said, adding:\n\nThe public cases that follow such legislation tend to center on books generally acknowledged to be genuine works of literature\u2014Beloved, by Toni Morrison, for instance, and other works by major and acclaimed authors. And just incidentally, many of the most frequently challenged books tend to be by and about people of color. What are we protecting our children from, exactly?\n\nMurphy acknowledged the concern but said she \u201chas faith\u201d that teachers can take on the burden.\n\n\u201cI know books aren\u2019t rated, but if the Motion Picture Association and the gaming industry\u2014if they can all identify profanity, or sexual explicitness, or drug use\u2014I have a lot of faith in our teachers here in the Commonwealth, that they can do the same.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A mother in Northern Virginia is advocating for public school teachers to better inform parents of reading materials that contain sexually explicit content.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A mother in Northern Virginia is advocating for public school teachers to better inform parents of reading materials that contain sexually explicit content.", "title": "Mom Takes Fight Against Sexually Explicit Books to Legislature", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/birfphotos101829_VA_020116.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T22:42:31+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1UE8Fmu"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A mother in Northern Virginia is advocating for public school teachers to better inform parents of reading materials that contain sexually explicit content.", "title": "Mom Takes Fight Against Sexually Explicit Books to Legislature", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/birfphotos101829_VA_020116.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12,school choice", "published_time": "2016-02-01T17:23:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T22:42:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "sexually explicit material, public schools, education, k-12, fairfax county, fairfax public schools, toni morrison, House Bill 516, beloved, the bluest eye"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf8f\"", "article_summary": "Since learning of her children\u2019s reading materials, Murphy has been advocating for public school teachers to better inform parents of reading materials that contain sexually explicit content.\nIf the bill makes it through the full Virginia legislature and schools are required to inform parents of sexually explicit content, critics raised concerns over the practicality of the measure.\nAfter discovering what she considers over-the-top, sexually explicit material in her children\u2019s high school reading assignments, a Northern Virginia mother is lobbying for greater transparency inside the classroom.\nHowever, \u201cthere are some teachers who refuse to identify books containing sexually explicit material because they believe that parents should let the teachers teach and that notifying parents of books with sexually explicit content will ultimately lead to censorship.\u201dFor that reason, Murphy said, the legislative step was necessary.\n\u201cAs I read it, I was disturbed by some of the content.\u201dThe content, Murphy said, was brought to her attention by her son, who at the time was a sophomore."}
