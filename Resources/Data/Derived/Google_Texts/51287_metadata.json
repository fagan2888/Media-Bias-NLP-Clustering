And it\u2019s those little moments, it makes you just so grateful.\u201d\n\nThat makes California the first state in the nation to implement new federal standards on autism care.\n\nThe new benefit includes coverage of the clinical standard of care for autism treatment \u2014 Applied Behavior Analysis, also known as ABA therapy. That treatment has shown significant results for a cross-section of children with autism.\n\nOf the 5 million children on Medi-Cal in California \u2014 that\u2019s roughly half the state\u2019s total children \u2014 there are an estimated 75,000 who likely have autism spectrum disorder. Of those children, experts expect about 12,000 children to access the new benefit, based on utilization figures from programs in other states.\n\nOne of those families is Jazzmon Wilson and her son Timothy. I recently met with them at their home in Rancho Cordova, outside of Sacramento. Timothy was playing a video game.\n\nFor most families, it was a familiar scene, the 6-year-old glued to his Super Mario game, leaping and dodging virtual pitfalls. But his mom, Jazzmon, still couldn\u2019t quite believe what she was seeing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, he\u2019s 6 now, and I never thought this was going to happen,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he plays Mario. He can play it!\u201d\n\nThe fact that Timothy can understand how the video game works, and interact with it \u2014 let alone sit still long enough to figure anything out in the game \u2014 is a major accomplishment, she said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing things other kids can do, too,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s those little moments, it makes you just so grateful.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way. Timothy has autism, and his mom described it as having a brain that was wired a little differently. She compared it to one of those frustrating cell phone conversations where there\u2019s a couple of seconds delay and people can\u2019t communicate with each other. She says her son Timothy had an 8-second delay.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. At two-years-old he couldn\u2019t speak a single word. Not mama, not Dada, nothing. He would spin around. He would yell, constantly.\n\nBut once he started ABA therapy, his mom says, he was a different kid.\n\n\u201cABA is giving back to you the typical experiences you dreamed you were going to have when your kid was born,\u201d Wilson said said. \u201cAll those LITTLE things.\u201d\n\nLittle things like sitting still, or making eye contact with his mother.\n\nThe basic idea of ABA therapy is to rewire all the little steps most people take for granted. For example, an ABA therapist will reward a child for sitting down with so-called \u201cquiet hands\u201d for two seconds. Then a reward for five seconds, then 10, and so on.\n\nAfter all of that, said Gregory Buch \u2014 a behavorial psychologist in Roseville, north of Sacramento \u2014 comes the arduous process of actually learning words.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is, if you have a child who is 3-years-old and has no language whatsoever, you\u2019ve got about two years\u2019 of communications skills at least to teach them,\u201d Buch said.\n\n\u201cSo not only do they have to learn everything that an average child learns that they didn\u2019t learn,\u201d he said, \u201cthey have to learn it faster than the average child learned it.\u201d\n\nWhen you combine a slow learning process with starting out way behind, you need an intensive program to catch up, Buch said. But, he added, that\u2019s what works.\n\n\u201cI think most kids [with autism] will benefit from some kind of ABA intervention,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for some kids, that\u2019s a really dramatic gain.\u201d\n\nThis type of therapy has been a clinical standard of care for more than a decade, but that doesn\u2019t always mean people could access it.\n\nThe Legislature had to order private insurance companies two years ago to pay for it. But with Medi-Cal, coverage remained blocked. Until now.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely pleased and excited that we\u2019re adding this benefit,\u201d said Toby Douglas, director of the state Department of Health Care Services.\n\nDouglas said California is first in the nation to act on new federal rules on autism care. California was just waiting for the federal go-ahead, he said.\n\n\u201cIt has been something that stakeholders [and] the state have been exploring for a long time,\u201d Douglas said.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of stakeholders gathered in a Sacramento auditorium to hash out the devilish details of implementing the benefit.\n\nKristin Jacobson, president of Autism Deserves Equal Coverage, was at that meeting, and she says there are still miles to go before everyone eligible for therapy gets the therapy.\n\n\u201cThis has been a really, really long struggle. We\u2019ve been fighting for such a long time. We\u2019re encouraged, but we are going to remain very vigilant,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf Medi-Cal doesn\u2019t make sure to contract with the vast majority of current existing providers, they will not have enough providers,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cThey will not be able to actually provide the benefit that they\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nHowever, she said, the bottom line is: After years of telling her autism clients \u201cNo, no, no, no,\u201d now she\u2019s finally able to say \u201cYes,\u201d Jacobson said. Her organization has produced a fact sheet to answer questions about the new benefit.\n\nJazzmon Wilson, back in her living room with Timothy, said the state\u2019s coverage couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. Timothy had a short course of therapy paid with proceeds from a legal settlement, but that\u2019s about to run out. Without the new Medi-Cal benefit, she said she didn\u2019t know what she would have done.\n\n\u201cTo have something that can bring a little bit of hope, it makes all the difference in the world,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd so when he can do those things now, it makes \u2026 It makes life worth living, which is hard to say. It really is hard to say that.\u201d\n\nThe state still has plenty of work to do, as it hasn\u2019t yet set provider rates or eligibility standards. But for thousands of families across California, the coverage for ABA therapy may mean a taste of fresh hope in their lives.\n\nDavid Gorn is a senior news editor with California Healthline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Private insurers were required to cover a special therapy, but Medi-Cal kids were excluded.
