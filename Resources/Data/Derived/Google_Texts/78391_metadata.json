CBS will not be going through the same drama which we saw at NBC when Johnny Carson and Jay Leno left The Tonight Show (twice in the case of Leno). There was no consideration of forcing Letterman out before he was ready. One week after David Letterman announced his planned retirement on his own schedule, CBS has announced that Stephen Colbert will be replacing him. While I think Craig Ferguson does an excellent job following Letterman\u2019s show, it was not expected that Ferguson would receive the 11:35 time slot. I do like Ferguson\u2019s show but, if he leaves CBS, it would not be as significant as David Letterman and later Conan O\u2019Brien leaving NBC. I hope Ferguson does remain where he is, providing a choice between his show and Seth Meyers at 12:35.\n\nStephen Colbert has already said that (as would be expected) he is not going to do the show in character as on The Colbert Report on Comedy Central show. It has been an excellent run, but I am also confident Colbert can do a fine job hosting as \u201chimself.\u201d I do hope that from time to time Colbert, instead of stupid pet tricks, goes back into his stupid conservative character for a skit.\n\nI suspect that Colbert will tone down politics to some degree with the move to a late night network talk show. His liberal credentials are well known after pointing out that \u201creality has a well-known liberal bias.\u201d Or maybe not. A study at Ohio State in 2009 found that many conservatives took him seriously and didn\u2019t realize he was mocking them.\n\nHere is a selection of one liners from Stephen Colbert when in character, many of which have been featured at Liberal Values as a Quote of the Day:\n\n\u201cOur president has gotten so desperate that he appeared on this website Funny or Die. By the way, \u2018funny or die\u2019 is also the ultimatum you got from Obamacare\u2019s death panels.\u201d \u2013Stephen Colbert\n\n\u201cNo one has signed up for Obamacare, give or take 4.2 million people.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Colbert\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know what, folks? I miss George W. Bush. That man knew how to sell a war. Obama has hard evidence of weapons of mass destruction and he can\u2019t even get England to go along with it. Meanwhile, President Bush got an international coalition with nothing more than Colin Powell\u2019s reputation and half a test tube of crystal light.\u201d \u2013Stephen Colbert\n\n\n\n\u201cConservatives like me know that in a budget crisis, everything nonessential has to go \u2014 whether it\u2019s food for kids who aren\u2019t mine or some other stuff for people I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u2013Stephen Colbert\n\n\u201cIt seems like every single day, President Obama finds a new way to waste our tax dollars. I mean, two daughters? Seems a little redundant.\u201d \u2013Stephen Colbert\n\n\u201cWhere did we go wrong? The Republicans had everything going for them \u2013 a terrible economy, an unpopular incumbent, and a positive message for the American voter: \u2018less than half of you are parasites.\u2019\u201d \u2013Stephen Colbert\n\n\n\n\u201cFolks, I\u2019m no fan of \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 They expose our children to dangerous liberal ideas like befriending the homeless, two men sleeping in the same bedroom and counting.\u201d \u2013Stephen Colbert\n\n\u201cThis is America. We must defend the principles symbolized by Lady Liberty \u2013 unless she\u2019s on the pill, in which case, she is a giant green tramp.\u201d \u2013Stephen Colbert\n\nOne of Stephen Colbert\u2019s finest moments outside of his show was at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in 2006. Here is the video of his tribute to George Bush, with full text available here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7FTF4Oz4dI\n\nRush Limbaugh says CBS Declares War on Heartland of America:\n\nCBS has just declared war on the Heartland of America. No longer is comedy going to be a covert assault on traditional American values, conservatives. Now it\u2019s just wide out in the open. What this hire means is a redefinition of what is \u201cfunny\u201d and a redefinition of what is comedy, and they\u2019re blowing up the 11:30 format under the guise that the world\u2019s changing and people don\u2019t want the kind of comedy that Carson gave us or even Letterman. They don\u2019t want that anymore. It\u2019s the media planting a flag here. I think it\u2019s maybe the media\u2019s last stand, but it\u2019s a declaration. There\u2019s no unity in this hire. They\u2019ve hired a partisan, so-called comedian to run a comedy show.\n\nThis is the most tolerant statement I can recall from conservatives on Letterman. Most likely Colbert will be more overtly liberal than Letterman but we can\u2019t be certain as to what will happen considering that a late night network talk show is a different type of show than The Colbert Report.\n\nRelated Posts: Conan O\u2019Brien, Craig Ferguson, David Letterman, George Bush, Jay Leno, Rush Limbaugh, Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert\n\nOriginally posted at Liberal Values", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.audience": "Global", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.7", "og": {"site_name": "The Moderate Voice", "description": "White smoke could be seen rising from CBS Headquarters on Thursday.
