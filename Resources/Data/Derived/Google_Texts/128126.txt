The Navy will pay more than $9 million to keep using Windows XP under a contract signed this month, Computerworld reported Tuesday.

The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) will pay Microsoft $9,149,000 through the contract, which was approved earlier this month. It could eventually grow to be as large as $30,842,980 by 2017.

The funds will pay for Microsoft to provide custom security support to up to 100,000 Windows XP machines used by the Navy. Microsoft has abandoned supporting the system for users who don’t pay for the custom services. The contract will also provide support for other older Microsoft products, including Office 2003.

"Nearly all the networks and workstations afloat and ashore will benefit from the Microsoft Premier Support services and Microsoft Custom Support services for Windows XP, Office 2003, Exchange 2003 and Server 2003,” said a spokesman for SPAWAR.

He said the Navy is developing plans to modernize its infrastructure, but that until "those applications and programs are modernized or phased out, this continuity of services is required to maintain operational effectiveness."

“In particular, Microsoft Premier Support Services and Custom Support Services maintain enterprise-wide Microsoft capabilities to ensure Navy warfighters have connectivity to their respective networks and to the data necessary to support and accomplish their mission.”

Microsoft ended all support for Windows XP in April of last year.
