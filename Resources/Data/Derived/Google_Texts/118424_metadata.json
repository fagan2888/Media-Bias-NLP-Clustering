(Director) Janet Napolitano does not want to uphold the law, she wants illegal aliens here.\u201d\n\nE-Verify is a free database that allows employers to check Social Security numbers to verify a person has a legal right to work in the U.S. Since its creation in 1997, liberal critics have blasted the program as a tool to keep undocumented workers from getting jobs. Still, by 2012, federal employees and certain federal contractors were required to use the program, and 20 states had enacted some form of E-Verify requirement.\n\nIn 2011, Republicans in the House and Senate introduced bills that would have required all employers to use E-Verify. It failed to pass along party lines.\n\nBut when the budget standoff exploded into a shutdown last week, E-Verify was shuttered and some-300 people who work in the Verification Division were sent home on\n\nfurlough, DHS spokesman Christopher Bentley told Watchdog.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the whole program (that is furloughed), to look at it as just the website itself is disingenuous,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just as simple as flipping a switch on and off.\u201d\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t comment on whether the Obama administration was glad to see E-Verify go.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t address that one way or another,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cI won\u2019t get into a partisan discussion.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t tell that to Miller or the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Center for Immigration Studies.\n\n\u201cIt does need to be constantly updated,\u201d said the center\u2019s Director of Research Steven Camarota. \u201cBut in a one-week period can they leave it up? Of course. There is no reason it had to be shut down. The immigration system is still working; it\u2019s not like people are not arriving.\u201d\n\nCamarota stopped short of saying it was intentionally targeted for a shutdown by Obama, but said, \u201cIt seems like another example of making things as unnecessarily difficult as possible to blame the Republicans for the shutdown. The administration seems intent on creating as many inconveniences as possible.\u201d\n\nThe AFL-CIO did not respond to a request for comment on the impact the E-Verify shutdown has on various work projects ongoing in the 20 states. The ACLU did not respond to whether their membership was happy the site was not functioning.\n\nLabornotes, a monthly magazine for labor activists, has been opposed to E-Verify from its inception.\n\n\u201cThere are errors in the system,\u201d said Labornotes\u2019 editor, Jane Slaughter. \u201cPeople who do have a legitimate right to work are often caught up in the system and getting threatening letters from their employer, saying, \u2018You have to get your affairs in order.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are for people being able to come to this country and get jobs,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cE-Verify tries to keep people from doing that thing. There are a lot of pressure for employers to use it.\u201d\n\nThe conservative think tank Heritage Foundation disputed concerns by organized labor.\n\n\u201cThe system is quite accurate \u2014 as of two years ago was 99 percent accurate,\u201d said David Inserra, Heritage\u2019s research assistant for national security and cyber security. \u201cIf an immigrant came here legally and followed the rules, E-Verify won\u2019t interfere with their ability to work.\u201d\n\nE-Verify requires federal new hires to submit enter their information in the database at least three days before the hire date. This mandate has been waived during the shutdown, according to the E-Verify website. What isn\u2019t clear is the impact it has on various states with their own sets of laws.\n\n\u201cThe shutdown doesn\u2019t mean that the database can\u2019t be there (operating),\u201d Camarota said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t get updated or tech support \u2014 that\u2019s different than saying the thing can\u2019t function. This seems like it\u2019s creating a huge backlog when they didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nAs for E-Verify itself, the site offered its condolences:\n\n\u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience and look forward to serving you once we resume operations.\u201d\n\nContact Tori Richards at tori@watchdog.org or on twitter @newswriter2", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "he federal right to work database E-Verify has become a casualty of the government shutdown, leaving some to wonder whether the Obama administration is taking advantage of Washington politics to kill a program unpopular with Democrats on Capitol Hill.", "title": "E-Verify: Is Obama happy to see right-to-work database go? - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/06/ObamaJune6.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-10T14:08:48+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/110282/e-verify-is-obama-happy-to-see-right-to-work-database-go/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Federal Government", "tag": "Center for Immigration Studies,Christopher Bentley,David Inserra,Democrat,Department of Homeland Security,DHS,E-Verify,everify,Heritage Foundation,Jane Slaughter,labor,Labornotes,shutdown,Steven Camarota,Tori Richards", "published_time": "2013-10-10T11:56:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-10T14:08:48+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "he federal right to work database E-Verify has become a casualty of the government shutdown, leaving some to wonder whether the Obama administration is taking advantage of Washington politics to kill a program unpopular with Democrats on Capitol Hill.", "title": "E-Verify: Is Obama happy to see right-to-work database go? - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/06/ObamaJune6.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe20a9\"", "article_summary": "By Tori Richards | Watchdog.orgThe federal right-to-work database E-Verify has become a casualty of the government shutdown, leaving some to wonder whether the Obama administration is taking advantage of Washington politics to kill a program unpopular with Democrats on Capitol Hill.\nStill, by 2012, federal employees and certain federal contractors were required to use the program, and 20 states had enacted some form of E-Verify requirement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just as simple as flipping a switch on and off.\u201dHe wouldn\u2019t comment on whether the Obama administration was glad to see E-Verify go.\nIn 2011, Republicans in the House and Senate introduced bills that would have required all employers to use E-Verify.\n\u201cThe shutdown doesn\u2019t mean that the database can\u2019t be there (operating),\u201d Camarota said."}
