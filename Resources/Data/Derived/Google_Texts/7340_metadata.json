No just God would stand for what they did yesterday and what they do every single day. From governments and peoples across the Middle East, there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer, so that it doesn\u2019t spread. There has to be a clear rejection of these kinds of nihilistic ideologies.\n\nGWEN IFILL: The National Security Council confirmed it is Foley in the gruesome video posted yesterday by the Islamic State group titled \u201cA Message to America.\u201d The NewsHour has chosen not to show any of the images.\n\nFoley was abducted in Syria in November 2012, while reporting for the news site GlobalPost.\n\nJAMES FOLEY: A grim routine has taken hold in the fight for Syria\u2019s largest city.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Just a few months earlier, he filed this report on what life looked like in a rebel-controlled neighborhood of Aleppo. His career as a freelance photojournalist spanned a number of countries and conflicts.\n\nIn 2010, reporting for the \u201cNewsHour\u201d in Afghanistan, Foley found himself in the line of fire, as he shared a firsthand look at a Taliban ambush on an American infantry unit.\n\nJAMES FOLEY: It was only after this near catastrophe that we see the convoy\u2019s front truck is on fire, and, worse, the soldiers have pulled a casualty to the side of the mountain, as others frantically begin to work on him.\n\nGWEN IFILL: In 2011, in Libya, Foley was held for 45 days by forces loyal to former dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Following his release, he spoke about that kidnapping on the NewsHour.\n\nJAMES FOLEY: I never worried that I would be in captivity for, let\u2019s say, a year. I was concerned. I was really concerned to tell my mom that I was OK. And when we hit that two-week mark, I knew, OK, this is going to be a long time. They\u2019re telling us two to three days, but they\u2019re just playing mind games with us.\n\nGWEN IFILL: It was unclear who initially abducted Foley in Syria or when he fell into the hands of Islamic State forces. But his death marked the first time they have killed an American citizen in the Syrian conflict.\n\nJOHN FOLEY, Father of James Foley: It haunts me that he \u2014 how much pain he was in and how \u2014 how cruel this \u2014 this method of execution is.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Still shaken, Foley\u2019s parents emerge from their home in Rochester, New Hampshire, today to remember their son.\n\nDIANE FOLEY, Mother of James Foley: Jim had \u2014 kind of had nine lives. I mean, he came out of Libya. And I guess we just never gave up hope either. We just kept thinking that somehow we\u2019re getting closer, we know he\u2019s alive. We \u2014 you know, we just ran out of time. He ran out of time.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Foley was 40 years old. The same video also showed another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, who has written for \u201cTIME\u201d magazine. The militants threatened he will be killed next if U.S. airstrikes in Iraq continue.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists estimates at least 20 other news professionals are being held in Syria.\n\nDAVID CAMERON, Prime Minister, United Kingdom: It is an act of murder, and murder without any justification.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced a manhunt for the hooded militant with a British accent who appeared in the beheading video.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Journalist James Foley was confirmed as the man executed by beheading in a video released by the Islamic State group.
