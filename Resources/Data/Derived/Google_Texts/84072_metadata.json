It\u2019s just conditioning that I\u2019m behind with,\u201d Bordeleau said. \u201cI have to work on my conditioning and I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\nBordeleau, who played all 82 games last season for Colorado, with six goals and five assists, has yet to play this season. He was expected to miss the first three months of the season after back surgery \u2014 but he was activated about two to three weeks early.\n\nAVS MAILBAG: Pose a question for Mike Chambers\n\n\u201cI feel close. I\u2019m really close,\u201d Bordeleau said. \u201cI\u2019m excited. I\u2019m anxious. I\u2019m (ticked) I haven\u2019t been able to play.\u201d\n\nBordeleau said he would like to make his season debut on the Avs\u2019 road trip \u2014 they play Thursday at Pittsburgh, then Saturday at Buffalo and Sunday at Detroit \u2014 but that he might still need two weeks to catch up his fitness.\n\n\u201cI was hoping tomorrow. But today, my conditioning wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been frustrating. But it is what it is. It was a big surgery. I\u2019ve had to work hard to get back.\u201d\n\nAfter the surgery, Bordeleau wasn\u2019t able to stand, let alone skate, he said. His road back through recovery, though, is nearing an end.\n\n\u201cAt least it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore\u201d he said.\n\nRoster updates. Erik Johnson, Matt Duchene, Gabriel Landeskog, John Mitchell and Daniel Briere all returned to Avs\u2019 practice Wednesday after sitting out the day before.\n\nMitchell (knee) remains on injured reserve. Briere had his left thigh wrapped, but participated fully.\n\nBen Street (hand) and Jesse Winchester (concussion) also remain on injured reserve.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Patrick Bordeleau back with Avs after \u201cfrustrating\u201d recovery, but not ready to play", "title": "Patrick Bordeleau back with Avs after \u201cfrustrating\u201d recovery, but not ready to play", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/17/patrick-bordeleau-back-with-avs-after-frustrating-recovery-but-not-ready-to-play/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141217__patrick-bordeleau-avs-121714p1.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141217__patrick-bordeleau-avs-121714p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-17T13:22:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:29:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa0f\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019ve had to work hard to get back.\u201dAfter the surgery, Bordeleau wasn\u2019t able to stand, let alone skate, he said.\nBordeleau skated full-go Wednesday at the Avs\u2019 final practice before leaving on a three-game road trip to Pittsburgh, Buffalo and Detroit.\nBut the third-year winger, who went through back surgery in the offseason, is not yet ready for games, he said.\nIt\u2019s just conditioning that I\u2019m behind with,\u201d Bordeleau said.\nPatrick Bordeleau is back with the Avalanche \u2014 after he was activated from injured reserve on Tuesday \u2014 but he\u2019ll remain a healthy scratch for the time being."}
