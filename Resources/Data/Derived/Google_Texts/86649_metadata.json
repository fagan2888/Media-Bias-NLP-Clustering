Friday saw the dollar up sharply after the government's U.S. non-farm payroll report showed a rise of 271,000 last month, the most since last December. \"I think the jobs report was most significant,\" said Rupert of data that could encourage the Fed to raise rates. \"[I]t reversed the market thinking of US economic weakness from the prior two months.\" U.S. Treasuries yields have risen sharply in the wake of the jobs report, briefly sending two-year yields to their highest in 5-1/2 years. European currencies came under pressure Monday after four European Central Bank governing council members said a consensus is forming at the central bank to take one of its benchmark interest rates deeper into negative territory in December. Talk of a cut to the ECB's -0.2 percent deposit rate dragged euro zone bond yields lower on Tuesday. [GVD/EUR] The dollar edged up 0.3 percent against the euro to $1.0711. The euro-zone currency has lost nearly 3 percent against the dollar so far in November. The dollar jumped to 1.0089 Swiss franc earlier in the day, its highest since March 20 . It was last up 0.4 percent at 1.0066 franc.
