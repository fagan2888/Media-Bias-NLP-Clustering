Old news. The real excitement in the market this week was the climb in the Nasdaq, which gained 165 points, or 3.5 percent. On Friday alone it added 36 points to reach 4,894. That\u2019s only 106 points away from 5,000. From there, it\u2019s in spitting distance of its all-time closing high of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000. That\u2019s right, it took 15 years, but the Nasdaq could soon exceed the peak from its tech-bubble glory days. In contrast, the S&P 500 is now 40 percent above its early 2000 high.\n\nRelated: Apple\u2019s App Store Bigger Than Hollywood Box Office\n\nOf course, if you adjust for inflation, the Nasdaq would have to get a lot higher \u2014 6,941 to be exact \u2014 for investors who held stocks in the index to be made whole in real dollars. The S&P is only just above its inflation-adjusted high from 15 years ago of 2,059.\n\nThursday was a big day for the Nasdaq, which got a 1.2 percent lift to 4,858, its highest level in 15 years. Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO), one of the original Internet \u201chorsemen,\u201d was a big part of that gain, climbing 9.4 percent after exceeding earnings estimates.\n\nA deal between online travel companies Expedia (Nasdaq: EXPE) and Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE: OWW) also created more enthusiasm for Nasdaq stocks. TripAdvisor (Nasdaq: TRIP) jumped 25 percent on hopes for more deal-making in the travel sector.\n\nThe tech sector lagged the S&P at the start of the year. But it\u2019s not just Cisco \u2014 several tech bellwethers have posted surprisingly strong fourth-quarter results, including Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL).\n\nRelated: Rising Dollar Hits Blue Chips\n\nStrong sales and profits from the tech giants have reminded investors that, even without global economic growth, tech stocks can outperform as long as they are in the sweet spot of secular trends like growth in mobile, cloud computing or the networked home.\n\n\u201cWe believe the pace of innovation is accelerating and providing attractive growth opportunities for many technology stocks even in a mixed global macro environment,\u201d analyst Steve Jue with Rainier Investment Management wrote recently in his 2015 outlook, explaining why the firm is emphasizing technology stocks.\n\nThe Nasdaq may not make it to 5,048, let alone 6,841. But if global tensions continue to ease and economic trends provide a tailwind, this era\u2019s four Internet horsemen \u2013 oddly reminiscent of the four horsemen of the late \u201890s, could ride to new record highs once again.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s been 15 years, but the tech-laden index is finally approaching former tech-bubble levels", "title": "Will the Nasdaq Finally Top Its 2000 High?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/13/Will-Nasdaq-Finally-Top-Its-2000-High", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07082014_Stock_Market_Ticker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/13/Will-Nasdaq-Finally-Top-Its-2000-High", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07082014_Stock_Market_Ticker.jpg", "creator": "@ameystone", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s been 15 years, but the tech-laden index is finally approaching former tech-bubble levels", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc1e0\"", "article_summary": "A deal between online travel companies Expedia (Nasdaq: EXPE) and Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE: OWW) also created more enthusiasm for Nasdaq stocks.\nBut it\u2019s not just Cisco \u2014 several tech bellwethers have posted surprisingly strong fourth-quarter results, including Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL).\nFrom there, it\u2019s in spitting distance of its all-time closing high of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000.\nThe real excitement in the market this week was the climb in the Nasdaq, which gained 165 points, or 3.5 percent.\nIn contrast, the S&P 500 is now 40 percent above its early 2000 high."}
