All across America, "Team Red White And Blue ", "Team Rubicon," and "The Mission Continues," teamed up to complete a "Run As One," but in Panama City Beach they added something a little extra this year.

Not only did the community gather to take part in the 5th Annual 5K and one mile walk, but motorcycle riders gathered to ride as one.

The event is a way to raise Veteran awareness and bring the Veteran community together.

Kelly Elrod, the Chapter Captain for Team Red White And Blue in Panama City said, "The money Saturday is going to all three organizations and will be split evenly between Team Red White And Blue, Team Rubicon and The Mission Continues. We try to engage veterans to get active in their community, to affect change and help other Veterans so all that money will go directly towards those programs."

The event was created after Team Rubicon's Captain, Clay Hunt, a fellow Veteran, lost his battle with depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
