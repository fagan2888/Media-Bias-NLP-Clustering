And I reprise my earlier claim that if you had told me Ohio Gov. John Kasich would be the last candidate to drop out, I would have laughed in your face.\n\nWell, who\u2019s laughing now? New York businessman Donald Trump, that\u2019s who. After Mr. Trump won the Indiana primary Tuesday night, his closest rival (who was hundreds of delegates behind), Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, announced he was suspending his campaign. Even though Mr. Kasich was still in the race, he had been previously eliminated mathematically since he needed more delegates to win than were actually available. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Kasich announced he was suspending his campaign, making Mr. Trump the presumptive GOP nominee (let the Speaker Paul Ryan conspiracy theories fly!).\n\nSo now that the GOP has its nominee, let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane and see how we got here, by examining all the candidates who dropped out and why they did so.\n\nRick Perry\u2014Dropped out September 11, 2015\n\nPoor Rick Perry. He went into 2012 with strong conservative credentials but quickly flamed out after a series of weird missteps, including his infamous \u201coops\u201d moment in a debate. He had a lot of embarrassment to overcome in 2016, but he couldn\u2019t overcome it, and he became the first casualty of the election.\n\nScott Walker\u2014Dropped out September 21, 2015\n\nMr. Walker had one of the most disappointing campaigns of 2016. He was a candidate for all of 70 days, and he entered the race as the person to beat. But his campaign quickly fizzled once Mr. Trump got into the race and the Wisconsin governor failed to adequately answer random press questions.\n\nBobby Jindal\u2014Dropped out November 17, 2015\n\nMr. Jindal declined to run in 2012, which probably would have been a better year for him. In 2016, he never gained real traction and was relegated to the undercard debates until he dropped out. His story and his message were pretty solid, and he was probably the best candidate when it came to the issue of Obamacare, but his campaign never really popped under the light of Mr. Trump.\n\nLindsey Graham\u2014Dropped out December 21, 2015\n\nI didn\u2019t cover the undercard debates because, seriously, none of those candidates had a chance. But if I did, each debate would include Mr. Graham\u2019s best zingers. From occasionally self deprecatory to acerbic, he made watching the undercard debates bearable. Sadly for Mr. Graham, Americans aren\u2019t interested in another war, so his hawkish approach to the Islamic State turned people off.\n\nGeorge Pataki\u2014Dropped out December 29, 2015\n\nDid you remember Mr. Pataki ran for president? Neither did I, but he dropped out just before the new year. He ran an unremarkable campaign and was an unremarkable candidate.\n\nMike Huckabee\u2014Dropped out February 1, 2016\n\nMr. Huckabee dropped out after placing 9th in the Iowa caucus. Iowa should have been one of the best states for his social conservatism, but he couldn\u2019t even come close to winning. He began his campaign on the main debate stage, but was quickly sent to the undercard debate as his poll numbers declined.\n\nRand Paul\u2014Dropped out February 3, 2016\n\nA lot of people had high hopes for Mr. Paul, myself included. He was supposed to be able to appeal to Independents and grow the Republican Party. But after his campaign faced money problems and low polls, the staunch Libertarian dropped out. He couldn\u2019t even do as well in Iowa as his father, Ron Paul, had in 2012.\n\nRick Santorum\u2014Dropped out February 3, 2016\n\nMr. Santorum ran because he came in second in 2012. The Republican Party has a big problem with nominating the next in line, so Mr. Santorum seemed like an obvious choice. But in the age of the Internet and has-beens, his campaign never really took off, and he was forced to endure the undercard debate until he dropped out. He came in 11th in Iowa, behind New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nChris Christie\u2014Dropped out February 10, 2016\n\nIt was my elderly horse\u2019s birthday, and I was visiting her when I got the news about Mr. Christie. I believe my reaction was: \u201cAbout time.\u201d This for the man I helped pass out literature for in 2009 (before I settled on commentary/journalism as a career). Mr. Christie never had a place in the GOP primary once Mr. Trump entered the race. Mr. Christie was supposed to be the brash, tell-it-like-it-is Northeasterner, but Mr. Trump quickly claimed that title and then some, overshadowing Mr. Christie. The New Jersey governor has since endorsed and campaigned with Mr. Trump, so maybe he\u2019ll get a job in the mogul\u2019s Cabinet.\n\nCarly Fiorina\u2014Dropped out February 10, 2016\n\nMs. Fiorina was the only female candidate among 16 men, and she held her own. She blew away her competition in her first undercard debate and earned a place in the main debate. She then needled Mr. Trump over his comments about her face and proved why she belonged on the main stage. But her campaign failed to capitalize on her newfound popularity, and her poll numbers quickly dropped until she was back in the undercard debate. She later endorsed Mr. Cruz and was announced as his vice presidential pick if he were to win the nomination (which he didn\u2019t).\n\nJim Gilmore\u2014Dropped out February 12, 2016\n\nMr. Gilmore, the man who couldn\u2019t even qualify to be in all the undercard debates, outlasted nine well-known candidates (and George Pataki). He may have been a likeable guy, but the former Virginia governor hadn\u2019t been in a major office since 2002. People had forgotten he existed. In New Hampshire, Mr. Gilmore got fewer votes than \u201cother.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush\u2014Dropped out February 20, 2016\n\nMr. Bush also entered the race with high expectations that quickly fell flat. By the time he dropped out, he had run one of the saddest campaigns in recent history. Beyond the campaign\u2019s money problems, Mr. Bush couldn\u2019t connect to an audience. He tried to be funny but it didn\u2019t work. He tried to go after Mr. Trump but it didn\u2019t work. He was just\u2026 uninteresting.\n\nBen Carson\u2014Dropped out March 4, 2016\n\nMr. Carson got into the race and almost immediately began saying one dumb thing after another. I was previously a fan of his, but after watching him say weird things about the pyramids and appear half sedated at the debates, my image of him was tarnished. He was able to raise a ton of cash, and his outsider, nice-guy persona took him quite far, but he could never be the nominee when it appeared he didn\u2019t know anything about any subject.\n\nMarco Rubio\u2014Dropped out March 15, 2016\n\nAs Mr. Bush began to flail, Mr. Rubio emerged as the best hope for the Republican Party (to some). He was young, attractive, articulate, charming, Hispanic and his ideology fell somewhere between Establishment and conservative. Yet somehow he couldn\u2019t convince voters that he was their guy. After failing to win his home state of Florida, he suspended his campaign.\n\nTed Cruz\u2014Dropped out May 3, 2016\n\nMr. Cruz had the best ground game of any candidate in the race. He entered the presidential election prepared to do whatever it took to win, but he couldn\u2019t pull it off against an opponent like Mr. Trump. Mr. Cruz went from being despised by the Republican Establishment to somehow being associated with it. It\u2019s like everyone forgot he was behind the government shutdown. Indiana was seen as his last stand, and he couldn\u2019t pull it off. Of course, he had no hope of securing the nomination before that, but his continued presence in the race was thought to give Republicans a chance at a contested convention that would stop Mr. Trump.\n\nThat didn\u2019t work out so well.\n\nJohn Kasich\u2014Dropped out May 4, 2016\n\nMr. Kasich did so poorly that he had fewer delegates than Mr. Rubio even a month after the Florida senator dropped out. His strategy seemed to amount to staying in the race and hoping everyone else dropped out. He even stayed in long after it was clear he couldn\u2019t possibly secure the nomination by winning delegates. It was like the tortoise and the hare, if the tortoise sat around hoping a meteor would take out the hare.\n\nAnd that just leaves\u2026. Mr. Trump.\n\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Ashe Schow", "sailthru.author": "Ashe Schow", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-483174260.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-483174260.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "2016 elections, Chris Christie, Donald Trump, GOP Primary, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-483174260.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "keywords": "2016 elections, chris christie, donald trump, gop primary, jeb bush, john kasich, marco rubio, ted cruz", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-483174260.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "description": "A timeline and explanation for why each GOP candidate dropped out, leaving Donald Trump as the nominee.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "And Then There Was One", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "sailthru.byline_slug": "ashe-schow", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "news_keywords": "%tags%", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/img_06061.jpg?quality=80&w=88", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "@AsheSchow", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2016-05-05T13:00:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-05T13:00:11+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/ashe-schow"}, "sailthru.description": "From 17 candidates to one: How the GOP primary ended with Donald Trump as the nominee.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "From 17 candidates to one: How the GOP primary ended with Donald Trump as the nominee.", "title": "And Then There Was One", "url": "http://observer.com/2016/05/and-then-there-was-one/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-483174260.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Ashe Schow is a senior political columnist for the New York Observer and a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner.
