It all began on a late evening in Toronto when a woman from Los Angeles messaged me on OkCupid to say she liked my look, and that it was a shame about the distance. As I\u2019d said to a friend earlier that day, \u201cIf she\u2019s not already in my bed, it\u2019s too far to go.\u201d Emotional distance has always gotten the better of me, so my friend, a couples\u2019 therapist, suggested I try online dating. The safety of not having to meet a person in real life, she said, might lead me to speak more honestly about myself. Did I know, she asked, what I was looking for in a romantic relationship? I\u2019d come out of a break-up with a woman who had a young child. It had taken months just to bring myself to delete her girl\u2019s birthday alert on my calendar. So, when I set to crafting my dating profile, I announced upfront that I wanted a family. Taking a cue from \u201cLos Angeles,\u201d I scanned profiles and landed on a woman in San Diego who looked a bit different in each photo. I could see myself with each version of this woman. She had two teenaged sons. I\u2019d never so much as lived with a male of any age.\n\nI opened a chat window\u2014\u201cLike your look. Shame about the distance\u201d\u2014and immediately logged off. Across the room, my phone buzzed. I took the phone to my bedroom and read the reply. \u201cDistance? What are you talking about? You\u2019re just 2,000 miles and up the road!\u201d \u201cSan Diego\u201d was online. I came to call her B, the first initial of her name, and within 24 hours we\u2019d agreed to meet in Toronto three weeks later. We knew it would be difficult. After the end of an 18-year relationship with the boys\u2019 other mother, we\u2019d be foolish to think I could simply join a family. B and I traveled back and forth eight times, and, two years later, we got married. It was a start. * * * Two weeks after our wedding, I threw my ring\u2014over what, I don\u2019t remember, likely something to do with how careless we\u2019d been, in the case of the children, inconsiderate. Months earlier, in Toronto, as we were about to part again, we\u2019d gone in search for our rings. The shopkeeper pointed to a row of brightly enameled copper bands. The one that fit B was green\u2014the color of my eyes\u2014and the one that fit me was blue\u2014the color of hers. Unconventional approaches to life, love, and lasting happiness\n\nRead More When I pitched my ring, it deflected against a mirror and shattered the enamel. Yet, over time, as people asked to see the ring, they assumed the design was intentional. I began to wonder if it doesn\u2019t take a marriage to fix a marriage. Shouldn\u2019t we make grand leaps of faith for the people we love? Any problems we had were not the direct product of two strangers acting solely on their impulses. By this point, we were doing the work of any blended family. It was always going to be hard. And in speaking more directly about what I'd wanted in a relationship from the onset\u2014candor enabled by technological circumstance\u2014my relationship had given me a safe rate of introduction to the family I needed. Progress, indeed. B and I originally met online, and it was the online world that kept us connected. We used all the free text and call applications available, and to sustain intimacy, we Skyped. When the three-hour time difference got too much, we began to leave video greetings in a shared Dropbox folder. B encouraged a tradition of reporting what had been the best part of our day; I encouraged a tradition that leaves me hoping Dropbox employees don\u2019t download user\u2019s videos for personal profit.\n\nThe greetings eventually became more domestic; birthday wishes to mutual friends, washing the dogs, an occasional (and reluctant) greeting from one of the boys. Sometimes, I just fired up the webcam and ate cereal, about as domestic as it gets. * * * Upon first deciding to meet in person, B and I agreed we wouldn\u2019t have sex for 24 hours. When we did, my grand reveal was a pair of anxiously sweaty armpits. Hers was a reminder of who was waiting at home for the woman I\u2019d seduced via Wi-Fi\u2014faint traces of two C-sections and the soft folds that, to my eye, resembled the outer shell of Batman\u2019s suit. My nickname for B had been \u201cHot Mom.\u201d Now she was a superhero. From a distance, sex was an exercise in humility, creative lighting, and an appetite for patience, particularly when the wireless dropped signal and we were left with a frozen image and a proceeding soundtrack. Upon reunion, we often retreated into shyness, thwarting the time spent learning each other\u2019s limitations and which we could be trusted to encroach upon. The first time I met B\u2019s children, we all played basketball in the driveway, where I attempted to block their mother\u2019s rush to the net with the enthusiasm of a pet dry humping a pillow. This isn\u2019t a game; I understand. I\u2019ve long ago fit \u201cstepparent-in-training\u201d into my Twitter bio at the expense of other self-identifiers. In the United States, with each successive marriage the risk of divorce is greater\u2014even higher in remarriages with children, and higher still when one partner enters the marriage childless. Even the youngest had done an audit of how this could go down: People come and go, but will any of them stay? B\u2019s mother, with advancing dementia, had lived with them for a time. A close family friend has also moved in briefly to get on his feet after a divorce. Now me. I truly had joined a family in progress, our family. We do have our moments. Just the other day, one of the dogs, curled up under a blanket with the eldest son, emerged, slinked across the room, and up onto my lap.
