Comparing the two time periods, researchers found that consumers\u2019 average out-of-pocket spending for birth control pills fell from $32.74 to $20.37, and, for IUDs, from $262.38 to $84.30.\n\nUnder the mandate, private health insurance plans are required to cover prescription contraceptives at no cost, though many women still faced costs due to insurers\u2019 failure to comply, among other reasons.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that the ACA is saving the average pill user $255 per year, and the average woman receiving an IUD is saving $248,\u201d said lead author Nora V.
