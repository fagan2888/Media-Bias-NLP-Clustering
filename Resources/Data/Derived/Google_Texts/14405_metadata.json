It also automates status determination and reporting for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), another hardship for LTC facilities.\n\nAttendance on Demand, Inc. is pleased to announce a new feature for Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) reporting. It produces a PBJ file that reports hours by calendar day, automatically splitting night-shift hours between days for facilities that normally allocate the whole shift to a single day.\n\nBeginning in July 2016, long-term care (LTC) facilities are required to report daily staffing and census information for each fiscal quarter through the online PBJ system to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In addition to census data, CMS expects detailed accounts of each employee\u2019s service, including job title, services performed, and daily number of hours worked. CMS also requires hours to be reported by calendar day \u2013 midnight to midnight \u2013 not the way many facilities track time.\n\nHours for shifts that cross midnight have to be split for PBJ reporting. Attendance on Demand\u2019s newest PBJ reporting feature does this automatically without changing the way the facility\u2019s operational reports or employee time cards display time.\n\n\u201cThe deadline is quickly approaching and many facilities are still unclear about their PBJ reporting strategy,\u201d said Beth Baerman, Director of Communications at Attendance on Demand, Inc. \u201cAttendance on Demand can help remove the burden of PBJ reporting. It also automates status determination and reporting for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), another hardship for LTC facilities.\u201d\n\nAbout Attendance on Demand\n\nAttendance on Demand supports the labor management needs of thousands of companies and more than three-quarters of a million employees across North America.
