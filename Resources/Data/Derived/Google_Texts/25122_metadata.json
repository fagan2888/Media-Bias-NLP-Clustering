And happy to have you with us today.\n\nMICHELLE OBAMBA: I\u2019m doing great.\n\nAL SHARPTON: How are you?\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: I\u2019m happy to be here. I\u2019m doing great. You know the sun is shining, it\u2019s a little chilly, but it\u2019s Christmas time.\n\nAL SHARPTON: Yeah, well I am a witness. It\u2019s a little chilly up down here. I\u2019ll see you later tonight.\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: Yes, indeed. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\n\nAL SHARPTON: I want to get into this, because this is such an important message that you\u2019re giving. And what really was striking to me is that you got very personal. You talked about twelve years ago with Sasha. Tell us about that.\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: Yeah. When Sasha was about four months old, you know, we were blessed with healthy babies, I had a healthy pregnancy, you know, Malia was, you know, issue free. But I will never forget, it was a day when, you know, one hour she was fine, she was normal, she was happy, doing everything I was used to her doing, and the next hour she was crying inconsolably. And that just wasn\u2019t like her. And I did everything I tried to do, I tried to feed her, I tried to walk her, I tried to burp her. Finally I just thought I need to call my pediatrician. That\u2019s the first point that I want to make is that we had health insurance, which meant I had a really good relationship with our pediatrician. So he knew me. And he knew I wasn\u2019t the kind of mother to call up just because my baby was crying.\n\nAL SHARPTON: Right.\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: So when I described the symptoms, you know the fact that she had a slight fever, but she seemed to be in pain in a way that I had never seen in a baby. He said; get her to the emergency room, I don\u2019t like the sounds of it. Just go. Do not pass go, just get to the emergency room; and as it turns out she had meningitis; and they had to do a spinal tap. She turned out, obviously, as the story ends, she is fine, she\u2019s healthy, she\u2019s a beautiful young lady. But if we hadn\u2019t had insurance and access to a pediatrician and access to a hospital where we didn\u2019t have to worry about the cost of care, if we had waited overnight, if we had postponed acting there\u2019s no telling what the outcome would\u2019ve been.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why for me, as a mother, I am just, you know, I just can\u2019t put into words how important it is for every American, for every mother, for every person in this country, to have healthcare. Because you just never know what kind of curveballs life are going to throw you. You know?\n\nAnd there will always be a curveball. But it shouldn\u2019t be a curveball that lands you in the hospital and bankrupt. But before Obamacare, that\u2019s how, that\u2019s was the reason for the vast majority of bankruptcy filings in this country because people were losing their homes because of these uncovered medical costs; hundreds of thousands of dollars for people who had gall bladder surgery, or an infant born premature, or you know, an unexpected diagnosis of cancer. And now that we have the Affordable Care Act where people have access to affordable insurance, we need people to sign up for that. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m so passionate about it. You know, people deserve that kind of peace of mind that insurance provides, that we have, as the President and the First Lady of the United States, every American should have that kind of peace of mind.\n\nAL SHARPTON: The thing that strikes me is you bring a passion and a perspective to this that is really beyond the partisan bickering we hear in Washington and we hear on talk radio, or cable, and I\u2019m doing both now. Or in civil rights what I do. You talk as a mother and you talk as someone who said I\u2019ve been there and I know what ordinary Americans are facing. And this is why they need to deal with this.\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: Yeah. And we, Barack and I just met with a group of mothers, because we\u2019re talking to mothers. Mothers are the ones who make the decisions about healthcare in their families. They\u2019re the ones dealing with sickness on a regular basis. They\u2019re the ones who have the ear to their kids, to their teenagers, their young adults who think they\u2019re invincible and don\u2019t need insurance. We\u2019re talking to them because they\u2019re the ones with the stories, just like me, in a roomful of women who, you know, had young people with cancer that they never imagined. You know? Sons and daughter who are working part time jobs don\u2019t have insurance, but you know, running across these curveballs that I talked about.\n\nAnd they tell their stories with tears in their eyes, you know, that until this Act was passed \u2013 there was one mother who said she cried herself to sleep every night because her son was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in his early twenties. And she didn\u2019t know how she was going to pay for it. So she was praying every night that the Act wouldn\u2019t be repealed. You know, so that\u2019s the kind of personal, you know, story that\u2019s often missed in that back and forth that turns this issue, which is a pretty plain and simple issue, Reverend Al. This is about getting people healthcare who didn\u2019t have it, and can\u2019t afford it; and now we have Obamacare, and it\u2019s affordable.\n\nMost people can get a plan for as little as $100 a month they can be insured. They can go to a doctor on a regular basis. When they get sick they won\u2019t go bankrupt. It\u2019s as simple as that, but healthcare is so confusing to most people that it\u2019s easy to confuse the situation, which is why now what we\u2019re encouraging people to do is just educate themselves, go to healthcare.gov. Find out what these plans offer. It\u2019s easy to access. The website is vastly improved. They are signing up as many as 50,000 people a day now. But if people aren\u2019t comfortable with a website they can also go to a 1-800 number; 1-800-318-2596 and they can get personal assistance, somebody who will walk them through the process. But it\u2019s important for people to sign up by December 23rd if they want to be enrolled by January 1st.\n\nSo now it\u2019s about education. It\u2019s about outreach. It\u2019s about making sure that people, particularly in the African-American community, are not confused by this political back and forth that\u2019s going on. Healthcare, Obamacare, is a good thing; and it\u2019s something that I want every American to have access to. We shouldn\u2019t live in a country this rich, right, where people are choosing between their rent or their medicine. You know, where kids aren\u2019t getting the immunizations they need. They\u2019re not getting the, you know, the nutrition information that they need to stay healthy and to thrive. Not in America. But before it wasn\u2019t available. It was unaffordable. Now we don\u2019t have an excuse. And that\u2019s where my passion comes from, because I want for the rest of America what my family has. You know? I want people to have the peace of mind that I have, because it\u2019s hard enough being a mother trying to raise kids and then worrying about whether if they get sick whether you can help them. There is nothing more powerless than being a mother who can\u2019t help their child when they\u2019re sick. That\u2019s just to me untenable.\n\nBut we now have the resources. But we have to be educated about it. We have to do the, we have to reach out, we have to get signed up, and then we have to sign up others. We need young people signed up too for this, because it\u2019s not just about moms and babies, it\u2019s about young people who feel invincible, right?\n\nAL SHARPTON: That\u2019s right.\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: Who feel like I\u2019m never going to get sick, I\u2019m healthy now. Well, young people are the ones who are driving around late at night, you know, that can get into a car accident, or slip at a club, you know?\n\nAL SHARPTON: Right.\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: Who play pick-up games and to get a black eye, you know? Cooking for the first time and cut a finger, and you know, bust an artery, you know? Healthcare is something that every American of all ages, particularly young people, because one of the things we learned from one of the women in the group that we talked to who had a nephew that she cares for, she worries just as much because he wouldn\u2019t get healthcare because she knows that if he didn\u2019t get healthcare, if something happened to him, she\u2019d have to pay for it, right?\n\nAL SHARPTON: Yep, yep. Yep.\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: You know, young people aren\u2019t just living out there on their own, if they get sick and can\u2019t afford it, who\u2019s going to have to come in and clean up that financial mess but the parents and grandparents who care about them. You know? So young people owe it to their mothers, to give their mothers the peace of mind to know that they are insured and that they can take care of themselves if something goes wrong.\n\nAL SHARPTON: Well, that\u2019s a strong message from the First Lady of the United States. And we thank you for coming on and sharing that with us. And we thank you for all that you do. I tell the President all the time I lost all this weight to be your model on the program.\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: Oh, you\u2019re doing it.\n\nAL SHARPTON: He says I\u2019m a little too old, they\u2019re looking for somebody under 35. I didn\u2019t read the fine print.\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: (Laugh)\n\nAL SHARPTON: I didn\u2019t know about the age requirement. (Chuckle)\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: I think you are an excellent example, and I thank you for giving me this time, this forum, I just want to thank you for all the work that you\u2019re doing out there in the community and the churches to keep this issue front of mind and make sure that people understand what the law is all about. It\u2019s your kind of work that\u2019s going to make the difference in our communities and in this country. So I love you so much.\n\nAL SHARPTON: Love you, thank you.\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: All right, take care.\n\nAL SHARPTON: Mrs. Michelle Obama, our First Lady. Thank you.\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: Bye-bye.\n\nFor more on this story, go to: BlackAmericaWeb\n\n\n\nAbout Keeping it Real with Reverend Al Sharpton\n\nAs one of America\u2019s most-renowned civil rights leaders, Sharpton continues to challenge the American political establishment to be inclusive of all people regardless of race, gender, class, or beliefs.
