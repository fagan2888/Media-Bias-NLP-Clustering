The first PSA reminds young viewers how important it is to cover bowls and trash containers to reduce the spread of the virus \u2014 if these contain water, mosquitos can breed in them. When Elmo and Raya return in the second PSA, they recommend preventive measures children and parents can take to stay safe, like wearing long-sleeved shirts and not skimping on the bug spray.\n\n\u201cChildren often help educate their parents, especially in areas of poverty,\u201d WHO spokesman Daniel Epstein told CNN. For that reason, Lewis Kofsky, Sesame Workshop's vice president for Latin America, hopes the campaign reaches every child in the region.The videos currently air only in Spanish and Portuguese. But according to Pan American\u2019s Facebook page, English versions are coming soon.
