ISIS now controls the two major cities in the province, Ramadi and Fallujah, as well as 90 percent of the rest of the province.\n\nThe fall of Ramadi is the latest turn in a continuous battle that has lasted a year and a half. The loss of the city came in much the same way it had in Mosul: After a few days of heavy attacks by ISIS involving suicide armored car bombs and artillery shelling, the Iraqi government forces collapsed and fled their posts, abandoning their weapons and their vehicles. But unlike the fall of Mosul, the collapse in Ramadi occurred despite U.S.-led air bombing in the area, and after warnings months ago that the city could be taken.\n\nThe loss in Ramadi highlights the degree to which ISIS has been underestimated, and the Iraqi security forces have been overestimated to win the fight on the ground while the U.S. provides support from the air. This defeat also sets up a dramatic conflict for Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi: He could forfeit Anbar Province to ISIS or allow Shiite militias to win the day. But that comes with a big price: sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shias.\n\nRelated: Why America\u2019s War with ISIS Will Take Years\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear, though, that Iraqi forces are still not up to the challenge of defeating ISIS on their own. Iraqi forces were defeated on Friday after dozens of ISIS fighters crossed the Euphrates from the north, using boats to attack a hostile local tribe. Then a dozen bulldozers used as armored car bombs attacked from the east, enabling ISIS to take over the police headquarters and the governor's office in the city center. The Army and the Special Forces collapsed on Sunday after at least seven more armored car bombs hit their headquarters in the western edge of the city, clearing the way for ISIS to take full control of the city.\n\nThe major general commanding the army in Ramadi and the commanders of the area police and the special forces all fled the battlefield in the city, leaving their men, arms and vehicles in a disorganized withdrawal similar to that of Mosul 2014. Two videos posted online allegedly show dozens of policemen fleeing a building wearing civilian clothes and a long caravan of military vehicles\u2014mostly American--driving away as well.\n\nThe toll of the loss in Ramadi was devastating: In just a few days, 500 people and soldiers were killed, including many who were executed by ISIS. A massive amount of arms and munitions was lost to ISIS. Some 25,000 people fled the city.\n\nThe battle may have been won in a matter of days, but ISIS\u2019s victory was the result of a long-term strategy. ISIS pushed its way to Ramadi after several attempts and after carefully measured maneuvers. It took control of part of the city in January 2014, and attacked there relentlessly ever since.\n\nIn October 2014, it captured the town of Hit to the west of Ramadi. As a result, the Iraqi army units in Ramadi withdrew to their base, leaving the task of protecting the city to the police and local tribes. In December 2014, ISIS attacked the town of al-Baghdadi, near the site of a main Iraqi airbase, al-Asad. \u201cISIS likely attacked near al-Asad to fix [Iraqi security forces] forces there. They would have been the primary source of reinforcements to Ramadi, illustrating ISIS\u2019s operational design,\u201d said a report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).\n\nISIS advanced from controlling the western part of the city in December 2014 to the city center in April and May of this year, cutting the supply line between the two most important spots in Ramadi: the governor's office and the army headquarters. \u201cISIS began the attack by seizing neighborhoods between the two facilities,\u201d the ISW report explained.\n\nRelated: ISIS\u2019s 10 Most Extreme Acts of Terror\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nFinally, ISIS intensified its attacks on many fronts in May 2015 to distract and disperse the Iraqi government forces. Baghdad and several other cities and towns to the north and west were attacked with car bombs and foot soldiers. However, the main targets were the Baiji refinery on the main road to Mosul and Ramadi. \u201cISIS's strategy to consolidate its control of terrain, part of its defense, includes deliberate efforts not only to prevent the ISF [Iraqi security forces] from massing on one front, but also to divert them in different directions to allow ISIS to make advances even while under fire,\u201d the ISW report said.\n\nIn capturing Ramadi, ISIS was also able to take advantage of a series of political crises that created an atmosphere of distrust among Iraqis and decreased confidence in the ranks of the security forces. For example, the successful assault on the city coincided with a Shiite ritual of millions of people marching by foot to a holy site in Baghdad. The government allocated tens of thousands of soldiers to protect the marchers. Nevertheless, a group of marchers was able to sabotage several properties and belongings of Sunnis in Baghdad. The incident was contained, but it created bitterness among Sunnis.\n\nMore significant was a provision in the House Republicans\u2019 defense authorization bill for next year that attracted little notice here but created a larger controversy in Iraq. It proposed arming the Sunni tribes and the Kurdish Peshmerga as independent entities. The U.S. denied any policy change, but the idea stoked conspiracy theories in Iraq over who created ISIS and who is benefiting from it to divide Iraq. Many Shiites believe ISIS is supported by the U.S., while many Sunnis believe ISIS is supported by Iran. Neither allegation is supported by evidence, but both are dangerously destructive to the morale of anti-ISIS troops. The budget provision prompted many Iraqis to start talking as if the end of their country as a unified entity was imminent.\n\nA string of Iraqi missteps and controversies further heightened tensions between Sunnis and Shiites and undermined confidence in the government and its ministers. Questionable claims about the neutralizing of ISIS leadership and other enemies haven\u2019t helped. While the Iraqis announced the critical injuring of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and then the killing of his successor, Abu Alaa al-Afri, the Pentagon refused to confirm these claims. Audio of a Baghdadi speech that surfaced a few days before the fall of Ramadi reaffirmed his control of the terror group. Iraq had also announced the killing of Saddam Hussein's second in command and the current leader of the Baath party, the fugitive Izzat al-Douri, who also gave a speech prior to the fall of Ramadi to deny that claim.\n\nIt\u2019s not just confidence in Iraq\u2019s national leadership that has suffered. Corrupt military, tribal and provincial leaders have turned fighting ISIS into a lucrative business, exaggerating the numbers of their men in order to embezzle the salaries the government pays out. Most of the provincial officials live outside of Ramadi. Therefore, they lack their constituency\u2019s support and trust. One video posted online shows two tribal fighters and two policemen who were fighting ISIS in Ramadi on the eve of its fall. The men bitterly criticized Anbar provincial council members and the governor, calling them \u201ccorrupt politicians, liars...traitors...and dishonest.\u201d They called upon them to resign from their posts.\n\nAnd while Iraqi military leaders made a series of tactical mistakes that left their troops vulnerable, ISIS used proper tactics when attacking: It made sure to control the supply lines and the river banks, blowing up the bridges and awakening the sleeper cells. Over the last 18 months, it also targeted the army and the police leadership in Anbar, where more generals were killed or injured than any other province. The result could be seen in a video posted online in which Ramadi's policemen and tribal fighters criticize their commanders. \u201cIt is a pity that there is no coordination between the units. The forces are being maneuvered by whoever is available. There was no discipline among the forces,\u201d says one policeman in the video.\n\nRelated: Jihadicare?

Even before its victory in Ramadi, ISIS had made significant gains in the areas to the west and north of Baghdad, reversing Iraqi gains from a hard, year-long fight on the ground and in the air. ISIS leader al-Baghdadi pledged in a recent speech to continue the offensive and capture Baghdad and the Shiite holy site in Karbala.\n\nRelated: The Next Battle with ISIS Will Be on the Dark Web\u200b\u200b\n\nThe security in Baghdad \u2013 where a quarter of the nation\u2019s population lives \u2013 has worsened steadily over the last several weeks. After several months of relative peace, bombs and assassinations have become frequent occurrences again. ISIS\u2019s gains have made it clear that a reliable ground force is needed to clear and hold contested territory. What isn\u2019t yet clear is whether those troops will have to be American or not.\n\n\u201cI do think more U.S. ground troops would be needed playing an active combat role to try to turn the tide in Anbar,\u201d said Al-Tamimi of the Middle East Forum.\n\nOthers think otherwise. The Shiite militias hold the key, says Hisham Alhashimi, an expert on ISIS at the Iraqi National Security Advisor's office. But this approach presents huge risks for Iraq's unity, given that those militias are trained and funded by Tehran. \u201cIran's role will increase,\u201d Bunnik says, \u201cand the social fabric of the Iraqi state will further disintegrate.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Almost a year after the fall of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, ISIS has captured R", "title": "The Taking of Ramadi: Behind ISIS's Bloody Assault", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/21/Taking-Ramadi-Behind-ISISs-Bloody-Assault", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Iraqis_Flee_Ramadi_ISIS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/21/Taking-Ramadi-Behind-ISISs-Bloody-Assault", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Iraqis_Flee_Ramadi_ISIS.jpg", "creator": "@AlhamdaniRiyadh", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Almost a year after the fall of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, ISIS has captured R", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cISIS likely attacked near al-Asad to fix [Iraqi security forces] forces there.\nThe fall of Ramadi is the latest turn in a continuous battle that has lasted a year and a half.\nIraqi forces were defeated on Friday after dozens of ISIS fighters crossed the Euphrates from the north, using boats to attack a hostile local tribe.\nThey would have been the primary source of reinforcements to Ramadi, illustrating ISIS\u2019s operational design,\u201d said a report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).\nAudio of a Baghdadi speech that surfaced a few days before the fall of Ramadi reaffirmed his control of the terror group."}
