But the governor decided that taking Medicaid coverage away from people who had finally gained healthcare was not in the state\u2019s interest, especially after rankings came out showing Arkansas leading the nation in obesity. Hutchinson\u2019s Arkansas Works plan, which replaces the original \u201cprivate option\u201d with a waiver that ostensibly requires more personal responsibility, survives due to some interesting maneuvers.When the governor knew he wouldn\u2019t get the required 75% vote to fund his updated program, he cut a deal with Medicaid backers to insert a clause that would have let the program expire at the end of the year. Hutchinson made it clear he planned to use his line-item veto on that provision, which would leave Medicaid fully funded.Which was enough to cause the 2 of 10 lawmakers blocking the changes to cave, giving Hutchinson what he wanted in the first place\u2014a vote to fund Medicaid. If the 2 hadn\u2019t changed their minds, Medicaid would not be funded at all, something even Obamacare critics couldn\u2019t defend.The bill with the sham amendment passed Thursday and Hutchinson used his line-item veto to cancel the sunset language immediately.Kaiser Health News reported that Hutchinson praised the \u201cspirit of cooperation\u201d in the General Assembly and described his moves as \u201ctransparency,\u201d because, \u201cEveryone knew what was happening.
