STAFF VIDEO BY JENNA INTERSIMONE\n\nOfficials at a New Jersey high school say they\u2019re upset over a photo on social media showing students playing a \u201cJews vs. Nazis\u201d drinking game. (Photo: ~File)\n\nPRINCETON - Police are investigating a photo posted on social media that showed students from a New Jersey high school playing a \u201cJews vs. Nazis\u201d drinking game.\n\nThe photo was shared on Snapchat, where one Princeton High School student captured it and wrote about it on her blog. It shows students playing a version of beer pong dubbed \u201cHolocaust Pong\u201d or \u201cAlcoholocaust.\u201d Students can be seen pouring beer into two sets of cups that were arranged in the forms of a Star of David and a swastika.\n\nThe 17-year-old student who blogged about the photo, Jamaica Ponder, told NJ.com the students were her classmates.\n\n\u201cThey are athletes and student leaders,\u201d Ponder said. \u201cThey\u2019re prominent individuals that everybody knows, captains of sports teams.\u201d\n\nThe Princeton Police Department said Friday morning that they\u2019ve started an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the photo, NJ.com reported.\n\nLt. John Bucchere said that possession of alcohol by minors on private property is not a crime.\n\n\u201cHowever, if there is evidence that someone bought alcohol for minors or provided a place specifically for them to consume it, that is illegal,\u201d Bucchere said.\n\nPrinceton Superintendent Steve Cochrane said he\u2019s deeply upset that students engaged in a drinking game with \u201cclearly anti-Semitic\u201d overtones.\n\n\u201cAn incident such as this one, forces us to take a hard look at our efforts in educating our children in the values that may be most important to their success in life,\u201d Cochrane said.\n\nHe said the district is talking to the students and their families about the photo.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.
