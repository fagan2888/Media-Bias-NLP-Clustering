And the Wildcats stuck to that script again against the Wolves on Saturday as they stormed back to win the final three sets 25-16, 25-17 and 25-15 to claim back-to-back Class 1A state championships, cap a spotless 30-0 season, and bring home the program's fifth state title.\n\nThe undefeated record for Fleming marked the third time it had accomplished that feat in school history \u2014 the other two came in 2007 and 2008 when it won its first pair of state championships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt's a completely different feeling than last year's championship,\u201d said Fleming senior setter Rachel Frantz, who was masterful with five aces, eight kills, nine digs and 31 assists. \u201cLast year, we were the underdogs (No. 4 seed). This year, we were on top and we had to be mentally tough to stay there. And this is a great way to go out and end the year.\u201d\n\nIt doesn't get much more mentally challenging than dropping the opening set of a state championship game, but it's a scenario the Wildcats had prepared for.\n\nFleming players pile on top of each other after defeating Idalia 3-1 in the Class 1A state championship match. (Jonathan Seib)\n\n\u201cOne of the things we work on in practice is, going against our JV, we play down 22-18 and force ourselves to get mentally tough. We knew if we lost the set, we could come back,\u201d Frantz said.\n\nIdalia was the aggressor in the first set as it led by as many as nine points, blocked well, and were taking huge swings against the Fleming block, which had trouble timing the Wolves to begin the match.\n\n\u201cWe got a little frustrated and were just hitting hard and straight, as hard as we could, and Idalia is so big that when you hit hard into its block, it's bad news,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cThen we weren't getting the blocks on the other side. We were a little bit late and were lining kids up a little bit wrong.\u201d\n\nFleming, which finished with six solo blocks, would figure out the Wolves' tendencies in the second set, though.\n\nThe Wildcats took back control at the front of the net \u2014 jumping out to a double-digit 13-3 lead following an ace by senior Timmi Keisel. And they had seniors, outside hitter Deborah Kurtzer and libero Megan Chintala, seemingly digging every ball that crossed the 10-foot line as the two finished with 33 digs and 23 digs, respectively, en route to a convincing 25-16 win that stole away all the momentum Idalia previously had.\n\n\u201cEverybody did their jobs,\u201d said Chintala about the turnaround in the second set. \u201cAnd everybody took part in what they were supposed to do, stayed positive, and kept encouraging each other.\u201d\n\nIdalia tried to regroup in the third set as it held a lead as late as 12-10. But an 8-2 blitz by the Wildcats, aided by a block from Frantz and kills from Keisel and Kurtzer, created all the separation Fleming needed to take the set 25-17.\n\nKeisel, the reigning Class 1A Player of the Year, took over in the fourth and final set as she rattled off seven on her match-high 17 kills \u2014 including a bullet she spiked down on match point \u2014 to help the Wildcats polish off the 25-15 win, 3-1 championship win, and 47th straight victory overall dating back to last season.\n\nFleming's last loss was a five-setter to Class 2A foe Akron on Sept. 28, 2013. Since then, it has lost just 15 total sets.\n\nFleming senior Timmi Keisel hits against two Idalia blockers during Saturday's Class 1A state championship match. Keisel had 17 kills in the Wildcats' 3-1 win over the Wolves. (Jonathan Seib)\n\n\u201cIt's a surreal feeling right now,\u201d said Keisel, who got to share the moment this year with her little sister, Alli, who had a breakout freshman season. \u201cGoing into this match, I was remembering how I felt last year after winning the state title and hoping we could feel that way again.\u201d\n\nFor senior Saige Herbert, who was limited to being a cheerleader on the bench as a junior last season, it was a completely new feeling.\n\n\u201cLast year, the girls were so supportive of me when I got hurt, so I just wanted to come back and help as best as I could,\u201d said Saige, who did her part with an ace, four kills, a block, and 13 digs. \u201cI'm so proud of this team, this family, that I can't even put it into words.\u201d\n\nIt was a magical ending for the Wildcats and to the careers of their eight seniors: Timmi Keisel, Frantz, Kurtzer, Chintala, Saige Herbert, Sabrina Lousberg, Emily Muller and Elayna Muller, who chipped in five digs in Saturday's championship win, as well.\n\n\u201cThey are just an unbelievable group,\u201d said Derek Herbert about his senior core. \u201cThis shows the character of these girls. They got the highest GPA of all Class 1A schools in the state this year and we got the academic state championship, as well, this year. That shows they are smart, they care about working hard and doing what's right, and to be able to have had them and coach them is truly a blessing.\u201d\n\nAnd with Alli Keisel and sophomore Shaylee Johnson (eight kills against Idalia) headlining a list of returning underclassmen who saw consistent varsity time this season \u2014 including juniors Justice Bretz and Jessica Stone, sophomores Kalyn Serrato and Jessica Sigmon, and freshman Bailey Chintala \u2014 the ingrediants are there for the Wildcats to be a threat again for a three-peat in 2015.\n\nIt's just part of the routine up in Fleming.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sports/ci_26901214/fleming-wins-fifth-volleyball-title-school-history", "sailthru.author": "By David Wilson \n \n  Journal-Advocate sports writer", "ag": {"canon": "JournalAdvocate:article:26901214:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-09T15:08:47-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "journal-advocate.com", "description": "The Fleming volleyball program is very superstitious when it comes to its routines.\n\nWhether that means a certain volleyball tie that makes frequent appearances around the neck of head coach Derek Herbert, a particular Arby's order, or the designated seating chart along the Wildcats' bench.", "title": "Fleming wins fifth volleyball title in school history", "url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sports/ci_26901214/fleming-wins-fifth-volleyball-title-school-history", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/1109/20141109_012149_DSC_4796.jpg", "site": "@SterlingJA", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/1109/20141109_012149_DSC_4796_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2014-11-09T20:43:25-0700", "endDate": "2015-11-09T13:17:50-0700", "description": "The Fleming volleyball program is very superstitious when it comes to its routines.\n\nWhether that means a certain volleyball tie that makes frequent appearances around the neck of head coach Derek Herbert, a particular Arby's order, or the designated seating chart along the Wildcats' bench.", "byline": "By David WilsonJournal-Advocate", "pubDate": "2014-11-09T13:26:28-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-09T15:08:47-0700", "sailthru.title": "Fleming wins fifth volleyball title in school history", "verify-v1": "BXs3Tp/yfKM8u4D/sQH/llaXrumTjsEN3+pi+oLzohs=", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sports news, Sterling Colorado Sports news, Sterling Colorado news, Sports Sterling news, Sports Colorado news, US Sports news, world Sports news.", "sailthru.site": "journal-advocate.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sports/ci_26901214/fleming-wins-fifth-volleyball-title-school-history", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/1109/20141109_012149_DSC_4796.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Fleming volleyball program is very superstitious when it comes to its routines.\n\nWhether that means a certain volleyball tie that makes frequent appearances around the neck of head coach Derek Herbert, a particular Arby's order, or the designated seating chart along the Wildcats' bench.", "title": "Fleming wins fifth volleyball title in school history"}, "google-site-verification": "2iNkVYi6fQKhylL0pQaJF4qvYsz3qMnvr9EdKrmIbvw", "y_key": "b781c784225bf6e2", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/1109/20141109_012149_DSC_4796.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7bf1\"", "article_summary": "Fleming players pile on top of each other after defeating Idalia 3-1 in the Class 1A state championship match.\n3) also hug in the background following the Wildcats Class 1A state championship win.\nFleming senior Timmi Keisel hits against two Idalia blockers during Saturday's Class 1A state championship match.\nThey came back from a first-set loss in last year's championship match to beat Caliche.\nThey got the highest GPA of all Class 1A schools in the state this year and we got the academic state championship, as well, this year."}
