In addition there will be safety upgrades to the Bloomfield Avenue and Court Street intersections.\n\nBorough officials hope the streetscape improvements may sew the seeds for a more comprehensive revitalization program for Flemington.\n\n\"If we show we are willing to make an investment in our downtown, others will come here and make an investment,\" said Robert Shore, former chairman of the BID.\n\nOnly one area of downtown \u2014 the Union Hotel \u2014 has been designated as a redevelopment area, but Greiner said that the borough's planning board is undertaking a re-examination of Flemington's master plan and that may lead to the designation of other redevelopment areas.\n\nA downtown strategic plan prepared for the BID in 2014 outlined six areas in the downtown area that could be redeveloped, including the Turntable Junction shopping area that recently was sold to a New York investment group, Turntable and Fulper LLC, for more than $3 million.\n\nGreiner said he does not know the new owner's plans for the property, but said it serves as an important link between Main Street and the Liberty Village outlet center.\n\nBuy Photo A pedestrian walks past the closed Union Hotel on Main Street in Flemington.

The housing could attract millennials seeking their first apartments or retirees who no longer want to stay in suburban homes but want to live near urban amenities, he said.\n\nOfficials hope the streetscape project will be a positive step in making Main Street a more attractive place for both businesses and residents.\n\n\"Flemington is delighted to receive this grant,\" Greiner said. \"We look forward to the safety and circulation improvements, which will support our efforts at revitalization.\"\n\nThe mayor said the receipt of the grant demonstrates the positive results from a close working relationship between the borough and the Flemington Business Improvement District.\n\nGreiner also thanked the freeholders, the state Department of Transportation and District 16 state legislators for supporting Flemington's efforts to secure the grant.\n\n\"Establishing safe, walkable downtowns and neighborhoods are important aspects of having a thriving community,\" State Sen. Kip Bateman, R-16th District, said. \"This project will help to draw more visitors to Flemington's Main Street.\"\n\nBuy Photo Officials in Flemington are hoping to revitalize the downtown area, including new streetscapes and a new plaza in this area in front of the Records building on Main Street.

No time line has been established for construction.\n\n\"These improvements will make it safer and easier for people to get around downtown Flemington,\" said Phil Velella, chairman of the BID. \"thousands come to our community for music festivals and other special events and this will enhance their experience and draw even more visitors to our downtown. This is a really exciting opportunity.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1AcZQDV", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Mayor Phil Greiner wants Main Street to be more than just the downtown for the county seat.
