He\u2019s reportedly \u201ccome out\u201d in his interview with Sir Michael Parkinson on Channel Ten on Sunday night? Gay, you say?\n\nWell, who would have thought it?\n\nA brief comeback: Ian Thorpe during the 2012 Australian Olympic trails when he failed to make the team. Photo: Getty Images\n\nApart from just about everyone who\u2019s met and talked to our greatest Olympian, I mean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook, it\u2019s not that being cultured, sensitive, softly spoken, discerning, philosophical and cosmopolitan with a huge interest in fashion are the exclusive preserves of gay sportspeople in the oft macho and proudly hairy-chested sports world we live in. But as Thorpe, by his own admission, has long ticked all those boxes, of course there has been speculation for many a\u2019moon that he is \u201cthat way inclined,\u201d as they say in the classics.\n\nAnd you\u2019re equally right that in a perfect world no one would give a tinker\u2019s toss as to what Thorpe does in bed \u2013 and that already describes the views of a huge portion of the population \u2013 but therein lies the point. It ain\u2019t a perfect world we live in, and with homophobia still such an omnipresent force in Australian life, the fact that our most admired modern sportsperson declares himself gay, is significant, and yet one more forearm jolt to the Hydra head of the beast known as bigotry.\n\nPutting all his cards down on the table: Ian Thorpe. Photo: Supplied\n\nWhen league player Ian Roberts declared himself gay nearly 20 years ago, it instantly reduced the voltage of sting on the cruellest schoolyard epithet of the lot, \u201cyer a poofta.\u201d When the gays can claim the toughest bastard whoever pulled on a football boot as one of their own, it simultaneously makes a mockery of so many of the negative stereotypes that gay Australians had laboured under \u2013 the ones quite unlike those positive stereotypes mentioned above. Well, now the gays also have the greatest Australian Olympian of all time, and one of the most admired figures in the country, in their corner when it comes to fighting that bigotry.\n\nBeyond the impact the announcement will have on gay politics in Australia though, our chief hope has to be that it will make Thorpe himself happier. For without trying to play Sigmund Freud, too much, one can\u2019t help wonder if having to hide his sexuality and not live as the man he wants to be has had anything to do with the depression, alcohol, prescription drugs and troubles he has had in recent years. If now that he no longer has to put out denials that are straight out lies, no longer has to live a lie, he can just get on with being his happier self?\n\nAnd lie about it Thorpe has, for a long time, make no mistake.\n\nIan Thorpe's book This is Me. Photo: Supplied\n\n\"For the record,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography two years ago, \u201c I am not gay and all my sexual experiences have been straight.\u201d\n\nPorky pie? Much more than that. What you write about your life in your autobiography is a little like what you say when under oath. When you call that autobiography This is My Life it is a further affirmation that what I am telling you is the dinkum oil.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe thing that I find hurtful about \u201cspeculation that I\u2019m gay,\u201d Thorpe went on, with the ABC, \u201cis that people are questioning my integrity and what I say. That's the only part I find hurtful, that this is something I would be embarrassed about and that I would hide ... \u201d\n\nMore nonsense.\n\nNow whether Sir Michael grills Thorpe about why he felt the need to be so vociferous in his denials, instead of pursuing what Alan Jones once called his \u201cnuclear ships policy,\u201d to the same question \u2013 \u201cWe neither confirm nor deny\u201d \u2013 we will find out on Sunday night.\n\nWhat I can say is that having discussed the issue with Sir Michael over lunch in London earlier this week, the great English interviewer told me that Thorpe was \u201cfully forthcoming. I had no sense of him hiding anything.\u201d\n\nGood luck to Thorpe. And nor need he hide anything like that again. There remain plenty of gay people who don\u2019t declare their sexuality because they simply don\u2019t choose to and it is no one\u2019s damn business anyway, but the fact remains the more people like Thorpe make declarations like he has, the closer Australia nudges to the perfect world where no one gives a damn.\n\nLive and let live, Thorpie\u2019s gay, the footy\u2019s on, and pass me a beer would ya?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Swimming", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Ian Thorpe is gay, you say?
