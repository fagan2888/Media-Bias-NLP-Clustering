To further his cause, the doctor sent Ali a boxing-inspired poem that appealed to his sense of altruism. The idea worked.\n\n\"That is what Muhammad always has been about \u2014 that is why he became so great,\" says Lieberman. \"Muhammad always gave of himself.\"\n\nThe Ali Center footprint was expanded to 26,450 square feet in 2013. The center features 30 exam rooms, a balance-and-gait lab, clinical-research areas and a rehabilitation gym. A team of five neurosurgeons also offers what has been called the world's premier deep brain stimulation program.\n\n\"It's one thing to say 'Go exercise,' but people also need a comfort zone to go to a Parkinson-specific class where they feel safe,\" says Darolyn O'Donnell, recreation therapy coordinator for the center.\n\nIn the near future, the Ali Center will offer a certification course for Parkinson's caregivers. Community outreach with a bilingual approach is a major focus, including helping patients who might need financial aid.\n\n\"People think celebrities get better care, but we want the standard of care here to be the same for everybody,\" says Lonnie Ali.\n\nJon Saraceno, who first met Ali covering boxing for USA Today, is freelance journalist covering sports and pop culture.", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:caregiving#Providing Care", "Division1": "Division:caregiving#Providing Care", "page_title": "Muhammad Ali's Parkinson Center Spreads Care", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-06-25T10:30:25.220-04:00", "keywords": "caregiving, Muhammad Ali, Parkinson's disease, celebrity, advanced age, clinical-research, neurosurgeons, financial aid, patients", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Jon Saraceno", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_bulletin_today", "type": "info", "description": "Learn how the center handles about 10,000 patient visits a year.", "IALevel3": "info-2014", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Politics and Society/Newsmakers/Celebrities", "Subject2": "DCSubjects:Politics and Society/Newsmakers/Famous athletes", "Subject3": "DCSubjects:Home and Garden/Caregiving", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "DivisionCategory1": "Providing Care", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "Learn how the center handles about 10,000 patient visits a year.", "title": "Muhammad Ali's Parkinson Center Spreads Care - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/home-family/caregiving/info-2014/muhammad-ali-parkinson-center.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/etc/aarp/statics/global/img/logos/aarp_50x50.imgcache.rev1463067051643.png", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarpe/en/home/home-family/caregiving/info-2014/muhammad-ali-parkinson-center", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "aarpeContent": "true", "IALevel1": "home-family", "IALevel2": "caregiving", "s43": "3b.AARPCaregiver|MyHomeandFamily", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-24"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdcab\"", "article_summary": "Jon Saraceno, who first met Ali covering boxing for USA Today, is freelance journalist covering sports and pop culture.\nIn the near future, the Ali Center will offer a certification course for Parkinson's caregivers.\nThe Ali Center footprint was expanded to 26,450 square feet in 2013.\n\"People think celebrities get better care, but we want the standard of care here to be the same for everybody,\" says Lonnie Ali.\n\"That is what Muhammad always has been about \u2014 that is why he became so great,\" says Lieberman."}
