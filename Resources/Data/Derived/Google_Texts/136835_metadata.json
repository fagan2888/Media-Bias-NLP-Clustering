Under the banner \"Lack aid? Many counties have only pricey plans,\" USA Today repots:\n\nMore than half of the counties in 34 states using the federal health insurance exchange lack even a bronze plan that's affordable \u2014 by the government's own definition \u2014 for 40-year-old couples who make just a little too much for financial assistance, a USA TODAY analysis shows.\n\nMany of these counties are in rural, less populous areas that already had limited choice and pricey plans, but many others are heavily populated, such as Bergen County, N.J., and Philadelphia and Milwaukee counties.\n\n...\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis looked at whether premiums for the least expensive plan in any of the metal levels was more than 8% of household income. That's similar to the affordability test used by the federal government to determine whether premiums are so expensive consumers aren't required to buy plans under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n...\n\nThe number of people who earn close to the subsidy cutoff and are priced out of affordable coverage may be a small slice of the estimated 4.4 million people buying their own insurance and ineligible for subsidies. But the analysis clearly shows how the sticker shock hitting many in the middle class, including the self-employed and early retirees, isn't just a perception problem. The lack of counties with affordable plans means many middle-class people will either opt out of insurance or pay too much to buy it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Violating yet another promise, Obamacare regulations have made health insurance unaffordable for many Americans..05/26/2016 18:30:52PM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Violating yet another promise, Obamacare regulations have made health insurance unaffordable for many Americans.", "title": "- The Unaffordable Care Act: Obamacare Drives Up Premiums Nationwide", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2013/12/26/the-unaffordable-care-act-obamacare-drives-up-premiums-nationwide-n1768646", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/352/2013-12-18T142448Z_1_CBRE9BH141H00_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE-HISPANICS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Violating yet another promise, Obamacare regulations have made health insurance unaffordable for many Americans.", "title": "- The Unaffordable Care Act: Obamacare Drives Up Premiums Nationwide", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2013/12/26/the-unaffordable-care-act-obamacare-drives-up-premiums-nationwide-n1768646", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/352/2013-12-18T142448Z_1_CBRE9BH141H00_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE-HISPANICS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Unaffordable Care Act: Obamacare Drives Up Premiums Nationwide, Conn Carroll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The USA TODAY analysis looked at whether premiums for the least expensive plan in any of the metal levels was more than 8% of household income.\nThe lack of counties with affordable plans means many middle-class people will either opt out of insurance or pay too much to buy it.\nThat's similar to the affordability test used by the federal government to determine whether premiums are so expensive consumers aren't required to buy plans under the Affordable Care Act.\nMany of these counties are in rural, less populous areas that already had limited choice and pricey plans, but many others are heavily populated, such as Bergen County, N.J., and Philadelphia and Milwaukee counties.\nAnother day, another terrible headline for Obamacare."}
