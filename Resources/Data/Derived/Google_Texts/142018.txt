The Comedy Central star swears he’s in it — but he may not be easy to find

Keep an eye out for Stephen Colbert in “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug” in theaters this weekend, because he’s “kind of the breakout star.”

The “Colbert Report” host appeared on CBS’ “Late Show with David Letterman” on Monday and teased his cameo in the sequel to 2012 hit “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.”

“I don’t want to tell anybody where I am, but I’m in it … check IMDb,” Colbert said before explaining that Jackson invited him and his family to visit the New Zealand set during production.

“We’re in a scene in Laketown,” Colbert added. “I don’t want what to say what, where in the movie — it’s kind of a ‘Where’s Waldo.'”

Laketown is the human settlement which Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the band of Dwarves pass through on their way to reclaim Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch.

IMDb has Colbert listed as playing a “Laketown Spy” in film. Audiences can find out what that means, if anything, when “Desolation of Smaug” hits theaters on Friday.
