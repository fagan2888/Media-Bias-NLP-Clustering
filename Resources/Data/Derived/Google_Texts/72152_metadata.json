And no, these aren't women with a deep-seeded baby wish \u2014 they've all gotten IUDs.\n\nThe tiny intrauterine devices, which are implanted by a doctor or nurse practitioner, allow busy New Yorkers to ditch the daily ritual of taking the pill \u2014 or scramble for alternative methods when they forgot a dose.\n\n\"The pill was making sex with my husband a source of anxiety,\" one Queens-based writer who wished to remain anonymous told the Daily News. The scribe, now 36, had been on the pill for nearly a decade and \"wanted a change.\"\n\nAfter some research, she found Mirena, a popular plastic IUD, and calls it \"fantastic.\" Others have discovered ParaGard, a copper IUD that is more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy without hormones.\n\nBut why did it take so long for this renaissance of sorts?\n\nIUDs are a solid method of birth control for New York women, who may be too busy and might forget to apply patches or take pills. (Peter Foley/Bloomberg)\n\nFIRST THINGS FIRST\n\nThese long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) were christened by the American Academy of Pediatrics last month as the best birth control available for teens for their high success rates.\n\nAnd doctors are telling young women to consider LARCs because they are completely reversible and boast low failure rates \u2014 less than 1%\n\nBut the movement has been building over the last several years. \"Nationally, what we know is that IUD rates have been rising substantially,\" Dr. Laura Duberstein Lindberg, a senior research associate for the Guttmacher Institute, said, noting a 400% increase in the last decade, or from 2.4% to 8.5% in seven years, through 2009. Nearly all of those women used IUDs.\n\nBirth control pills, patches and rings, on the other hand, fail up to 9% of the time \u2014 mostly due to user error. And many of these methods carry hormonal side effects, such as weight gain and moodiness.\n\nThat was a big turnoff for 25-year-old Nichole LeFebvre. \"I had been on the pill since I was 16 or 17,\" the Park Slope resident said, and \"was sick of what hormonal pills were doing to my body.\"\n\nAfter some Internet research, LeFebvre went to her OB-GYN in 2012 to get a ParaGard \u2014 a T-shaped copper device devoid of hormones. \"I wish I had known about it in high school,\" she lamented, adding that LARCs should be part of sex education. She's already convinced several of her girlfriends to take the plunge.\n\nWomen like LeFebvre are increasingly becoming interested in these continuous-acting tools that pack few side effects (so long, mood swings!) and are effective at preventing pregnancy for up to 10 years.\n\nData for New York City women using IUDs is not available, though city officials sang the praises of long-term birth control at a press conference last summer, showing a promising change in the tides of effective birth control measures.\n\nDoctors are noticing the shift, too.\n\n\"I definitely have more patients asking for them in my practice,\" Dr. Laura MacIsaac, the director of Family Planning for the Mount Sinai Health System, told The News. \"I think we'll see more and more, but I've already seen them go up a lot.\"\n\nMacIsaac, who only sees teenagers at her practice, says that her patients \"are now hearing about these methods,\" either through more visible marketing campaigns or through word of mouth.\n\n\"They are being marketed and as more teens are getting them, our patients are hearing about them from their peers,\" MacIsaac said.\n\nDr. Natasha Withers, a doctor of osteopathy with One Medical Group, agrees. \"There's just a lot more awareness,\" she said. \"I think the trust factor is big because people are nervous about the IUD procedure.\"\n\nCHANGE IN THE TIDE Would you consider getting an IUD? Yes - sign me up! Yes - but I have my doubts Maybe - not sure No - I'm happy with my current method No - It's not for me\n\nWHAT IS THE WHAT\n\nThere are three different types of LARC IUDs. They all work differently from hormonal birth control pills, patches and rings, which all function the same way by using hormones to stop ovulation.\n\nIUDs, on the other hand, are inserted into a woman's uterus and block sperm from swimming to a regularly released egg, either by hormones or copper ions. Mirena, Skyla and ParaGard are the three that are FDA-approved in the U.S.\n\nMirena lasts for five years, while Skyla \u2014 made by the same parent company, Bayer \u2014 lasts for three. Both are hormonal IUDs, meaning they release small amounts of progestin locally (just inside the uterus) to ward off sperm. Because hormones are not being pumped throughout the entire body, mental health side effects associated with the pill, patch or ring, such as depression and anxiety, are rare.\n\nBecause of the localized hormones, many women with this device find they no longer have periods. It's also FDA-approved to treat heavy periods and reduces bleeding by up to 90% over the course of six months.\n\nParaGard works in a similar way to ward off sperm, but it uses copper ions, not hormones. It's good for up to 10 years, but can cause heavier periods.\n\nIt is important to note that none of these IUDs protect against HIV or STDs.\n\nBecause they all work so similarly and have the same efficacy, choosing one that's best for you really depends on if you want your menstrual cycle to change.\n\nGetting an IUD without insurance can cost between $500 to more than $1,000, though for those with private insurance, the Affordable Care Act has made this method much more low cost or even free, making it a cost-effective birth control method.\n\nDoctors have reported an increase in use in IUDs. (javi_indy/Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nRUMOR HAS IT\n\nDespite its effectiveness, there is a lot of misplaced fear around IUDs.\n\nThis fear reached a peak in the 1970s when the Dalkon Shield, a popular IUD brand, was linked to serious infections and 15 deaths. It was pulled from the market in 1974.\n\n\"These aren't your mother's IUDs,\" Lindberg said.\n\n\"The method itself has changed and we've gotten farther away from the health concerns that aren't reflected in the new generation of devices,\" a movement that has come about from better research and study.\n\nAnother fear? That the insertion process, in which the cervix is dilated, will be uncomfortable or even extremely painful. This, for some women, is true.\n\n\"The actual insertion was the most painful thing I've ever experienced,\" said another anonymous New Yorker, a 29-year-old grad student from Inwood. \"They brought (my boyfriend) in from the waiting room because I was crying so much.\"\n\nThese aren't your mother's IUDs. The method itself has changed and we've gotten farther away from the health concerns that aren't reflected in the new generation of devices.\n\nLeFebvre agreed, saying the first few months after she got her IUD were \"pretty brutal,\" as she was plagued by cramps and heavy periods.\n\nStill, both women said that once their symptoms subsided, their new method of birth control was well worth the pain.\n\n\"The Mirena is fantastic,\" the Queens woman told The News. \"But I can't recommend it without telling people how awful the insertion is.\"\n\nSide effects \u2014such as heavy bleeding in the first few months and cramping \u2014 are mild in most women. Much rarer are serious side effects, such as a perforated uterine wall, though Mirena has had several lawsuits brought to it with that concern.\n\nBut the benefits \u2014 lighter periods, less cramping and foolproof contraception \u2014 seem to have more women running to their gynecologists.\n\n\"The years of freedom from worrying have been amazing,\" the Inwood grad student said.\n\nCHANGE IN THE TIDE\n\nAs paradigms shift and more information is made readily available, more women across the city and the country are taking the leap, finding that the IUD fits in with New York women's frenetic lifestyles.\n\n\"The great part of the IUD is you don't have to remember to do anything,\" Withers said. \"For busy New Yorkers, it's often difficult to remember taking a pill at a certain time.\"\n\nLindberg agrees. \"It's not just women's attitudes that have changed, it's the shifting biases of physicians.\n\n\"That has opened up the floodgate of this method.\"\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
