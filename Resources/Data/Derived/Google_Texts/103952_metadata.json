Since the grants are performance-based, they must be repaid if benchmarks such as new investment or job creation are not met, and of the 22 localities that defaulted, 15 still owe money.\n\n\u201cI do not have or maintain a list,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said in an email. \u201cWe work these one at a time as they mature.\u201d\n\nSome of the poorest counties in Virginia owe the most. The city of Danville owes the commission $3.4 million, and the Lee County Industrial Development Authority (IDA) owes $600,000.\n\nLee County defaulted on two different grants, and the county\u2019s IDA director acknowledged the probability of collecting a full reimbursement is quite low.\n\n\u201cThe contracts are three-party contracts,\u201d IDA Director Michael James said. \u201cThe commission administers the grant to us, and we then administer the grant\u201d to private companies that come to town with promises of jobs.\n\nIn the event of default, he said, the process works in reverse: The company owes the IDA and, in turn, the IDA owes the commission.\n\n\u201cWe owe the commission regardless of whether we collect from the company,\u201d James said.\n\nOthers owing money include Charlotte County, the town of Marion, Lunenburg County, the Patrick County Economic Development Authority, the Tazewell County IDA and the Washington County IDA. Each has received a notice of default and a demand for refund, or is subjected to a repayment agreement.\n\nVirginia was given some $4.1 billion in reparations after 46 state attorneys general sued large tobacco companies in 1998. The tobacco commission received half that amount, and so far has awarded 1,807 grants totaling more than $1 billion, according to its website.\n\nThe commission, as of August, had nearly $564 million in cash and investments.\n\nTo keep track of created jobs, the commission relies on Virginia Employment Commission data to verify companies are keeping their promises and creating jobs, according to Tim Pfohl, the commission\u2019s interim executive director.\n\n\u201cThat provides us an independently verified source that\u2019s also used by the state for calculating business and income taxes,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nIf a county defaults on a loan, the tobacco commission freezes any money going into that county. Mr. Stephenson said some localities have paid their debt while others are negotiating repayment plans or have executed a repayment plan.\n\nThe Virginia Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission, a 31-member body, was created in 1999 by the General Assembly to use the proceeds of the 1998 national tobacco settlement in the \u201cpromotion of economic growth and development in tobacco-dependent communities.\u201d\n\nIn 2011 the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) published a report recommending tighter accountability by the commission.\n\nThe commission\u2019s \u201cprocess for evaluating funding requests does not effectively screen out weak proposals,\u201d the report states.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than $5.2 million in \"tobacco\" grants to Virginia communities has disappeared, leaving some of the state's most depressed areas deeper in the red.", "Author": "Kaitlyn Speer \u2014 Watchdog.org, Virginia Bureau", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "More than $5.2 million in \u201ctobacco\u201d grants to Virginia communities has disappeared, leaving some of the state\u2019s most depressed areas deeper in the red.", "title": "Virginia tobacco grants go up in smoke", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/26/virginia-tobacco-grants-go-up-in-smoke/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/16/60027ad27a8dd8245f0f6a7067005b5d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/16/60027ad27a8dd8245f0f6a7067005b5d.jpg", "title": "Virginia tobacco grants go up in smoke", "description": "More than $5.2 million in \"tobacco\" grants to Virginia communities has disappeared, leaving some of the state's most depressed areas deeper in the red.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Community Revitalization Commission, Ned Stephenson, Indemnification And Community Revitalization Commission, Lee County Industrial Development Authority"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d9e\"", "article_summary": "More than $5.2 million in \u201ctobacco\u201d grants to Virginia communities has disappeared, leaving some of the state\u2019s most depressed areas deeper in the red.\n\u201cWe work these one at a time as they mature.\u201dSome of the poorest counties in Virginia owe the most.\nThe tobacco commission received half that amount, and so far has awarded 1,807 grants totaling more than $1 billion, according to its website.\nOthers owing money include Charlotte County, the town of Marion, Lunenburg County, the Patrick County Economic Development Authority, the Tazewell County IDA and the Washington County IDA.\nFrom July 2007 until October 2014, 22 localities defaulted on Tobacco Region Opportunity Fund (TROF) grants or owe the Virginia Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission money, said Ned Stephenson, the commission\u2019s deputy director."}
