There is one reason only: it was graced by the disconcertingly skeletal presence of the Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie.\n\n\n\nThe only reason this particular anti-rape conference hit the front pages is that it was graced by the disconcertingly skeletal presence of the Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie\n\nMs Jolie \u2014 who if she were dressed in rags and pictured on the mud tracks of a Third World village would herself not look out of place on an Oxfam poster \u2014 is a UN special envoy. That global body has long recognised the value of recruiting showbusiness to its causes. It knows politicians find it impossible to resist the magnetism of silver-screen celebrity, and the stardust it sprinkles on their activities.\n\n\n\nThus both the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary posed with \u2018Dame\u2019 Angelina in Downing Street: David Cameron pledged to \u2018protect victims and punish perpetrators of rape\u2019 in countries such as Somalia and the Congo, while William Hague declared that rape as a weapon in war was the \u2018moral issue for our generation.\u2019\n\n\n\nI wonder if those two highly intelligent men really believe that this country has any power to deter African soldiers from raping and pillaging in what are often unspeakably savage civil wars.\n\n\n\nBoth the Prime Minister David Cameron and his Foreign Secretary William Hague posed with 'Dame' Jolie\n\nCameron told the conference that \u2018this Government will always seek to protect the most vulnerable in society, both at home and abroad\u2019. Perhaps I underestimate the might of our Department for International Development, but is it really up to the task of preventing even one vulnerable woman in Somalia from being raped?\n\n\n\nIt would be more realistic and useful if our most senior politicians put as much emphasis on the problem of sexual violence within our own society \u2014 and if our courts did more to protect those victims.\n\n\n\nWhat criminologists term \u2018domestic violence\u2019 remains the single biggest category of offence in Britain \u2014 consuming almost 10 per cent of the caseload of the Department of Public Prosecution.\n\n\n\nThis certainly underestimates its extent, given the reluctance of so many women, often for reasons of sheer terror and intimidation, either to report their assailants to the police or to give evidence in court.\n\n\n\nAs the DPP noted in its most recent report: \u20186,741 domestic violence cases failed in 2012-13 because the victim either failed to attend court or retracted their evidence; that equated to approximately 37 per cent of all unsuccessful domestic violence cases.\u2019\n\n\n\nA friend of mine, who worked in one of Birmingham\u2019s biggest hospitals, told me he had been \u2018absolutely horrified by the scale and extent of domestic violence, yet so much of it never reaches the public\u2019s attention, or the courts: in one case, I saw a woman whose jaw was broken by a man who had murdered his previous girlfriend and who had been released only the year before. She was too scared to report the incident to the police, as hard as we tried to persuade her\u2019.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s right: someone who murdered one woman was out and about, brutalising others with near impunity.\n\nWe may have a better record of locking up the perpetrators of violence against women than the countries of which David Cameron and Ms Jolie are so critical \u2014 but we also have a remarkable ability to let them out again.\n\n\n\nOnly last week the Mail reported on a case in which a London mother-of-three called Jageer Mirgind was left blind and hideously scarred for life after her father-in-law, Manjit Singh Mirgind, slashed her wrists and gouged her eyes with a knife.\n\n\n\nManjit Singh Mirgind, left, attacked his daughter-in-law Jageer Mirgind after he accused her of having an affair, slashing her wrists and gouging her eyes with a knife in front of her children\n\n\n\nApparently, Mr Mirgind, a Sikh, was under the impression that his daughter-in-law had been having an affair with a Muslim man. In fact \u2014 and not that it makes any difference to the wickedness of the attack \u2014 the woman hadn\u2019t been conducting an affair: Mr Mirgind had fallen for what was described as \u2018a series of prank calls\u2019. He told the court: \u2018I was trying to protect her. I am a peaceful man.\u2019 How very reassuring.\n\n\n\nAnyway, what sentence do you think the perpetrator of this horrific attack received? Ten years \u2014 which under our system of automatic release after half the term is served, means he will be out in five.\n\n\n\nEven more appallingly, according to the report in the Mail, he had initially been charged with attempted murder, but prosecutors later accepted his guilty plea to causing serious bodily harm with intent \u2018in order to avoid having to go to trial\u2019.\n\n\n\nYet Mr Mirgind \u2014 as the court was also told by one of the victim\u2019s terrified children, who were present throughout the appalling assault \u2014 had shouted out: \u2018I am going to kill you.\u2019 It is disgraceful that such a man should be allowed to plea-bargain his way out of an attempted murder charge.\n\n\n\nThis case has echoes of a no less barbaric assault three years ago, in which Tina Nash, a 33-year-old mother-of-two from Plymouth, was subjected to an attack lasting 12 hours by her partner, Shane Jenkin.\n\n\n\nAfter breaking her jaw and nose, he gouged out her eyes, declaring: \u2018You\u2019re never going to see your kids again.\u2019 Jenkin was sent to a secure mental health unit and ordered to serve \u2014 wait for it \u2014 \u2018at least six years\u2019.\n\n\n\nWhat would we think of a country in the developing world where a man convicted of torturing and blinding his girlfriend had been given the chance of serving only six years? Would our Foreign Secretary make a fuss?\n\n\n\nOddly enough, the British Foreign Office did protest in 2011, expressing \u2018deep concern\u2019, when Iranian courts decreed that a man who had blinded with acid a woman who spurned his advances should \u2014 if the victim demanded it \u2014 be blinded himself.\n\n\n\nEventually the woman concerned was persuaded not to exercise her right \u2014 but I am unconvinced that \u2018an eye for an eye\u2019 is a more inappropriate remedy than six years imprisonment for such extreme sexually motivated violence.\n\n\n\nAnd I am even less convinced that our politicians are in a position to lecture other countries about the judicial protection of women. We should do more to look after our own \u2014 even without photogenic assistance from Hollywood.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes China want to buy the Queen?\n\nChinese PM Li Keqiang has threatened to cancel his trip to Britain this week unless he gets an audience with the Queen\n\nAccording to an investigation in the Mail, property developments in the English Home Counties are being bought up by the Chinese middle classes.\n\n\n\nWhile it might be a concern to families who will see this as another obstacle to acquiring homes at affordable prices, it is not just property China is buying up in the UK, as two stories last week illustrated.\n\n\n\nIt was revealed that a professorship in \u2018Chinese Development Studies\u2019 at Cambridge University had been set up with \u00a33.7 million in funding from members of the family of China\u2019s former Prime Minister, Wen Jiabao.\n\n\n\nCambridge insisted it was not selling out to the totalitarian government of the People\u2019s Republic \u2014 but a number of its academics expressed concern that the University refuses even to discuss the donors\u2019 links to the Beijing political establishment.\n\n\n\nAnd we also learned that the current Chinese PM, Li Keqiang, had threatened to cancel his trip to Britain this week unless he got an audience with the Queen (even though it is not a state visit).\n\n\n\nAsked about this, a British Government official admitted: \u2018The Chinese are hard negotiators.\u2019\n\n\n\nPerhaps the Chinese want the monarch to apologise in person on behalf of her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, for the opium wars. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll let us know if she does.\n\nLast Wednesday the BBC screened Faster Than The Speed of Light?, a documentary which \u2018explores the recent discovery of particles that appear to travel faster than the speed of light\u2019.\n\n\n\nWhich particles would those be?\n\n\n\nAccording to the film, these were neutrinos detected by the CERN laboratory, near Geneva, zooming faster than the 186,000 miles per second hitherto considered the universe\u2019s speed limit.\n\n\n\nAmazing: Einstein\u2019s theory refuted. Only it hadn\u2019t been.\n\n\n\nA few months after the CERN team declared it had found particles which had got to their destination before they departed, it was revealed that a loose fibre-optic cable had introduced a delay in their timing system.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "divclassbody": "dominiclawsonforthedailymail", "news_keywords": "DOMINIC,LAWSON,Angelina,Mr,Hague,women,victims,betrayed,courts", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2658687/DOMINIC-LAWSON-Angelina-Mr-Hague-women-victims-betrayed-courts.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "What elevated this particular anti-rape conference to the front pages?
