At 27 percent, Republicans are only slightly more trusting than they were during their all-time low in 2012. Independents, however, reported a higher rate of trust than last year, but only by one percentage point.\n\nGallup notes that one of the reasons for this lack of trust may reflect Americans\u2019 feelings regarding political bias \u2013 44 percent of Americans believe the media is \u201ctoo liberal,\u201d while 34 percent believe it is \u201cjust about right.\u201d Only 19 percent believe it is \u201ctoo conservative,\u201d although this number did climb six percentage points since last year.\n\nGeoffrey Lysaught, publisher of The Daily Signal, is not surprised by the results of the poll:\n\n\u201cAmericans are right to be skeptical. News organizations can play a critical role in the advancement of a free and prosperous society. But this requires that news media remain committed to a dogged pursuit of the truth no matter where it leads. When news organizations present spin as news or fail to cover important stories due to intimidation by political and corporate interests, the American people lose.\u201d\n\nThe survey was conducted via telephone interviews of a random sample of 1,017 voting-age adults from all 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most Americans don\u2019t trust the media, according to a recent Gallup poll.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Most Americans don\u2019t trust the media, according to a recent Gallup poll.", "title": "Americans\u2019 Trust in Media at All-Time Low", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140917_MediaTrust-FEATUREDIMAGE.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1yio9FB"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Most Americans don\u2019t trust the media, according to a recent Gallup poll.", "title": "Americans\u2019 Trust in Media at All-Time Low", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140917_MediaTrust-FEATUREDIMAGE.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2014-09-18T10:15:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Gallup, poll, trust, mass media"}, "article_summary": "Most Americans don\u2019t trust the media, according to a recent Gallup poll.\nAmong Democrats \u2013 who according to Gallup are most likely to report a higher level of trust in the media \u2013 trust has fallen to 54 percent, their lowest rate in 14 years.\nWhen asked how much confidence they had in the mass media to \u201creport the news fully, accurately, and fairly,\u201d only 40 percent of Americans responded \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount.\u201dAmericans\u2019 trust in mass media has only ever been this low once before in 2012.\nAt 27 percent, Republicans are only slightly more trusting than they were during their all-time low in 2012.\nIndependents, however, reported a higher rate of trust than last year, but only by one percentage point."}
