President Obama had dinner with actors Morgan Freeman and Tom Hanks Wednesday night in Washington, his second night out with movie stars in a week.

Mr. Freeman was seen leaving the restaurant BLT near the White House around the same time Mr. Obama departed the establishment. Mr. Hanks also was spotted.

Last weekend in Los Angeles, Mr. Obama ate dinner with actor Will Smith and DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg.

Mr. Freeman said in 2011 that he thought Mr. Obama made racism worse in the U.S. due to negative reactions to him by the GOP. The actor donated $1 million to Mr. Obamaâ€™s super PAC in 2012.
