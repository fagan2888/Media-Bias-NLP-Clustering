Roosevelt bats quiet in disappointing tournament

Anymore, Madi Herbert steps into the box feeling strong.

The Berthoud junior eyes balls all the way through the zone, right into the catcher's mitt. Softballs now look like beach balls, and those that find the strike zone?

Well those are now gone balls.

"All I see are my kind of pitches, which are pretty much right down the middle and ones that I can actually load on and just get my timing right with the pitcher," she said. "That's why I'm having a great tournament, just having confidence from my last four home runs."

Herbert's swatted four homers in the past two days, the latest helping power the Spartans past Greeley West 7-4 in the championship game of the Spartan Classic at Barnes Softball Complex.

"I'm being confident about my hits and how good of a player I can be. And I'm having a lot of confidence in actually watching the ball," Herbert said of her recent power surge. "Just coming out here and getting the win is great for us because the past two weeks we haven't been doing that well. We came out here, our tournament, trusting each other."

That trust went a long way in beating Sterling 7-0 in Berthoud's first game Saturday, which sent them to the title game in the Maroon Division, the highest at the tournament.

But Herbert wasn't the only one swinging a big bat to help claim the crown. The Spartans did so in classic fashion - by beating the cover off the ball.

Junior Taylor Armitage cranked a triple in the first inning before taking one yard herself for a two-run blast in the fifth inning to give Berthoud the commanding 7-4 lead. She finished the day 2-for-2 and a team-best three RBI. Senior Jessi Boruff also drove home two for the Spartans in the explosive five-run third inning.

"We came in knowing that we had a little bit of work to do, we had to get some wins under our belt, get our confidence going," BHS coach Ashtin Williamson said. "Madi's just on fire. She's on a hot streak right now and coming up big; just that simple."

While Berthoud used the Spartan Classic to regain some of their swagger, Roosevelt finds itself smack dab in the middle of an offensive rut.

The Rough Riders entered the tournament hoping to go 3-1, but came out 1-3. Roosevelt scored just three runs outside of a big 11-0 win over Widefield on Friday.

It looked as though the Riders were poised to pick up a low-scoring victory over Weld Central in the third-place contest of the Platinum Division, yet fate was against them.

The Rebels scored a single run in the fifth, sixth and finally seventh innings, all with two outs, to walk off RHS 3-2.

"It's tough, but the toughest part is we're not giving ourselves very much wiggle room. We have a lead, but it's not a very big lead, so we have to play pretty close to perfect," RHS coach Alan Gibson said. "When that doesn't happen, then that's when things kind of fall apart."

The Riders received a good performance in the circle from senior Makayla Deeter, who pitched all 6 innings and gave up only two earned runs. Senior second baseman Ahley Ortiz went 2-for-3 with an RBI.
