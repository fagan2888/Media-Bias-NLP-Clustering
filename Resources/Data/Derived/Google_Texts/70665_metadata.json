Paul LePage, Rep. Steve Stanley said he believes the Maine governor supports the state in starting its first cold-case squad to solve unsolved murders like the homicide of Joyce McLain 33 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe meeting went very well,\u201d Stanley, D-Medway, said of his encounter during LePage\u2019s Saturday morning constituent hours at the governor\u2019s office. \u201cThe governor is supportive of \u2018Joyce\u2019s Law\u2019 and the cold case thing.\n\n\u201cHe did say, though, that the financial side of it is the problem, funding it,\u201d Stanley added. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to go from there to see what we can do.\u201d\n\nLePage\u2019s spokeswoman, Adrienne Bennett, did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.\n\nState police and Deputy Attorney General William Stokes have said many times that investigators have worked hard and developed a list of suspects who might have been involved with the death of 16-year-old Joyce McLain, whose body was found near Schenck High School\u2019s soccer fields on Aug. 10, 1980, but that they have taken the case as far as they can. McLain was last seen jogging near her home a few blocks from the school on the night of Aug. 8.\n\nThe victim\u2019s mother, Pamela McLain, questions whether the case has been pursued vigorously enough. At her request, Stanley has submitted to the Legislature proposals to form a cold-case squad to investigate homicides and \u201cJoyce\u2019s Law,\u201d which would compel state police to allow outside agencies to review unsolved homicides more than five years old. McLain also challenges Stokes\u2019 decision denying the reality TV show \u201cCold Justice\u201d a review of the case.\n\nA legislative committee rejected reviewing the bills during the upcoming January session. Stanley will appeal the decision to cut the cold case bill later this month and will re-submit the bills in the following session, he said.\n\nStokes has said he supports the cold-case squad proposal but believes Joyce\u2019s Law would be impractical, violate state law governing investigative confidentiality, and could severely impair police abilities to investigate cases. That reasoning forced his rejection of \u201cCold Justice,\u201d he said.\n\nStanley and Patrick Day, a volunteer assisting McLain in her quest for justice for her daughter, requested the meeting with LePage to see what help he might provide. LePage collected paperwork from Day and promised to review it, Stanley said.\n\n\u201cHe said he would do anything he could to help,\u201d Stanley said of LePage.\n\nCheck back for updates at bangordailynews.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 After a brief meeting with Gov.
