The two firms merged in June and have been working to determine who would lead various practice areas. As previously reported, Sens. John Breaux and Trent Lott will jointly head up the overall public policy practice with Jeff Turner serving as managing partner. Under them, the firm announced a number of other leadership positions \u2014 lawyers who will manage teams built around defense, energy, financial services and tax, food and drug, health care, technology and transportation.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014Turner will head Squire Patton\u2019s technology practice in addition to his overall responsibilities managing the day-to-day operations of the firm.\n\n\u2014Squire lobbyist Al Cardenas will be deputy leader of the public policy practice and will lead the firm\u2019s Florida and Latin America practices.\n\n\u2014Former Patton Deputy Chairman Kevin O'Neill has a new role as deputy global managing partner for public policy, investigatory and regulatory solution \u2014 with a portfolio focused around global legal needs.\n\n\u2014 Victoria Cram and Carolina Mederos will head up the transportation, infrastructure and local governments practice. Both were with Patton Boggs prior to the merger. \u2014Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater and Brian Starer will lead the transportation shipping and global logistics group. Slater came from the Patton side of the merger, while Starer was at Squire.\n\n\u2014Partner Micah Green \u2014 who formerly served as president and co-CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association \u2014 will lead the financial services and tax practice. He was previously with Patton.\n\n\u2014Former White House official and firm partner Robert Kapla will serve as the firm\u2019s international policy practice leader, working with foreign governments. He was with Patton Boggs prior to the merger.\n\n\u2014Former Pentagon official and Patton attorney Jack Deschauer will serve as the leader of the Squire Patton defense practice.\n\n\u2014 Josh Greene will manage the energy & natural resources public policy practice at Squire Patton Boggs. He came from the Patton Boggs side of the merger.\n\n\u2014 Eugenia Pierson will lead the firm\u2019s health policy work as head of the health care practice. She takes over amid turmoil in that department, following the en masse departure of former Patton lobbyist John Jonas and his health care practice group to rival Akin Gump.\n\n\u2014Finally, veteran attorney Stuart Pape will lead the food and drug practice, working to help clients with issues related to the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe new leadership structure puts former Patton Boggs attorneys firmly in charge of the lobbying and public policy operations of the newly combined firm. Cardenas and Starer are the only Squire Sanders team leaders managing practice areas on the public policy side. On the other hand, Squire\u2019s lobbying operation was small prior to the merger, and Patton Boggs has long been the top dog on K Street.\n\nGOOD MONDAY AFTERNOON and welcome back to your regularly scheduled programming.

That brings the firm\u2019s total to nearly 40 lawyers in Tokyo and over 140 lawyers in the Asia Pacific region.\n\n\u2014Global law firm Hogan Lovells is bringing on 70 attorneys in a merger with Mexican law firm Barrera, Siqueiros y Torres Landa. BSTL has offices in Mexico City and Monterrey. The combination will be effective in August of 2014. In Mexico, Hogan Lovells brand itself as Hogan Lovells BSTL.\n\nCHAMBER HILL INKS TWO: The American Academy of Family Physicians and the National Partnership for Women & Families have signed with Chamber Hill Strategies. The family physicians group, representing more than 115,000 physicians and medical students, is seeking work on issues related to graduate medical education. Chamber Hill partner Jennifer Bell said the new work shows that physicians are expanding their focus beyond the reforming the sustainable growth rate, though that\u2019s still important to them. This is the group\u2019s third active lobbying registration, according to Senate records. In the first quarter, it spent $50,000 with Polsinelli and nearly $630,000 in-house. The National Partnership of Women & Families is making its first hire since 2009, when it sought work on the Affordable Care Act. The group is now working on issues related to paid family and medical leave, hoping to advance the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, Bell said. The group hasn\u2019t had help from an outside firm since 2010 and has posted no in-house lobbying activity since then, according to Senate records.\n\nAT&T'S LOBBYING AGAINST MUNICIPAL BROADBAND: AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson wasn't sure last month if his company had ever lobbied against cities or states working to set up their own broadband networks \u2014 but as POLITICO\u2019s Tony Romm and Alex Byers write this morning, it's clear his company and fellow telecoms, like Comcast and Time Warner Cable, have spent heavily against such efforts. \"On their own, or as part of groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council, the companies have deployed their vast lobbying resources from the Carolinas to California, hoping to ensure that private networks don\u2019t have to compete with government-facilitated alternatives,\" they write. The projects, which allow regions to put up the cost of building out networks for cable and Internet services, aren't universally opposed by telecom incumbents, but Romm and Byers take a look at the specifics in South Carolina, Indiana, California and elsewhere. All that spending, too, comes as the telecoms are pushing for a new round of media consolidation that could heighten their influence and reach.

The cards, which supporters of the bank plan to give to every member of Congress in coming weeks, are part of a lobbying push by corporations such as Boeing Co. and General Electric Co., and business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers. Their goal is to combat the most serious threat yet to the survival of the agency, which is under assault by new House leadership and conservative groups that say it amounts to corporate welfare.\" http://on.wsj.com/VSd7pv\n\nSPEIER TARGETS LOBBYIST RELATIVES: Kent Cooper reports: \u201cA bill recently introduced in Congress would require lobbyists to identify relatives who are senior government officials, and prohibit candidates and their committees from employing relatives. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., recently introduced H.R. 5011, that seeks to curtail the benefits involved with candidates who hire relatives and lobbyists who have lobbying contacts with their relatives who are government officials.\u201d http://bit.ly/1n0ArGW\n\nNEW JOINT FUNDRAISING COMMITTEES (Members of the JFC):\n\nArkansas Victory Fund 2014 (Cotton for Senate, Republican Party of Arkansas)\n\nCalifornia Majority Fund (California Republican Party, NRCC)\n\nCantwell Wyden Victory Fund (Friends of Maria, Wyden for Senate)\n\nNEW PAC REGISTRATIONS:\n\nAlabama Liberty Fund (super PAC)\n\nConcrete Reinforcing Steel Institute PAC (PAC)\n\nNEW LOBBYING REGISTRATIONS: (Firm: Client)\n\nNone\n\nNEW LOBBYING TERMINATIONS (Firm: Client (Type of Termination))\n\nCrowell & Moring: City of Cleveland (Q2 Termination)\n\nCrowell & Moring: Lancaster General Hospital (Q2 Termination)\n\nElinor Schwartaz: Lobel Novins and Lamont for California State Lands Commission\n\n(Q2 Termination)\n\nGovBiz Advantage: Livingston Group (for Anglo America) (Q2 Termination)\n\nMoffett Group: Vornado/Charles E.
