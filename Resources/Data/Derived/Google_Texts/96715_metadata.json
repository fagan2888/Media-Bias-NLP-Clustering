In other cases he submitted a false letter of credit for nominal buyers. In each loan, Alam and the co-conspirators falsely represented that the homes would be a primary residence. In truth, they did not intend to live in the homes.\n\nLoss totaled more than $485,000.\n\nAt the time of the crime, Alam was on federal probation for a similar offense and his realtor license had been suspended. In addition to his prison sentence, Alam was also ordered to pay more than $250,000 in restitution.\n\nCo-defendants included:\n\nChristopher Ginyard, 28, Wichita, who was sentenced to two years supervised release and $40,000 restitution.\n\nHenry Pearson, Jr., 29, Wichita, who was sentenced to two years supervised release and $56,000 restitution.\n\nHenry Pearson, Sr., Wichita, who was sentenced to two years supervised release and $55,180 restitution.\n\nBruce Dykes, 46, Wichita, who was sentenced to two years supervised release and $14,872 restitution.\n\nJanice Young, 27, Wichita, who was sentenced to five years supervised release and $60,332 restitution.\n\nSteven Pelz, 40, Wichita, was sentenced to two years federal probation and $31,924 restitution.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Manjur Alam, 47, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-man-sentenced-for-mortgage-fraud-270801661.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/MORTGAGE-FRAUD2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Manjur Alam, 47, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.", "title": "Wichita man sentenced for mortgage fraud"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Manjur Alam, 47, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-man-sentenced-for-mortgage-fraud-270801661.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/MORTGAGE-FRAUD2.jpg", "title": "Wichita man sentenced for mortgage fraud", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Wichita man sentenced for mortgage fraud", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Wichita man sentenced for mortgage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11b2\"", "article_summary": "A Wichita man was sentenced Monday to six years in federal prison for mortgage fraud.\nSteven Pelz, 40, Wichita, was sentenced to two years federal probation and $31,924 restitution.\nJanice Young, 27, Wichita, who was sentenced to five years supervised release and $60,332 restitution.\nCo-defendants included:Christopher Ginyard, 28, Wichita, who was sentenced to two years supervised release and $40,000 restitution.\nHenry Pearson, Jr., 29, Wichita, who was sentenced to two years supervised release and $56,000 restitution."}
