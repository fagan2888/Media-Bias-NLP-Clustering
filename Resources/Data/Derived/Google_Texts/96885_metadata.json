I have been on radio nearly 30 years now. I\u2019ve been following this for most of my adult life,\u201d Hannity told TheBlaze.\n\n\u201cIt always gets this way in South Carolina. Go back to 2000, George Bush-John McCain, just read the paper,\u201d the conservative commentator continued. \u201cThe history is pretty vicious. I would like to see it calm down because ultimately for the Republican nominee, there will have to be uniting if they want to defeat the Democrats. A house divided is going to fall. They have to rally behind the winner.\u201d\n\nHannity was in Greenville for the Conservative Convention ahead of Saturday\u2019s Republican primary in the state.\n\nHannity stressed that he isn\u2019t endorsing any candidate but leans toward outsiders that the establishment doesn\u2019t like, and left it at that. For this campaign cycle, that has clearly been real estate billionaire Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nTheBlaze asked him about Trump\u2019s past positions on abortion, guns and taxes that have changed since becoming a presidential contender.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting into individual campaigns, but I will say this: On the issue of Trump, you either believe he is where he is now or you take his old positions, but I have not endorsed a candidate,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cI want a conservative with a vision that will get Americans back to work, a balanced budget, our borders secure, ISIS dealt with and a strong national security presence. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d\n\nHannity insisted that too many Republicans have fallen short on their promise, one reason for the rise of anti-establishment candidates.\n\nTheBlaze also asked Hannity if he had any confidence that the GOP-controlled Senate would stand firm against Obama\u2019s nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m beginning to see wobbly, the same guys that capitulated on Obamacare, they all promised to repeal and replace Obamacare. They didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Hannity replied. \u201cThey could have used the power of the purse. The same guys who in 2014 promised they were going to stop executive amnesty are the same guys now promising that they will hold the line and let the people decide who will pick the next justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo far, I\u2019m beginning to see some wobbly knees like we\u2019ve seen in the past, which is why this is an insurgency year,\u201d Hannity explained. \u201cThis is why conservatives, if you look at the polls, 60 percent feel betrayed, and I think for good reason. When a politician makes a promise and they don\u2019t follow through and they don\u2019t fight for the things they believe in that angers the people that put them in office. They have the right to be angry.\u201d\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), a Cruz supporter speaking at the same event, agreed with Hannity that it\u2019s possible the Republican nominee could be wounded.\n\n\u201cI think it could very well hurt the eventual nominee,\u201d Gohmert told TheBlaze. \u201cIf Ted ends up as the nominee like we hope, then I could see Democrats taking everything that Trump says and running in commercials over and over again. One of the worst things we can do to other Republicans is give the Democrats ammunition, especially like in this case where it\u2019s simply not true, but use those commercials to beat up other Republicans.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "GREENVILLE, S.C. \u2014 A vicious tone in South Carolina is nothing new, but TV and radio host Sean Hannity said he did have concerns the effect it might have on the eventual nominee.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t my first rodeo.
