As anyone who has tackled the application for federal student aid for higher education will tell you, the form is a 108-question beast, requiring hours of work and voluminous information.

But can it be trimmed radically, perhaps even to just a couple of questions?

U.S. Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Michael Bennet, D-Colo., believe it can, and are poised to introduce legislation to that end.

Their proposal would have the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as FAFSA, boiled down to these two essential questions:

What is your family size and what was your household income two years ago?

The senators have persuasive research that says all of the additional questions on the current form might add up to a $54 difference in a student’s Pell Grant award. If that’s the case, it doesn’t seem worth it to put students through all of that rigmarole. And that’s particularly important when considering that the complexity of the process discourages many students from getting the aid they are eligible to receive.

In addition, the cost of verifying the information submitted on forms is a significant burden for colleges. A study involving 13 California community colleges found the schools spent $2 million in one year double-checking information on the forms. That money could be better allocated to financial aid or other needs.

While we like the idea of dramatically simplifying FAFSA, we do wonder whether there should be an option for students in special circumstances to fill out a separate schedule or a longer form.

For instance, parents who have two children attending college at the same time face a significantly more challenging financial situation than those with just one.

But the senators are apparently amenable to considering modifications to their proposal in an effort to ensure the form fits its mission — to ensure needy students have access to financial aid without asking for a mountain of unneeded information.
