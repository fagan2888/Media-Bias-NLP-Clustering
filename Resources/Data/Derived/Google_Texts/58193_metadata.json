But taking into account robust economic growth, there was no need to change rates, he said.\n\nKropiwnicki did not comment on the central bank's outlook for Poland's gross domestic product. He said in his personal view GDP growth would be maintained at 3.8-4.0 percent this year.\n\nPolish economic growth has hovered around 3.4-3.6 percent for the last two years.\n\nKropiwnicki reiterated that he saw no need to change rates, which have been at a record-low of 1.5 percent since March 2015. \"I don't see reasons that could change monetary policy prospects in the medium term.\"\n\nAsked if he would support a 50-basis points rate reduction if the zloty were to strengthen in response to future actions by the European Central Bank and if Poland's growth slowed down, Kropiwnicki said:\n\n\"Such prospect is so improbable, because there are elements of government policy which may indicate that the zloty will weaken. I'm talking about further consequences of the bank (asset) tax, and potential Swiss franc-denominated credits conversion.\"\n\nPoland's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), which won elections in October, has introduced a new tax on the country's mostly foreign-owned banking sector. And President Andrzej Duda has proposed a conversion scheme to allow borrowers to redenominate their costly Swiss franc mortgages into zlotys.\n\nPolish banks hold a combined $43 billion in foreign currency debt, mainly in Swiss francs, taken out when the franc was weaker and the loans were easier for Polish consumers to repay.\n\nAnalysts expect that bank tax, which came into effect this quarter, may limit lending growth, while presidential proposal to convert forex loans might weaken banks and the Polish currency.\n\nMost of newly-appointed members of the central bank's Monetary Policy Council, reshuffled by the PiS-led parliament and PiS-backed president have said they saw no need to change rates.\n\nKropiwnicki also said he saw no need for implementing non-standard monetary policy tools, which were suggested by PiS politicians during an election campaign.\n\n(Writing by Marcin Goclowski.
