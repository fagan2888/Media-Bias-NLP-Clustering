After the score was confirmed, Newton began his typical \u201cSuperman\u201d celebration, pulling his hands apart across his chest.\n\nNewton, who had also been jawing at Saints defenders, was then shoved by linebacker Curtis Lofton, who drew a personal foul on the play, but not an ejection. Moments after Lofton\u2019s shove, numerous players from both sides vigorously joined the altercation.\n\nWilliams appeared to land punches thrown at Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan, who was knocked down but apparently not hurt as he remained in the game.\n\nIntensity and frustrations were bound to be high in this matchup of NFC South Division foes who have both struggled much of this season, but remained in playoff contention.\n\nThe Panthers came in on a six-game losing streak, which included a loss to New Orleans in Charlotte.\n\nStill, Carolina had a chance to pull within a half-game of the division lead with a victory in New Orleans and an Atlanta loss at heavily favored Green Bay on Monday night.\n\nNew Orleans entered the game tied for first in the division with the Falcons despite a 5-7 record, but had lost its previous three at home.\n\nAlso, New Orleans\u2018 defense entered the game ranked second-to-last in the NFL, then gave up 17 points in less than nine minutes to a Panthers squad that had only managed 30 first-quarter points in its first 12 games.\n\nWhen the scuffle erupted, Newton was on the edge of the scrum, and got shoved into a padded gate behind the goal post. On impact the gate gave way and the scrum spilled into a tunnel.\n\nThe scuffle did little to change the tenor of the game. During the third quarter, Jordan received a personal foul for a late hit on Newton along the sideline. Newton responded shortly after with a 26-yard scoring pass on a screen play to Fozzy Whitaker in the third quarter, giving Carolina a 38-3 lead.\n\nNewton also seized several opportunities to tease the fans in the Superdome, including an exaggerated first-down signal after one of his many sizeable gains on scrambles.\n\nBoos rained down from the stands often, though usually directed at the home team, and seats were mostly empty with five minutes remaining in the third quarter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Panthers tight end Brandon Williams has been ejected from Sunday's game against the New Orleans Saints for throwing punches during a scuffle between the teams that spilled behind an end zone, through a closed gate and into a tunnel.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Panthers tight end Brandon Williams has been ejected from Sunday\u2019s game against the New Orleans Saints for throwing punches during a scuffle between the teams that spilled behind an end zone, through a closed gate and into a tunnel.", "title": "Panthers, Saints brawl after Cam Newton TD", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/7/panthers-saints-brawl-after-cam-newton-td-leads-ej/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/07/panthers-saints-footb_lanc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/07/panthers-saints-footb_lanc.jpg", "description": "Panthers tight end Brandon Williams has been ejected from Sunday's game against the New Orleans Saints for throwing punches during a scuffle between the teams that spilled behind an end zone, through", "card": "summary", "title": "Panthers, Saints brawl after Cam Newton TD"}, "Author": "Brett Martel", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Cam Newton, New Orleans, Carolina Panthers, New Orleans Saints"}, "article_summary": "The scuffle began after Cam Newton dove over the pile for a 2-yard touchdown, giving Carolina a 17-0 lead in the first quarter.\nAfter the score was confirmed, Newton began his typical \u201cSuperman\u201d celebration, pulling his hands apart across his chest.\nWhen the scuffle erupted, Newton was on the edge of the scrum, and got shoved into a padded gate behind the goal post.\nNewton, who had also been jawing at Saints defenders, was then shoved by linebacker Curtis Lofton, who drew a personal foul on the play, but not an ejection.\nThe Panthers came in on a six-game losing streak, which included a loss to New Orleans in Charlotte."}
