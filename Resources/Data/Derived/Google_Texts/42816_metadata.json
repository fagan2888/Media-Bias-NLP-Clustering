Pasco County is home to about a dozen such communities including Caliente, Lake Como and Paradise Lakes.\n\nA two-part special with the same title premiered on TLC in 2013, but tonight\u2019s 10 p.m. premiere kicks off the first, full, eight-episode season for the show.\n\nIt follows the experienced realtor Youngblood and a young agent recruit named Alex who\u2019s learning the ropes. They\u2019re fully clothed. The clients are not.\n\nYoungblood teaches Alex the \u201crules,\u201d things such as \u201cnudists greet with a handshake, hugging is not recommended,\u201d and \u201calways make eye contact, \u201d while viewers get an inside look at the clothing-optional culture.\n\nThe show is careful about what it reveals. Bare behinds are OK (a one-minute preview features dozens of them in various states of leafblowing, skateboarding, grilling steaks and other everyday activities), but the clients fronts are obscured by a ridiculous number of hilarious items including patio lanterns, cocktail shakers, bunches of bananas and potted plants.\n\nJim Sweasy, owner of The Woods RV Resort in Land O\u2019 Lakes will appear on the show this season. He said the show was shooting there part time for about four months starting in January.\n\nThe producers are throwing an invitation-only watch party at the upscale RV park for about 70 people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s done very tasteful. They\u2019re going to show a part of the nudist lifestyle that the average person doesn\u2019t see or think about,\u201d said Sweasy, who appears nude during a later episode this season. \u201cPeople have this idea in their heads of the old nudist camps, but I think as they watch this show it\u2019s going to open their eyes ... The average RV lot here costs $150,000 and up, and people are traveling here in million dollar coaches.\u201d\n\nIn the premiere, Jackie brings together the \u201ctextiles\u201d or \u201cclothed conservatives\u201d of the Pasco County real estate industry and the nudists of the community for a \u201cvery hands-on networking event,\u201d according to a preview on the TLC website.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 28 Jun 2014 14:47:17 -0400", "Description": "There are special considerations that go into shopping for a home when you\u2019re a nudist.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "There are special considerations that go into shopping for a home when you\u2019re a nudist.", "title": "TLC\u2019s \u2018Buying Naked,\u2019 shot in Pasco County, premieres tonight", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/events-tampa-bay/tlcs-buying-naked-shot-in-pasco-county-premieres-tonight-20140628/", "image": {"width": 622, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140628/ARTICLE/140629284/EP/1/1/EP-140629284.jpg", "height": 435}, "updated_time": "2014-06-28T16:31:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "There are special considerations that go into shopping for a home when you\u2019re a nudist.", "title": "TLC\u2019s \u2018Buying Naked,\u2019 shot in Pasco County, premieres tonight", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140628/ARTICLE/140629284/AR/0/AR-140629284.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-06-28T14:47:17Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-06-28T16:31:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "buying naked pasco,buying naked tlc,caliente,pasco county nudists,TV show,woods rv resort"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccaae\"", "article_summary": "These are the lessons of \u201cBuying Naked\u201d a new, real estate reality series on TLC, shot in the clothing-optional communities Pasco County has become known for.\nPasco County is home to about a dozen such communities including Caliente, Lake Como and Paradise Lakes.\nJim Sweasy, owner of The Woods RV Resort in Land O\u2019 Lakes will appear on the show this season.\nThe producers are throwing an invitation-only watch party at the upscale RV park for about 70 people.\n\u201cPeople have this idea in their heads of the old nudist camps, but I think as they watch this show it\u2019s going to open their eyes ..."}
