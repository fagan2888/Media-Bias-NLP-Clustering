In what is easily the most delicious campaign contest of the 2016 election, Ben Cohen (the "Ben" of Ben & Jerry's), has created a Bernie Sanders-specific flavor of ice cream called "Bernie's Yearning." While the flavor isn't an official Ben & Jerry's pint (and a disclaimer on the site says that Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. has nothing to do with it), 25 pints of the ultra-limited edition flavor will be given to Sanders supporters who enter a contest on the campaign website.

The flavor is described as a mint ice cream with a chocolate disk on top that is meant to be broken and mixed into the ice cream.

Nothing is so unstoppable as a flavor whose time has finally come #FeelTheBern #BerniesYearning: http://ow.ly/Xv3o1 Posted by Yo Ben Cohen on Monday, January 25, 2016

Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield are Vermont residents and have been vocal supporters of Sanders' campaign for president since the beginning of the campaign.

There have been discussions of a Sanders-themed ice cream flavor since October. Cohen actually described Bernie's Yearning in a CNN interview three months ago, and said that the chocolate disk on top of the ice cream is meant to represent the wealth of the top one percent of the population, and that the process of breaking up the chocolate and redistributing it throughout the ice cream is demonstrative of Sanders' economic ideals.

While part of me hates that we live in a world where something as delicious as mint chocolate chip ice cream can be politicized, another part is applauding the creativity of this campaign.
