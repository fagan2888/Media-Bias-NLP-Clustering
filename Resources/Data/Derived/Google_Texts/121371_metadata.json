That was 20 years ago, it\u2019s much better now.\u201d\n\nChapel Hill and Carrboro residents will soon see local stores with signs welcoming breastfeeding mothers and information encouraging the practice of breastfeeding.\n\nThe towns are set to become two of the first cities in the country to receive the Breastfeeding-Family-Friendly City Designation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pilot for the world,\u201d said Miriam Labbok, director of the Carolina Global Breastfeeding Institute and UNC professor of maternal and child health. \u201cThere has never been a city that set out to say \u2018Hey, we welcome the family.\u2019\u201d\n\nChapel Hill Mayor Mark Kleinschmidt and Carrboro Mayor Lydia Lavelle announced their support for the Breastfeeding-Family-Friendly City Designation, led by the Carolina Breastfeeding Institute, on Aug. 6. The campaign is in conjunction with the United States Breastfeeding Committee\u2019s National Breastfeeding Month in August.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re really lucky in this community to have the support that we do of businesses and community spaces,\u201d said Stephani Kilpatrick, residential services director for the Inter-Faith Council for Social Service, which is a supporter of the initiative. \u201cBut I think saying it straightforwardly that we are breastfeeding-family-friendly is important as far as encouraging it and normalizing it.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina law states that women can breastfeed anywhere in public and private locations. The Affordable Care Act requires workplaces to provide break time for mothers to pump breast milk with suitable locations free from intrusion.\n\nIn order to earn the Breastfeeding-Family-Friendly City Designation, at least 50 percent of businesses must post \u201cbreastfeeding welcome here\u201d signs on their windows. Local groceries also must not promote commercial brand baby formula by preferential placement in the stores or direct advertising.\n\nLabbok, who has been involved in encouraging breastfeeding since the 1980s, said she doesn\u2019t expect all stores to stop selling formula after the launch of the initiative because of the regulations regarding chain grocery stores such as Harris Teeter.\n\nRoskind\u2019s Oasis Cafe was chosen as the launch venue for the initiative on Aug. 10 due to the support he has shown for breastfeeding mothers. All breastfeeding mothers are given a free pot of tea when they visit.\n\nRoskind said that a group of mothers would often visit and breastfeed in a corner of his cafe.\n\n\u201cI was pleased to have the actual town endorse it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best thing for a child is breast milk, but we\u2019ve gotten so far away from it because of corporations and lifestyles that prevent mothers from breastfeeding.\u201d\n\n@zhainatyun\n\n\n\ncity@dailytarheel.com\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robert Roskind and his wife felt uncomfortable when his wife breastfed his then-infant daughter in public.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Tar Heel", "description": "Robert Roskind and his wife felt uncomfortable when his wife breastfed his then-infant daughter in public.", "title": "Feed your babies, says Chapel Hill, Carrboro", "url": "http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2015/08/fed-your-babies-says-chapel-hill-carrboro", "image": "http://d39xfl750sfsi8.cloudfront.net/201604217ygrp9dscZ/dist/img/DTH-fb-icon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.dailytarheel.com", "site": "@dailytarheel", "card": "summary"}, "publish_date": "2015-08-20 23:18:00", "google-site-verification": "CHlXbXA4sWralvQUEv7pJfpAAlXw8V34QT7XXWre_aU", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailytarheel"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The towns are set to become two of the first cities in the country to receive the Breastfeeding-Family-Friendly City Designation.\nThat was 20 years ago, it\u2019s much better now.\u201dChapel Hill and Carrboro residents will soon see local stores with signs welcoming breastfeeding mothers and information encouraging the practice of breastfeeding.\nAll breastfeeding mothers are given a free pot of tea when they visit.\nIn order to earn the Breastfeeding-Family-Friendly City Designation, at least 50 percent of businesses must post \u201cbreastfeeding welcome here\u201d signs on their windows.\nFeed your babies, says Chapel Hill, CarrboroZhai Yun Tan | Published 08/20/15 11:18pm\u201cThere were a few occasions, and it wasn\u2019t stated, but you could tell the vibes,\u201d said Roskind, owner of Oasis Cafe in Carrboro\u2019s Carr Mill Mall."}
