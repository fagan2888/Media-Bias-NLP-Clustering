There\u2019s something about the pageantry, the grandeur, and the joy that lifts up a community and all the people within it. Perhaps I\u2019m bitten by nostalgia when I remember my parents\u2019 stories about the Corpus Christi parades back in Ireland in the 1940s and 50s. Thousands wound their way through communities after High Mass: girls in their white dresses and gloves and men in their Sunday finest marching behind the Eucharist. They were proud to be Catholic.\n\nI was very curious when I noticed that the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) was encouraging people to have parades during this year\u2019s Fortnight for Freedom, which begins Sunday. I thought to myself, \u201cWhat a good idea.\u201d A Church that has been rocked by sexual abuse scandals and divided by the bishops\u2019 cultural war needs a good parade to bring us all together. I certainly wanted to sign up to march.\n\nHowever, after I attended Mass, my vision of a unified Church marching together with the renewed hope that Pope Francis has fostered was quickly shattered. The priest explained that they really want us to march so that we can lend credence to their desire to discriminate. Next week, the bishops will launch a campaign under the guise of religious freedom, which means they want the ability to discriminate against LGBT people, against people who have children outside of marriage, against a woman who has an abortion \u2014 and against you.\n\nThe bishops want to take taxpayer money to fund their discrimination, but they don\u2019t want adhere to the same rules as everyone else. They fought the Affordable Care Act provision that contraception be included as an essential health benefit covered by all insurance plans. When they lost, they pressured the administration into carving out exemptions for churches, dioceses, and other religious institutions \u2014 but even that was not enough. They expanded the exemption to religious nonprofits, and through Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, they even trampled on the conscience rights of individuals who work at for-profit corporations.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Catholic charities in Africa take taxpayer money to serve patients with HIV & AIDS, but they don\u2019t want to provide condoms to prevent HIV. Likewise, the USCCB has said that it will not provide abortions and emergency contraception in their border relief services, so the 68,000 children and teens who flee violence and persecution in their home country will not find the critical healthcare they need.\n\nThe bishops want a parade of Catholics not to uplift and celebrate our community, but to show support for their discrimination campaign. But Catholics in their everyday practice do not march behind the bishops. In fact, 89 percent of Catholics do not believe they have to vote on issues the way that bishops recommend; 72 percent support contraceptive coverage in both private and government insurance plans; and 99 percent of sexually active Catholic women have used a method of contraception banned by the Vatican.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoliticians from both sides of the aisle are the ones who are really marching behind the bishops. Every Republican presidential candidate in next year\u2019s election will promise to give the bishops a blank check if they win. Even more depressing, we\u2019ve seen the Obama administration making concessions to the bishops time and time again. This administration \u2014 and, it appears, the Democratic Party \u2014 has no understanding of the separation of church and state, and no commitment to supporting real religious freedom. Real religious freedom is freedom of and freedom from religion. Neither party seems to understand that you don\u2019t get to impose your beliefs onto somebody else \u2014 your freedom stops at the end of your nose.\n\nUnless we let our politicians know we don\u2019t believe that discrimination is an American value, they are quite likely to empty the till \u2014 to give away the entire store \u2014 to the bishops and other religious interests. What\u2019s at stake is preserving the separation of church and state that is precious for all Americans, including Catholics.\n\nWe should let our politicians know that a parade of everyone who believes in real religious freedom and rejects discrimination would stretch for miles.\n\nJon O\u2019Brien is president of Catholics for Choice.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/church/2015/06/19/a-march-for-discrimination/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IndianaGayRightsRally.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "On Sunday, US bishops will launch a campaign under the guise of religious freedom in which they want a parade of Catholics not to uplift and celebrate our community, but to show support for discrimination.", "title": "A march for discrimination"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d1d2d3", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd80\"", "article_summary": "We should let our politicians know that a parade of everyone who believes in real religious freedom and rejects discrimination would stretch for miles.\nReal religious freedom is freedom of and freedom from religion.\nThe bishops want a parade of Catholics not to uplift and celebrate our community, but to show support for their discrimination campaign.\nThe bishops want to take taxpayer money to fund their discrimination, but they don\u2019t want adhere to the same rules as everyone else.\nHowever, after I attended Mass, my vision of a unified Church marching together with the renewed hope that Pope Francis has fostered was quickly shattered."}
