They respond much better to a photo of the Statue of Liberty, rather than a photo of the U.S. Capitol,\u201d said Kelly, who is seeking his third term.\n\nKelly's campaign spent $125,000 on TV advertising from Sept. 16 through Wednesday. His ad shows him in the district stretching from Butler to Erie and tells his story, he said, because \u201cI represent the district, not Washington.\u201d\n\nRothfus of Sewickley said he used his first campaign ad to remind voters of who he is, and talked about his cancer of the appendix, diagnosed a month before the birth of his sixth child, \u201cto highlight both that you can overcome adversities and the ingenuity of American doctors.\u201d In office since 2013, Rothfus said he also wants to \u201cremind voters of the possible impact Obamacare could have on our health care system.\u201d\n\nHis campaign made a \u201csix-figure buy across the district\u201d for TV ads but would not specify the dollar amount of the time span.\n\nAvoiding association with Washington while running for office began after Richard Nixon's presidency, Lapp said.\n\n\u201cIt used to be there was a gravitas of noting you worked in Washington and in Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cPost-Watergate, there has been a growing cynicism against Washington that never really stopped.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, he said, \u201care not running with the president.\u201d\n\nMost of this year, more people disapproved than approved of Obama's performance; his recent disapproval rating in Gallup's daily tracking was 52 percent.\n\nKelly's Democratic opponent, political newcomer Dan LaVallee, a Carnegie Mellon University graduate whose family owned and operated Kunst Bakery in Pittsburgh for more than 50 years, has a Facebook ad that talks about his Western Pennsylvania roots.\n\nLaVallee could not be reached for comment. His website knocks Washington and notes that he's running because most areas in the district \u201care falling behind\u201d in the economy's recovery.\n\n\u201cWe have opportunities for growth, but we're not taking advantage of them because Washington would rather shut down the government than find solutions,\u201d his message says. \u201c... We need new leadership to get our economy moving again.\u201d\n\nRothfus' opponent, Democrat Erin McClelland, the founder of a substance abuse rehabilitation center in Blawnox, has a web-based attack ad that criticizes Rothfus for his stance on climate change. McClelland doesn't speak in the ad, which shows Rothfus during a debate and acknowledging he does not think climate change is man-made and is not convinced it's a fact.\n\n\u201cI'm very dubious,\u201d he says in the video clip.\n\nMarios Kritiotis, McClelland's campaign manager, said she is considering whether to invest in advertising.\n\n\u201cWe're open to anything, but at this juncture we're getting a great response in the field and have been actively engaging voters on the ground level and hearing their stories,\u201d he said.\n\nForest Hills Democrat Mike Doyle, whose congressional district includes Pittsburgh and the Mon Valley, said he won't advertise this fall since he's running unopposed.\n\n\u201cIt would not be a wise use of money. But even if I did run an ad, it would never show me in Washington. ... Bragging about working in Washington has never been something I've done,\u201d said Doyle, first elected in 1994.\n\nHis campaign website is filled with photos of him with community leaders, college students in the city's Oakland neighborhood and in the North Side against the backdrop of Heinz Field.\n\nIn many political ads, Democrats and Republicans alike replace suits and ties and loosen the top buttons of their shirts to talk about their work to benefit communities, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg College in Allentown.\n\nSupport for the president's signature health care act would be hard to find this year, Borick said.\n\n\u201cThe president, Obamacare and anything Washington-associated is just toxic,\u201d he said.\n\nLapp produced an ad, \u201cFor Us,\u201d for former Army Ranger and ex-CIA employee Kevin Strouse, a Democrat who is challenging Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick for his 8th District seat in Bucks County. The ad shows Strouse with his family, talking about a broken government and troubled middle class.\n\nThe goal is to come across to voters as genuine, Lapp said \u2014 not to make promises or talk about legislation.\n\n\u201cPeople want to feel a connection and know that who you are sending to Washington shares your values,\u201d he said.\n\nSalena Zito is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
