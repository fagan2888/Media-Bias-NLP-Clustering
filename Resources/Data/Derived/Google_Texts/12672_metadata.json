The grant, paid out in two installments, was set to expire this December. (Read ConnectEDU\u2019s grant pitch here.)\n\nThe project, however, got derailed earlier this year when ConnectEDU filed for Chapter 11 protection, citing an estimated $33.7 million in liabilities and $17.7 million in assets.\n\nSince then, the Gates Foundation has tried to ensure that its grant money is kept in a separate account and that any unused portion will be returned to the organization, according to a filing made this week in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. Requests for information from ConnectEDU\u2019s counsel at Lowenstein Sandler, however, have gone unanswered, the foundation says.\n\nAttorneys from Lowenstein Sandler didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.\n\nNow, the foundation is asking the court to direct ConnectEDU to respond to its questions and turn over documents related to the grant funds by Sept. 12. Without more information, the foundation says, it can\u2019t tell how large of a claim it has in the bankruptcy and is \u201cin danger of non-compliance\u201d with its federal and state tax reporting requirements.\n\nConnectEDU is one of a few dozen organizations awarded money as part of the Gates Foundation\u2019s Literacy Courseware Challenge, which supports the creation of digital literacy tools to help students in grades 4 through 8.\n\nWrite to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com.
