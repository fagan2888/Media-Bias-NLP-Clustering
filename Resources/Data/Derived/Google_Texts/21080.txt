What a new agency to oversee the Mound Basin should look like will be the focus of a meeting Monday night in Ventura.

The Mound Basin is the city’s highest-producing groundwater source but also has the worst quality water.

It is located in the western portion of the Santa Clara River Valley Groundwater Basin. The city, the Ventura County Watershed District and the United Water Conservation District are working to form the agency.

A law that went into effect earlier this year, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, is intended to promote greater cooperation between agencies that manage groundwater. Within five years, the new agency must produce a groundwater management plan that lays out how to best manage and protect the resource.

In 20 years, the sources should be sustainable.

Water officials will discuss the law in greater depth tonight.

The city is separately working toward an agency to oversee the Upper Ventura River basin.

Monday’s meeting starts at 6 p.m. in the community meeting room at City Hall, 501 Poli St.
