DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz allegedly put a deal forward where she would switch positions on medicinal marijuana if a Democratic donor withdrew criticism of her for not backing a related statewide initiative last year; it was defeated by a narrow margin. John Morgan, the donor who slammed Schultz for not backing the measure, contributed heavily to the pro-medical marijuana campaign. Of course, Schultz has denied the consideration of any deal regarding this debacle.\n\nYet, there\u2019s more; Democrats don\u2019t want Debbie to run either. She\u2019s turned off many within Democratic circles, with some viewing her management style as \u201cself-centered,\u201d according to Politico. Additionally, the publication reported that Schultz had allegedly prepared an \u201canti-woman\u201d and \u201canti-Semitic\u201d line of attack against President Obama when she felt he might try and replace her as DNC chair, a position that could come off as too partisan for independent voters in the Sunshine State if she ever mounted a Senate run [emphasis mine]:\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: Many Democrats don\u2019t want her to run for Senate either.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Senate is a default position,\u201d said Democratic consultant James Carville. \u201cIt\u2019s not like, maybe you can be designated hitter.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Senate Campaign Committee is far from enthusiastic, according to sources close to the committee. Asked about Wasserman Schultz specifically, DSCC spokesman Justin Barasky said only: \u201cIt seems like there\u2019s no one in the United States Senate who wants to be a senator less than Marco Rubio, and there are numerous potential candidates who could beat him.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nWasserman Schultz, meanwhile, appears to have more liabilities, including what some of her milder critics refer to as \u201cher capacity to misspeak\u201d \u2014 like her accusing Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker last fall of a record on women\u2019s rights that was like \u201cgrabbing us by the hair and pulling us back.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nNo one is waiting for Wasserman Schultz to make up her mind \u2014 nor does anyone think she\u2019ll clear the field if she did jump in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like other Democrats will say, \u2018Oh she\u2019s running, I better not run,\u2019\u201d Carville said.\n\n\u2026\n\nThroughout her time as chair, Wasserman Schultz has turned off colleagues, other top Democrats and current and former staff for a management style that strikes many as self-centered \u2014 even for a politician \u2014 and often at the expense of the DNC or individual candidates or campaigns. Many top Democrats, including some she counts as supporters and friends, privately complain about her trying to use the DNC as a vehicle for her own personal promotion, and letting her own ambition get in the way of larger goals.\n\nWasserman Schultz has a different sense of herself. According to people who spoke with her, when she sensed Obama was considering replacing her as chair in 2013, she began to line up supporters to suggest the move was both anti-woman and anti-Semitic. Under fire last fall for her leadership, she took Obama\u2019s decision not to remove her then as evidence of renewed strength and said she was confident no one could get her out of the DNC before her term is over at the beginning of 2017, according to sources who\u2019ve spoken with her. She\u2019s also been known to joke around the office about how having a vacation home in New Hampshire might one day be helpful in a presidential run.\n\n\u2026\n\nWasserman Schultz would be a strong Senate candidate in South Florida, and be able to pull Jewish and female voters elsewhere in the state, the logic goes, all likely helped by Clinton. But \u2014 especially if Rubio or former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is on the ticket \u2014 she\u2019d be much weaker in Tampa and the northern part of the state. Then there\u2019s the chance that her DNC chairmanship could work against her, making her look hyperpartisan in the minds of independent voters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ouch..05/26/2016 3:32:54AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Ouch.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Yeah, Democrats Don\u2019t Want Wasserman Schultz To Run For Senate Either", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/02/22/yeah-democrats-dont-want-wasserman-schultz-to-run-for-senate-either-n1960366", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/338/184c7459-ea2c-4211-b5bb-0049b7459609.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Ouch.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Yeah, Democrats Don\u2019t Want Wasserman Schultz To Run For Senate Either", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/02/22/yeah-democrats-dont-want-wasserman-schultz-to-run-for-senate-either-n1960366", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/338/184c7459-ea2c-4211-b5bb-0049b7459609.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Yeah, Democrats Don\u2019t Want Wasserman Schultz To Run For Senate Either, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb436\"", "article_summary": "Wasserman Schultz has a different sense of herself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like, maybe you can be designated hitter.\u201dThe Democratic Senate Campaign Committee is far from enthusiastic, according to sources close to the committee.\n\u2026Wasserman Schultz would be a strong Senate candidate in South Florida, and be able to pull Jewish and female voters elsewhere in the state, the logic goes, all likely helped by Clinton.\nYet, there\u2019s more; Democrats don\u2019t want Debbie to run either.\nJohn Morgan, the donor who slammed Schultz for not backing the measure, contributed heavily to the pro-medical marijuana campaign."}
