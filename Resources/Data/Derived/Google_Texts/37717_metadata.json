His Career Has Been A Disaster. CREDIT: AP Photo/Melinda Deslatte Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) with his wife Wendy, in September\n\nDavid Vitter has been elected to the United States Senate twice by the state of Louisiana \u2014 by margins of 19 points and 22 points \u2014 in a state carried by Mitt Romney over Barack Obama, 57.78 percent to 40.58 percent in 2012. But two polls recently showed him trailing state representative John Bel Edwards (D) in Saturday\u2019s runoff for governor by double digits. Vitter is seemingly about to do the unthinkable: Be a Republican who loses an election in a deep-red state.\n\nWhile part of it may be the widespread unpopularity of term-limited Republican incumbent Gov. Bobby Jindal, whose disapproval rating hovers at a historic 70 percent, Vitter\u2019s own personal behavior and record helped spur Lt. Governor Jay Dardenne (R), who garnered about 15 percent in last week\u2019s gubernatorial jungle primary, to cross party lines and endorse the Democrat Edwards. \u201cThe Republican brand has been damaged by the failed leadership of Bobby Jindal during this last term,\u201d Dardenne said in his endorsement announcement. \u201cDavid Vitter\u2019s governorship will further damage that brand.\u201d\n\nHere are some highlights of Vitter\u2019s record:\n\n1) \u2018Most Corrupt\u2019\n\nVitter has been cited by the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington three separate times as among the \u201cmost corrupt\u201d legislators in Washington, D.C. Among the reasons: he paid his cousin with political action committee funds, was admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee for actions that undermined a \u201cbasic principal of government service,\u201d and that he likely violated state prostitution laws. Edwards is making the fact that Vitter\u2019s number appeared on the D.C. Madam\u2019s phone list an issue in a campaign ad.\n\n2) War On Federal Employees\u2019 Healthcare\n\nVitter\u2019s fierce opposition to the Affordable Care Act has not waned since its passage in 2010. His campaign website calls the program \u201ca disaster\u201d and he pushed for a full repeal of the law this year. But his most fierce push has been for what he calls the \u201cNo Exemption for Washington from Obamacare Act,\u201d a proposal to require all executive branch political employees and congressional staffers to get their health insurance through an exchange, with no employer subsidies whatsoever. Republican colleagues have blasted the effort as \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201centirely political,\u201d and, according to Politico, congressional aides privately \u201chave fumed about Vitter\u2019s proposal every time it comes up, because leaving the subsidized federal health insurance program might require them to pay more and change their doctors.\u201d This would mean that federal legislative and executive staff would not get what 62 percent of the nation\u2019s employees do.\n\n3) War On The Poor\n\nIn 2011, with 50 million Americans in poverty after the economic meltdown, Vitter proposed capping funding for food stamps and 76 other federal welfare programs at pre-2007 levels by 2015 (or when unemployment fell below 7.5 percent, whichever came sooner). In his own state, the poverty rate hovers near 20 percent \u2014 far above the national rate of 14.8 percent. \u201cWe are overdue to renew welfare reform efforts and make additional gains because the welfare state has grown enormously since then \u2014 even factoring our recession,\u201d he explained at the time. Two years later, he authored a restriction to prevent anyone convicted of a violent crime or sexual assault from receiving food stamps \u2014 for the rest of their lives \u2014 and last year he also proposed requiring the remaining beneficiaries to present a photo ID every time they used food stamps, as an effort to reduce \u201cfraud surrounding the taxpayer-funded program.\u201d In reality, government audits have revealed that food stamp fraud accounts for just 1 percent of the program.\n\n4) War On The Planet\n\nVitter\u2019s Senate website boasts that he works to \u201cpromote a common-sense and balanced approach to a fact-based energy and infrastructure policy that harnesses the power of America\u2019s job creators to grow and maintain a strong economy.\u201d In practice, this has meant he has denied climate science, backed the elimination of the Environmental Protection Agency, proposed legislation to reduce criminal liability for oil spills, denounced CO2 emissions limits, and mocked 15,000 furloughed EPA employees as an example of why the 2013 federal government shutdown was not \u201call bad.\u201d His strongest praise, he reserved for oil billionaires Charles and David Koch, who he termed \u201ctwo of the most patriotic Americans in the history of the Earth.\u201d\n\n5) Birtherism\n\nIn 2010, Vitter embraced the most extreme anti-Obama rhetoric, endorsing a \u201cbirther\u201d lawsuit challenging the president\u2019s eligibility to be president. \u201cI know all the information I\u2019ve been able to get my hands on through the media. But obviously with the mainstream media as a filter, that\u2019s not a whole lot,\u201d he lamented after a town hall attendee asked him about Obama\u2019s birth certificate. \u201cI personally don\u2019t have standing to bring litigation in court. But I support conservative legal organizations and others who would bring that to court. I think that is the valid and most possibly effective grounds to do it.\u201d\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to catch up, Vitter and the Louisiana GOP have spent much of the week demonizing Syrian refugees.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"The Republican brand has been damaged by the failed leadership of Bobby Jindal during this last term.
