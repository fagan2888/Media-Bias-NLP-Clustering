The city has issued 70 business licenses to all kinds of clinics since 2011, records provided by the city show. There are several new physicians\u2019 offices, walk-in clinics and urgent care centers.\n\nThree of the Sandy Springs centers are considered \u201curgent care,\u201d offering hours outside the normal work week, and treating conditions that might otherwise be treated in an emergency room, according to city records. The city has permitted 12 new physicians\u2019 offices, including one primary care doctor.\n\nGrowth in doctor\u2019s offices appears in other parts of the Perimeter area, too. Perimeter Clinic Buckhead Office Manager Sasha Kron said she\u2019s seen 12 clinics open up nearby within the last three years. Kron\u2019s office has been open for eight years, and Kron remembers when her clinic saw up to 60 patients a day.\n\nShe said she anticipates seeing more patients and clinics because of the new federal Affordable Care Act, which went into effect this month. One key provision of the new law, also known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d is that it requires millions of Americans to enroll for health insurance, if they don\u2019t already have it. President Barack Obama signed the health care law in 2010.\n\n\u201cOh, absolutely it will bring more in,\u201d Kron said. \u201cWill it be quality medicine? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nDr. Okiki Louis, regional medical director for Concentra\u2019s Southeast Region, said the company was interested in opening a walk-in clinic closer to Sandy Springs\u2019 aging Baby Boomer population. Concentra opened three different clinics along Roswell Road within the last three years: an urgent care, primary care and therapy clinic.\n\n\u201cThe Sandy Springs location is in a high-traffic retail space,\u201d Louis said. \u201cIt lies on a busy street in the Sandy Springs/Perimeter area, so there is high visibility. This particular center is part of our new Integrated Wellness Center model where both primary care and urgent care offices make up the facility. In addition, the wellness center is adjacent to a Humana guidance center, so it allows us to also serve the Humana members\u2019 medical needs and create a meeting space for the senior community.\u201d\n\nLouis said Concentra sees the ACA as an opportunity as more patients walk through the clinic\u2019s doors.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate an increased use in urgent care facilities as more patients become covered under plans in the exchanges and seek medical resources for routine health issues,\u201d Louis said. \u201cIn the long term we see greater opportunities to expand the continuum of care through the use of (electronic health record) systems, greater connection to health care systems, and a greater focus on wellness and long-term health.\u201d\n\nLouis said that Concentra is getting ready by putting its records system in place and implementing care coordinators who will help patients find providers and specialists.\n\n\u201cWe have also expanded our focus to include primary care centers in order to create additional access points for newly-covered patients and longer-term medical homes,\u201d Louis said.\n\nKron said that she thinks there will also be a rise in clinics that accept no insurance at all because physicians will want to avoid the hassle of processing new insurances. She said her main selling point will be the quality of care patients receive at Perimeter Clinic.\n\n\u201cI think, in a way, the healthcare law is going to benefit me,\u201d Kron said. \u201cYou can offer more quality. Patients are going to come and see you.\u201d\n\nAbout Dan Whisenhunt\n\nFacebook Comments:\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Reporter Newspapers", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://www.reporternewspapers.net/2013/10/18/pop-clinics-pop-locally-health-care-options-grow/", "article_author_name": "Dan Whisenhunt", "image": "http://www.reporternewspapers.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_6661.jpg", "site_id": "7e592b3220af0ce98624de889e2ceecb", "article_published_time": "2013-10-18T09:30:04+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-24T05:09:00+00:00", "keywords": "city, perimeter clinic buckhead, sandy springs perimeter, sandy springs reporter, space, around our community, perimeter business", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "news_keywords": "city, Perimeter Clinic Buckhead, Sandy Springs Perimeter, Sandy Springs Reporter, space", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Reporter Newspapers", "description": "Over the last three years, there\u2019s been an explosion of medical offices opening in the Perimeter area, specifically in Sandy Springs.
