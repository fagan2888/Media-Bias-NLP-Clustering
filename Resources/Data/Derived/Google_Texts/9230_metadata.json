Posted Monday through Friday right here at www.abcnews.com\n\nCompiled by ABC News' Jayce Henderson , Will Cantine and Janine Elliot\n\nFORT HOOD ABC News' Luis Martinez: \" Fort Hood Shooter Had Lengthy but Unremarkable Military Career\" The Army service record of Spc. Ivan A. Lopez, who has been identified as the shooter who killed three fellow soldiers and injured 16 others at Fort Hood, Texas, on Wednesday, revealed a lengthy though unremarkable military career. Lopez, a native of Guayanilla, P.R., was an active duty soldier who initially began his Army career as a member of the Puerto Rico National Guard in 1999. He did not complete training and was discharged in November 1999, according to Maj. Jamie Davis, a spokesman for the Puerto Rico National Guard. Lopez re-entered the Guard in 2003 as an infantryman, though he later transitioned to a Guard band, where he played percussion. LINK\n\nWall Street Journal's Devlin Barrett and Julian E. Barnes: \" Fort Hood Officials Focus on Shooting Suspect's Mental Health\" The soldier accused of Wednesday's deadly shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas was undergoing treatment for a combination of depression, anxiety and insomnia, but no evidence has emerged linking his mental condition to his deployments overseas, military officials said Thursday.Army Spc. Ivan A. Lopez, who is suspected of killing three and wounding 16 before delivering a fatal shot to his own head, saw no combat during a short stint as a truck driver in Iraq or in a 13-month tour as an observer in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, according to military records and officials. LINK\n\nUSA Today's Trevor Hughes: \" Fort Hood shooting renews old fears, brings new ones\" An unsettling sense of deja vu has descended upon this sprawling Army post and the town surrounding it after a soldier on Wednesday shot and killed three people and wounded 16 before fatally shooting himself when confronted by a military police officer. For a community still recovering from the November 2009 killing of 13 base workers, Wednesday's assault by Spc. Ivan Lopez, 34, renewed old fears and awakened new ones. \"You figure that since it happened before, they'd be more prepared,\" said all-night diner waitress Catherine Wright as she finished a shift that was far slower than usual for Thursday morning. LINK\n\nAFFORDABLE CARE ACT Wall Street Journal's Kristina Peterson: \" Health-Law Tweak Redefining Full-Time Worker Gains Bipartisan Traction\" An effort to change the 2010 health-care law's definition of a full-time worker to ease its requirements on businesses has gained bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, as the Republican House on Thursday passed a bill to make the change with the help of 18 Democrats. The idea has popped up in several places in recent days. In the Senate, a similar measure has attracted two Democratic co-sponsors and has been floated as part of a potentially bipartisan package to raise the minimum wage. Republicans are pushing the issue hard, and sought to attach it as an amendment to unemployment-insurance legislation on Thursday. LINK\n\nCIA ABC News' Arlette Saenz: \" Senators Declassify Report Exposing 'Brutality' of CIA Interrogation Program\" The Senate Intelligence Committee has approved declassifying the executive summary of its report on the CIA's controversial interrogation program used on terror suspects after 9/11. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the report on the CIA program \"exposes brutality which stands in stark contrast to our values as a nation.\" \"It chronicles a stain on our history that must never be allowed to happen again,\" Feinstein told reporters following the vote. \"This is not what Americans do.\" LINK\n\nThe Hill's Jeremy Herb: \" In 11-3 vote, Senate Intel panel approves CIA report's release\" The Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday voted to declassify parts of its controversial report on Bush-era interrogation tactics, paving the way for the report's public release. The Intelligence panel voted 11-3 to make public the report's 400-page executive summary and its conclusions and findings, as well as the dissenting view from Republicans. LINK\n\nThe New York Times' David S. Joachim: \" Panel Votes To Reveal how C.I.A. Interrogated\" The public will soon get its first look at a voluminous report on the C.I.A.'s detention and interrogation practices during the George W. Bush administration, after the Senate Intelligence Committee voted on Thursday to declassify key sections of it. \"The report exposes brutality that stands in stark contrast to our values as a nation,\" Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat of California and the chairwoman of the committee, said in a written statement after the vote. It continued, \"This is not what Americans do.\" LINK\n\nThe Washington Post's Greg Miller and Adam Goldman: \" Senate Panel Votes To Release CIA Interrogation Report\" The Senate Intelligence Committee voted Thursday to make public a long-awaited report that concludes that the CIA's use of brutal interrogation measures did not produce valuable intelligence and that the agency repeatedly misled government officials about the severity and success of the program. The decision, opposed by three Republicans on the panel, means that the findings will be sent to the White House and the CIA, putting the agency in the awkward position of having to declassify a document that delivers a scathing verdict on one of the most controversial periods in its history. LINK\n\nPolitico's Burgess Everett and Josh Gerstein: \" Senate Panel Votes To Declassify CIA Report\" The Senate Intelligence Committee voted in private on Thursday to seek declassification of a 480-page summary of a report sharply criticizing the Central Intelligence Agency's detention and interrogation programs under President George W. Bush. The panel's chairwoman, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), said the documents show the CIA \"made serious mistakes that haunt us to this day\" in the agency's efforts to track down those responsible for the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. \"The purpose of this review was to uncover the facts behind this secret program, and the results were shocking,\" Feinstein said. \"The report exposes brutality that stands in stark contrast to our values as a nation. It chronicles a stain on our history that must never again be allowed to happen.\" LINK\n\nDEMOCRATS The Los Angeles Times' Michael Memoli: \" Democrats target Republican ties to Koch brothers\" Democrats struggling to combat a flood of outside money pouring in to defeat their candidates have found at least a temporary solution: If you can't beat them, brand them. The latest strategy of Democratic messaging is tying Republican candidates and policies to the party's most prominent - and at times vilified - financial patrons, billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch. LINK\n\nGOP The Washington Times' Tom Howell Jr.: \" Ben Carson, Republicans huddle in search of Obamacare replacement\" With a major Obamacare sign-up deadline past, Republicans are turning their attention to the \"replace\" half of their repeal and replace strategy, hoping to make up ground lost over the past four years as they seek to show voters that they have an alternative to the president's health care overhaul. Retired surgeon Ben Carson sat down with the House Republican health care caucus Thursday to hash out ideas. The doctor urged lawmakers to set some deadlines of their own for writing a plan.
