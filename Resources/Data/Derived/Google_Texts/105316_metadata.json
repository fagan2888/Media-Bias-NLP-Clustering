Such was the case for me earlier this month, when I joined Professor James Peterson in a round-table discussion with Lehigh University students and faculty about how to get published as an op-ed columnist.\n\n\u2666\u25ca\u2666\n\nWhen one of the attendees asked us to elaborate on the type of negative feedback one can anticipate upon being published, I remarked that it often depends on the demographic profile of the author in question. \u201cFigure out what aspects of your racial, religious, or sexual identity are most likely to be attacked, and then assume that a bunch of trolls are going to make the most vulgar comments they can think of based on them,\u201d I pointed out.\n\n\u201cCan you give a specific example?\u201d asked one student.\n\nAfter taking a moment to think about it, I replied, \u201cWell, as those of you who followed Gamergate last year have already seen, female writers frequently receive rape threats. Many of the women I personally know in the industry get rape threats all the time, even when they\u2019re not writing about video games or gender-related topics. As a man who has never gotten a rape threat \u2026\u201d\n\n\u2666\u25ca\u2666\n\nBefore I could finish that thought, a chuckle rippled throughout the room. Although I hadn\u2019t intended to say anything humorous, I had inadvertently caught a glimpse of a deep gender bias in our culture, one that equally disadvantages men and women. To wit:\n\n\u2014For women: Although I am certain the audience members did not intend for their mildly jocular response to be interpreted this way, the reality is that they laughed because our society has normalized certain horrifying assumptions about women being raped. When the term \u201crape culture\u201d is used, it is because of occasions like this, wherein the concept of a woman being raped is easy to understand but the notion of a man having the same experience is literally scoffed at. It also goes a long way toward explaining why rape threats are such a common default response for Internet commenters\u2014even though most polite society distances itself from such rhetoric, on a primal level we still haven\u2019t shaken the inner bigot that still deems them acceptable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It took a visit to a liberal college classroom to understand just how deeply embedded in our culture it truly is", "title": "When they laughed at rape", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It took a visit to a liberal college classroom to understand just how deeply embedded in our culture it truly is", "title": "When they laughed at rape", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/22/when_they_laughed_at_rape_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/shutterstock_85655041.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It took a visit to a liberal college classroom to understand just how deeply embedded in our culture it truly is", "title": "When they laughed at rape", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/shutterstock_85655041.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Matthew Rozsa", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, College, Rape, Rape Culture, The Good Men Project", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1839\"", "article_summary": "Topics: College, Rape, Rape Culture, The Good Men Project, Life News, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on The Good Men ProjectEvery so often, a single experience will instantaneously illuminate an aspect of the human condition to a person who had previously failed to viscerally grasp it.\nAfter taking a moment to think about it, I replied, \u201cWell, as those of you who followed Gamergate last year have already seen, female writers frequently receive rape threats.\nMany of the women I personally know in the industry get rape threats all the time, even when they\u2019re not writing about video games or gender-related topics.\nWhen the term \u201crape culture\u201d is used, it is because of occasions like this, wherein the concept of a woman being raped is easy to understand but the notion of a man having the same experience is literally scoffed at.\nAs a man who has never gotten a rape threat \u2026\u201d\u2666\u25ca\u2666Before I could finish that thought, a chuckle rippled throughout the room."}
