Showstopper promotes 50 dance contests a year and calls itself the largest organization of its kind in the world.\n\nDance Carousel owner Lori Matta was thrilled with her students\u2019 award-winning performances.\n\n\u201cI am proud of each and every one of my students,\u201d Matta said. \u201cI call them my kids. They are amazing, really, since the little girls dance only one and a half hours a week and the big girls only three hours a week. None of them need a trophy to define who they are.\u201d\n\nWinners included: Kendall Gaudens, second place overall for teen performance solo; Jacelyn Shissler, first place overall, junior performance solo; and Amayah Giles, 10th place overall in teen performance solo.\n\nDancers Faith Brown, Jessica Girod and Vaviel Verner won first place overall in senior performance by a duet or trio, regional top 10 overall, gold trophies and the coveted judge\u2019s award. The Dance Carousel itself received a double platinum award for excellence, four platinum awards and two gold awards.\n\nThe stellar performance qualifies the dancers to compete at the Showstopper national finals in either Myrtle Beach, S.C., Anaheim, Calif. or Galveston, Texas this summer, Matta does not know if they will be able to go because of the costs.\n\nRegardless if they go to the finals, the dancers, \u201chave already proven they have talent,\u201d Matta said.\n\n\u201cWhat is of greater importance is the amount of confidence and focus they have personally gained through their dance experience that will benefit them throughout their lives.\u201d\n\nThe Dance Carousel is located at 402 W. Ball St. The studio\u2019s telephone number is (813) 659-9100.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 24 May 2014 06:32:00 -0400", "Description": "PLANT CITY Youngsters from a local dance center recently took top honors at a statewide competition.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "PLANT CITY Youngsters from a local dance center recently took top honors at a statewide competition.", "title": "Local dance studio takes trophies and honors at state competition", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/plant-city/local-dance-studio-takes-trophies-and-honors-at-state-competition-20140524/", "image": {"width": 1923, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140524/ARTICLE/140529749/EP/1/1/EP-140529749.jpg", "height": 2000}, "updated_time": "2014-05-22T15:09:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "PLANT CITY Youngsters from a local dance center recently took top honors at a statewide competition.", "title": "Local dance studio takes trophies and honors at state competition", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140524/ARTICLE/140529749/AR/0/AR-140529749.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-05-24T06:32:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-05-22T15:09:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b12\"", "article_summary": "None of them need a trophy to define who they are.\u201dWinners included: Kendall Gaudens, second place overall for teen performance solo; Jacelyn Shissler, first place overall, junior performance solo; and Amayah Giles, 10th place overall in teen performance solo.\nThe Dance Carousel itself received a double platinum award for excellence, four platinum awards and two gold awards.\nDancers from the Dance Carousel competed against dozens of dancers from studios around Florida at the Showstopper contest.\nPLANT CITY Youngsters from a local dance center recently took top honors at a statewide competition.\nDance Carousel owner Lori Matta was thrilled with her students\u2019 award-winning performances."}
