Threnhauser & Cody Brumgard| May 8, 2015\n\nAlmost 37 million Americans (about 70% of all Medicare beneficiaries) have their prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D. This is the federal program that subsidizes the cost of prescription drugs and premiums for prescription drug plans for Medicare beneficiaries. Of the 37 million, 23 million are enrolled in prescription drug plans (PDPs) and 14 million in Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (MA-DP plans). The remaining 30% of Medicare beneficiaries without Part D coverage either receive prescription drug benefits from another source (retiree benefits, employer-sponsored plans, TRICARE, etc.), or they do not have any type of prescription drug coverage (see The Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Fact Sheet).\n\nOne unintended result of the creation of the Medicare Part D plans in 2006 is the \u201cdoughnut hole.\u201d This is the amount of money that an individual has to pay between the Medicare Part D coverage limit on prescription drug benefits and the Medicare Part D \u201ccatastrophic coverage\u201d threshold. After the beneficiary qualifies for catastrophic coverage, they only pay a small coinsurance or copayment for drugs that are covered for the rest of the year.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because almost all beneficiaries who receive coverage under Part D are affected by the doughnut hole, and beneficiaries expect their health care professionals and care managers to be able to explain to them how the system works and what they are expected to pay for prescriptions. So, how does Medicare Part D coverage work for beneficiaries?\n\nThe Deductible Phase \u2013 The beneficiary pays out-of-pocket for Part D prescription drug plan premiums, and 100% of the prescription drug costs until the plan deductible is met. Between 2005 and 2014, the limit on Medicare Part D plan deductibles was $310. For 2015, the limit on Medicare Part D plan deductibles is $320. The Coinsurance Phase \u2013 Once the deductible is met, the beneficiary pays 25% of the drug costs, while the Part D prescription drug plan covers the remaining 75% \u2013 until the beneficiary reaches the prescription drug coverage limit. Between 2006 and 2014, the coverage limit ranged from a low of $2,250 in 2006 to a high of $2,970 in 2013. For 2015, the coverage limit is $2,960. The Doughnut Hole Phase \u2013 The beneficiaries are now in the Medicare Part D coverage gap \u2013 the doughnut hole. Prior to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), once in the doughnut hole, beneficiaries were responsible for the full cost of prescription drugs until they reach a yearly out-of-pocket (OOP) spending maximum. In an attempt to reduce this coverage gap and reduce out-of-pocket spending for beneficiaries, PPACA gradually moves the coverage gap costs to be shared by the beneficiary, the health plans, and the drug manufacturers. The end goal is that by 2020, beneficiaries will be responsible for only 25% of the costs for brand name and generic drugs \u2013 effectively closing the doughnut hole. Between 2006 and 2014, the yearly OOP maximum on spending to qualify for catastrophic coverage ranged from a low of $3,600 in 2006 to a high of $4,750 in 2013. For 2015, the yearly OOP maximum on spending to qualify for catastrophic coverage is $4,700. The Catastrophic Coverage Phase \u2013 After this maximum spending limit is reached, the beneficiary is eligible to receive benefits again through catastrophic coverage. Catastrophic coverage assures that an individual pays a smaller amount of their prescription drug costs \u2013 usually about 5% of the costs.\n\nThe Medicare doughnut hole coverage gap applies to all Part D beneficiaries (including those with mental health issues) \u2014 except for a small group that may qualify for exemptions. The Extra Help or Low-Income Subsidy (LIS), a program designed to help beneficiaries with limited income and resources cover like premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance. To qualify, beneficiaries must have a yearly income below $17,655 ($23,895 for a married couple), and have less than $13,640 in assets ($27,250 for a married couple) (see Medicare: Save on Drug Costs). For beneficiaries in the Extra Help program, Medicare may cover between 85% and 100% of the prescription drug costs and may also include $0 monthly premiums depending on the state\u2019s plan. Additionally, low income individuals who are dually eligible for Medicaid may also receive assistance from their state to cover prescription drug costs to supplement Medicare coverage.\n\nFor a reference guide to this topic, check out What Are The Rules Of The Medicare Doughnut Hole?: An OPEN MINDS Market Intelligence Report.
