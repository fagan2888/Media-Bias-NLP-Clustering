Some of the archaic things we do.\u201d\n\nOn his list is an automatic system to review government inefficiencies, a review of the House committee structure, a more efficient Senate and House schedule, and changes to the budget process. \u201cIs the committee structure we came up with in 1994, and before that in the \u201950s, really what\u2019s best today?\u201d McCarthy asked Politico. \u201cMaybe, but you don\u2019t know. We should audit them. Accountability matters.\u201d\n\nBy systematically identifying and removing inefficiencies, streamlining the two chambers schedules and maybe reworking the committee process, McCarthy hopes to restore voters faith in the congressional process and address the frustration he has sensed with President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of Obamacare, Ebola and the various scandals of the past few years.\n\nA central part of the vision is getting fiscal cliffs and government spending bills out of the way, so Congress can focus on other legislative issues. He hopes a long term funding bill is passed in the lame duck session. \u201cIf we are fortunate to have both majorities, take away any cliff you can have hanging out there,\u201d McCarthy told Politico. \u201cIf you have a cliff, it takes attention away.\u201d\n\nAnd rather than budget every year, he thinks Congress should budget every two years. He also wants to reform the Congressional Budget Office so it looks at a longer-term impact of legislation \u2014 about every 20 years instead of 10. \u201cThe budget act is the Budget Act of 1974,\u201d he told Politico. \u201cDoes the world look like it did in \u201974?\u201d\n\nSome outside experts agree.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely critical that legislation is scored over a longer time-horizon than 10 years,\u201d Heritage Foundation budget economist Romina Boccia told The Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cAs we are learning first hand now with Obamacare, 10-year scores are too easily manipulated and can hide the most important fiscal impacts of major policy changes.\u201d\n\nBut the two year budget would hurt more than it might help, she said. \u201cA two-year budget cycle might well exacerbate problems in the current process and would undoubtedly give occasion to yet more frequent requests for supplemental spending \u2014 inflating spending and the deficit in the process.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s plan is of course contingent on Republicans controlling the House and the Senate next year, but he\u2019s confident that will happen. But he told a group of donors recently that if Republicans don\u2019t prove they can govern, \u201cthere won\u2019t be a Republican president in 2016.\u201d\n\nNew York Rep. Steve Israel, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman, called McCarthy\u2019s plan \u201claughable\u201d in a statement Monday. \u201cRepublicans have spent the past four years pledging to change-to reach out to women and minorities, to develop a real agenda that focuses on jobs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut in reality, all they\u2019ve done is retreat further into their out-of-touch, insulated Tea Party echo chamber, shut down the government and continue to protect wealthy special interests at the expense of middle class families. Americans are tired of their empty promises, and won\u2019t be fooled again.\u201d\n\nFollow Rachel on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
