Biberacher and colleagues hope that by illuminating a potential early biomarker of MS their paper will help launch a number of new research efforts. \u201cThis finding also demonstrates that the antibody development to the KIR4.1 protein, a protein found in some people with MS, precedes the clinical onset of disease suggesting a role of the autoantibody in how the disease develops,\" Biberacher explained.\n\nFor their investigation, the team surveyed 32 former blood donors: 16 who were later diagnosed with MS, and 16 who remained healthy. All participants were of the same sex and in the same age cohort. The researchers looked at antibody levels in blood samples collected up to six years before the onset of MS symptoms.\n\nBiberacher and colleagues found that, while none of the non-MS participants showed signs of the KIR4.1 antibody, nearly half of the MS participants tested positive. The antibodies appeared to be present in the bloodstream several years before the first clinical attack.\n\nTowards Earlier MS Diagnosis\n\nMS is typically classified as an autoimmune disorder \u2014 a debilitating condition that turns the body\u2019s own defenses against its most essential parts. Rogue T cells begin to erode myelin, the protective sheath that covers nerves. The subsequent degeneration disrupts communications between essential organs, which eventually results in irreparable nerve damage.\n\nToday, an estimated 400,000 Americans have MS. Although there\u2019s no known cure, an earlier diagnosis may limit the disease's impact on a patient\u2019s everyday life. \"The next step is to confirm these findings in larger groups and determine how many years before onset of disease the antibody response develops,\" Biberacher told reporters.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ms, multiple sclerosis, antibody, biomarker, autoimmune disorder, viola biberacher, blood test for multiple sclerosis", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An antibody in the bloodstream could help physicians diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) several years before symptoms appear, a new study finds.", "title": "Catch MS Years Before Symptoms Develop", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/test-may-catch-ms-years-symptoms-develop-antibody-bloodstream-could-represent-early-biomaker-269951", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/23/blood-sample.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An antibody in the bloodstream could help physicians diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) several years before symptoms appear, a new study finds.", "title": "Catch MS Years Before Symptoms Develop", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/test-may-catch-ms-years-symptoms-develop-antibody-bloodstream-could-represent-early-biomaker-269951", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/23/blood-sample.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/23/blood-sample.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-02-23T14:54:57-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-23T14:54:56-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An antibody in the bloodstream could help physicians diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) several years before symptoms appear, a new study finds."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdedab\"", "article_summary": "The researchers looked at antibody levels in blood samples collected up to six years before the onset of MS symptoms.\nAn antibody in the bloodstream could help physicians diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) several years before symptoms appear, a new study finds.\nBiberacher and colleagues found that, while none of the non-MS participants showed signs of the KIR4.1 antibody, nearly half of the MS participants tested positive.\nNew research shows that a certain antibody associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) may be present in some patients\u2019 blood years before symptoms develop, raising the possibility of effective screening protocols and preventative therapy.\nBiberacher and colleagues hope that by illuminating a potential early biomarker of MS their paper will help launch a number of new research efforts."}
