She gave her medication to quell her anxiety, and they rehearsed opening her mouth wide.\n\nBut at the dental clinic, Violeta Anderson refused to cooperate. Ada Anderson tried calming her mother by singing and rubbing her leg. Then she tried bribing her with crackers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d Ada Anderson told her mother, who has dementia. \u201cWe have to know what\u2019s happening with your teeth so you don\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nIn the end, dentistry professor Roseann Mulligan and her students at the University of Southern California dental school were able to get one X-ray during the two-hour visit. They couldn\u2019t do a clinical exam. Mulligan, who specializes in geriatric care, suggested that Anderson be partially sedated next time.\n\nGood dental hygiene is important to overall health, and chronic illnesses and medications can worsen oral health. Yet providing dental care to seniors such as Violeta Anderson is fraught with challenges. According to the American Dental Association, a fifth of people age 75 and older haven\u2019t seen a dentist in the past five years.\n\nMany older patients are resistant because of fear or years of neglect \u2013 or they have impaired cognitive skills and don\u2019t understand the need. Others are not mobile enough to get to a dental office.\n\n\u201cThere are layers upon layers that can make it very difficult,\u201d said Susan Hyde, division chair of oral epidemiology and dental public health at University of California at San Francisco School of Dentistry.\n\nOlder patients also may have arthritis or a history of strokes. \u201cThey can\u2019t take care of their own teeth and are prone to tooth decay and subject to pain,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cIt becomes very complicated.\u201d\n\nEven for patients eager for care, paying for it can be a problem.\n\nMedicare, which covers medical care for people 65 and older, doesn\u2019t include routine dental care, and many seniors lose coverage through other insurance plans when they retire. Medicaid, the insurance program for low-income Americans, doesn\u2019t require states to provide it to adults. Only 15 states offer a comprehensive dental benefit to Medicaid recipients, according to the nonprofit Center for Health Care Strategies. California recently reinstated fuller dental services for adults, and Virginia and DC offer limited dental services.\n\nNursing homes are required to do a dental screening and help residents with oral hygiene, but dentists say that doesn\u2019t always happen.\n\n\u201cYou have people who have maintained their oral health their entire lives, only to see it go down the tubes in six to eight months,\u201d said Judith Jones, a professor at Boston University\u2019s dental school and elder-care spokeswoman for the American Dental Association.\n\nPoor oral hygiene and care can lead to infection, the inability to eat and a loss of dignity, Jones said. And the bacteria that cause gum disease can increase the risk of coronary heart disease, aneurysms and other health problems, research shows.\n\nSome efforts are underway to ensure that all elderly patients get access to high-quality dental care, though dentists say it won\u2019t be easy. The Senate has proposed including oral-health screenings in its re-authorization of the Older Americans Act, which helps pay for nutrition and social services for low-income seniors. This spring two bills were introduced in Congress that would expand coverage to adults without dental insurance.\n\nOne, introduced in February by Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Democrat running for president, would extend dental coverage to all Medicare and Medicaid recipients, increase funding for oral health services at health clinics and create an oral health professional student loan program. The other, introduced in January by Rep. Robin Kelly (D, Illinois), would allow organizations to get federal grants to improve oral health education and expand outreach programs to under-served communities, including the elderly and disabled.\n\nMulligan, the USC professor, said coverage for dental care is just as necessary as it is for it is for medical care. But Violeta Anderson, who has diabetes and high blood pressure, doesn\u2019t have dental insurance. She gets treatment because she is lucky enough to have a daughter who can pay for it.\n\nThe Center for Oral Health, a California-based nonprofit, is conducting a two-year assessment in California to determine the extent of dental problems among seniors. Preliminary results show that 38 percent of residents of California\u2019s long-term-care facilities don\u2019t have any of their original teeth. Nearly half of those with at least one tooth had untreated decay. And about 1 in 7 needed urgent care.\n\nVioleta Anderson was given an oral sedative to help her relax before her dental appointment.

The American Dental Association recently started offering online training, and dental schools are also making an effort to train students. Mulligan, for example, recently founded an online master\u2019s degree program for dentists interested in geriatric care.\n\nNazanin Sharifi, a Los Angeles area dentist who is in the program, said she wanted to specialize after caring for her father, who had Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cI saw how he suffered,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know how to brush his teethor even say he was in pain.\u201d\n\nIn San Francisco, all dental students at the University of the Pacific\u2019s dental school spend time at On Lok Lifeways, an organization that serves elderly people who would otherwise need nursing home\n\ncare.\n\nOne morning in October, Elisa Chavez, a professor at the school, supervised two students as they treated patients. Chavez said that until they do a rotation in geriatric dental care, many of her students haven\u2019t thought about the specific challenges. \u201cWhen you have patients who have lots of medical issues, it can be intimidating,\u201d she said.\n\nThe patients who visited the On Lok dental clinic that day all had some form of dementia. They spoke three different languages \u2013 Korean, Tagalog and Cantonese. All had missing teeth and health problems, including diabetes, a history of strokes, high blood pressure and kidney disease.\n\nOne 95-year-old patient had to be told several different ways to close his mouth so the team could take X-rays. Another, 82, had bone loss and signs of an infection but refused X-rays and a cleaning.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story at the University of the Pacific dental school. Paul Subar, a professor there, said some elderly patients may need to come five or six times before dentists can do a procedure.\n\nBut the patience can pay off. Just ask Anthony Vanderhorst. After nearly a year of care, Vanderhorst, with a history of liver disease, a stroke and deteriorating teeth, recently walked out sporting a new set a dentures.\n\nThe 64-year old, who doesn\u2019t have dental insurance, told Subar that he was happy to look normal and play the trumpet again. And he was grateful for treatment he otherwise could not afford.\n\n\u201cThe school was my only alternative,\u201d Vanderhorst said, \u201cor else I wouldn\u2019t have any teeth in my mouth.\u201d\n\nThis KHN story also ran in The Washington Post.
