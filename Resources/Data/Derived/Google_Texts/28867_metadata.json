The global figure stood at $307.2 billion so far this year, over 2014\u2019s $283.9 billion, it said.\n\nPrivate equity traditionally hasn\u2019t been particularly interested in pharmaceutical deals, except for generic pharmaceuticals, where they can skip the uncertainties surrounding new drugs\u2019 development and commercial launch and go straight to having a stable source of recurring revenue.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean they are sitting on the sidelines.\n\nPharmaceutical outsourcing services and contract manufacturing have been private equity\u2019s inroad, particularly in tapping underserved small and midsize pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies.\n\nGreat Point Partners last month made a 7.4-times return from the sale of Cytovance Biologics to Hepalink USA for $205.7 million, a person familiar with the situation told LBO Wire. Cytovance, which manufactures proteins and antibodies for use in clinical trials by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, not only is the best-performing portfolio from Great Point\u2019s $156 million debut pool, but it also returned \u201cnearly half of the fund,\u201d the person said.\n\nAnd Nautic Partners in September sold clinical services provider Theorem Clinical Research Inc. to U.K.-based contract research organization Chiltern International Inc. Theorem conducts early-phase, Phase II, Phase III, and late-phase clinical trials for pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device and diagnostic customers.\n\nOne company up for grabs is PCI Pharma Services, which owners Frazier Healthcare Partners, Thomas McNerney & Partners and two other investors are planning to put up for sale in a deal that may value the Philadelphia company at more than $1 billion, , people familiar with the situation told LBO Wire. PCI, also backed by Greenspring Associates and Australia\u2019s QIC Global Private Equity, has its roots in pharmaceutical packaging, but has since expanded into pharmaceutical development, clinical trial manufacturing, clinical planning support, commercial manufacturing, and packaging and medication serialization.\n\nWrite to Amy Or at amy.or@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Private equity firms are tapping opportunities in drug development and production through outsourcing services", "title": "Buyout Firms Find Pharmaceutical Opportunities in Outsourcing", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/11/04/buyout-firms-find-pharmaceutical-opportunities-in-outsourcing/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LC324_Pills1_P_20151104124143.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Buyout Firms Find Pharmaceutical Opportunities in Outsourcing", "description": "Private equity firms are tapping opportunities in drug development and production through outsourcing services", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Amy Or", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Private equity firms are tapping opportunities in drug development and production through outsourcing services", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-11-04T21:00:24-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/11/04/buyout-firms-find-pharmaceutical-opportunities-in-outsourcing/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-19188", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Private equity firms are tapping opportunities in drug development and production through outsourcing services", "title": "Buyout Firms Find Pharmaceutical Opportunities in Outsourcing", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/11/04/buyout-firms-find-pharmaceutical-opportunities-in-outsourcing/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LC324_Pills1_P_20151104124143.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-19188", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-11-04T18:45:15-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Pharmaceutical outsourcing services and contract manufacturing have been private equity\u2019s inroad, particularly in tapping underserved small and midsize pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies.\nReutersPrivate equity firms are mostly sitting out the consolidation activities in the pharmaceutical industry, but they are tapping opportunities in drug development and production through outsourcing services.\nPCI, also backed by Greenspring Associates and Australia\u2019s QIC Global Private Equity, has its roots in pharmaceutical packaging, but has since expanded into pharmaceutical development, clinical trial manufacturing, clinical planning support, commercial manufacturing, and packaging and medication serialization.\nData provider Dealogic said there has been a record $251.2 billion worth of pharmaceutical deals in the U.S. so far this year, topping the $202.8 billion for all of last year.\nThe global figure stood at $307.2 billion so far this year, over 2014\u2019s $283.9 billion, it said."}
