(Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nLoveland Classical Schools has hired the nonprofit group You Can Live History for the past three years to offer students a living lesson in history. The Aurora company brings costumes, teaches the students and orchestrates a ball and a battle reenactment after school and on the weekend.\n\nAny students who wants to can participate. The cost is borne by the parents; however, for those who can't afford the cost, there are scholarships provided through donations and fundraising, so no one is left out.\n\nThe school and the company transformed a field, west of Loveland, into several locations around Sharpsburg, MD, on Saturday and filmed several battles that occurred on Sept. 17, 1862, as well as events that led up to the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest single day of the Civil War.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmoke filled the field as the Confederate and Union soldiers - in this case young students - squared off and let sparks fly from their weapons. Row after row of bodies fell.\n\nAnd that is what happened during the many battles of the Civil War - sons, fathers, brothers and uncles died or were injured from muskets, bayonets and even canon fire.\n\n\"There were 23,000 casualties,\" said Kathy Miller, history teacher who organized the event. \"It was horrible and bloody.\"\n\nThis particular battle was the first time Gen. Robert E. Lee brought his soldiers into Union territory during the war between two sides of a young country, fractured over the issue of slavery.\n\nThe union commander, George B. McClellan, thought he had a leg up because his side discovered Lee's plans written on cigars, according to Miller. However, in the time the man spent planning his attack, a southern sympathizer alerted Lee of the found plans, and in a surprise to the Union Army, the Confederate Army altered its plans, according to Miller.\n\nThe battles were intense and bloody on a single day around Sharpsburg. Eventually, the south retreated, changing the course of the war, Miller said.\n\nTheir retreat is thought to have kept European countries from siding with the south and bringing in allied troops and boosted the north enough that President Abraham Lincoln soon gave the Emancipation Proclamation that freed the slaves, Miller said.\n\nThe students, she said, are learning this history in a unique and memorable way, experiencing a small sliver of what these soldiers went through during the war.\n\nThe battles and weapons are not real, but the lessons are, as are the experience of spending all day on your feet in different kinds of weather, hiding in bushes and trees as well as squaring off in dirt and grass, fighting until someone falls.\n\n\"It's hot and you're tired, but by the end of the day, you want to do it all over again,\" said Miller, who has participated all three years.\n\nJoining her on the battlefield those same three years, for the Confederate side, was 14-year-old Wyatt Swanson, who said he loved the \"real life experience.\"\n\n\"It's not just studying it in a textbook,\" he said. \"You get to experience what it was like in their shoes.\"\n\nPamela Johnson: 970-669-5050, ext. 526, johnsonp@reporter-herald.com, www.twitter.com/RHPamelaJ.", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-05-02T13:59:09-0600", "modificationDate": "2015-05-02T20:32:17-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0502/20150502__03RHACivilw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Pamela Johnson \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "An army of school kids walked in the shoes of Union and Confederate soldiers Saturday during a Civil war re-enactment held west of Loveland.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:28036086:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0502/20150502__03RHACivilw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An army of school kids walked in the shoes of Union and Confederate soldiers Saturday during a Civil war re-enactment held west of Loveland.", "title": "Students relive Civil War battle"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "An army of school kids walked in the shoes of Union and Confederate soldiers Saturday during a Civil war re-enactment held west of Loveland.", "title": "Students relive Civil War battle", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0502/20150502__03RHACivilw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-02T13:59:09-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "sailthru.title": "Students relive Civil War battle", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Pamela JohnsonReporter-Herald", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0502/20150502__03RHACivilw~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-05-02T14:08:30-0600", "news_keywords": "News, News news, Loveland Colorado News news, Loveland Colorado news, News Loveland news, News Colorado news, US News news, world News news."}, "article_summary": "Loveland Classical School students, dressed as Confederate soldiers and Union soldiers, reenact an attack, which is part of the Battle of Antietam, during the Civil War on Saturday west of Loveland.\nLoveland Classical students hit the battlefieldAn army of school kids walked in the shoes of Union and Confederate soldiers Saturday.\nEventually, the south retreated, changing the course of the war, Miller said.\nAdvertisementSmoke filled the field as the Confederate and Union soldiers - in this case young students - squared off and let sparks fly from their weapons.\nThe Aurora company brings costumes, teaches the students and orchestrates a ball and a battle reenactment after school and on the weekend."}
