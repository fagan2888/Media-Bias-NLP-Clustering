The White House also predicts there will likely be an increase in air pollution and airborne allergens, which could worsen allergies and asthma. Increased temperatures are expected to lead to \u201cthousands to tens of thousands of additional premature deaths per year across the United States by the end of this century,\u201d according to the report. However, the U.S. population has become less sensitive to heat than in the past through advancements such as increased access to air conditioning and health care.\n\nThe White House also predicts illness, such as lyme disease and salmonella will increase as temperatures increase and seasonal weather patterns change. Extreme weather such as hurricanes and tornados could lead to trauma and cause distress, grief and behavioral health disorders.\n\nThe White House used the findings to support the Obama administration\u2019s actions to reduce emissions and increase renewable energy to combat climate change.\n\n\u201cAlready, under President Obama\u2019s leadership, the United States has done more to combat climate change and protect the health of communities than ever before,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cFor example, the Clean Power Plan will deliver better air quality, improved public health, clean energy investment and jobs across the country. Since the historic global climate agreement was reached at COP21 in Paris last year, the United States has announced plans to not only implement the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but has also committed to adopting an amendment to the Montreal Protocol that would phase down HFCs, a potent greenhouse gas.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "The effects\u00a0of climate change are expected to have negative impacts on human health, according to data released Monday by the White House.
