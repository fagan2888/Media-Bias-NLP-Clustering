Others have testified that the label would remind doctors to \u201cremind the patient about the importance of continuing his or her portion\u201d of payments to their health insurance plan.\n\nThe coalition of physicians in support of the bill would have us believe that citizens who receive subsidies for their insurance are financially irresponsible freeloaders who don\u2019t pay their bills, but that simply isn\u2019t the case. Over 91 percent of Americans who have signed up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act have remained up to date on their premium payments.\n\nCritics of the bill have pointed out that one doctor\u2019s reminder could be another\u2019s rejection, arguing that the label could create a \u201cscarlet letter\u201d effect in which doctors turn away patients whose insurance cards indicate that they are receiving a subsidy. While doctors are prohibited from turning patients away based on the type of insurance they have, public health advocates in Texas have interpreted doctors\u2019 arguments in favor of the bill as an indication that that\u2019s exactly what they intend to do.\n\nAs Jose E. Camacho, executive director of the Texas Association of Community Health Centers said, quoted by the Texas Tribune, \u201cOther than creating a group that you\u2019re going to discriminate against, I don\u2019t see any purpose for indicating that people are getting a subsidy.\u201d\n\nThis bill is the latest in a long line of attempts in Texas to make it harder for citizens in the state to afford their health coverage. The state has refused to expand Medicaid, and is a cosignatory of the lawsuit brought forward in King v. Burwell the Supreme Court case deciding whether a typo in the Affordable Care Act invalidates health insurance plans purchased through federal exchanges. If the plaintiffs in King are successful, HB 1514 will be unnecessary because such a ruling would invalidate Affordable Care Act subsidies for all 1.75 million Texans currently receiving them.\n\nTexas\u2019s efforts to deny its own citizens health coverage is even less acceptable given how little financial sense they make from the point of view of, well, Texas\u2019s state government. 30 percent of Texans are obese, 19 percent smoke and 24 percent are projected to have diabetes by 2040. Texans already spend more on health care than citizens in all but two states, California and New York, and that\u2019s only going to go up as those obesity, smoking and diabetes rates take their toll.\n\nAnd just because those citizens aren\u2019t insured doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be consuming health care. When citizens need healthcare and can\u2019t pay for it, their costs are passed on to everyone else in the state. That means higher premiums for every Texan.\n\nIn other words, if there were ever a state that stood to gain by getting its citizens on private health insurance plans, that state would be Texas. In spite of this, Texas has the highest uninsured rate in the country, and is doing everything it can to keep it that way.\n\nStigmatizing consumers who signed up for their coverage via the Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t help anyone, with the possible exception of Republican state legislators who need to sponsor three anti-Obamacare bills each term in order to avoid an Americans for Prosperity-sponsored primary challenge.\n\nFingers crossed that the bill dies in the Senate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas's House passed a bill last week that would add a label to the health insurance cards of citizens who receive Obamacare subsidies.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "AMERICAblog News", "description": "Texas's House passed a bill last week that would add a label to the health insurance cards of citizens who receive Obamacare subsidies.", "title": "Texas bill would label citizens who receive Obamacare subsidies - AMERICAblog News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/healthinsurance.jpg", "height": 500}, "updated_time": "2015-05-12T12:23:12-04:00", "url": "http://americablog.com/2015/05/texas-bill-would-label-citizens-who-receive-obamacare-subsidies.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Texas's House passed a bill last week that would add a label to the health insurance cards of citizens who receive Obamacare subsidies.", "creator": "@_Jon_Green", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/healthinsurance.jpg", "title": "Texas bill would label citizens who receive Obamacare subsidies - AMERICAblog News", "site": "@americablog", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "p": {"domain_verify": "6a65cadbb06b6a8cd2795a412c36d6b4"}, "fb": {"admins": 504024627}, "google-site-verification": "LrdwJVMR_suty6YsOZ4xc1Hv3-F8Ms0Wo-VhCAoXm_U", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AMERICAblog", "section": "News", "tag": "Texas", "published_time": "2015-05-12T12:00:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-12T12:23:12-04:00"}, "news_keywords": "ACA, health insurance, Obamacare, premiums, Texas"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb047\"", "article_summary": "If the plaintiffs in King are successful, HB 1514 will be unnecessary because such a ruling would invalidate Affordable Care Act subsidies for all 1.75 million Texans currently receiving them.\nOver 91 percent of Americans who have signed up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act have remained up to date on their premium payments.\nAnd just because those citizens aren\u2019t insured doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be consuming health care.\nIn other words, if there were ever a state that stood to gain by getting its citizens on private health insurance plans, that state would be Texas.\nOthers have testified that the label would remind doctors to \u201cremind the patient about the importance of continuing his or her portion\u201d of payments to their health insurance plan."}
