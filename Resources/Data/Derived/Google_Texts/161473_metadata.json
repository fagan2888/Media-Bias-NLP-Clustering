(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nSometimes it seems every businessman these days wants to be like the founder of Uber.\n\nTake Sean Murphy, 35, an electrician-entrepreneur in Winchester, Va.\n\nMurphy owns tiny Murphy Family Electric. But he has big ideas \u2014 and a new app called SuperHandy, with which he hopes to turn his company into the Uber of home services. Electrical. Plumbing. Cleaning. Even fitness coaches.\n\nThe app works like Uber. You set your location and press \u201cStart Job.\u201d It sends a request to the nearest Super helper, known as a \u201cpro.\u201d If the helper \u2014 pre-screened by Murphy \u2014 accepts, he or she will call you to discuss the job. When the helper arrives, he or she presses \u201cI have arrived.\u201d There is still no charge. Once both parties have agreed on the job, the pro presses the app and the clock starts ticking.\n\nThe fees can range from 25 cents per minute for a basic pro to help with a household chore to around $2 a minute for a skilled tradesman, such as an electrician. Up-front fees can range from $5 to $50, depending on the type of service.\n\nThe app created by Sean Murphy, right, launched an Uber-like app that lets people hire home-service professionals and tradesmen such as electrician Dan Gonzalez, right. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThe app, which includes a cost estimator, is designed to be an affordable, convenient way to handle home tasks, Murphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s this new movement. The \u2018share\u2019 movement. People are starting to share their cars, their homes.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if Super is going to work, and my writing about it doesn\u2019t endorse the product. But Murphy\u2019s aspirations reflect one of the latest in a growing tide of small \u2014 but sometimes long-standing \u2014 businesses trying to get in front of the digital curve to prevent getting marginalized. It is happening in media, hospitality, taxis, groceries \u2014 you name it.\n\nAnd now home-improvement. Amazon.com launched a home services platform earlier this year that combines purchases with installation experts. The business is in at least 15 cities across the United States. There are other disrupters, such as Porch.com, Pro.com and Taskrabbit.com, crowding into similar spaces.\n\n\u201cHome improvement is wanting to figure out how to look like Uber,\u201d said Kermit Baker of the Remodeling Futures Program at Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies.\n\nMurphy already owns and has spent the past seven years building a conventional electrical repair company that services the Washington area.\n\nHe makes a comfortable living from Murphy Family Electric. It grosses about $500,000 and has a receptionist and two electricians, in addition to himself.\n\nBut like many would-be entrepreneurs, he thinks service-on-demand models that go directly to the customers are essential to survival.\n\n\u201cWe either get involved, share time and space with others, or become extinct,\u201d said Murphy, who is using his traditional electrical business to finance the new app.\n\nHe estimates that he has spent about $100,000 so far on building his app business.\n\nMurphy may be an advocate for the share movement, but sharing the app has been the challenge up to now.\n\nSuper was launched about a year ago and so far has 400 downloads from customers. About 500 pros \u2014 from electricians to trainers to towing companies \u2014 have signed up to be general contractors. They get 80 percent of each job; Murphy takes 20 percent.\n\nSome of the money he has used to launch the project has gone toward screening his pros, each of whom is an independent contractor. He checks identity and criminal records. He also looks at their experience level to make sure they can do the job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an approach that may work for home service, which is mow my lawn, blow the leaves, put on a storm window. Simple, straightforward projects,\u201d said Harvard\u2019s Baker. \u201cAn app to do kitchen remodeling is much more complicated.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that there are a lot of bugs that are going to have to be worked out of this system before it works the way it is designed to work.\u201d\n\nJust last week, one customer declined to pay after tying up one of Murphy\u2019s contractors for three hours. One customer accused Super of stealing a headlamp. The pro had to call and tell him where it was. Murphy is even in a squabble over the rights to the Super name.\n\nSuper\u2019s gross revenue for the first year is less than $20,000 through the app, which shows how difficult it is to get customers to take the first step and give their credit card information to the app.\n\nMurphy has been noodling around in the space for a few years. He started one app he called Event Locator, which found parties through social media. It failed. There was also an event ticketing platform that failed.\n\nHe even started an anti-aging skin-care company. Kaput!\n\nMurphy got the idea for Super after using Uber for a London pub crawl with his fiancee.\n\n\u201cI loved the app, so I thought, \u2018Why isn\u2019t there something like this for electricians and handymen?\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nHe contacted engineers overseas who had built his previous apps and sent them instructions on what he wanted. His fledgling business was soon off and running.\n\nMurphy started learning the electrical trade at 14, doing simple jobs for his father, who owns an electrical company in Oregon.\n\nAfter graduating from Christendom College in Front Royal, he lived out of his Ford Focus while studying for a master\u2019s degree in theology and doing electrical work.\n\nHe showered at a gym. He slept in the car in spots near Interstate 66 and in Tysons Corner. At one point, while working on a job at the Department of the Interior, he would arrive at 5 a.m. near the Washington Monument to get street parking spots and then pay a hot dog concessionaire to feed the meter all day.\n\nEventually, he decided to hang his own shingle. He named his sole proprietorship Murphy Family Electric. (There was already a Murphy Electric.) He used $3,000 in savings to buy his first ad in the Yellow Pages.\n\nHe grossed $30,000 the first year, 2007, much of it from word of mouth, friends and contacts he made doing electrical jobs. He kept to residential repair jobs because his father advised him the profit margins were superior to construction work.\n\nAfter about a year, he moved the business to Fairfax County to expand and charge more. He made his first hire around that time.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do the business side,\u201d he says, so he learned Mint, a bookkeeping program.\n\nHe quickly caught on to the possibilities of selling through the Internet, at one time paying a technology expert $75 an hour to teach him how to get his company more online notice.\n\nMurphy liked the creative side, but sometimes he was too creative. \u201cWe were blackhatting,\u201d he admits, referring to techniques that some use to game the online advertising world.\n\nAlong the way, he has bought and repaired a couple of homes. He now lives comfortably in Winchester with his wife, who runs a hair-styling business.\n\nAfter living out of his car and building a successful business, he\u2019s not afraid to take a risk pursuing his Uber-like idea. \u201cThe hard part is right now . . . getting people to use the app.\u201d\n\nSounds like he could use a marketer.\n\nAfter this story published, Murphy changed the name of his app to SuperHandy.
