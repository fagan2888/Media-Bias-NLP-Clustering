The move boosts Illinois Health and Scienceâ€™s development of a new, high-capacity radiopharmaceutical production facility in Indianapolis, through its company Zevacor Molecular.

Illinois Health and Science is the parent company of Decatur Memorial Hospital, a regional not-for-profit hospital with over $900 million in revenue.
