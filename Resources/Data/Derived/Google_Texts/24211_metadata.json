The Corrections Corporation of America operates the facility for profit, adding fuel to an already roaring fire of opposition.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile President Obama\u2019s expanded deportation relief is a welcome move\u2014the truth is that without addressing immigration detention, immigrants will continue to suffer horrifying conditions in detention centers.\n\nCurrent U.S. legislation is read by some members of Congress to require that at least 34,000 immigrants be held in detention beds at all times at a cost of $2 billion annually. This would mean that tens of thousands of immigrants will continue to be detained every year even if others are granted reprieve from deportation.\n\nThat\u2019s why executive action by the president on deportations should be accompanied by closing inhumane facilities like Stewart and ending the bed quota once and for all. Alternatives to detention are effective, much less costly, and far more humane than institutional detention.\n\nResistance inside Stewart has grown at the same time as external pressure to close the facility has mounted.\n\nThis past summer, dozens of detained immigrants there participated in a hunger strike. When a group of detained immigrants organized to bring concerns forward, things got ugly. There was a facility-wide, 24-hour lockdown in response, and participating units were shut down longer. Pepper spray was reportedly used against hunger strikers.\n\nThis retaliatory desire to shut down opposition in the face of gross human rights concerns is unacceptable.\n\nIsmael, an immigrant detained at Stewart, had a stroke on March 9, 2014, and passed out in his unit. After being released from the hospital back into ICE\u2019s custody, he received no further treatment, follow-up, or even a lower bunk. After a second stroke a month later, the detention center allowed him pain pills for resulting headaches, but no treatment or rehabilitation. Finally, before even reaching his hearing, Ismael decided under duress to sign his deportation papers and leave behind his life in the U.S. to avoid further suffering.\n\nAlcides became a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. in 1996. He proudly served his country in Iraq, and is now a disabled veteran and wheelchair-bound. At Stewart, he was made to stand, causing him severe pain, and he has since lost feeling in his legs altogether. He went three and a half weeks without showering due to lack of assistance. After use of pepper spray at the facility in response to the hunger strike, he suffered seizures and was not provided with the correct medication upon return to the facility from the hospital. He joined the hunger strike in an attempt to get access to his prescribed medication.\n\nThis treatment is inhumane, un-American, and do recall, it is also for profit.\n\nIn a 2012 report by the ACLU of Georgia, \u201cPrisoners of Profit: Immigrants and Detention in Georgia,\u201d we found that Stewart has consistently failed to provide basic medical care, hygienic conditions, or edible and adequate food for those in detention. Detained men who spoke up suffered retaliation: a commonly used tactic was placing them in solitary. Stewart has been ranked by watchdogs like the Detention Watch Network as one of the worst facilities in the country.\n\nDespite years of advocacy by detained immigrants, their family members, and human rights organizations, conditions have worsened.\n\nThis coming weekend, hundreds of people from across the country will converge at the gates of Stewart to once again call for closure of this facility.\n\nThe time has come for the Obama administration and ICE to shut Stewart down, and for this painful chapter in the American treatment of immigrants to close.\n\nShahshahani serves as National Security/Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project Director for the ACLU of Georgia and president of the National Lawyers Guild.
