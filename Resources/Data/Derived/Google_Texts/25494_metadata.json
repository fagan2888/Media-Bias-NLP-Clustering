Not a peep about anyone\u2019s penis or hand size, short stature, tendency to sweat, or dishonest business practices, and no Ted Cruz telling Donald to stop interrupting and breathe. The four Republican candidates still standing seemed to have made a collective decision to be civil to one another, act more serious and debate actual issues. And yet still, they managed to spout a fair amount of alarming nonsense.\n\nHere are nine notably absurd and jarring moments from the debate.\n\n1. Donald Trump made a point of telling everyone he has watched the Democratic debates about highfalutin\u2019 things like Social Security and it is soooooo boring. (Not exciting like his favorite shows, \u201cSurvivor\u201d and \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d)\n\n2. Marco Rubio made it very clear that although his parents came to this country unskilled and uneducated and were welcomed and are part of what made this country great, he is firmly committed to slamming that door shut to unskilled immigrants from here on in.\n\n3. Trump doubled down on his statement this week that \u201cIslam hates us.\u201d When Jake Tapper asked, \u201cDid you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims?\u201d Trump answered, \u201cI mean a lot of them.\u201d\n\nTapper gave him one more chance and said, \u201cDo you want to clarify that?\u201d But Trump really thought he had already been plenty clear, and insisted that any attempt to argue with him was political correctness.\n\nMaking this doubly notable was that it somehow made Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz seem like moderates about Muslims, because they think there are Muslims we can work with to defeat ISIL. They are not moderates about Islam. Neither is John Kasich.\n\n4. Both Cruz and Rubio turned a question about whether we should commit the war crime of killing terrorists\u2019 families into an opportunity to bash Obama for \u201cgutting the military.\u201d Kind of a headscratcher. Then again, the Republican candidates had the misfortune of debating on the very day when news came out that Obama\u2019s approval ratings are up dramatically. Bummer for them.\n\n5. Cruz managed to make Trump seem relatively reasonable about negotiating between Israel and the Palestinians.", "article_metadata": {"description": "None of the candidates bragged about the size of his penis, but their talking points were no less appalling", "title": "The 9 most dumbfounding moments from the latest GOP debate", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "None of the candidates bragged about the size of his penis, but their talking points were no less appalling", "title": "The 9 most dumbfounding moments from the latest GOP debate", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/12/the_9_most_dumbfounding_moments_from_the_latest_gop_debate_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/CNN-debate.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "None of the candidates bragged about the size of his penis, but their talking points were no less appalling", "title": "The 9 most dumbfounding moments from the latest GOP debate", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/CNN-debate.jpeg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Janet Allon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Donald Trump, Florida, GOP debate, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Donald Trump, Florida, GOP debate, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Elections News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetAnyone tuning into the Republican debate in Florida on Thursday night expecting the kind of exciting fireworks of the last debate might have been disappointed.\nDonald Trump made a point of telling everyone he has watched the Democratic debates about highfalutin\u2019 things like Social Security and it is soooooo boring.\nNot a peep about anyone\u2019s penis or hand size, short stature, tendency to sweat, or dishonest business practices, and no Ted Cruz telling Donald to stop interrupting and breathe.\nHere are nine notably absurd and jarring moments from the debate.\nThe four Republican candidates still standing seemed to have made a collective decision to be civil to one another, act more serious and debate actual issues."}
