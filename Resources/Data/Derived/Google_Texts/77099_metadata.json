Britton Colquitt took the snap for granted and may have been thinking a bit too much about how to play the wind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to do a better job with ball security and get a clean ball off, get good hang time and give our guys a better chance,\u201d Colquitt said.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 punter dropped the snap, then rushed his punt a tad and didn\u2019t get his usual air under it.\n\nBut still he booted it 53 yards. And shouldn\u2019t a delay from a dropped snap help the punt coverage?\n\nApparently not. There was something counterintuitive about the 84-yard touchdown punt return by New England\u2019s Julian Edelman in the second quarter. Even with the Broncos\u2019 coverage team getting an extra second or two to get downfield, Edelman fielded it with plenty of room to run. Edeleman ran right, past rookie linebacker Corey Nelson, who was blocked either on the side by Tim Wright (as the referee or saw it) or illegally from behind (as the ref didn\u2019t see it), then zigged back left across the field where he outraced Colquitt to complete his touchdown that put the Patriots up 20-7.\n\n\u201cI thought he got me a little bit from behind,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cBut that\u2019s football. Nobody\u2019s perfect. Got to stop him, anyway. It shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Best images from Broncos-Patriots\n\nIt was Edelman\u2019s fourth career punt return for a touchdown, a franchise record.\n\n\u201cEdelman\u2019s a great returner,\u201d Colquitt said. \u201cWe had one with him last year where our guys were there \u2026 It was nothing against our guys, it\u2019s just a great player making a great play.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time the Broncos had allowed a touchdown off a punt return since Buffalo\u2019s Leodis McKelvin went 80 yards in a Christmas Eve 2011 game at Buffalo.\n\nColquitt knew the breakdown started with him.\n\n\u201cThe wind was doing its thing and I\u2019m probably instead of thinking of the basics \u2026 you\u2019ve got to pay more attention to details and I obviously didn\u2019t,\u201d Colquitt said.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com; Twitter: @mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Britton Colquitt takes blame for punt returned for touchdown", "title": "Britton Colquitt takes blame for punt returned for touchdown", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/02/britton-colquitt-takes-blame-for-punt-returned-for-touchdown/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141102__Colquitt-broncosp1.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141102__Colquitt-broncosp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-02T20:26:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:44:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1cc\"", "article_summary": "There was something counterintuitive about the 84-yard touchdown punt return by New England\u2019s Julian Edelman in the second quarter.\nIt shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dPHOTOS: Best images from Broncos-PatriotsIt was Edelman\u2019s fourth career punt return for a touchdown, a franchise record.\n\u201cThe wind was doing its thing and I\u2019m probably instead of thinking of the basics \u2026 you\u2019ve got to pay more attention to details and I obviously didn\u2019t,\u201d Colquitt said.\nBritton Colquitt took the snap for granted and may have been thinking a bit too much about how to play the wind.\nThe Broncos\u2019 punter dropped the snap, then rushed his punt a tad and didn\u2019t get his usual air under it."}
