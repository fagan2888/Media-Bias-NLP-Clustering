He had known he wanted to become a doctor, but he was looking for a way to contribute to systemic change in healthcare. His professor at the time was Donald Berwick, who later headed the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services and made a bid this year to be the Democratic candidate for governor of Massachusetts on a platform that includes single payer healthcare. Berwick\u2019s class inspired Gellis to think more about the business skills needed in healthcare. Gellis decided he wanted to apply business skills specifically to primary care, and he applied to Harvard Medical School and Harvard Business School simultaneously. By the time he began his residency in internal medicine, he\u2019d completed both degrees and had caught the attention of Iora Health, an innovative primary care practice that was planning to start up in a few cities around the country. When he finished his residency three years later, the company hired him as a primary care provider. Half a year later, he is helping to lead their Brooklyn practice.\n\n\u201cI have an actual management title and responsibilities, which is pretty crazy six months out of residency,\u201d said Gellis. According to Maria Chandler, who is president of the Association of M.D./M.B.A. Programs and herself a recipient of both degrees, the degree combination \u201cfast tracks\u201d graduates up the career ladder. The current nominee for surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, holds both degrees, has founded multiple organizations, and is only 36 years old. Those with dual degrees have a particular edge when it comes to hospital administration, a field that has traditionally employed M.B.A.s as leaders and M.D.s as middle managers. According to a New York Times analysis in May, the average annual salary for a hospital administrator is $237,000, compared with an average of $185,000 for a clinical physician. A 2011 study found that hospitals with physician CEOs outperformed those with non-medical leadership. \u201cJust like you wouldn\u2019t want a school superintendent to never have taught, you don\u2019t want the person leading your hospital to never have taken care of a patient,\u201d said Vinod Nambudiri, a fifth-year internal medicine and dermatology resident at BWH and a graduate of Harvard\u2019s joint M.D./M.B.A. program. Chandler wonders how physicians can become administrators without business training. \u201cWhat industry puts somebody with no business training in front of a huge budget?\u201d said Chandler. \u201cNowhere but medicine, really.\u201d * * * There is a growing complaint in medical education that the curriculum hasn\u2019t changed very much since 1910, when educator Abraham Flexner analyzed medical school curriculums across the country and proposed standardization of pre-clinical and clinical years in his groundbreaking Flexner Report. In the last few decades, the number of students choosing to supplement their M.D. degrees with others in different disciplines is climbing, and more schools have begun offering joint Ph.D., MPH, and MA programs. The number of joint M.D./M.B.A. programs in America has grown from six to 65 in 20 years. (From 2011 and 2012 alone, the number increased by 25 percent.) More than half of M.D./M.B.A. programs started after the year 2000, and most offer the degree in a five-year timeframe, lowering the total cost that business school would traditionally add. A 2011 study found that hospitals with physician CEOs outperformed those with non-medical leadership. Chandler estimates that there are about 500 students in joint M.D./M.B.A. programs across the country this year. She runs the joint degree program at UC Irvine, where 20 percent of medical students in the incoming class are doing the M.D./M.B.A. program. In the past, interest in business was sometimes derided as a distraction from commitment to medicine: Students interviewed in 2005 said some doctors or peers saw them as \u201ctraitors\u201d for getting M.B.A.s. When Chandler herself got the degree in 1992, she said no one told her about the few combined programs that existed back then. She earned her M.B.A. by attending evening classes for four years while working full-time as a pediatrician.\n\n\u201cMany of the greatest challenges in healthcare today are business problems,\u201d says Evan Rachlin, an M.D./M.B.A. graduate who works in the healthcare arm of Bain Capital Ventures. As hospitals implement the Affordable Care Act, and managed care systems grow increasingly complex, many medical students and residents feel compelled to understand the business of healthcare, from team management to budgeting and accounting. For students in joint programs, switching back and forth between cultures can be surreal. Medical students are part of a clear hierarchy: They wear the shortest white coats in the hospital, reaching only to their waists, while attending physicians wear the longest. In business school classes, however, \u201cyou are told that everyone\u2019s opinions are equal and the people at the lowest level may have the best idea,\u201d Chandler says. Sometimes, it can be difficult for students to balance these two sets of expectations. But they say achieving this balance is the purpose of the dual degree. \u201cMedical people tend to be very risk averse; innovations often come from outside,\u201d said Alexi Nazem, a third-year M.D./M.B.A. resident in internal medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. \u201cMost of medicine is like a giant oil tanker you\u2019re trying to steer with a paddle.\u201d Earning an M.B.A. can give a new doctor more clout in hospital decision-making. A study in 2001 found that students in M.D./M.B.A. programs at six medical schools exhibited a higher \u201ctolerance of ambiguity\u201d\u2014a characteristic the authors associated with leadership ability\u2014than traditional medical students. \u201cWhen you read a business case for the first time, there really is no right answer, and initially it can be really frustrating having gone through trying to solve every problem and follow all the rules like medical school taught us,\u201d said Gellis. \u201cYou learn how to think about uncertainty.\u201d Gellis finds this sort of thinking relevant in his work as a primary care provider, since he is often the first line of contact for patients coming in with a problem. For example, he says, \u201cyou have to think about what one piece of data you want instead of ordering every test.\u201d\n\n* * * The M.D./M.B.A. may also be attracting more high-performing students to the specialty of primary care, which is declining in residency application numbers even as the need for practitioners increases. Business-minded types often search for problems that need solving, and primary care gives them plenty of opportunity for that. The field allows doctors to be creative while serving a high-need medical population, and to tackle preventive care rather than band-aid solutions. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to reinvent the primary care system, we need young leaders to step forward,\u201d said Gellis. After stumbling into primary care as a path that would let him take care of individual patients while assuming responsibility for the bigger picture of healthcare, Gellis started the grassroots network Primary Care Progress. In primary care, doctors may be able to work a combination of clinical hours and entrepreneurial work hours. This is what Nazem, who is finishing up his internal medicine residency and searching for entrepreneurial work in conjunction with a primary care fellowship, hopes to do. The only issue with these dream-job setups is that graduates often end up having to cobble them together themselves. \u201cYou really have to be enterprising and committed because you will run into wall after wall after wall,\u201d said Nazem. Merck CMIO and Harvard M.D./M.B.A. graduate Sachin Jain says that\u2019s what you often have to do in the business world anyway. \u201cThis whole notion of a path is very medicine. It\u2019s not very business,\u201d says Jain. \u201cIn business, it\u2019s very organic, you have to be able to see the opportunity and lead change towards that opportunity.\u201d The timeline and application structure for residencies or fellowships are very rigid, while the hiring for startups, for example, is fluid. Another challenge is that most clinical residencies don\u2019t allot time or outlets for side projects during work hours. Marissa Wagner interrupted her residency to earn an M.B.A. at Stanford. When she returned to residency in 2013, she tried to continue a project she\u2019d started at Stanford, but says it was a struggle to do so when working 80 hours a week. \u201cIf you decide to go back and finish residency, you sort of have to leave this stuff, at least to a certain degree,\u201d she says. Earning an M.B.A. can give a new doctor more clout in hospital decision-making. There are an increasing number of residency programs seeking to solve this dilemma. Duke started the management and leadership pathway for residents in 2009 to solve the problems of \u201caccidental administrators in medicine\u201d and potential \u201catrophy\u201d of business school skills during residency. Duke declared that there should not be a \u201cbinary choice between business or medicine.\u201d The students have a minimum of 15 months of management experience over the course of the program, with approximately 6 months on clinical rotations and 6 months in management modules for two to three years.\n\nJain did a training program at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital called HemiDoc, where he spent 50 percent of his time in residency and 50 percent pursuing his medical and business research and teaching. While in residency, Nazem has been working on a medical education side project to create and implement a residency-fellowship training pathway specifically for management and innovation in medicine. \u201cLike there are sub-tracks in internal medicine, there should similarly be a track to train people who intend to be in clinical leadership roles and innovation roles,\u201d he said. Even in a typical residency, though, business training often comes in handy. When Chandler asked residency programs across the country for evaluations on UC Irvine graduates, she found that \u201cin almost every category, M.D.-M.B.A.s were listed as higher: even in non-business areas.\u201d She says she doesn\u2019t know if there is self-selection bias for these kinds of dual degree programs, which would mean that students who choose to pursue dual degrees may be more competitive and well-rounded to begin with. The benefits run both ways: Chandler says that earning an M.D. may help make business-minded people more careful and compassionate. Businesses who hire M.D./M.B.A.s tell her that these graduates are \u201cethical businessmen\u201d who use the medical creed to influence their actions in the business world. Unlike medicine, where applying for jobs can be a slow and methodical process, the business world can present unexpected opportunities. In his second year of residency, Jain got a phone call asking him to work at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. As he worked to improve nationwide policy and implement the Affordable Care and HITECH Acts, said Jain, \u201cmy M.B.A. was used every day we were building new organizations, hiring new talent, and thinking about strategy.\u201d Now that he\u2019s the first chief medical information and innovation officer at Merck, Jain still sees patients at the Boston VA medical center and is a lecturer of health policy at HMS, is affiliated with the research institute at HBS. He also launched a journal focused on healthcare delivery and innovation.\n\nChandler, too, says leadership opportunities have appeared for her at every turn. She found herself launching the new M.D./M.B.A. program at UC Irvine in 1997\u2014which started with one student\u2014when she inquired about how to encourage medical students to pursue the school\u2019s M.B.A. degree. In addition, Chandler oversees nine nonprofit clinics in Los Angeles County. * * * Practicing medicine requires passing through a series of sequential gates: medical school, board certification exams, residency, fellowships, and re-certification. Many successful M.D./M.B.A.s warn against straying from this path. \u201cClinical credibility matters,\u201d said Jain. \u201cA lot of folks will get off the path, do the M.D./M.B.A., leave, and don\u2019t do residencies. I think it\u2019s a huge mistake. Having completed a clinical residency has enabled me to practice clinical medicine, which is so important and so relevant to my ability to understand what the systemic problems are in the delivery of healthcare that need solutions.\u201d According to a study published in June 2014 that surveyed Wharton M.D./M.B.A. graduates from 1981 to 2010, 29 of 148 respondents (about 20 percent of respondents) did not enter residency. The same study showed that recent graduates of the program have entered residency at slightly lower rates than older alumni. Fisayo Ositelu, who works on consumer health insights at NerdWallet, decided not to do a clinical residency when he graduated with his M.D./M.B.A. from Stanford. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to work on a large scale versus a one-on-one basis. I think there\u2019s a lot that can be done on a systemic level,\u201d he said. Currently, NerdWallet\u2019s health arm is focused on helping consumers reduce their medical bills. \u201cWhat industry puts somebody with no business training in front of a huge budget? Nowhere but medicine, really.\u201d Evan Rachlin, currently working in healthcare venture capital at Bain Capital Ventures, chose not to do a clinical residency when he graduated from Harvard\u2019s joint degree program. When the time came to apply, he felt that there was little point in practicing at a hospital for just a few years and then leaving the clinical setting altogether. \u201cIt forced my decision between clinical care and business earlier, because I knew I didn\u2019t want to leave clinical medicine right after doing a residency,\u201d he said. In the end, he decided to go straight into the business world. He worked at McKinsey as a healthcare consultant, calling the experience \u201cin many ways a business residency. They have an enormous number of doctors. My first case there, everyone on the team was either a Ph.D. or an M.D.\u201d Now, at Bain, Rachlin and his team talk to 500 healthcare startups a year to determine where to place multimillion dollar investments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At a time when many of healthcare&#39;s greatest challenges are business problems, more and more doctors are adding three extra letters after their names.", "author": "Vidya Viswanathan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "At a time when many of healthcare&#39;s greatest challenges are business problems, more and more doctors are adding three extra letters after their names.", "title": "The Rise of the M.D./M.B.A. Degree", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/09/RTR1NN1B/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/09/the-rise-of-the-mdmba-degree/380683/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "She runs the joint degree program at UC Irvine, where 20 percent of medical students in the incoming class are doing the M.D./M.B.A.\nprogram at UC Irvine in 1997\u2014which started with one student\u2014when she inquired about how to encourage medical students to pursue the school\u2019s M.B.A. degree.\nFisayo Ositelu, who works on consumer health insights at NerdWallet, decided not to do a clinical residency when he graduated with his M.D./M.B.A.\nprograms at six medical schools exhibited a higher \u201ctolerance of ambiguity\u201d\u2014a characteristic the authors associated with leadership ability\u2014than traditional medical students.\nThere are an increasing number of residency programs seeking to solve this dilemma."}
