After reading a set of \u201cvery visually dense\u201d passages, the two teachers took 25 minutes to answer four questions about what they just read.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t very confident with our answers,\u201d Cooper admitted.\n\nDespite the difficulty of the online test, the Gorham Middle School English and social studies teacher said she sees value in the Web-based student assessments and the \u201chigher-order\u201d thinking Common Core is designed to elicit in young students. She doesn\u2019t want to see it abandoned.\n\nIf a grass-roots effort to kill Common Core in Maine is successful after more than four years of work to implement its standards, Cooper and other educators worry the fallout could be damaging, resulting in confusion and more uncertainty in Maine\u2019s education system.\n\n\u201cI will tell you that teachers will lose their minds,\u201d Cooper, a member of the Maine Educational Association board of directors, said.\n\nCommon Core has enemies in Maine. A conservative think tank has joined forces with a group of Common Core opponents in hopes of rekindling the effort to override the controversial education standards through legislation proposed this session.\n\nNo Common Core Maine, formed in the summer of 2013, launched a public campaign decrying Common Core as an \u201cundemocratic, uncontrolled\u201d federal experiment. The group aims to \u201cprotect the children of Maine from a massive trap designed to limit the potential of our future generations,\u201d according to its mission statement.\n\nDuring a late February luncheon in Portland, Matthew Gagnon, CEO for Maine Heritage Policy Center, a right-wing advocacy group, announced his organization would join forces with No Common Core Maine to support anti-Common Core legislation up for consideration this year.\n\n\u201cThis is something we care about an awful lot,\u201d Gagnon said, adding that the group looked forward to working with state lawmakers to \u201cfight back against Common Core\u201d in favor of a \u201clocally developed\u201d alternative.\n\nIn his Bangor Daily News blog, Gagnon included Common Core\u2019s demise in Maine as one of his 15 \u201cbold predictions\u201d for the Maine political scene in 2015.\n\nCommon complaints\n\nThe voluntary Common Core State Standards were implemented in 2010 in response to increased calls for proficiency-based education, which means students leave their public school with certain knowledge and skills in common with all other students. The intent was to ensure that all schools follow the same guidelines when teaching their students. Maine, which officially adopted the standards in 2011, will launch Smarter Balanced testing, an assessment based on the Common Core standards, this spring.\n\nAll but four U.S. states \u2014 Alaska, Texas, Nebraska and Virginia \u2014 have adopted Common Core standards. Minnesota adopted only the English Language Arts standards.\n\nSome states have begun to push back. Oklahoma, South Carolina and Indiana withdrew in 2014. Legislation and discussions have been introduced in other states to do the same. Most of those states are using Common Core standards as a prompt to explore their own standards changes.\n\nCommon Core opponents cite a litany of concerns about the standards, ranging from overzealous expectations of students at lower grade levels and failing to challenge older students to complaints that the federal government shouldn\u2019t be determining state education standards.\n\nJamie Gass is director of the Center for School Reform at the Pioneer Institute, a policy research group based in Boston. The oft-quoted Common Core critic spoke during the Maine Heritage Policy Center luncheon in Portland last month.\n\nHis group is active in pushing back against the standards nationally. Gass spent much of his time discussing the situation in Massachusetts, where the state\u2019s efforts to improve academic performance in the 1990s showed strong results, with the state climbing performance rankings.\n\n\u201c[Massachusetts] provides an example that states can do this work,\u201d Gass said.\n\nWhen Common Core arrived in the late 2000s, Massachusetts signed on, resulting in a dramatic dip in the teaching of classic literature, an \u201cexperimental form of geometry that has never succeeded anywhere\u201d and generally lesser standards than what the state had before, according to Gass.\n\nSome Common Core opponents argue that the federal government has no place in guiding education.\n\n\u201cThere is no topic [more] dedicated to state and local government than K-12 education,\u201d Gass said, adding there likely is a reason the drafters of the Constitution didn\u2019t mention education \u2014 they wanted that to be left up to the states.\n\nSome concerns are shared even by groups that support the premise behind Common Core. The Maine Education Association, for example, supports the \u201claudable\u201d concept of more uniform, rigorous standards to help ensure quality education and higher-level thinking, which is the aim of Common Core standards. Even so, Cooper, a board member, recently spent 40 minutes discussing the complaints and concerns shared by teachers and administrators regarding the standards and related testing.\n\nThe tests also ask young students to think on a higher level. For example, third-graders are asked to read a passage and \u201cdescribe the author\u2019s intent,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nThe testing that stems from the adoption of Common Core standards is facing challenges of its own, with some lawmakers and school districts pushing to notify parents and students that they have the right to opt out of standardized testing, including the new Smarter Balanced tests stemming from Common Core.\n\nMany teachers and administrators across the state have expressed concerns that restrictions on technology will affect student performance on the new test. Bangor Superintendent Betsy Webb, for example, has said that she has \u201cconcerns that the test this year will not truly test students\u2019 knowledge and that some of it may have been hindered by the technology and the process.\u201d\n\nFor example, younger students may not be skilled at typing out answers or using a mouse if they\u2019re used to tablets, instructors say. Other schools are struggling to schedule all the needed testing with limited bandwidth capacity at their buildings.\n\nStill others are concerned about the amount of testing and performance data collected on individual students and whether government agencies really need that information.\n\nThe legislation\n\nThere are four bills in the works that aim to hamstring or reduce the influence of Common Core in Maine. No Common Core Maine had an integral role in forming each of them, according to Heidi Sampson, a member of the group\u2019s executive committee. No Common Core Maine will continue to drive the pushback \u201cin word and deed,\u201d according to Sampson, who also serves on the state Board of Education and is a veteran home-schooler.\n\nLanguage is available for one of the bills, LR 866, An Act to Allow Teachers to Teach and Students to Learn. The three others are being processed through the Legislature\u2019s revisor\u2019s office, so the text has not been released.\n\nLR 866 would repeal the requirements for a system of proficiency-based education standards in Maine that are scheduled to become effective in 2017.\n\nLR 1487 would have the state adopt \u201cbest practice\u201d English Language Arts standards from other states that have demonstrated success in those areas, such as Massachusetts, California and Texas.\n\nOne of the most dramatic pieces of legislation, LR 1318, An Act to Improve Educational Assessments, essentially would do away with Smarter Balanced testing and replace it with some other form of assessment.\n\nLR 839, An Act to Safeguard Student Information, aims to \u201cprotect student and family information\u201d gathered from pre-K through entry into the workforce from misuse.\n\nSampson said her organization and others, including the Maine Heritage Policy Center, would be pushing hard to advocate for these pieces of legislation this year.\n\n\u201cThe game is set, it\u2019s time to get up and bat,\u201d Sampson said.\n\nFallout\n\nSome proponents of Common Core, including the Maine Education Association, acknowledge it\u2019s far from perfect but say doing away with it could do more harm than good, now that the state and school districts have been working to implement it for more than four years.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just pull Common Core, too many things are wrapped up in it now,\u201d Cooper said, citing the need for assessments, a plan for strong state standards and Common Core\u2019s ties to teacher performance measures and proficiency-based diplomas. \u201cDo they understand that they pull that thread and they unravel a whole host of things?\u201d\n\nThe Maine Department of Education also warns that a Common Core split could be damaging for statewide education.\n\nBefore the appearance of Common Core, Maine had its own set of standards known as the Maine Learning Results, which were revamped on occasion to meet the needs of the workforce and higher education institutions.\n\nSamantha Warren, spokeswoman for the Maine Department of Education, said in a recent email that Common Core standards have been incorporated into existing Maine Learning Results through rulemaking, so Maine technically didn\u2019t adopt Common Core but did adopt its updated set of standards.\n\n\u201cUnless Maine wanted to do away with statewide academic standards entirely \u2014 if the standards some refer to as the Common Core were repealed \u2014 they would need to be replaced either with a new set of rigorous college- and career-ready standards or we would need to revert back to the ones we used prior to 2011, which are outdated and which we believe would no longer adequately prepare our students for the current expectations of post-secondary institutions and the workforce,\u201d Warren wrote.\n\nCooper said a return to past standards might prompt some teachers to \u201cbreathe a sigh of relief\u201d but others might pull their hair out.\n\nThe department has been frustrated with the apparent lack of public interest in Common Core standards, especially early in the process, \u201cgiven its incredible importance to our students and our state\u2019s economic future,\u201d Warren added. Warren said only a handful of people showed up at a public hearing on the standards four years ago, and \u201cno one testified in opposition.\u201d\n\nShe said the fact that more people are becoming interested and engaged in the issue \u201ccan only be a good thing for our kids.\u201d\n\nLast fall, a panel convened to review the standards and determine what improvements might be needed or whether the national standards should be dumped. That group provided feedback to the Department of Education, which says it\u2019s \u201cdeciding how to best move forward\u201d under the oversight of Acting Commissioner Tom Desjardin. That includes whether the state should engage experts in English or math to gauge if Maine\u2019s standards are sufficient.\n\nFormer Commissioner Jim Rier, who led the panel initiative, was out on medical leave when this feedback arrived, which slowed the department\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cOne specific area of interest for our department is possibly redrafting the standards so they are in plain language so students, parents, the public and all educators can actually understand them,\u201d Warren said.\n\nSampson, who served on that panel, was critical of the work it accomplished, arguing the reviews weren\u2019t thorough enough and had a predetermined outcome. She and Cooper used the same words to describe the panel process: \u201ca farce.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that the current standards are better than the ones that were in place before them,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWhile we must be sensitive to the strain moving the bar too frequently can put on our students and schools, if we can do better, we must.\u201d\n\nCooper said standards evolved before Maine\u2019s Common Core standards adoption and will continue to evolve after.\n\n\u201cThis never seems to stop in education,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had enough time to put [Common Core standards] into place to really assess whether it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nFollow Nick McCrea on Twitter at @nmccrea213.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BANGOR, Maine \u2014 Amanda Cooper understands the backlash against the new education standards known as Common Core.
