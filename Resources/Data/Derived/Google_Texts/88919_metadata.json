Bob Goodlatte that is intended to discourage abusive patent litigation, known as patent trolling. (RELATED: Do Courts Need Congress to Assist in Fight Against Patent Trolls?)\n\nAccording to a statement from the event\u2019s organizers, \u201c[broad] patent legislation, such as H.R. 9 as introduced, that weakens the legitimate enforcement rights of all patent holders will harm our innovation economy, and is unnecessary in light of recent developments in the federal judiciary and executive branch.\u201d\n\nFiorina took an even more provocative stance, calling the bill a classic example of big government overreach, and claiming that, \u201cif the Innovation Act were law at the time, Thomas Edison would be considered a patent troll.\u201d\n\nIP protections are enshrined in the Constitution, she argued, because \u201cthe founders knew everyone has God-given gifts,\u201d and also understood that in order for individuals to maximize their potential, they must \u201cown the product of their labor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the country where nearly everything worth inventing was invented,\u201d she explained, and \u201cit happened here because innovators knew they could benefit from their efforts.\u201d\n\nFiorina went on to assert that innovation flourishes best in an environment with the fewest possible constraints, and warned that overly complex efforts to protect patent rights risk creating bigger problems than they solve. (RELATED: Study: Dodd-Frank Crushes Small Banks)\n\n\u201cCrony capitalism is alive and well,\u201d she noted, adding, \u201cElizabeth Warren is right about that, but wrong in saying that big government is the solution; big government and big business only ever support each other.\u201d\n\nExamples of this abound in recent history, Fiorina said. Obamacare, for instance, \u201cis longer than a Harry Potter novel, and not nearly as interesting,\u201d but has largely failed to solve the problems it was designed to address. Similarly, rather than ending the concept of \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d the Dodd-Frank Act made big banks even stronger.\n\n\u201cBefore we boil the oceans trying to solve problems that perhaps don\u2019t need legislative solutions,\u201d she suggested, we should have the humility to accept that \u201cthe founders had it right.\u201d\n\nOne alternative to the Innovation Act that has generated much greater support from innovators is the STRONG Patents Act, introduced on Tuesday by Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
