The benefits will not be extended to domestic partners.\n\nThe hospital said it made the decision because of recent changes in government regulations for same-sex couples, The Springfield News-Leader reported.\n\n\u201cMercy has followed the Church\u2019s position on this issue in the past,\u201d Mercy Springfield spokeswoman Sonya Kullmann said in a statement last week, \u201cHowever, in line with recent changes in government regulations, we will extend benefits to all legally married spouses effective this spring.\u201d\n\nBishop James V. Johnston said Catholics should reject the view that \u201cmarriage is whatever the government says it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s plan for marriage is not a matter of \u2018the Church\u2019s position,\u2019 as Mercy characterized it, but rather, one of God\u2019s own Word,\u201d Johnston said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo believing Christian worthy of the name should violate God\u2019s law because of \u2018regulations.\u2019 Our ancestors refused to abandon the faith even when subjected to the cruelty and torture of the Roman Empire, but in our age unspecified \u2018regulations,\u2019 government funds, and fear of public ridicule is sufficient in order to secure the compliance of some,\u201d he said.\n\nThe nonprofit Mercy Health System has more than 40,000 employees at hospitals in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma and outreach ministries in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.\n\nSpringfield-based CoxHealth, which is not affiliated with the Catholic Church, also recently said it would extend the same benefits to legally married same-sex spouses.\n\nIn Missouri, same-sex couples can marry only in the city of St. Louis, St. Louis County, and Jackson County, which includes Kansas City.\n\nMeanwhile, the Archdiocese of St. Louis is criticizing the federal government for putting Catholic businesses in a tough spot, after Mercy Health said it is considering extending benefits to same-sex partners of employees.\n\nMercy, based in suburban St. Louis, is among the nation\u2019s largest Catholic health care systems, with more than 40,000 employees in seven states. Mercy officials say they\u2019re considering the move to comply with the Affordable Care Act and other federal programs. It did not say when the change might happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the archdiocese says it\u2019s inconsistent to claim to be a Catholic institution while publicly acting against Church teaching. But the statement added that not complying with federal regulations could impose fines that would hurt employees and patient care.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/church/2015/01/19/springfield-bishop-objects-to-hospitals-same-sex-benefits/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/library/images/favicons/favicon-200.png", "type": "article", "description": "The bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau has expressed deep concern at the decision of a Catholic-based hospital group to extend benefits to same-sex spouses of employees.", "title": "Springfield bishop objects to hospital\u2019s same-sex benefits"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d1d2d3", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9036\"", "article_summary": "In Missouri, same-sex couples can marry only in the city of St. Louis, St. Louis County, and Jackson County, which includes Kansas City.\nThe Mercy Health System, which has about 9,000 employees in Springfield, said last week that it plans to offer benefits to legally married same-sex spouses beginning this spring.\nThe hospital said it made the decision because of recent changes in government regulations for same-sex couples, The Springfield News-Leader reported.\nThe nonprofit Mercy Health System has more than 40,000 employees at hospitals in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma and outreach ministries in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.\nMercy, based in suburban St. Louis, is among the nation\u2019s largest Catholic health care systems, with more than 40,000 employees in seven states."}
