Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., said in a statement. \u201cThe ancient faith tradition lies beaten, broken, and dying.\u201d\n\nIn its fight to establish a caliphate governed by strict Sharia law, ISIS has driven Christians out of Iraq and Syria in masses as they torch their churches to dust and murder them in scores, often referring to them as \u201ccrusaders\u201d in its holy war.\n\n\u201c[A]n official statement of the Congress of the United States must be made to label these atrocities carried out against Christians and other religious minorities for what they are\u2026genocide,\u201d Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat who also sponsored the resolution, said in a statement.\n\nThe attacks extend a deeply rooted religious divide in the Middle East that has left Christians clinging to survival as their numbers dwindle in the region.\n\nChristians made up about 20 percent of the Middle East\u2019s population at the beginning of the 20th century, according to Newsweek. That number is now around 5 percent.\n\n\u2018\u2018Christianity is under an existential threat,\u201d Eshoo told The New York Times.\n\nThe Iraq War and fall of Saddam Hussein partially fueled the latest exodus, diminishing the Christian population in Iraq from 1.5 million in 2003 to less than 500,000 today, the Times reported.\n\n\u201c[T]he Obama administration\u2019s decision to position U.S. engagement under the banner of Muslim world engagement failed to effectively promote pluralism and tolerance and reflect the broad diversity within the Middle East,\u201d the Center for American Progress wrote in a March report.\n\nThe 2011 Arab Spring exacerbated the situation. In Egypt, former dictator Hosni Mubarak had a close relationship with the nation\u2019s pope, giving Christians protection and a rare \u201caccess to power,\u201d according to PBS. Christians lost that protection when he was overthrown.\n\nSimilar stories panned out across the Middle East as uprisings toppled authoritarian regimes, leaving Christians a target of anti-government attacks.\n\n\u201cIslamists have very little love for groups that supposedly supported the system,\u201d Mark LeVine, a professor of Middle East History at the University of California at Irvine told PBS.\n\nA March European Parliament resolution condemning the attacks against Christians and other minorities reported that 700,000 Christians have fled Syria since the civil war began in 2011.\n\nIn Lebanon, where Christians hold substantial political power, their population has sharply dropped from 78 percent to 34 percent over the past century, according to the Times. In Iran and Turkey, \u201cthey\u2019re all but gone.\u201d\n\nToday, \u201cless than 1 percent of the world\u2019s more than 2 billion Christians live in the Middle East,\u201d Newsweek reported.\n\n\u201cSome of the oldest Christian communities in the world are disappearing in the very lands where their faith was born and first took root,\u201d the Center for American Progress wrote.\n\nFortenberry said the U.S. needs to \u201cconfront the scandalous silence about their plight.\u201d\n\n\u201cChristians, Yezidis, and other religious minorities have every right to remain in their ancestral homelands.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. lawmakers introduced a bipartisan resolution Wednesday to formally declare the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria\u2019s targeting of Christians \u201cgenocide.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "U.S. lawmakers introduced a bipartisan resolution Wednesday to formally declare the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria\u2019s targeting of Christians \u201cgenocide.\u201d", "title": "Lawmakers Aim to Declare ISIS\u2019 Terror of Christians \u2018Genocide\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150911_ISISGenocide_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Nnea7m"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "U.S. lawmakers introduced a bipartisan resolution Wednesday to formally declare the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria\u2019s targeting of Christians \u201cgenocide.\u201d", "title": "Lawmakers Aim to Declare ISIS\u2019 Terror of Christians \u2018Genocide\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150911_ISISGenocide_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-09-12T09:32:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ISIS, Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, genocide, Jeff Fortenberry, Anna Eshoo, Sharia law"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe056d\"", "article_summary": "Similar stories panned out across the Middle East as uprisings toppled authoritarian regimes, leaving Christians a target of anti-government attacks.\nFortenberry said the U.S. needs to \u201cconfront the scandalous silence about their plight.\u201d\u201cChristians, Yezidis, and other religious minorities have every right to remain in their ancestral homelands.\u201d\nThe attacks extend a deeply rooted religious divide in the Middle East that has left Christians clinging to survival as their numbers dwindle in the region.\nChristians made up about 20 percent of the Middle East\u2019s population at the beginning of the 20th century, according to Newsweek.\nIn Iran and Turkey, \u201cthey\u2019re all but gone.\u201dToday, \u201cless than 1 percent of the world\u2019s more than 2 billion Christians live in the Middle East,\u201d Newsweek reported."}
