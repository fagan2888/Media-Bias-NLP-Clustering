The health care industry is no different, especially in public hospitals and medical centers like those associated with colleges and universities. One Tennessee hospital believes it has found a new place to make a budget cut \u2014 make the nurses do patient room cleaning on top of their regular care rounds.\n\nAccording to the Channel 4 I Team in Nashville, Vanderbilt University Medical Center has informed the nursing staff that they will be responsible for cleaning patient areas as well as their standard duties.\n\n\u201cCleaning the room after the case, including pulling your trash and mopping the floor, are all infection-prevention strategies. And it\u2019s all nursing, and it\u2019s all surgical tech. You may not believe that, but even Florence Nightingale knew that was true,\u201d explained the hospital administrator. The additional requirements include \u201cpull[ing] their own trash and linens, sweep up and spot mop.\u201d\n\nAre additional pressures on nursing staff really in the best interest of both the nurses and their patients? A series of issues with understaffing and overcrowed hospitals across the county has made nursing one of the most overworked professions in the nation. Nursing advocates have long been encouraging employers to provide more benefits and support for nurses as a means of both improving morale and ensuring less likelihood of errors on the job.\n\n\u201cWith a happy and engaged nursing staff, the results will show a direct correlation with increased patient satisfaction, which keeps the hospital in the clear when it comes to satisfaction survey reimbursement penalties from CMS,\u201d says one hospital management consulting site. \u201cIt also instills trust and loyalty in the patients they serve.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, doing janitorial work doesn\u2019t appear to be one of the ways of boosting nursing morale, especially when the nursing staff is allowed no input or feedback on the proposal. In fact, the nursing staff was ordered not to speak in public at all about the new workload. \u201cNurses were told to \u2018refrain from speaking negatively about this in an open forum where our customer can hear. If you need to vent come see me,\u2019\u201d reports Eyewitness News TV 3.\n\nThe new duties aren\u2019t just a concern to nurses because of the time involved, but the potential increase for harming patients as well. The trash or linens can often contain waste with bodily fluid on it or other contamination, which could cause serious health issues if patients are subject to them. The idea has many nurses rightfully worried about potential cross-contamination, a hazard the hospital administration appears to dismiss.\n\nThe Vanderbuilt University Medical Center has not had the best history of employee relations even prior to this new staffing move. In the midst of budget cuts, and desperate to slash jobs, the hospital is in the midst of defending itself against lawsuits claiming that they have fired employees in violation of the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\n\nThe hospital is also in court over accusations that it has been engaging in Medicare fraud for over a decade.\n\nPhoto credit: Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is having nurses clean patient rooms a good management decision or an accident waiting to happen?", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3042/3041434.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "vanderbuild university medical center,nursing,patient health,medicare", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3063\"", "article_summary": "The Vanderbuilt University Medical Center has not had the best history of employee relations even prior to this new staffing move.\nAccording to the Channel 4 I Team in Nashville, Vanderbilt University Medical Center has informed the nursing staff that they will be responsible for cleaning patient areas as well as their standard duties.\nIn fact, the nursing staff was ordered not to speak in public at all about the new workload.\nOne Tennessee hospital believes it has found a new place to make a budget cut \u2014 make the nurses do patient room cleaning on top of their regular care rounds.\nThe health care industry is no different, especially in public hospitals and medical centers like those associated with colleges and universities."}
