As he opens his sixth year in office, he also faces legacy-defining decisions on the future of government surveillance programs and the American-led war in Afghanistan.\n\nLooming over it all will be the November congressional elections, Obama\u2019s last chance to stock Capitol Hill with more Democratic lawmakers who could help him expand his presidential playing field.\n\nFor Republicans, those contests are an opportunity to seize control of the Senate, which would render Obama a lame duck for his final two years in the White House.\n\nThe wild card in 2014, for the White House and congressional Democrats facing re-election, will be the fate of the president\u2019s health care law. The website woes that tainted its launch have largely been resolved and enrollment has picked up. But the White House has been tight-lipped about who has enrolled, raising uncertainty about whether the insurance exchanges are on track to get the percentage of young and healthy people who are critical to keeping prices down.\n\nThe health care questions aside, Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said the White House enters the new year buoyed by the \u201cmodest amount of legislative momentum\u201d generated by the December budget deal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful Congress can build on it and make progress on other priorities where common ground exists,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nIt won\u2019t take long to test that proposition, with debates on unemployment insurance, budget spending and the government\u2019s borrowing limit expected in quick succession in the opening weeks of the year.\n\nIf all three can be resolved in drama-free fashion \u2014 by Washington standards \u2014 the White House believes it could create a more favorable atmosphere for Obama to pursue second-term priorities such as an immigration overhaul and a higher minimum wage, though both would still face steep odds.\n\nThe president is scheduled to arrive in Washington this morning after an overnight flight from his home state of Hawaii. He\u2019s spent two quiet weeks on Oahu golfing and spending time with his family and childhood friends.\n\nUpon his return, Obama will step back quickly into the debate over expired unemployment benefits for 1.3 million Americans. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has scheduled a vote Monday night on a bill that would reinstate the benefits for three months.\n\nRead the full story at mauinews.com", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "President Barack Obama returns to Washington this weekend eager to test whether a modest budget deal passed in the waning days of 2013 can spark bipartisan momentum on Capitol Hill.
