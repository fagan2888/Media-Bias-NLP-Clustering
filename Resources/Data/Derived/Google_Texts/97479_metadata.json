We know this because he\u2019s telling us so.\n\nIn an interview this week with The Atlantic about the potential deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program, the president sought to use the fact of his relative youth and his consciousness about how history might judge him to his advantage: \u201cLook, 20 years from now, I\u2019m still going to be around, God willing. If Iran has a nuclear weapon, it\u2019s my name on this. I think it\u2019s fair to say that in addition to our profound national-security interests, I have a personal interest in locking this down.\u201d\n\nIn one sense, this is what we want presidents to worry about. We want them to be restrained by the cautionary examples provided by history and by the fact that history will judge them.\n\nBut what if the desire to tip the scales of history\u2019s judgment in his favor leads a president to take dangerous risks?\n\nIn fact, we know that is what Obama has done with the Iran deal because his aides have told us so.\n\nHis deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, put it this way last year to a roomful of liberal activists when talking about the initial November 2013 agreement to begin talking about Iran\u2019s nuclear program: \u201cBottom line is, this is the best opportunity we\u2019ve had to resolve the Iranian issue diplomatically \u2026 This is probably the biggest thing President Obama will do in his second term on foreign policy. This is health care for us, just to put it in context.\u201d\n\nBut this \u201copportunity\u201d didn\u2019t just emerge organically \u2014 which is actually where \u201copportunities\u201d are supposed to come from. It did not result from changing conditions that opened a new possibility of finding common ground.\n\nIran\u2019s behavior didn\u2019t change, and its pursuit of nuclear weapons didn\u2019t change. Obama manufactured what Rhodes called an opportunity by pursuing a deal with Iran and dangling all kinds of carrots in front of the mullahs.\n\nAnd why? Because he wants a foreign-policy legacy to match the size and scope of his key legacy in domestic policy.\n\nAnd who can blame him? After the failure of the Arab Spring, the collapse of Libya, the failure to act on his self-imposed \u201cred line\u201d in Syria, Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea from Ukraine and the terrifying rise and forward march of ISIS, the only unmitigated positive on his foreign-policy spreadsheet remains the killing of Osama bin Laden.\n\nLook, the guy will need something impressive to fill the exhibition space at his brand-new presidential library in Chicago.\n\nObama\u2019s asking us to trust him because, he says, you can\u2019t think he would want to look like the man who allowed Iran to go nuclear at some point in the future.\n\nSo what explains the president\u2019s own unprompted comments in an NPR interview in April that, under the terms already announced, Iran would have the right to go nuclear by 2028 \u2014 when he will, God willing, be a mere 67 years of age?\n\n\u201cA more relevant fear,\u201d he said, \u201cwould be that in year 13, 14, 15, they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly, and at that point, the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero.\u201d\n\nObama offered an answer. \u201cThe option of a future president to take action if in fact they try to obtain a nuclear weapon is undiminished,\u201d he said.\n\nSo it will be up to his successors to bail him out in the eyes of history and make it appear as though his legacy wasn\u2019t the nuclear destabilization of the Middle East!\n\nSpeaking of legacies, how\u2019s that key domestic-policy legacy going? Not so hot.\n\nObamaCare remains unpopular; far more Americans oppose than favor it.\n\nPeople still remember the disaster of the October 2013 rollout, which still casts a shadow over the program today.\n\nThose hard feelings were deepened last year by the discovery of a series of talks by key ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber in which he bragged that it had been falsely marketed to the American people to take advantage of their stupidity.\n\nIts defenders say the program is beginning to work, in the sense that it\u2019s covering more people \u2014 but it\u2019s not covering as many as the administration said it would by this time.\n\nThey tout the fact that the cost of the program is lower than it was supposed to be by now.\n\nBut that\u2019s an inconsistent claim; it\u2019s only less expensive because it isn\u2019t meeting its target numbers, not because cost savings have suddenly materialized from the ether.\n\nMeanwhile, at some point over the next month, the entire policy may be thrown into terminal chaos when the Supreme Court issues its judgment in a case called King v. Burwell \u2014 which challenges the legality of a central component of ObamaCare.\n\nAs the Supreme Court debates and writes its opinions, the overall economy continues to sputter. Over the past five years, it grows and halts, grows and halts, in a somewhat mystifying pattern that has kept the American people on guard and on edge.\n\nIn the latest RealClearPolitics polling average, 62 percent say the country is on the wrong track \u2014 more than seven years after Obama moved into the White House.\n\nObama still has 18 months to go, and presidents have staged remarkable turnarounds in public opinion in such a time frame. Bill Clinton did it before his re-election in 1996, which seemed like a ludicrous prospect in early 1995.\n\nRonald Reagan was at low ebb in mid-1987 and left office on a triumphant high in early 1989.\n\nBut we\u2019ve also seen the opposite. Indeed, we\u2019ve seen the opposite more recently. George W. Bush was in bad shape in mid-2007, unquestionably \u2014 worse than Obama, because he\u2019d lost the confidence of some Republicans, while Obama seems not to have lost any of his base.\n\nBut in 2008, the bottom fell out when a financial crisis that began in the spring turned into a total meltdown by the fall. Bush left office with one poll showing his approval rating at 22 percent.\n\nRight now, would you bet on things getting substantially better for Barack Obama, or substantially worse? Does it look like we\u2019re going to triumph over ISIS?\n\nDoes it feel like the economy is going to improve or that ObamaCare will suddenly gain public support? Does it seem like the deal with Iran is a good one?\n\nIf you answer these questions in the affirmative, then you are likely to be the sort of person who\u2019s kept your 2008 Obama \u201cHope\u201d poster on your wall and your 2012 Obama bumper sticker on your car.\n\nAlas for America and the world, a poster and a bumper sticker do not a legacy make.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Deep into the seventh year of his tenure, Barack Obama is thinking about his post-presidential legacy.
