The program is meant to provide a financial incentive for hospitals to improve the quality of care and cut down on costly readmissions, in which a patient must return to the hospital after a procedure.\n\nBut the new study, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, finds that many readmissions occur not because of problems with a hospital\u2019s care, but because of socioeconomic factors among the patients.\n\nFor example, the American Hospital Association (AHA) wrote in a report in March, \u201cResearch shows that economically disadvantaged patients often have limited access to services and resources that can help support their recovery post-hospitalization and, therefore, reduce their likelihood of being readmitted.\u201d\n\nHospital groups like AHA have called for their penalties to be adjusted for factors outside of a hospital\u2019s control, like patients\u2019 income.\n\nThe study finds that almost half (48 percent) of the difference between hospital readmission rates could be explained by outside factors like patients' education and income levels.\n\n\u201cHospitals with high readmission rates may be penalized to a large extent based on the patients they serve,\u201d conclude the three Harvard professors who wrote the study, Michael L. Barnett, John Hsu and J. Michael McWilliams.\n\nDr. Patrick Conway, chief medical officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), responded in a statement that the administration is \u201ccurrently researching the impact of socioeconomic status\u201d on the penalty program.\n\nHe pledged to \u201ccontinue to work with all stakeholders to seek feasible ways to encourage hospitals to reduce hospital readmissions while addressing any unintended consequences,\u201d particularly for those serving low-income patients.\n\nThe penalty program currently adjusts for some patient factors, like age, sex and recent diagnoses. But CMS warns that adding adjustments for socioeconomic status could hold hospitals that serve poorer people to a lower standard of care.\n\nThe penalties under the program can reach up to 3 percent of a hospital\u2019s Medicare payments. This year, CMS assessed $428 million in penalties, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The study finds that readmission penalties could fall more heavily on some hospitals.", "description": "The study finds that readmission penalties could fall more heavily on some hospitals.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The study finds that readmission penalties could fall more heavily on some hospitals.", "title": "Study: ObamaCare could penalize hospitals with poor patients", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/253579-study-obamacare-program-could-penalize-having-poor-patients", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/healthcareobamacare1_081214getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/253579-study-obamacare-program-could-penalize-having-poor-patients", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-14T15:03-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-14T15:03:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/253579-study-obamacare-program-could-penalize-having-poor-patients", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The study finds that readmission penalties could fall more heavily on some hospitals.", "card": "summary", "title": "Study: ObamaCare could penalize hospitals with poor patients"}, "dcterms.title": "Study: ObamaCare could penalize hospitals with poor patients"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbca9\"", "article_summary": "An ObamaCare program could be penalizing certain hospitals for serving more poor patients, according to a study released Monday.\nADVERTISEMENTThe study focuses on an ObamaCare program that docks a hospital\u2019s Medicare payments if its readmission rate is above a certain level.\nThe study finds that almost half (48 percent) of the difference between hospital readmission rates could be explained by outside factors like patients' education and income levels.\nBut the new study, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, finds that many readmissions occur not because of problems with a hospital\u2019s care, but because of socioeconomic factors among the patients.\nHe pledged to \u201ccontinue to work with all stakeholders to seek feasible ways to encourage hospitals to reduce hospital readmissions while addressing any unintended consequences,\u201d particularly for those serving low-income patients."}
