Starbucks may also be able to offer extended opening hours, compared with family-run coffee shops.\n\nBut while Italy has a rich coffee tradition, it isn't clear there's much growth in the market.\n\nEarlier this month, research firm Euromonitor estimated Italy's coffee market at 1.7 billion euros ($1.86 billion) in 2015, up 2 percent on year. Between 2015-2020, it expects just 1 percent compound annual growth in retail volume terms and 3 percent in constant 2015 value terms to 162,000 tonnes and 2.0 billion euros. Italy also already has a dominant play, Luigi Lavazza, with a 37 percent share of retail value in 2015, Euromonitor said.\n\nBy comparison, the U.S. retail coffee house industry is expected to generate more than $31 billion in revenue in 2015, according to data from Statista.\n\nItaly's population is around 62 million, compared with about 321 million in the U.S.\n\nIt isn't clear how well Starbucks is breaking into Europe's coffee culture in general. In its fiscal first quarter ended December 27, the company's comparable store sales for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) rose just 1 percent, compared with a better-than-expected 9 percent increase in the Americas. Net revenue for EMEA was $313 million in the fiscal first quarter, down 6 percent on-year.\n\nStarbucks' Italian foray isn't the first time the company has bearded an entrenched coffee culture. In 2013, the company opened outlets in Vietnam, a country that not only has plentiful small, cheap cafes, but also its own more-upscale chains, including Trung Nguyen. Starbucks doesn't break out its performance in Vietnam in its results.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Coffee giant Starbucks is finally ready to take its Americanized version of Italian coffees back to Italy, with its first outlet set to open in early 2017.", "news_keywords": "starbucks, italy, coffee, milan, expansion", "author": "Leslie Shaffer", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Coffee giant Starbucks is taking its Americanized version of Italian coffees back to Italy, with its first outlet set to open in early 2017.", "title": "Starbucks to give Italy a shot \u2026 or two", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/28/starbucks-to-open-store-in-milan-italy-with-partner-percassi-in-early-2017.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/11/09/103152478-IMG_8350-1.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Coffee giant Starbucks is taking its Americanized version of Italian coffees back to Italy, with its first outlet set to open in early 2017.", "creator": "@LeslieShaffer1", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/28/starbucks-to-open-store-in-milan-italy-with-partner-percassi-in-early-2017.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/11/09/103152478-IMG_8350-1.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "Starbucks to open store in Milan, Italy, with partner Percassi in early 2017", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Food and Beverage, Asia: News, Coffee, Food Retail, Retail, Restaurants, Consumer Discretionary, United States, Milan, Italy, Consumer, Starbucks Corp, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-02-28T21:51:23-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Food and Beverage", "modified_time": "2016-02-29T08:18:01-0500", "tag": "Starbucks Corp"}, "pageNodeId": 103426154, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "article_summary": "Italy's population is around 62 million, compared with about 321 million in the U.S.\nStarbucks' Italian foray isn't the first time the company has bearded an entrenched coffee culture.\nThat may also be a draw for professionals in the country, as Italian coffee shops sometimes charge extra for seating at tables, as opposed to standing-room areas.\nIn a deal with Percassi, an Italian brand manager, the first Starbucks outlet will open in Milan early next year, with stores to be rolled out in cities across the country later.\nItaly also already has a dominant play, Luigi Lavazza, with a 37 percent share of retail value in 2015, Euromonitor said."}
