He said the House would easily have enough votes to pass a repeal bill, but said that even with the majority he wasn\u2019t sure it would pass the Senate.\n\nIn that case, he listed three provisions of Obamacare he would work to get rid of outside of a full repeal of the law.\n\n\u201cJust because we might not be able to get everything we want doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t try to get what we can,\u201d Boehner said. \u201c\u2026There are bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate to take some of these issues out of ObamaCare. We need to put them on the president\u2019s desk and let him choose.\u201d\n\nThe things he would get rid of include the medical device tax and the Independent Payment Advisory Board. He also promised to take on the individual mandate, in direct contrast to Obama\u2019s speech Wednesday. Obama called it \u201ca line I can\u2019t cross.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn health care, there are certainly some lines I\u2019m going to draw. Repeal of the law I won\u2019t sign. Efforts that would take away health care from the 10 million people who now have it and the millions more who are eligible to get it we\u2019re not going to support. In some cases there may be recommendations that Republicans have for changes that would undermine the structure of the law, and I\u2019ll be very honest with them about that and say, look, the law doesn\u2019t work if you pull out that piece or that piece,\u201d Obama said at his post-election press conference.\n\n\u201cThe individual mandate is a line I can\u2019t cross because the concept, borrowed from Massachusetts, from a law instituted by a former opponent of mine, Mitt Romney, understood that if you\u2019re providing health insurance to people through the private marketplace, then you\u2019ve got to make sure that people can\u2019t game the system and just wait until they get sick before they go try to buy health insurance. You can\u2019t ensure that people with preexisting conditions can get health insurance unless you also say, while you\u2019re healthy, before you need it, you\u2019ve got to get health insurance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio gestures during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Nov. 6, 2014.
