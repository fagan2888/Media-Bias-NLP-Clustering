But according to the book, Paul seemed intent on bolstering the GOP leadership\u2019s \u201cskeptical attacks,\u201d which were \u201cdeliberately designed to undermine our efforts.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI marveled that Rand had decided not to be with us in this fight,\u201d Cruz charges in \u201cA Time for Truth.\u201d\n\nPaul, however, says that account isn\u2019t exactly truthful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s curious because he sent me a really nice, handwritten congratulatory note thanking me for my help,\u201d Paul told POLITICO last week. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nCruz portrays himself in his book as the rare creature in Washington who\u2019s willing to call out his own party in public and confront fellow Republicans when the cameras aren\u2019t rolling, too. But in interviews last week, some of his GOP colleagues challenged assertions in Cruz\u2019s tell-it-like-it-is memoir, which could undermine the Texas Republican\u2019s claim of authenticity.\n\nWhen he accepted a top job at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Cruz writes, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u201cpromised\u201d that the party committee would stay out of GOP primary fights, including to defend Republican incumbents against conservative challengers. But top Republicans question that assertion, noting that the NRSC\u2019s mission has long been to protect incumbents \u2014 and that has never been in dispute.\n\nThe 44-year-old Cruz, who is running for president, also writes that \u201cmembers of the GOP leadership\u201d made it \u201cclear\u201d to Washington lobbyists and corporate political action committees that they would be \u201cfrozen out\u201d if they gave campaign cash to the Texas freshman. Yet Republican leaders strongly deny that\u2019s the case.\n\n\u201cAny suggestion that Leader McConnell intervened to \u2018freeze out\u2019 potential supporters of Sen. Cruz is pure fantasy,\u201d said Brian McGuire, a top aide to McConnell. \u201cThe leader\u2019s primary political objective in the last cycle, as any close observer will attest, was to build and preserve a Republican majority in the Senate.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question Cruz has made his mark in the Senate as a persistent thorn in the side of his party leadership. He has frequently derided their tactics openly \u2014 whether over the Obamacare fight that prompted the government shutdown, the 2014 battle with his party over raising the debt ceiling or how to target the president\u2019s immigration policies last winter. It\u2019s one of the chief points he makes on the campaign trail: He\u2019s leading a movement of \u201ccourageous conservatives\u201d battling entrenched politicians of both parties.\n\nCruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier contends that the book\u2019s accounts are accurate.\n\n\u201cIt comes as no surprise to anyone that the Washington cartel would deny the surreptitious tactics it employs to enrich itself at the expense of the American people,\u201d Frazier wrote in an email. \u201cSen. Cruz stands by everything he has written in his book.\u201d\n\nAs primary season heads into full swing, Cruz\u2019s divisive tactics are bound to get more scrutiny \u2014 something his GOP foes believe will ultimately hurt the Texas firebrand among more mainstream Republican primary voters.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, his tactics are not bearing fruit for the party,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a presidential candidate, referring to the 2013 Obamacare fight in particular. \u201cFor him to be the standard-bearer, you\u2019d have to show some judgment different than he\u2019s shown in the past.\u201d\n\nPerhaps nothing defines Cruz\u2019s brief tenure as a senator more than his fight against his party on Obamacare in 2013. He, along with Utah Sen. Mike Lee, demanded that Republicans insist that any bill to keep the government open also include provisions defunding the Affordable Care Act. It prompted the 16-day government shutdown and a bitter feud within the GOP.\n\nBut Cruz has long been unapologetic, blaming Senate Republican leaders for signaling to President Barack Obama they would \u201cgive him everything he wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you wait for Senate Republican leadership, you will never stop Obamacare,\u201d Cruz writes in the book.\n\nDuring his marathon floor speech, Cruz got an assist from a handful of Republicans, whom he praises, including the \u201csteady\u201d Kansan Pat Roberts, and Florida senator and 2016 rival Marco Rubio.\n\nBut he reserves a section to ding Paul, who is also seeking the GOP nomination. While Paul supported the strategy to defund Obamacare, signing his name to a Lee-Cruz letter in the run-up to the shutdown, he was noticeably quiet during the course of the fight.\n\nDuring his marathon speech, Cruz recalled Paul asking: \u201c\u2018Do you want to shut down the government or would you like to find something to make Obamacare less bad?\u2019 And, \u2018Will you accept a compromise?\u2019 \u2018Will you work with the president?\u2019\u201d\n\nSuch comments, Cruz says, perplexed him and Lee.\n\nCruz added: \u201cMike Lee is not an easily excitable guy, but he was so upset by this that I thought he was going to need a sedative.\u201d\n\nLee spokesman Conn Carroll declined to comment.\n\nA review of the transcript of the September 2013 exchange between Paul and Cruz, however, suggests it was more amiable than the Texas senator described. The two men praised each other repeatedly. Paul contended that Cruz was doing a \u201cgood job\u201d promoting the campaign to defund Obamacare, which the Kentucky freshman also said he supported. When Paul asked whether Cruz was trying to shut down the government, it seemed to be a way of allowing the Texan to pin the blame on Obama and Senate Democrats instead.\n\n\u201cThe question Sen. Rand Paul asked was an excellent question,\u201d Cruz said during the September 2013 speech. \u201cHis question was whether I or anyone here wishes to shut down the government. The answer is absolutely not.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Cruz officials pointed to remarks Paul made to Fox News in November 2013 in which the Kentucky Republican said, \u201cEven though it appeared I was participating [in the shutdown fight], it was a dumb idea.\u201d\n\nFrazier, the Cruz spokeswoman, said: \u201cThe senator has great respect for Rand, but his words speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign did not dispute that the senator sent Paul a handwritten congratulatory note.\n\nCruz also accuses McConnell of maneuvering behind the scenes to hurt him politically. Cruz did see a dip in his donations from D.C.-area PACs immediately after the Obamacare filibuster \u2014 from $60,000 in his first eight months as a senator to $10,000 in the year after the speech. But his book offers no evidence of being frozen out by the Washington donor community at the behest of GOP leadership. Cruz is showcasing serious fundraising prowess, hauling in $14.2 million fundraising for his presidential campaign.\n\nCruz also writes that McConnell misled him when he offered him a job as vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee for the 2014 election cycle.\n\n\u201cHe promised that the committee would stay out of primaries from here on out,\u201d Cruz writes. \u201cBut it soon became clear that the NRSC had every intention of supporting incumbents \u2014 in primaries \u2014 against conservative challengers across the country. And in open races, it actively urged donors to give money to candidates opposing tea party conservatives. That didn\u2019t sit right with me. \u2026 It was yet another lesson: Assurances in Washington come with expiration dates.\u201d\n\nJosh Holmes, former chief of staff for McConnell, said there were no \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d at the time Cruz accepted the position that \u201cthe first job of the NRSC is to protect incumbent Republicans in primary and general elections.\u201d\n\nThe senior Texas senator, Republican John Cornyn, who serves as McConnell\u2019s chief deputy, had a similar assessment.\n\n\u201cI would say as a former chairman of the NRSC for two cycles, it is always the responsibility of the chairman to help incumbents get reelected \u2014 that includes in contested primaries,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\nBut did he ever try to clamp down on Cruz\u2019s campaign cash?\n\n\u201cCertainly that wasn\u2019t something I did,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\nOther GOP senators took issue less with Cruz\u2019s facts than what they called his willingness to break confidences to promote himself.\n\nIn the book\u2019s first chapter, Cruz recounts fellow Republicans \u201cangrily yelling\u201d at him for \u201ctelling the truth\u201d during a meeting about raising the debt ceiling. GOP elders, nervous about a default on the nation\u2019s debts, were willing to let the debt ceiling increase pass \u2014 but they didn\u2019t want their fingerprints on the bill for fear of angering the GOP base.\n\nCruz, however, said he could not countenance that request, insisting that it pass with a 60-vote threshold. That demand eventually forced GOP leaders and other Republicans to grudgingly vote to advance the measure.\n\nCruz highlighted the episode to make the case that many of his colleagues, particularly Senate GOP leaders, \u201cpose\u201d as staunch conservatives in public but then \u201cin private do little or nothing to advance those principles.\u201d\n\nSen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) said he was dismayed that a senator would reveal the caucus\u2019 off-the-record discussions.\n\n\u201cNo one is going to want to talk up something on a personal issue or a contentious issue if they think they are going to read about it the next day in the paper or it\u2019s going to be released in the press,\u201d Coats said. \u201cIt really undermines any sense of team or any sense of cooperation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Rand Paul takes issue with one anecdote, and another claim is called \u2018pure fantasy.\u2019", "title": "GOP senators challenge Cruz book claims", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/ted-cruz-2016-book-gop-senator-challenge-120067.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/13/150713_ted_cruz_book_2_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Obamacare,2016 Elections,Campaign 2016,Ted Cruz 2016,Campaigns,Affordable Care Act,Elections,Republicans,Biographies,Texas,Rand Paul,Rand Paul 2016,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Rand Paul takes issue with one anecdote, and another claim is called \u2018pure fantasy.\u2019", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a6f\"", "article_summary": "In his new book, Ted Cruz writes that Rand Paul let him down on Obamacare.\nBut Cruz has long been unapologetic, blaming Senate Republican leaders for signaling to President Barack Obama they would \u201cgive him everything he wanted.\u201d\u201cIf you wait for Senate Republican leadership, you will never stop Obamacare,\u201d Cruz writes in the book.\n\u201cHe promised that the committee would stay out of primaries from here on out,\u201d Cruz writes.\nBut his book offers no evidence of being frozen out by the Washington donor community at the behest of GOP leadership.\nThat demand eventually forced GOP leaders and other Republicans to grudgingly vote to advance the measure."}
