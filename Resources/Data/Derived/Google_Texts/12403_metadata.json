But if we were to be honest with ourselves, then whether or not we are still deserving of our founders\u2019 sacrifices is a fair question to examine, given recent developments.\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court grabbed President Obama by the bit and ruled thirteen consecutive times \u2014 sometimes unanimously \u2014 that he exceeded his authority on issues ranging from recess appointments to various coercive measures that force Americans to cede private property, personal choice and religious freedom. A panel of appellate judges also ordered the Obama administration to release a 40-page memo that outlined the president\u2019s legal justification for ordering the CIA to kill American citizens. But they did so only because Obama first claimed the memo was a state secret, but afterward made the political decision to leak a portion of it to his lackeys at NBC News.\n\nSadly, neither the court\u2019s justification nor the memo itself ever mentioned the Fifth Amendment. Our founding fathers, who knew all too well about the dangers of arbitrary and unjust punishment, enshrined due process into the Bill of Rights. The Administration of Justice Act passed by Parliament in 1774, which was punishment for the Boston Tea Party outlined in the more \u201ccomprehensive\u201d Coercive Acts, allowed Royal governors to order that trials of accused take place in Great Britain or other loyal regions within the Empire. Together, the colonists referred to Parliament\u2019s legislation as the Intolerable Acts.\n\nBut George Washington dubbed the Administration of Justice Act the \u201cMurder Act,\u201d and went on to lead a revolution to cast off such despotism. Our founding fathers would never have tolerated the execution of American citizens by executive fiat on the grounds a citizen \u201cmay be difficult to arrest,\u201d because they are abroad and \u201cdo not wear a uniform of an enemy combatant.\u201d\n\nPresidents from both parties have stretched the constitutional limits of executive power and expanded the size and scope of government for most of the twentieth century. They have done so at the expense of the people\u2019s power, which was constitutionally allocated to our state and national legislative bodies, mainly because voters have populated them with members who have not the virtue nor the courage and competence to stop them.\n\nFollowing the Hobby Lobby decision last week, Bill O\u2019Reilly said in his talking points memo that \u201cif one more liberal justice gets on the Supreme Court,\u201d then individual liberties are gone.\n\nHe\u2019s right.\n\nYet, most American voters don\u2019t understand the significance of the president\u2019s power to make judicial appointments, and the Senate too often is derelict in its duty to confirm justices that follow the Constitution. It is absolutely astounding that four of the nine justices on the highest court in the land believe religious freedom should take a back seat to the forced support of the abortion and prescription drug industries. But again, government is government, and government is tyrannical by its nature. In the end, we can only blame them for so much before we begin to look in the mirror at our own dereliction of civic duty.\n\nThe vast majority of voters never even consider the future make-up of the Supreme Court when deciding which candidate to vote for in presidential and Senate elections. And even if that changed in 2016, a large amount of American voters would still be persuaded by emotional and false arguments from people like Sandra Fluke. Aside from Megyn Kelly, a shamefully corrupt media not only refused to challenge the blatant falsehoods regurgitated by Fluke and others after the decision, but also helped to perpetuate them.\n\nSandra Fluke and those persuaded by her lies might be surprised to learn that religious activists were responsible for the Declaration at Seneca Falls, which resurrected the women\u2019s suffrage movement after it took second place to abolition; another movement established and carried out by evangelical Protestants who banded together as \u201cHoly Warriors\u201d against the evil enterprise of slavery. It was only because of the principles found in the Law\u2019s of Natural and Nature\u2019s God that our founders justified independence in the first place, and they were preached of in sermons in houses of God throughout the colonies.\n\nSo, how did a republic of self-governing states, largely made up of autonomous communities populated with empowered individuals, who focused on maintaining strong family units, end up succumbing to a strong, despotic centralized government?\n\nWhen the president and Congress expand government, which by nature further degrades individual liberties, they never step up to the microphone and tell the American people their true intention. No, I dare say not. Instead, it\u2019s always either some manufactured moral imperative, a \u201cnecessary\u201d government response to a manufactured crisis, or to protect us from some manufactured security threat.\n\nThe Sixteenth and Seventeenth Amendments, as was also the case with ObamaCare, were argued as moral imperatives. But rather than further the people\u2019s interest, they concentrated power in and around Washington D.C., and created careerism in the now-derelict Senate. The progressive pension reform movement to deal with the supposed crisis of superannuated workers, was completely manufactured and unwanted, but it sure was a nifty way to literally invent retirement, hurt the extended family and weaken the Protestant work ethic.\n\nI could go on and on, and each instance would be a revelation to most American voters. The bottom line is that we are pawning off what are necessary civic duties for those who wish to live in a free society to a government we naively believe we can control. Even worse, some of us know better, but for free contraceptives or a government check that doesn\u2019t even keep pace with inflation, or whatever the poison, we are willing to trade our liberties.\n\nThomas Jefferson wrote that a citizen has \u201cno right in opposition to his social duties.\u201d Or, in other words, if you want to be free, then you need to take responsibility for that freedom in every area of your life. Too many Americans aren\u2019t taking that responsibility, so I ask: Are we are no longer sufficiently virtuous to be free? Do we deserve the despotism that is barreling down upon us?\n\nHonestly, our founding fathers would say no, we aren\u2019t. Only 58 percent of Americans consider Independence Day to be one of the most important holidays, and a pathetic 44 percent say they didn\u2019t often feel proud to be American. Large majorities of American believe the country is headed in the wrong direction and that big government is the greatest threat today, yet only 28 percent said that America was the greatest nation on earth. How can expect we have what it takes to preserve freedom when so few of us think the only country on Earth built upon its principles is worth fighting for?\n\n\u201cI thank God that I have lived to see my country independent and free,\u201d Samuel Adams wrote after the American Revolution. \u201d She may long enjoy her freedom and independence if she will. It depends on her virtue.\u201d\n\nHappy Fourth of July, America. Maybe next year we will have virtue enough to come to the understanding why it was first called Independence Day.\n\nNote: Virtue is about sacrifice and personal responsibility, which too many of us are sorely lacking. But the good news is that virtue and charity is contagious.
