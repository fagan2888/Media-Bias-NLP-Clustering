The intersection of Broadway and Kolb has reopened after being closed most of the day in all directions as police investigated an accident scene.

A Tucson Police Department vehicle on a dispatched call, transporting a person, was traveling west on Broadway just before 8 a.m. and made a left turn onto South Kolb. As he was completing the turn, he ran into a pedestrian who was crossing the road heading east, according to TPD Sgt. Pete Dugan, department spokesman.



The officer immediately stopped and began to render first aid. The Tucson Fire Department responded and transported the pedestrian, a man in his 20s, with life-threatening injuries, which have since been stabilized, medical staff tell the TPD.



The officer and his passenger were uninjured.

Traffic detectives were on scene much of the day, but the intersection has finally opened again, Dugan said.
