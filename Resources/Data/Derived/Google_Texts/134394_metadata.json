And we expect them to be early buyers of our 30-centimeter imagery.\u201d\n\nThe satellite, roughly the size of a small RV, was built by Boulder-based Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. and launched by Centennial-based United Launch Alliance without delay during its launch window.\n\nFrom its location nearly 382 miles up, the satellite is now able to return pictures of a baseball game that clearly shows home plate and how many players are on the field.\n\nBut the company hopes \u2014 and needs \u2014 Wednesday\u2019s launch of WorldView-3 to be about more than just pretty photos. The satellite returns 4 terabytes of data every day. Without analysis, the raw data can be overwhelming and not useful information.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t say this will automatically create a boon for the company. At a certain point, you aren\u2019t really gaining new market share unless you are creating new applications,\u201d said Marco Caceres, a senior space analyst with Teal Group.\n\nThat is why DigitalGlobe\u2019s leadership has begun shifting its business focus on what it calls \u201cgeospatial big data,\u201d or usable insight that is gleaned from its powerful viewpoint from space.\n\nBall Aerospace built a new tool on this satellite that is capable of reading soil composition to tell users what natural resources could be beneath the surface at different locations.\n\nAnother instrument is about to see through hazy skies and smoke, which can be used to see where new hot spots are flaring up in the hopes of containing wildfires and saving firefighters\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cThis is a satellite that will make a big difference for our country and this world,\u201d Tarr said. \u201cWe are building a business in Colorado that is maniacal about our vision and purpose, which is seeing a better world, and WorldView-3 is a giant leap forward.\u201d\n\nAnd while DigitalGlobe is breathing a sigh of relief for a successful launch of its 6,200-pound spacecraft, the leadership is staying on the offense.\n\nTarr announced during its earnings call two weeks ago that the company is hastening the launch of its next high-resolution satellite, WorldView-4, now scheduled for 2016.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a window of opportunity here until the next company comes up with something comparable,\u201d Caceres said.\n\n\u201cThis is by no means the end of advances in technology.\u201d\n\nKristen Leigh Painter: 303-954-1638, kpainter@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "United Launch Alliance puts DigitalGlobe\u2019s WorldView-3 in orbit", "title": "United Launch Alliance puts DigitalGlobe\u2019s WorldView-3 in orbit", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/13/united-launch-alliance-puts-digitalglobes-worldview-3-in-orbit/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140731__bz15DIGITALGLOBEHHR_5930p1-1.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140731__bz15DIGITALGLOBEHHR_5930p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-13T13:11:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:10:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe believe we have a 10-year technological lead on our nearest competitor,\u201d DigitalGlobe CEO Jeffrey Tarr told The Denver Post.\nBut the company hopes \u2014 and needs \u2014 Wednesday\u2019s launch of WorldView-3 to be about more than just pretty photos.\nTarr announced during its earnings call two weeks ago that the company is hastening the launch of its next high-resolution satellite, WorldView-4, now scheduled for 2016.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a window of opportunity here until the next company comes up with something comparable,\u201d Caceres said.\n\u201cGoogle is one of our customers, and just about every provider of Internet-based maps is a customer of ours."}
