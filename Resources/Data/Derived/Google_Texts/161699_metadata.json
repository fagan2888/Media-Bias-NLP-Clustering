However, researchers in France suggest these feelings of apprehension and dread can actually have unexpected neurological benefits. Their recent study, published in the journal eLife, found anxious people\u2019s brains react to threats in a different action-related region of their brains than those who are more laid back. This in turn allows them to fare better during a crisis.\n\nSpecific regions of the human brain react to social threats quickly and automatically \u2014 within 200 milliseconds. Anxious individuals, however, tend to show increased sensitivity to these threats, as well as to negative emotions overall. Past studies have suggested anxiety could lead to an oversensitivity to threat signals, which in turn could impair how the brain processes threats. Rather than responding only when necessary, the anxious person remains in a state of permanent anxiousness, which impairs their ability to react quickly and causes them to be \u201cfrozen\u201d in fear. The current study, however, found having anxiety actually allows these threat signals to reach the brain\u2019s motor cortex more rapidly \u2014 triggering a fight-or-flight response.\n\nFor their study, lead author Marwa El Zein, of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research, and her colleagues measured electrical signals in 24 participants\u2019 brains with an electroencephalogram (EEG). Each was asked to decide whether digitally altered faces expressed anger or fear \u2014 both expressions were meant to be perceived as threatening. While all faces showed the same expression, some had the eyes altered, so they were looking away from the camera.\n\nThe results showed anxious people processed threats in regions of their brains responsible for action, while less anxious people processed them in their sensory circuits, which are responsible for facial recognition. The researchers found the direction of the people\u2019s gaze in the images was key to enhancing participants\u2019 sensitivity to their own emotions. When the gaze was directed at the camera, it produced a response in participants' brains far faster than when it was looking elsewhere.\n\n\"In a crowd, you will be most sensitive to an angry face looking toward you and will be less alert to an angry person looking somewhere else,\" El Zein said.\n\nAlthough it should be obvious people are more likely to respond to something directed at them, the neurological reason for why this happened was poorly understood, until now. The researchers suggested this reaction to anger is an adaptive mechanism meant to help with survival. When humans evolved alongside dangerous predators, for example, this rapid reaction prevented injury or death.\n\nA 2012 study supports this theory; anxiety, along with intelligence, coevolved as beneficial traits to enhance one\u2019s chances of survival. Study author Dr. Jeremy Coplan said, \u201cWhile excessive worry is generally seen as a negative trait and high intelligence as a positive one, worry may cause our species to avoid dangerous situations, regardless of how remote a possibility they may be.\u201d\n\nSo, while anxious people may avoid taking risks, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019re the ones who will survive longer.\n\nSources: El Zein M, Wyart V, and Grezes J.
