Stan Lee of Lexington and David Meade of Stanford, both Republicans, said in a news release that their bill also seeks to \u201cprotect ministers and churches from civil and criminal liability\u201d for declining to marry same-sex couples, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported.\n\n>>> Can Court Clerks Refuse to Do Gay Marriages? How It\u2019s Playing Out\n\nAnother Republican lawmaker, Rep. Addia Wuchner of Burlington, last week introduced a bill to protect religious leaders who will not perform same-sex marriages.\n\nWuchner said her bill would prevent the state from coercing religious figures or organizations, and would protect them from being sued for refusing to conduct such weddings.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t say people have fear, but there certainly is heightened concern about what the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling really means,\u201d she told the newspaper, referring to the high court\u2019s 5-4 decision June 26 legalizing same-sex marriage across the nation.\n\n\u201cThe Kentucky legislation is an important supplement to existing religious liberty protections.\u201d\u2013@AllianceDefends\u2019 Jim Campbell\n\nThe legislation offered by Lee and Meade follows continued debate in Kentucky and elsewhere about the First Amendment freedom of county clerks and employees to have someone else process a license for a same-sex couple if their faith recognizes marriage only as the union of a man and a woman.\n\n>>> Download the e-book version of \u201cTruth Overruled: The Future of Marriage and Religious Freedom.\u201d (Paperback will be available end of August, but may be pre-ordered.)\n\n\u201cThe Kentucky legislation is an important supplement to existing religious-liberty protections in the state,\u201d Jim Campbell, a senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom and director of the Christian legal organization\u2019s Center for Marriage and Family, told The Daily Signal. \u201cIt provides an additional measure of protection for county clerks who seek to live consistent with their sincere belief that marriage is the union of a man and a woman.\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis for stopping the flow of all marriage licenses.\n\nA federal judge on Monday delayed a hearing on the case until July 20 at the earliest, the Associated Press reported, because the ACLU had yet to formally notify Davis of the suit by two gay couples and two straight couples.\n\nDistrict Judge David Bunning said he sees a conflict between the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of religion and the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection for all under the law.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas noted the conflict in his dissent to the high court\u2019s ruling, Bunning said.\n\n\u201cThomas may very well be a prophet,\u201d he said.\n\nRoger Gannam, a lawyer for Davis and senior litigator for Liberty Counsel, accused the ACLU of being interested only in making a political point:\n\nThe ACLU [isn\u2019t] really concerned in the marriages of their clients. The plaintiffs can get married in at least 117 if not 118 counties in the state of Kentucky if they want to. This case was about targeting a person of faith to make a point that everyone must comply with the agenda to impose same-sex marriage on all of America.\n\nDan Canon, an ACLU lawyer, said the four couples were not targeting anyone but rather want to get a marriage license in the county where they live and pay taxes.\n\nWuchner\u2019s bill, although not drafted to apply outside a religious setting, also could affect and protect some public officials, the Courier-Journal reported. It would modify a law allowing some judges to \u201csolemnize\u201d a marriage in a religious sense.\n\n\u201cThis would not cover clerks, however, and they would still need to issue marriage licenses,\u201d Wuchner said.\n\nThis report has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three legislators propose changes allowing them to decline to issue licenses for, or to solemnize, same-sex marriages on religious grounds.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Three legislators propose changes allowing them to decline to issue licenses for, or to solemnize, same-sex marriages on religious grounds.", "title": "Ky.
