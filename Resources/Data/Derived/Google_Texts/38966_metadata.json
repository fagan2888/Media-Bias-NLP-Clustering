(Photo: Photo courtesy Deb Waldstein)\n\nTo all who knew Adam \"Lenny\" Veenstra, the Waldstein and Veenstra families would like to express our sincerest appreciation for your acts of kindness in remembrance of our son and brother.\n\nThe outpouring of love for one person was unbelievable. Comments and condolences on Facebook.com, WausauDailyHerald.com, and Helke.com websites lit up with your tributes. The service at Highland Community Church was standing room only and we unfortunately don't have all the names or addresses of everyone who participated. His friends at Hiawatha offered a \"Lenny Fest\" and \"Lenny's Sunday Funday\" in commemoration of his smile, love and loyalty, and the toothpick that was a constant in his mouth. It is too difficult to mention everything done, but please know how much everything was appreciated.\n\nWe will miss Adam more than anyone can imagine. We must remember the light and happiness he brought to our lives and we thank you all again for your kindness.\n\n\n\nOur sincerest thanks,\n\n\n\nDeb and Dan Waldstein Family\n\nFred and Halle Veenstra Family\n\nKyle and Kate Veenstra Family\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1F6QmDG", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Waldstein and Veenstra families would like to express our sincerest appreciation for your acts of kindness in remembrance of our son and brother.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "The Waldstein and Veenstra families would like to express our sincerest appreciation for your acts of kindness in remembrance of our son and brother.", "title": "Mom: Support after death unbelievable", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/2015/09/18/mom-support-after-death-unbelievable/72405554/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Waldstein and Veenstra families would like to express our sincerest appreciation for your acts of kindness in remembrance of our son and brother.", "title": "Mom: Support after death unbelievable", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fc5f3655f3128449e0b6ff77bf217f7a982f1ef0/c=91-0-639-548&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/18/WIGroup/Wausau/635781796408060046-image1.JPG", "creator": "@wausauherald", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "adam \"lenny\" veenstra, wausau letters, adam veentstra, lenny veenstra"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc508\"", "article_summary": "Adam \"Lenny\" Veenstra died Monday, Sept. 7.\nOur sincerest thanks,Deb and Dan Waldstein FamilyFred and Halle Veenstra FamilyKyle and Kate Veenstra FamilyRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1F6QmDG\nThe outpouring of love for one person was unbelievable.\n(Photo: Photo courtesy Deb Waldstein)To all who knew Adam \"Lenny\" Veenstra, the Waldstein and Veenstra families would like to express our sincerest appreciation for your acts of kindness in remembrance of our son and brother.\nComments and condolences on Facebook.com, WausauDailyHerald.com, and Helke.com websites lit up with your tributes."}
