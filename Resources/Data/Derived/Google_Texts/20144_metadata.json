Democratic appointees also become more liberal, but at a slower pace than Republican appointees.\n\nThe blog looked at justices currently on the court, and found that many are moving to the left, including the Democratic appointees. According to the blog: \u201cJustice Anthony Kennedy, who joined the court in 1988, has historically had a score solidly to the right of center, but last term he found himself slightly to the left for the first time. Justice Stephen Breyer has drifted from just left of center to solid liberal. Even Justice Antonin Scalia has liberalized somewhat from his extremely conservative positions in the late 1990s.\u201d\n\nThe blog notes conservative disenchantment with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who voted twice to uphold the Affordable Care Act. His voting record shows he has \u201cdrifted slightly leftward,\u201d the blog says.\n\nIn a story published last week, the New York Times reported on a study of Roberts\u2019 voting patterns in the last decade. The chief justice voted a conservative direction 58 percent of the time in the last decade, but in 5-4 cases he voted in a conservative direction 85 percent of the time, making him the most conservative justice in closely divided cases.\n\nFiveThirtyEight cites several possible reasons for the justices\u2019 leftward drift, including the possibility that they are influenced by liberal news coverage, by ideas picked up while overseas, and by greater exposure to a wide range of people. The blog assessed the liberality or conservatism of the justices\u2019 ideology by using the Martin-Quinn scores developed by Kevin M. Quinn, a law professor at UC Berkeley School of Law, and Andrew D. Martin, dean of the University of Michigan\u2019s College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.\n\nRelated article:\n\nABA Journal: \u201cNew Theories of Evolution\u201d\n\nSee also:\n\nABA Journal: \u201cJohn Roberts marks 10 years as chief justice by taking the long view\u201d", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "dcterms.description": "Many current justices on the U.S. Supreme Court are becoming more liberal as they age, according to an analysis of their votes on cases.The statics blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/supreme-court-justices-get-more-liberal-as-they-get-older/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt; looked at", "description": "Many current justices on the U.S. Supreme Court are becoming more liberal as they age, according to an analysis of their votes on cases.The statics blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/supreme-court-justices-get-more-liberal-as-they-get-older/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt; looked at", "application-name": "ABA Journal", "author": "Debra Cassens Weiss", "og": {"site_name": "ABA Journal", "description": "Many current justices on the U.S. Supreme Court are becoming more liberal as they age, according to an analysis of their votes on cases.The statics blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/supreme-court-justices-get-more-liberal-as-they-get-older/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt; looked at", "title": "Supreme Court justices become more liberal as they age, statistics blog says", "url": "http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/supreme_court_justices_become_more_liberal_as_they_age_statistics_blog_says/", "image": "http://www.abajournal.com/images/topic_images/scotus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.rights": "\u00a9 2004-2016", "twitter": {"description": "Many current justices on the U.S. Supreme Court are becoming more liberal as they age, according to an analysis of their votes on cases.The statics blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/supreme-court-justices-get-more-liberal-as-they-get-older/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt; looked at", "title": "Supreme Court justices become more liberal as they age, statistics blog says"}, "robots": "All", "dcterms.creator": "ABA Journal", "keywords": "ABA Journal, legal news, law, U.S. Supreme Court, Judiciary, Supreme Court Nominations", "dcterms.contributor": "Debra Cassens Weiss", "dcterms.title": "Supreme Court justices become more liberal as they age, statistics blog says"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd91f6\"", "article_summary": "Home Daily News Supreme Court justices become more liberal\u2026U.S. Supreme CourtSupreme Court justices become more liberal as they age, statistics blog saysMany current justices on the U.S. Supreme Court are becoming more liberal as they age, according to an analysis of their votes on cases.\nThe statics blog FiveThirtyEight looked at ideological scores of Republican- and Democratic-appointed justices since 1937, and found that Republican appointees become more liberal.\nThe blog looked at justices currently on the court, and found that many are moving to the left, including the Democratic appointees.\nThe chief justice voted a conservative direction 58 percent of the time in the last decade, but in 5-4 cases he voted in a conservative direction 85 percent of the time, making him the most conservative justice in closely divided cases.\nAccording to the blog: \u201cJustice Anthony Kennedy, who joined the court in 1988, has historically had a score solidly to the right of center, but last term he found himself slightly to the left for the first time."}
