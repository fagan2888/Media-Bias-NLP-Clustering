Tomorrow is Christmas but not everyone will have a roof over their head and a hot holiday meal to enjoy with family. Once again the Panama City Rescue Mission has jumped in to help.

Volunteers and staff provided a Christmas Eve lunch complete with all the fixings. Those who took advantage of the generosity say they are grateful.

It was all smiles and appreciation at the Rescue Mission on Christmas Eve morning. At 11 am lunch was served.

"I love it I love them all, yeah, it’s great,” said Billy Bray.

The Panama City Rescue Mission puts together a Christmas Eve lunch every year. People here say they're just grateful to have a cooked meal.

Willie Clark was raised in Panama City. He says this is not his first time eating a Christmas Eve meal at the Rescue Mission.

"It’s cool because a lot of people don't really have you know people around or you know or they don't have food at the moment or whatever I mean it’s cool,” said Clark.

Clark is an Army Veteran. He says usually stays with family members but this Christmas is a little different.

"Got into a little situation where I got to be here for a minute so….Spending the time here and enjoying the benefits,” Clark said.

About 35 community members helped out with this year's lunch. They helped cook and serve a classic Christmas dinner with all the fixings.

"I heard about the Rescue Mission so this past Thanksgiving we decided that we would serve and of course came back here today,” said Beverly Linton, Volunteer.

About 100 homeless people attended Christmas Eve lunch. People like Clark say that everyone should know what this holiday season is about.

"Just remember the reason for the season, Jesus Christ, look out for your brothers and sisters,” Clark said.

If anyone needs shelter Christmas Eve or Christmas their doors will be open from 6 am to 9 pm.
