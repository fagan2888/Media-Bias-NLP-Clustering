The open-world adventure is providing players with the power to choose exactly how Snake embarks on his missions.\n\n\u201cPhantom Pain,\u201d which is scheduled for release Sept. 1, is essentially a tale of revenge. The game centers on a battered and bruised Snake (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) setting off on horseback to rebuild his private army in Cold War-era Afghanistan.\n\nAfter recently spending several hours with \u201cPhantom Pain,\u201d here are a few of the most dramatic changes coming to the franchise:\n\n___\n\nOPENING ACT\n\nBefore he\u2019s unleashed on the open world, Snake mysteriously awakens in a medical facility after being in a coma for nearly a decade following the events of \u201cGround Zeroes,\u201d a stand-alone prologue released last year. The first chapter focuses on Snake\u2019s harrowing pursuit by the series\u2019 most supernatural baddies, yet all while he\u2019s wearing nothing but a flimsy hospital gown.\n\n___\n\nCHOOSE OR LOSE\n\nThe saga is divided into chapters, each with its own opening and closing credits. However, \u201cPhantom Pain\u201d leaves Snake\u2019s strategies mostly up to players to decide, rewarding them for being as sneaky and resourceful as possible. It\u2019s possible for Snake to go with guns blazing into enemy territory, but that won\u2019t necessarily net him the best upgrades for his bionic arm or base.\n\n___\n\nALL ABOUT THAT BASE\n\n\u201cPhantom Pain\u201d is as much about supply management as it is snooping around. Snake can slyly tether balloons to enemies, vehicles, munitions and more in order to send them back to his headquarters, Mother Base. As he collects supplies, his floating enclave will prosper. For example, Snake won\u2019t be able to interrogate foes until he\u2019s actually recruited an interpreter.\n\n___\n\nNOW THAT\u2019S WHAT I CALL MUSIC\n\nApparently, music will play a vital role in \u201cPhantom Pain,\u201d which is set in the 1980s. That\u2019s evidenced by tunes from such artists as Billy Idol and A-Ha pumping out from boom boxes tucked within bases. Snake can also create his own retro mixtapes. What better way to prepare for combat than to blast David Bowie\u2019s \u201cDiamond Dogs\u201d on the helicopter ride into battle?\n\n___\n\nMY BUDDY AND ME\n\nSnake won\u2019t totally be alone on the front lines. After securing or recruiting them, he\u2019s able to call on such \u201cbuddies\u201d - as they\u2019re known in the game - as a trained attack dog, mechanized robot walker and assassin sidekick to accomplish his tasks. As with Snake\u2019s other equipment, the buddies can be outfitted with stuff like better armor and higher tech weapons.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://www.konami.com/mgs /\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Derrik J.
