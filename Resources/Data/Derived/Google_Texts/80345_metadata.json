(Mark Bolton/Union Leader) Manchester Monarchs goalie Patrik Bartosak makes a save on Toledo Walleye Dominic Zombo in the first period of their ECHL game at the Verizon Wirelesss Arena in Manchester Sunday. (Mark Bolton/Union Leader)\n\nMonarchs work OT and more for shootout win over Toledo\n\n\n\n\u2014 It took 65 minutes of hockey and a 10-round shootout, but the Manchester Monarchs made the grind pay off in the end on Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe Monarchs got a goal from UNH product Austin Block in the 10th round of the shootout and a save from Patrik Bartosak on the ensuing Toledo Walleye attempt, giving Manchester a 3-2 advantage in the shootout and a 4-3 victory in the rubber match of their three-game set at Verizon Wireless Arena.\n\n..\n\nGasper Kopitar and David Kolomatis also provided shootout goals for Manchester, which received two goals from Matt White and another from Joey Diamond during regulation.\n\n\n\nThe Monarchs had a 3-2 lead to start the third period until Toledo\u2019s AJ Jenks knotted the score five minutes in. The two teams couldn\u2019t decide the game through the final 15 minutes of regulation and the five-minute, 4-on-4 overtime period, which forced the shootout.\n\n..\n\nBlock, who had a couple good scoring chances fall through during regulation, watched as his team had varying degrees of success against Toledo goalie Jeff Lerg before Monarchs head coach Richard Seeley called the forward\u2019s number. After skating in from center ice, Block slowed up and leaned into a wrist shot from between the circles, which flew over Lerg\u2019s glove and in.\n\n..\n\n\u201cI try not to think about it too much,\u201d Block said. \u201cSome guys have their one move that they try. I just came down, picked an area, closed my eyes and shot it as hard as I could.\u201d\n\n\n\nBlock\u2019s snipe was only half of the equation though, as Bartosak needed to make the ensuing save on Toledo\u2019s Joel Chouinard. Bartosak, who made 25 stops during regulation and overtime, succeeded on his end, stoning Chouinard with a body stop after a few dekes. The Monarchs goalie saved seven of Toledo\u2019s first nine attempts, leaving the task no more daunting when Chouinard\u2019s attempt came around.\n\n..\n\n\u201cI was just looking at the speed he was going with and visualize the type of move he could make,\u201d Bartosak said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter if it was for the win or to keep the game going. It\u2019s just a save.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe effort in net during the shootout and preceding play was in contrast to Saturday night, when Bartosak was shelled by the Walleye in a 6-2 loss. Bartosak, who was playing in just his second game back with Manchester on a conditioning assignment from the Ontario Reign, made several highlight-reel stops, including a body and glove save on a pair of clean looks in the closing seconds of the second period to preserve a one-goal lead.\n\n..\n\n\u201cI was seeing the puck pretty well yesterday and they just got a couple lucky bounces and capitalized,\u201d Bartosak said. \u201cI didn\u2019t make any changes. I felt the exact same way today and just went out trying to do my best.\u201d\n\n..\n\nSeeley said he was not only pleased to see Bartosak bounce back after Saturday, but the team as a whole as well.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe effort was clearly there for me,\u201d Seeley said. \u201cGuys put their hearts out there tonight and went to work. Being able to outwork that club is the reason we won this tonight.\u201d\n\n..\n\nManchester looked primed to hold on in regulation after a solid second period. Trailing 2-1 into the middle frame, the Monarchs came out with new life and a heightened tempo that produced both of White\u2019s scores. Quick puck movement and a blistering wrist shot from the blue line produced White\u2019s first tally, while a transition that turned into a one-on-one chance with Lerg gave the wing his second.\n\n..\n\n\u201cWhen we are playing like that consistently and get the right shift lengths, we are a pretty good hockey club,\u201d Seeley said. \u201cYou have to do three or four other things to get to that tempo consistently, and those are things we are still working on as a group.\u201d\n\n..\n\njduball@unionleader.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Monarchs got a goal from UNH product Austin Block in the 10th round of the shootout and a save from Patrik Bartosak on the ensuing Toledo Walleye attempt, giving Manchester a 3-2 advantage in the shootout and a 4-3 victory in the rubber match of their three-game set at Verizon Wireless Arena.", "title": "Monarchs work OT and more for shootout win over Toledo | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "The Monarchs got a goal from UNH product Austin Block in the 10th round of the shootout and a save from Patrik Bartosak on the ensuing Toledo Walleye attempt, giving Manchester a 3-2 advantage in the shootout and a 4-3 victory in the rubber match of their three-game set at Verizon Wireless Arena.", "title": "Monarchs work OT and more for shootout win over Toledo | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/Monarchs-work-OT-and-more-for-shootout-win-over-Toledo", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20151115/SPORTS0702/151119441/AR/0/AR-151119441.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Monarchs", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "Monarchs, Manchester,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-11-15 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "The Monarchs got a goal from UNH product Austin Block in the 10th round of the shootout and a save from Patrik Bartosak on the ensuing Toledo Walleye attempt, giving Manchester a 3-2 advantage in the shootout and a 4-3 victory in the rubber match of their three-game set at Verizon Wireless Arena.", "title": "Monarchs work OT and more for shootout win over Toledo | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/Monarchs-work-OT-and-more-for-shootout-win-over-Toledo", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20151115/SPORTS0702/151119441/AR/0/AR-151119441.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "(Mark Bolton/Union Leader)Monarchs work OT and more for shootout win over Toledo\u2014 It took 65 minutes of hockey and a 10-round shootout, but the Manchester Monarchs made the grind pay off in the end on Saturday.\nManchester Monarchs goalie Patrik Bartosak makes a save on Toledo Walleye Dominic Zombo in the first period of their ECHL game at the Verizon Wirelesss Arena in Manchester Sunday.\n(Mark Bolton/Union Leader) Manchester Monarchs goalie Patrik Bartosak makes a save on Toledo Walleye Dominic Zombo in the first period of their ECHL game at the Verizon Wirelesss Arena in Manchester Sunday.\nThe Monarchs had a 3-2 lead to start the third period until Toledo\u2019s AJ Jenks knotted the score five minutes in.\n..Gasper Kopitar and David Kolomatis also provided shootout goals for Manchester, which received two goals from Matt White and another from Joey Diamond during regulation."}
