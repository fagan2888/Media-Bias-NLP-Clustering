While freedom of worship is a cornerstone of the American way, invoking religious freedom tends to electrify conservatives more than liberals.\n\nThus, this case also should be discussed in terms that energize the Left: The Little Sisters clutch the short end of the income-inequality stick. There is no economic justice in their abuse by Obama, heartless bureaucrats, and the dapper despots at Eric Holder\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nThis is a genuine example of the haves hammering the have-nots.\n\nLiterally.\n\n\u201cThe Little Sisters do their work for free,\u201d says Daniel Blomberg, legal counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents these nuns. \u201cThey are not paid salaries,\u201d Blomberg adds. \u201cEach Little Sister takes a vow of poverty. They don\u2019t personally own anything.\u201d\n\nRather than concentrate fully on the destitute senior citizens whom they have served since 1888, the Little Sisters are distracted by Team Obama\u2019s insistence that they genuflect before Obamacare\u2019s mandate to provide free contraceptives to all fertile women, regardless of income. As serious Catholics, the sisters oppose birth control, especially in their own health plan.\n\nIf they resist, Obama would slam the sisters with crippling fines of $100 per day per employee. This totals $36,500 annually, each. With 60 workers, for instance, the Little Sisters of Denver could be fined $2.2 million per annum \u2014 one third of their budget \u2014 unless they permitted Christian Brothers Services to cover contraceptives for these staffers.\n\n\u201cIf the Little Sisters pay these fines, that money would not go to help elderly people who are dying and can\u2019t care for themselves,\u201d Blomberg adds. \u201cInstead, these funds would go to the IRS.\u201d\n\nBlomberg also notes that Obamacare lets HIV medication prices increase. \u201cThere are no restrictions on co-pays for HIV drugs. Indeed, plans do not have to cover them. But contraceptives must be covered and totally free,\u201d Blomberg says. \u201cYou can die under the Affordable Care Act because you cannot afford your HIV medications, but birth control has to be gratis.\u201d\n\nThis outrageous policy assumes that women should get contraceptives for nothing, even when they can afford them, as most women did until Obama decided to give them away, like perfume samples. As Sarah Kliff wrote in last December 11\u2019s Washington Post, \u201cThe percent of women paying nothing for birth control grew from 15 percent in fall 2012 up to 40 percent in spring 2013.\u201d Even worse, Obama insists that the cost of these freebies should be borne, at least partially, by people who believe, wrongly or rightly, that contraception is evil.\n\nThe poster girl for this crusade is Sandra Fluke, the feminist attorney who screamed for free birth control in 2012, while studying law at Georgetown University. If Fluke earns the median private-sector starting salary for that school\u2019s graduates, Obama should explain why nuns who earn $0.00 annually should face millions in fines unless they accept a scheme that lets a woman who makes $160,000 enjoy birth control for $0.00.\n\nThis is uglier than a gargoyle.\n\n\u201cWomen at all income levels use the pill,\u201d says Dr. Lawrence B. Finer, director of domestic research at the Guttmacher Institute. \u201cBut pill use is more common among higher-income women than among lower-income women.\u201d Birth-control pills are the most popular female contraceptive.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with insurance,\u201d says Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at Northwestern University Law School. \u201cInsurance is designed to protect people against bad luck. This benefit is for getting lucky.\u201d\n\nContraceptives are neither rare nor expensive. Virtually every pharmacy is brimming with them. Plan B, a \u201cmorning after\u201d pill that may induce abortion, is available in college vending machines. Goodrx.com offers one-month supplies of 21 different oral contraceptives under $25.
