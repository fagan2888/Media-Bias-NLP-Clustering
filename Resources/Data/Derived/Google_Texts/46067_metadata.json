Bush, Iraq war, isis, Saddam Hussein, News, Politics News\n\nThere are in American life few really unassailable opinions\u2014especially when the calendar turns its depressed pages on primary season. That\u2019s when the circular firing squad fills the air with the tang of smoke and cordite. But sometimes you can find agreement, even in primary season. Sometimes you can even find something like unanimity.\n\nTed Cruz has won applause in recent debates by citing what is seen as America\u2019s last unambiguous victory. To defeat ISIS, he said, we should look to the first Gulf War. (Which ended 25 years ago today.) Cruz wants a repeat of that stormy desert operation, with its thousand-plus air attacks in 37 days \u2014and with all its attendant destruction. \u201cThere ain\u2019t much left\u201d to a place after such a campaign, Cruz said with a smile.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich has likewise argued that we\u2019d beat ISIS if we just called upon \u201cthe coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.\u201d Likewise, Donald Trump has been sure, when dismissing the Bush family legacy, to separate the calamities of the son from the victories of the father. Even Michael Dukakis, in an interview this month, praised how George H.W. Bush handled that war.\n\nSo, something that\u2019s lauded by everyone from Cruz to Dukakis to must be an unmitigated good, right? Well, maybe not. Let\u2019s take a look. It\u2019s not hard to see so many of our troubles getting their start in 1991\u2019s glowing sand.\n\nThe Gulf War\u2014that is, the effects-laden franchise opener, and not the bloated sequel\u2014did mark a great victory, by at least one measure. In turning back Saddam Hussein and liberating Kuwait, the United States lost 148 soldiers in combat; the Iraqi military in the same period endured up to 22,000 casualties. So, yes, of course: a victory. But of what kind?\n\nThe Gulf War marked the first time in the modern era that we sent our military to fight an Arab-world enemy. Think about that. What has seemed an awful but inescapable part of American foreign policy\u2014the drawn-out struggle against one Islamic foe or another\u2014began in that war. And our having waged that war is precisely what first inflamed the region\u2019s zealots against us. Think about that, too. Not many remember this, but what first motivated Osama bin Laden to attack the United States? It was intolerable to an Islamist such as bin Laden that\u2014because of the fight against Saddam\u2014there were \u201cinfidel\u201d American troops in Saudi Arabia, home of Islam\u2019s two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first Gulf War was not the good one, and 25 years later, as false history hardens, we must remember why", "title": "They\u2019re still lying about the first Gulf War: How the first George Bush helped create today\u2019s Middle East trouble", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The first Gulf War was not the good one, and 25 years later, as false history hardens, we must remember why", "title": "They\u2019re still lying about the first Gulf War: How the first George Bush helped create today\u2019s Middle East trouble", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/28/theyre_still_lying_about_the_first_gulf_war_how_the_first_george_bush_helped_create_todays_middle_east_trouble/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/bush_hussein.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The first Gulf War was not the good one, and 25 years later, as false history hardens, we must remember why", "title": "They\u2019re still lying about the first Gulf War: How the first George Bush helped create today\u2019s Middle East trouble", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/bush_hussein.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Darin Strauss", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, April Glaspie, Editor's Picks, george bush, George W.
