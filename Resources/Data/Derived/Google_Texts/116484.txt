The Seattle Times’ Sunday editorial discussed how the Affordable Care Act has the potential to reduce health disparities across Washington state and King County.

Below are two interactive maps that use the latest data available to show obvious differences between the northern and southern parts of the county.

The map on the left side shows the average rate of uninsured residents by ZIP code from 2008 to 2012. The darker the shade, the higher the rate of people without coverage. Click on each ZIP code to see the correlating percentage.

The map on the right side shows average life expectancy rates by ZIP code from 2006 to 2010. In this interactive, the darker the shade, the lower the life span. Again, click on each ZIP code to see the correlating figure.
