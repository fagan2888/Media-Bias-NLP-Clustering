NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) – UnitedHealthcare says it will no longer offer coverage to Tennesseans through the federally run health care exchange set up under the Affordable Care Act.

The Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance says it was notified by the insurance provider that they plan to only offer coverage in a handful of states next year. The change affects around 15.5 percent of those covered under the Affordable Care Act in Tennessee, or about 40,879 people.

“We’re disappointed about UnitedHealthcare’s decision to withdraw from the marketplace after joining last fall because of how the departure will impact consumers,” said TDCI Commissioner Julie Mix McPeak. “However, we understand that the company’s decision to withdraw is a business decision.”

Those covered by UnitedHealthcare currently will remain covered until December 31, but must choose a different provider when the next open enrollment period begins on November 1. Those insured by UnitedHealthcare through their employer or Medicaid or Medicare products are not affected.
