But could increase screening lead to treating cancer cases that don't need it?\n\nDoctors are screening for cancer now more than ever. But could increase screening lead to treating cancer cases that don't need it? Phil and Pam Gradwell (to be), CC BY 2.0\n\nWhen it comes to treating cancer, we\u2019ve made some pretty amazing advancements in recent years: Not only has technology advanced to better treat cancer at any stage, we have some of the most advanced screening methods that can pinpoint even the smallest of tumors. But is our screening and subsequent treatment process negatively impacting those with less severe forms of cancer? Some doctors are starting to think so.\n\nWhen doctors reference overdiagnosis, they often use thyroid cancer as a primary example. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), cases of thyroid cancer have been growing at an alarming rate: In 1992, only 5.9 per every 100,000 Americans had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer compared to 14.9 in 2012. This rate is two and a half times higher than it was just 20 years ago, the NCI said. However, the rate of people who have died of thyroid cancer has not changed since 1992. In fact, it\u2019s actually remained the same since 1935. So why are we hearing of more cases popping up now?\n\nAccording to a recent study published in the journal Thyroid, this increase can only be attributed to improved screening methods, not an increased incidence of cancer. Thanks to modern MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasound-guided biopsies, doctors are able to find any type of tumor, regardless of the size, better than ever before. But, the study found that these tumors may cause unnecessary alarm \u2014 in fact, the smaller ones are often not life-threatening at all. Some people can go without treatment and not experience a single symptom.\n\nYet, the screening process compels both doctors and patients to act, which can lead to unnecessary surgeries that can potentially cause health risks more dangerous than the actual tumor. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence that screening for thyroid cancer provides any benefit to the patients,\u201d lead study author Dr. Juan Brito Campana, an endocrinologist for the Mayo Clinic, told The Huffington Post.\n\nSurgically removing the thyroid (thyroidectomies) can be costly, both financially and physically. The researchers found that on average, Americans spend a total of $1.6 billion each year on treating thyroid cancer, with diagnosed patients being 2.5 times more likely to file for bankruptcy. Not to mention patients who have a thyroidectomy have to take replacement hormones for the rest of their life, which could also lead to complications; plus, surgeries in sensitive areas like the throat often come with risks.\n\nThat said, it's not just thyroid cancer that's overdiagnosed. Early detection may be essential in treating more aggressive cancers, but when it comes to more slow-growing forms, some doctors say we must take another approach. For example, many experts are starting to speak out against ovarian cancer screenings if women don't otherwise indicate development of the disease.\n\n\u201cEach individual person who is a missed diagnosis is a tragedy,\u201d Dr. Robin Fiore, a bioethicist of the University of Miami, told HuffPo. \u201cBut every individual person who has unnecessary surgery is a tragedy as well. And in some types of cancer, there are more of the latter than the former.\u201d\n\nThose opposed still believe screening is necessary, finding that the benefits are equal to the risks. Dr. Therese Bevers, a professor of clinical cancer prevention at Anderson Hospital in Houston, believes that we should focus more on the harms of over-screening, rather than getting rid of screening altogether.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that we're throwing the baby out with the bathwater,\" she said. \"Screening isn\u2019t a bad thing as long as we aren\u2019t treating thing that don\u2019t need to be treated.\"\n\nTo try and come up with a new approach to cancer screening, doctors are looking toward recent changes made in the process of detecting prostate cancer. In the early \u201890s, doctors commonly tested men over the age of 40 for a biomarker of the cancer, called the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). As a result, rates of prostate cancer skyrocketed, and doctors moved to treat all the new cases with more doses of radiation and prostate removal srugery, respectively. But overall, prostate cancer is often not a life-threatening illness. In fact, most tumors progress so slowly that men will often die of other causes without even knowing they had one.\n\nOnce it became apparent that prostate cancer treatment was doing more harm than good, the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force told doctors in 2012 that they should stop screening men for PSA. Since then, rates of prostate cancer diagnosis have slightly decreased.\n\nMany doctors are now electing to adapt the \u201cactive surveillance\u201d method in light of these recommendations. For example, Dr. Ashutosh Tewari, the chairman of urology at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, says that the tools used to screen for cancer can also be used to monitor the progression of the cancer with \"stunning accuracy,\" allowing doctors to see if treatment would be necessary.\n\n\u201cIn patients on surveillance, we do frequent imaging and genomic analysis on biopsies of the prostate, which can tell us if the cancer is low risk or high risk,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve found that in between 50 and 70 percent of patients, the cancer remains indolent.\u201d\n\nAs a result, more men are receiving treatment only when they need it. And though many still debate whether the current screening process is going a bit overboard, it seems that vigilant surveillance may be the best best. Treatment might not be necessary, but at least doctors will know if it becomes necessary down the line.\n\nSource: Brito J, Montori V, Hay ID, et al.
