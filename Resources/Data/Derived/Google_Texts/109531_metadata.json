Law\u00admakers will fi\u00adnally get to hear from Am\u00adbas\u00adsad\u00ador Thomas Pick\u00ader\u00ading and Adm. Mike Mul\u00adlen, the two re\u00adtired of\u00adfi\u00adcials who led the gov\u00adern\u00adment\u2019s in\u00adtern\u00adal re\u00adport on the mat\u00adter. Get\u00adting Mul\u00adlen and Pick\u00ader\u00ading in\u00adto the hot seat has taken five months of ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00adation and even a sub\u00adpoena, so they must be hid\u00ading something good, right?\n\nMaybe not. We have a pretty clear idea of what the two former of\u00adfi\u00adcials might say, since they sat with con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal in\u00advest\u00adig\u00adat\u00adors for be\u00adhind-closed-doors in\u00adter\u00adviews in June. We fi\u00adnally got to see the 355 pages of tran\u00adscribed testi\u00admony this week (read Mul\u00adlen\u2018s and Pick\u00ader\u00ading\u2018s here), but they\u2019ve so far gone largely un\u00adnoticed. A re\u00adview sug\u00adgests that House Over\u00adsight and Gov\u00adern\u00adment Re\u00adform Com\u00admit\u00adtee Chair\u00adman Dar\u00adrell Issa and oth\u00ader Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans will find no smoking guns in Thursday\u2019s hear\u00ading.\n\nFor in\u00adstance, there\u2019s the ques\u00adtion of wheth\u00ader the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion did everything it pos\u00adsibly could have to re\u00adspond to the at\u00adtack once it star\u00adted. Last month, Issa said in a ra\u00addio in\u00adter\u00adview that the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion hasn\u2019t ex\u00adplained why it didn\u2019t send air\u00adcraft, and sug\u00adges\u00adted that the pres\u00adid\u00adent and then-Sec\u00adret\u00adary of State Hil\u00adlary Rod\u00adham Clin\u00adton did not \u201cac\u00adtu\u00adally care about people in harm\u2019s way as they\u2019re be\u00ading at\u00adtacked by al Qaeda ele\u00adments.\u201d\n\nMul\u00adlen, however, told con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal in\u00advest\u00adig\u00adat\u00adors two months earli\u00ader there was simply noth\u00ading more the U.S. mil\u00adit\u00adary could have done. \u201c[We] looked at every single U.S. mil\u00adit\u00adary as\u00adset that was there, and what it pos\u00adsibly could have done, wheth\u00ader it could have moved or not. And it was in that in\u00adter\u00adac\u00adtion that I con\u00adcluded, after a de\u00adtailed un\u00adder\u00adstand\u00ading of what had happened that night, that from out\u00adside Libya, that we\u2019d done everything pos\u00adsible that we could,\u201d the former chair\u00adman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ex\u00adplained.\n\nHis in\u00adter\u00adlocutor fol\u00adlowed up: \u201cSo your con\u00adclu\u00adsion based on your ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adence, 40 years of ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adence, is that the mil\u00adit\u00adary and the U.S. Gov\u00adern\u00adment did everything that they could to re\u00adspond to the at\u00adtacks?\u201d Mul\u00adlen re\u00adspon\u00added, simply: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nWhy didn\u2019t the U.S. send an \u201cF-16 at low alti\u00adtude [to] fly over those people who were at\u00adtack\u00ading our con\u00adsu\u00adlate,\u201d as Sen. John Mc\u00adCain, R-Ar\u00adiz., asked in May on ABC\u2019s This Week? Be\u00adcause, Mul\u00adlen told in\u00advest\u00adig\u00adat\u00adors, the F-16 would need be re\u00adfueled at least twice, and that was im\u00adpossible at the time. The \u201cphys\u00adics of it, the real\u00adity of it, it just wasn\u2019t go\u00ading to hap\u00adpen for 12 to 20 hours,\u201d he said.\n\nHe ad\u00added that just be\u00adcause forces wer\u00aden\u2019t able to get there in time doesn\u2019t mean they wer\u00aden\u2019t try\u00ading. \u201cIt does not seem to be, at least from a pub\u00adlic stand\u00adpoint, widely un\u00adder\u00adstood, we moved a lot of forces that night,\u201d he told in\u00advest\u00adig\u00adat\u00adors.\n\nWhat about the no\u00adtion that Mul\u00adlen and Pick\u00ader\u00ading\u2019s re\u00adview wasn\u2019t in\u00adde\u00adpend\u00adent, as many Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans have claimed? Did he have full ac\u00adcess? Did he look at every\u00adone? \u201cWe had the au\u00adthor\u00adity to, with\u00adin the scope of the task\u00ading, to do just about any\u00adthing that we thought was im\u00adport\u00adant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe in\u00adter\u00adviewed every\u00adone that we thought was rel\u00adev\u00adant \u201c\u00a6 the most im\u00adport\u00adant de\u00adscript\u00adive char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adist\u00adic of it is that it would be in\u00adde\u00adpend\u00adent.\u201d\n\nWhat about Clin\u00adton? \u201cIn the end there was no of\u00adfi\u00adcial, in\u00adclud\u00ading the sec\u00adret\u00adary of state, whose in\u00advolve\u00adment wasn\u2019t re\u00adviewed,\u201d he replied. \u201cEvery\u00adbody was on the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found no evid\u00adence what\u00adso\u00adever that [Clin\u00adton] was in\u00advolved in se\u00adcur\u00adity de\u00adcisions\u201d about the com\u00adpound in Benghazi, Mul\u00adlen told in\u00advest\u00adig\u00adat\u00adors. \u201cShe did not have such a role,\u201d Pick\u00ader\u00ading ad\u00added. A re\u00adport is\u00adsued by Issa\u2019s of\u00adfice this week men\u00adtions Clin\u00adton\u2019s name 33 times.\n\nAnd those are just some of the more ser\u00adi\u00adous linger\u00ading ques\u00adtions about the at\u00adtack, not the more fanci\u00adful ones like the no\u00adtion that of\u00adfi\u00adcials told spe\u00adcial op\u00ader\u00adat\u00adors in coun\u00adtry to \u201cstand down.\u201d (On that one, here\u2019s the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan House Armed Ser\u00advices Com\u00admit\u00adtee Chair\u00adman Buck McK\u00adeon: \u201cCon\u00adtrary to news re\u00adports, [Lieu\u00adten\u00adant Col\u00adon\u00adel S.E.] Gib\u00adson was not ordered to \u2018stand down\u2019 by high\u00ader com\u00admand au\u00adthor\u00adit\u00adies \u2026 he would not have been able to get to Benghazi in time to make a dif\u00adfer\u00adence.\u201d)\n\nOf course, it\u2019s pos\u00adsible that Mul\u00adlen and Pick\u00ader\u00ading are ly\u00ading, but that gets us in\u00adto the realm of con\u00adspir\u00adacy the\u00adory, which is un\u00adfor\u00adtu\u00adnately where so much of the con\u00adver\u00adsa\u00adtion around Benghazi has ended up.
