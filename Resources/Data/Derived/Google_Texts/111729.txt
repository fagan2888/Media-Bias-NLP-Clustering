NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Employee benefits are often the key to employees’ hearts. A tuition refund plan, for example, can occasionally be worth more to a 19-year-old than a higher salary. But it is not the dollar value of the benefits that is important - at least according to one study.

Research, conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), found that employees rank benefits among the top contributors to their levels of job satisfaction. But researchers also found that the dollar amount employers spent on benefits is not what mattered the most. It was how well employees understood the benefits being offered.

Traditionally, according to the study, companies communicate with their employees about benefit plans only a couple of times a year. Usually this is during open enrollment periods and performance reviews. But is it really necessary to do so more often?
