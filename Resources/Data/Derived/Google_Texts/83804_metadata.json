A nurse developing technology or a process to make bedside care easier and safer is an example.\n\n\"There enough that we've just seen of ideas from staff that give us enough to do to start the process,\" Coopwood said.\n\nFor outside entrepreneurs, Regional One can provide the real-world environment for testing new products and ideas, the executives said. The system, with the Regional Medical Center located near Downtown at its core, can become the first customer for those fledgling companies that prove their products improve health care.\n\n\"And ideally take potentially some equity in that company for helping them lift themselves up,\" Vogel said. \"So we're looking at innovation as a potential revenue opportunity, but first and foremost is being able to serve patients,\" he said.\n\nA unique service at Regional One's innovation center will be for investors, like those who invest in medical device startups attracted to Memphis Bioworks and other accelerator programs, Vogel said.\n\nInvestors can steer part of their investment to Regional One's center to help examine and test entrepreneurs' concepts in the health care system.\n\n\"We're going to provide them access and if the solution works, we're going to buy it, so we will be their first customer,\" Vogel said. \"So we're going to have the investors actually invest in us to help vet some of their ideas to reduce the risk.\"\n\nTwo companies that honed products in Memphis medical device accelerator competitions \u2014 Restore Medical Solutions and LineGard Med \u2014 will be among the first to work with the new innovation center, the Regional One executives said.\n\nIn an online survey of health care organization innovation centers last year by The Commonwealth Fund, half of 33 that responded had started up since the Affordable Care Act's passage in 2010.\n\nMedical care and health outcomes ranked as the most common projects for the centers, followed by patient engagement or experience and efficiency. Funding was the most common barrier.\n\nIn Detroit, Henry Ford Health System started an innovation center that worked closely with the Tech Town Detroit business accelerator there to evaluate health care-related technologies, said Leslie Lynn Smith, who led Tech Town before becoming chief executive of the Entrepreneurship-Powered Innovation Center (Epicenter) in Memphis.\n\n\"I think it's awesome that Regional One after having moved through the really important work of repositioning Regional One within the community, is now focused on being leaders in innovation and expansion of entrepreneurial opportunities in Memphis,\" Smith said.\n\nThe innovation center has taken months of ground work, will have a foundation and may see its staff grow from Vogel to five to 10 people, the executives said. Fundraising will help build out a space and provide program funds for the center, Coopwood said.\n\nA website \u2014 innovation.regionalonehealth.org \u2014 provides a way to submit ideas, and includes a 15-point \"binding legal contract\" that requires agreement.\n\nVogel, 53, a self-described Memphis serial entrepreneur in the health care technology field, avoids a suit, tie and the usual cherry-wood office furnishings. He wore Joe's jeans and Vans shoes with his sport coat and has whiteboard walls in his office suitable for marking up with ideas.\n\n\"Our desire through the innovation center \u2014 whether it's a product or delivery service or whatever vector that we look at \u2014 is to be disruptive to the normal health care environment,\" Coopwood said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Regional One Health seeks to harness entrepreneurs with innovation center", "og": {"url": "http://www.commercialappeal.com/business/medical/regional-one-health-seeks-to-harness-entrepreneurs-with-innovation-center-328322df-0016-31ba-e053-01-379527101.html", "image": {"width": 900, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/M0013582123--8001.JPG", "height": 599}, "type": "article", "description": "Whether it comes from technicians, nurses, doctors or  entrepreneurs throughout the state, Regional One Health in Memphis is open to innovative products and  ideas, said executive director Scott Vogel.", "title": "Regional One Health seeks to harness entrepreneurs with innovation center"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/memphisnews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/M0013582123--8001.JPG", "description": "Whether it comes from technicians, nurses, doctors or  entrepreneurs throughout the state, Regional One Health in Memphis is open to innovative products and  ideas, said executive director Scott Vogel.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Regional One Health seeks to harness entrepreneurs with innovation center"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ca-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Brandon Dill/Special to The Commercial Appeal May 11, 2016 \u2014 Scott Vogel is the executive director of the Regional One Health Center For Innovation.\nInvestors can steer part of their investment to Regional One's center to help examine and test entrepreneurs' concepts in the health care system.\nFundraising will help build out a space and provide program funds for the center, Coopwood said.\nDisrupting that normal environment to become a gateway for entrepreneurial-minded staff among its nearly 3,000-person workforce and for entrepreneurs elsewhere with potential solutions to health care's problems is the strategy behind a new Regional One Health Center for Innovation in Memphis.\nIn Detroit, Henry Ford Health System started an innovation center that worked closely with the Tech Town Detroit business accelerator there to evaluate health care-related technologies, said Leslie Lynn Smith, who led Tech Town before becoming chief executive of the Entrepreneurship-Powered Innovation Center (Epicenter) in Memphis."}
