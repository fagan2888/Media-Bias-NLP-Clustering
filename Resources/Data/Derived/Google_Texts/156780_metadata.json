Mark Begich (D-AK) tends to be one of the more conservative members of the Democratic Party. But while he\u2019s been mostly supportive of President Barack Obama on the Affordable Care Act, there\u2019s one issue one which he and the president may have a harder time finding consensus. During an appearance on CNN Thursday, the senator said that if Obama ever comes up to Alaska, he will \u201cbang him over the head a few times\u201d until he agrees to open up oil drilling in the ANWR region of that state.\n\nBegich, who is up for re-election in 2014, would not say whether he would accept an offer from President Obama to come to Alaska and campaign for him. When anchor John Berman asked if Obama\u2019s presence on the campaign trail would be \u201chelpful\u201d in the solidly red state, Begich deflected the question by saying, \u201cAnyone who banks on a politician coming to the state is not working on what they need to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the president wants to come up, that\u2019s his decision,\u201d Begich continued. \u201cBut you know what? If he comes up here, I\u2019m going to take him to the arctic, show him ANWR, tell him why we need to drill in ANWR, change his mind on that if I can, bang him over the heads a few times on it. So, if he wants to come and see what I need to show him to change his position on, I\u2019m happy to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeems like a dream trip for the president,\u201d Berman joked. \u201cNot sure this is going to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he really say \u2018bang him on the head?'\u201d Zoraida Sambolin asked in disbelief. \u201cThat won\u2019t go over very well.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama has long opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, recently rejecting a proposal that would have traded drilling rights for a fund to research cleaner automotive technology. According to Heather Zichal, deputy assistant to the president on energy and climate change, \u201cANWR\u2019s off the table.\u201d\n\nWatch video below, via CNN:\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
