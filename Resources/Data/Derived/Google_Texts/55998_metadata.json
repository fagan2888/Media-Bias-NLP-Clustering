Thus, she is forced to leave her employees to the mercy of the insurance exchange.\n\nThese cases contradict White House Press Secretary Jay Carney\u2019s repeated claims that nothing would change for those who receive their insurance through their employer, despite evidence reported by Attkisson that shows that the administration knew in 2010 that millions of people would lose their coverage.\n\nAtkisson quoted a 2010 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report that estimated that Obamacare \u201cwould collectively reduce the number of people with employer-sponsored health coverage by about 14 million.\u201d She said the reason is that big companies will opt to save by paying the relatively small penalty.\n\nSmall companies like Clark\u2019s and Atkinson\u2019s are not required to provide health insurance for their employees, but have done so as a benefit and a perk. Now, thanks to Obamacare, they can no longer afford to do so.\n\nYet the administration has known about this for more than three years, and lied about it, just like Obama did about people being able to keep their plan if they liked their plan. Obama is determined to make his dream of socialized medicine a reality.\n\nFor millions of Americans, that reality stinks and is the real turkey this week.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Accuracy In Media", "description": "CBS News\u2019 Sharyl Attkisson reported on Tuesday that the Obama administration knew three years ago that millions of Americans would lose their employer-provided health insurance once Obamacare took effect:\r\nWe\u2019ve learned that the government estimated all along that millions of workers will be dropp", "title": "CBS\u2019s Sharyl Attkisson: Obama Administration Knew in 2010 That Millions Would Lose Company Provided Insurance [Video]", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cbs-sharyl-atkisson-on-obamacare.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-27T12:07:18+00:00", "url": "http://www.aim.org/don-irvine-blog/cbss-sharyl-attkisson-obama-administration-knew-in-2010-that-millions-would-lose-company-provided-insurance-video/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AccuracyInMedia/", "section": "Bias Watch", "published_time": "2013-11-27T12:07:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-27T12:07:18+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "CBS News\u2019 Sharyl Attkisson reported on Tuesday that the Obama administration knew three years ago that millions of Americans would lose their employer-provided health insurance once Obamacare took effect:\r\nWe\u2019ve learned that the government estimated all along that millions of workers will be dropp", "title": "CBS\u2019s Sharyl Attkisson: Obama Administration Knew in 2010 That Millions Would Lose Company Provided Insurance [Video]", "url": "http://www.aim.org/don-irvine-blog/cbss-sharyl-attkisson-obama-administration-knew-in-2010-that-millions-would-lose-company-provided-insurance-video/", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cbs-sharyl-atkisson-on-obamacare.jpg", "site": "@AccuracyInMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc79f\"", "article_summary": "Small companies like Clark\u2019s and Atkinson\u2019s are not required to provide health insurance for their employees, but have done so as a benefit and a perk.\nHowever, Clark\u2019s enthusiasm has dimmed for Obamacare after receiving a 39 percent premium rate increase, boosting her health care costs by $30,000.\nThus, she is forced to leave her employees to the mercy of the insurance exchange.\nBetsy Atkinson, a Virginia Beach businesswoman told Attkisson that she had to cancel her company\u2019s insurance plan because it didn\u2019t meet the new Obamacare requirements, and she can\u2019t afford a plan that does.\nFor millions of Americans, that reality stinks and is the real turkey this week."}
