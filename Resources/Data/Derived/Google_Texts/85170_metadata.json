Nikki Haley\u2019s Cabinet, adamant that South Carolina should not expand Medicaid eligibility under Obamacare.\n\nNearly 200,000 residents in this state can\u2019t afford private policies or qualify for the low-income health insurance program because of difficult decisions that he helped Haley make.\n\nNow, three months since he resigned his powerful position in her administration, Keck concedes that a recent attempt to expand Medicaid in Tennessee might have worked.\n\n\u201cStates are very different. Medicaid expansion might be the best choice for some states, and it might not be in other states,\u201d Keck told The Post and Courier.\n\nLate last year, he accepted a new job as an executive with Mountain States Health Alliance, a hospital system based in Johnson City, Tenn. There, he is partially responsible for government relations.\n\n\u201cClearly the hospital system here and every hospital system in the United States is in support of Medicaid expansion,\u201d Keck said. \u201cI\u2019m not in charge of deciding whether it\u2019s a worthwhile plan.\u201d\n\nShelli Quenga, who supports the Affordable Care Act and helps residents enroll in Obamacare policies through the Mount Pleasant nonprofit where she works, said she\u2019s not surprised that Keck is \u201chaving to look at things from a different perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I work for McDonald\u2019s, I\u2019m going to say the Big Mac is best. If I work for Burger King, I\u2019m going to say the Whopper is best,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all changed jobs before. You have to adapt.\u201d\n\nDuring Haley\u2019s first term, Keck managed the S.C. Department of Health and Human Services, where he ran the state\u2019s $7 billion Medicaid program. He argued many times to state legislators, local media, national news outlets, even Congress, that the existing Medicaid system is flawed and that he wanted to focus on fixing it.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are looking for a way to expand insurance but not call it Obamacare,\u201d he told The Washington Post in 2013. \u201cThe goal here is not universal coverage. The goal is getting people healthy. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing something much different.\u201d\n\nWhile Medicaid eligibility rules have long varied from state to state, the federal Affordable Care Act intended to even the playing field by expanding access to everyone in the country whose income fell below 138 percent of the poverty level \u2014 or about $16,000 a year for a single adult. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that Medicaid expansion under the new law was optional. Many red states, including South Carolina, initially opted out and have remained firmly anti-expansion. Others, though, have recently reconsidered their options and have been busy working with the federal government to craft plans that fit their own needs.\n\nRepublican Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam announced in December that he spent many months forging a compromise Medicaid expansion plan called \u201cInsure Tennessee\u201d with the Obama administration. It would have extended coverage to 280,000 low-income Tennesseans, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cStates have slowly been winning concessions from the federal government that fix some of the longstanding problems\u201d that Republicans have expressed about Medicaid expansion, Keck said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Insure Tennessee completely solved all those problems \u2014 in fact, I know it didn\u2019t \u2014 but it definitely went a long way to incorporate some ideas that conservatives have been asking for for a long time.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 4, a Tennessee Senate Health Committee defeated Haslam\u2019s proposal. A different Medicaid expansion deal failed to gain enough support among Wyoming legislators on Friday. Some states are still debating the issue. More than half have already expanded Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\nHaley spokeswoman Chaney Adams said the South Carolina governor has no intention of participating.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s good for one state may not be what\u2019s good for another, and Gov. Haley has always said that the job of her colleagues is to do what\u2019s best for their states \u2014 and she\u2019s going to do what\u2019s best for ours,\u201d Adams said in a prepared statement.\n\nChristian Soura, who replaced Keck in November as the Health and Human Services director, told state senators last week that his agency continues to evaluate how other states approach Medicaid expansion. \u201cIn my opinion, each state needs to make its decisions for itself,\u201d Soura said.\n\nTechnically, even though conservative South Carolina leaders aren\u2019t embracing Obamacare, Medicaid rolls are expanding here anyway. Approximately 1.1 million people in South Carolina now receive Medicaid benefits \u2014 a 30 percent jump in four years.\n\nKeck is responsible for most of that growth. For example, he implemented a program that automatically enrolls children based on information from other state agencies. In another initiative called the Healthy Outcomes Plan, he asked every hospital in the state to better manage thousands of poor, uninsured patients who keep showing up in emergency rooms.\n\nBut circumstances are different in Tennessee, he said. First, the state is bigger than South Carolina and more people there have no health insurance. Hospitals in Tennessee are also paid very little to treat indigent patients who can\u2019t afford their medical bills. South Carolina hospitals receive much more money for similar services.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t support Medicaid expansion in South Carolina and I still don\u2019t. I supported getting people access to care in a much different way,\u201d he said.\n\nKeck acknowledged in an interview with this newspaper two years ago that Medicaid expansion might be appropriate in some states.\n\n\u201cIf I had to do it again in South Carolina, I would do it the exact same way,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not in the middle of it anymore.\u201d\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at 937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Former Haley health care adviser says Medicaid expansion might work elsewhere, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsHealth care, \r\nMetro, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, Affordable Care Act,Christian Soura,Medicaid,Medicaid expansion,Nikki Haley,Obamacare,Tony Keck", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Tony Keck spent the better part of four years in Gov.
