House Speaker John Boehner said Thursday that the GOP will keep trying to repeal Obamacare, after a Supreme Court ruling that upheld subsidies to people using the federal insurance exchange and basically left the law intact.

"Obamacare is fundamentally broken, increasing healthcare costs for millions of Americans. Today's ruling doesn't change that fact," Boehner said. "Republicans will continue to listen to American families and work to protect them from the consequences of Obamacare."

"And we will continue our efforts to repeal the law and replace it with patient-centered solutions that meet the needs of seniors, small business owners, and middle-class families," he said.
