Four out of ten Americans believe President Barack Obama has expanded the power of the presidency too much, according to a new Reason-Rupe poll.

Asked, “do you think Barack Obama has expanded the power of the presidency too much, not enough, or has he not expanded the power of the presidency?,” 42 percent responded that he had expanded power “too much,” 21 percent thought he hasn’t, and 30 percent responded “not enough.” Seven percent of respondents were unsure.

Republicans were more likely to be skeptical of presidential power, with 66 percent responding that Obama has expanded power too much, while 70 percent of Democrats responded that he either hadn’t expanded power or hasn’t expanded power enough.

Reason notes that age is a more likely indicator of Americans’ views than political affiliation: 18-24 year olds were most likely to respond that Obama has not expanded power enough. In every other age group, more respondents answered that they felt Obama had expanded power too much, with a clear majority among Americans 65 and older.

According to Reason, “young people may become more suspicious of government power as they age.”

The poll was conducted in partnership with Princeton Survey Research Associates International.
