Proposed restrictions on amateur hash oil production cleared a Denver City Council committee Tuesday after changes were made to accommodate alcohol-based extraction.

The measure, aimed at preventing home explosions, would ban the use of butane or other gases in extractions of oil from marijuana, except by licensed businesses that take precautions. Amateurs who make hash oil at home still could use safer water- and food-based methods.

Responding to concerns expressed last month, including by a father who makes cannabis oil to treat his daughter’s severe epilepsy, the Safety and Well-Being Committee added the exemption for alcohol- and ethanol-based extractions.

But unless they obtain a permit from the Denver Fire Department, people using those methods would have to refrain from using heat produced by fuel or electricity and must limit the amount of alcohol or ethanol used each time to 16 ounces.

The committee approved the proposal, and it will be introduced in coming weeks in the full council.

Brian Wilson, the father of the epileptic girl, said he still is concerned that some parents might be fearful to obtain a fire permit that’s considered a public record.
