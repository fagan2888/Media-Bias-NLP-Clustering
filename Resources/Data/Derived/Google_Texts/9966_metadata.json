(Photo: Chris Smith, HHS)\n\nHealth care spending last year rose at the highest rate since 2008, thanks in large part to far more people being insured but also a 12% increase in drug spending, federal data out Wednesday showed.\n\nThe rate of growth in health spending is lower than before the Affordable Care Act took effect, but many believe the cost increases require more of a focus on non-medical solutions to health issues.\n\nNational experts will explore some of these evidence-backed programs during a Friday morning forum that will be live-streamed on usatoday.com.\n\nThe event, presented by USA TODAY and Cigna, runs from 9-11 a.m. at the Newseum in Washington. One panel will feature two public health thought leaders: Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association; and Richard Hamburg, deputy director of the Trust for America's Health. They will talk about keeping whole populations healthy and reducing health disparities, especially in urban areas.\n\nDr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, (Photo: APHA)\n\nKaren DeSalvo, a physician who is acting assistant secretary of health at the Department of Health and Human Services and the department's top health IT official, will be discussing the best ways she's seen for communities and technology to address health inequities, especially in urban areas. Before joining HHS, DeSalvo was health commissioner in New Orleans, where she worked as a community leader after Hurricane Katrina to set up a neighborhood-based care network for the most vulnerable residents.\n\nRosanne Haggerty, CEO of Community Solutions, a nonprofit focusing on homelessness, will discuss how its partnerships between businesses, government officials and residents in poor neighborhoods in Hartford and Brooklyn have boosted health.\n\nCigna CEO David Cordani will also share his thoughts on urban health.\n\nWhile many people think of staying well as an individual responsibility, where you live plays a huge role. Place and culture help determine social norms and access to affordable housing, safe neighborhoods, healthy food and places to exercise.\n\nBut many communities face challenges that hinder health, such as poverty, violence and lack of education \u2014 problems that contribute to rising health care costs that everyone pays for. Friday's speakers will discuss some proven solutions.\n\nBenjamin, for example, plans to share the story of the \"Green Carts\" program in New York City, through which mobile food carts sell fresh fruits and vegetables in under-served neighborhoods. When the idea was first proposed, he said, vendors who wanted to serve hot dogs and other traditional street food fought it.\n\nBut the health department and its supporters ultimately won, he said, and \"they improved access to fresh fruits and vegetables in under-served communities and got rid of the myth that low-income folks won't eat fresh fruits and vegetables.\"\n\nBenjamin said such solutions work for a few major reasons: \"They're culturally sensitive. They're focused on the needs of people in the area. And they're designed to work where they are.\"\n\nTre Mims lost 100 pounds in the last three years thanks to healthy eating so is glad to see fruit and vegetables at a nearby convenience store (Photo: Jayne O'Donnell, USA TODAY)\n\nIn September, USA TODAY and Cigna hosted a forum in Houston that focused more on challenges facing that part of the country and rural areas. Residents in the sprawling city talked about their health challenges, and barber Tre Sims discussed overcoming his. He's lost 100 pounds in the last three years by eating healthier and no longer suffers from high blood pressure. Now he picks up fruit at the convenience store near his work, instead of the junk food he used to eat. He can do that thanks to the Healthy Corner Store Network, a partnership between Go Healthy Houston and the community organization CAN DO Houston, which stands for Children and Neighbors Defeat Obesity.\n\nThe hope is to begin to patch together a road map to a healthier nation and to start a national dialogue about how to get there.\n\nFollow the conversation on Twitter at #healthiercommunities.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Qk47kS", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "How are residents, community groups improving urban health and how should it be paid for?", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "How are residents, community groups improving urban health and how should it be paid for?", "title": "USA TODAY forum examines solutions to community health problems, inequities", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/12/04/usa-today-forum-examines-solutions-community-health-problems-inequities/76621844/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How are residents, community groups improving urban health and how should it be paid for?", "creator": "@usatoday", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d0c0acad3eda61085e072102f1f66aae97a0fae5/c=89-0-3369-3280&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635847394458410376-DSC-2962.jpg", "title": "USA TODAY forum examines solutions to community health problems, inequities", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. Department of Health and Human Services", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. Department of Health and Human Services", "title": "USA TODAY forum examines solutions to community health problems, inequities", "author": "Laura Ungar, and Jayne O'Donnell", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/nation", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/29891c6687e3283f6d3cb31e20895f551cd37290/c=423-0-2883-3280/local/-/media/2015/12/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635847394458410376-DSC-2962.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f8ed6aae5b4c390429c49f0452862d28bc1d66b5/c=89-0-3369-3280/local/-/media/2015/12/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635847394458410376-DSC-2962.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b826bb5e71c1b82a7cd9281f0d522f82aab768a5/c=283-0-4645-3280/local/-/media/2015/12/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635847394458410376-DSC-2962.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a2c9c33cb0f3106104b3b022eb48ea8f5b6c50b/c=0-134-4926-2917&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/12/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635847394458410376-DSC-2962.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-04T12:14:26.920000-05:00", "shorthed": "USA TODAY Friday forum explores urban health", "articleid": 76621844, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abaa1cb68fac2ad55b5c370d780bf53307242d9f/c=0-134-4926-2917/local/-/media/2015/12/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635847394458410376-DSC-2962.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5fc9bdddbe16f217acb6ba7025863777521651f9/c=799-0-2636-3280/local/-/media/2015/12/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635847394458410376-DSC-2962.jpg"}}, "article": {"author": "Jayne O'Donnell"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "But many communities face challenges that hinder health, such as poverty, violence and lack of education \u2014 problems that contribute to rising health care costs that everyone pays for.\nPlace and culture help determine social norms and access to affordable housing, safe neighborhoods, healthy food and places to exercise.\nCigna CEO David Cordani will also share his thoughts on urban health.\nSpeaker: Dr. Karen DeSalvo, acting assistant secretary of health at the Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe event, presented by USA TODAY and Cigna, runs from 9-11 a.m. at the Newseum in Washington."}
