The chemicals will be destroyed at sea on board a specially adapted U.S. ship because they are too dangerous to import into a country.\n\nUntil now, it was not clear how the containers of chemicals could be transferred from the Scandinavian ships onto the U.S. vessel.\n\nAn Italian Foreign Ministry official said the use of the port was the maximum role Italy was prepared to serve in the operation, and that the chemicals would not touch Italian territory at any point.\n\nThe official would not identify which port would be used.\n\nSyria's 2-1/2-year civil war has killed at least 125,835 people, according to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and over 2 million refugees have fled, often overwhelming neighbouring countries.
