Spotlight on… DeMarcus Cousins, center, Sacramento Kings.

When: The first full week of the NBA season provided a lot of surprises, perhaps none as big as by the Sacramento Kings, who have gotten out to their first 5-1 start in several years. The best player has been do-everything center DeMarcus Cousins.

What’s up: Cousins was dominant in four games last week, averaging 27 points, 12.8 rebounds, 1.5 blocks and a steal as Sacramento went 4-0, including a big one at Phoenix on Friday night.

Background: Cousins has had a star-crossed existence in his young career in the NBA. There has never been any question about his talent, but there have been plenty of concerns about his ability to control his emotions. Cousins’ reputation as a loose canon overshadowed the immense ability he possesses. Not anymore. Cousins has worked hard to control his emotions, and with that challenge out of the way, his basketball is shining through.

My take: Media and fans are dialing in on Cousins because of the Kings’ fast start, but the truth is he has been this good pretty much since he stepped foot in the NBA in 2010. The only reason he has not been part of an all-NBA team by now is because of Sacramento’s lack of success. But that won’t be an issue this season if the Kings continue on the road they’ve started.
