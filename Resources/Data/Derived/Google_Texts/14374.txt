Jefferson City, MO — Ryan Johnson, President of Missouri Alliance for Freedom, today called on Attorney General Chris Koster to join at least 15 other state attorneys general in taking action against the Obama Administration’s controversial energy plan.

“Missouri derives 83 percent of its electricity from coal. President Obama’s new carbon regulations will have a punitive effect on all Missourians by raising their energy costs,” said Ryan Johnson, President of the Missouri Alliance for Freedom. The EPA’s so-called ‘clean power plan’ is tantamount to a federal takeover of the electrical system and a controversial scheme that will hurt every Missourian who pays an electricity bill. It is to energy what ObamaCare is to health care. We are calling on Attorney General Chris Koster to stand up and protect our citizens by taking action in the courts to stop it.”

The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) plans to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants (the controversial clean power plan) will do serious damage to our economy. According to a report issued by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Institute for 21st Century Energy, the cost to America’s economy is likely to be above $50 billion a year between now and 2030. It is wrong for the federal government to arbitrarily raise the energy costs of Missourians through another executive fiat.
