The proposal does not require pharmacists to tell patients about the substitution.\n\nGeorge Goodno, spokesman for the Biotechnology Industry Organisation (BIO), told BioPharma-Reporter.com GPhA's text was written in collaboration with a separate, ad hoc coalition of innovator and biosimilar makers, including BIO, and, BioPharma-Reporter.com understands, Hospira, Amgen and Genentech.\n\n\u201cThis new language brings GPHA\u2019s position fully in line with that which BIO has advocated,\u201d said Goodno. \u201cWe expect that with all major industry associations in alignment, state policy makers will take notice and see that now is the time to adopt legislation allowing for the dispensing of biosimilars and the eventual substitution of interchangeable biologics.\u201d\n\n\u2018Electronic system\u2019\n\nUnder GPhA\u2019s suggested wording, pharmacists would have an unspecified \u201creasonable time\u201d following dispensation to communicate the name and manufacturer of the biologic to the prescribing doctor.\n\nIdeally, this information should be communicated \u201cby making an entry in an interoperable electronic medical records system or through an electronic prescribing technology or a pharmacy record that is electronically accessible by the prescriber.\u201d\n\nWhere this technology isn\u2019t available, pharmacists should use faxes or phones, said GPhA.\n\nThe proposed legislation would not allow refill prescriptions to switch from an originator to a biosimilar.\n\nThe State of things\n\nThe 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) allows biosimilars to be switched for a reference product, provided there are \u201cno clinically meaningful differences\u201d between the two.\n\nBut states are divided on how this substitution should be made \u2013 and specifically, whether doctors and patients should be informed of the switch and have the option to reject it.\n\nAt present, US states have varying laws, or none, governing biosimilars substitution, as shown in BioPharma-Reporter.com\u2019s infographic.\n\nSo far Florida, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Virginia and Indiana have passed laws surrounding substitution, but legislation has failed in many other states. In 2013, California passed a law giving doctors veto power over substituting biosimilars.\n\nGPhA said if its suggestion is adopted, it would give millions of Americans access to \u201csafe alternatives to costly biologic medicines\u201d \u2013 a figure it estimated would bring savings of $250bn in 10 years for only the eleven likeliest biosimilars to enter the market.\n\nThe proposed rules uphold current pharmacy practice for small molecules drugs, which can be automatically substituted with generics without the notification or permission of prescribers.\n\nMost US state legislatures will begin sitting for their 2015 sessions in January.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the ongoing fight over whether US pharmacists will be allowed to prescribe biosimilars in place of their reference products, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association has agreed on \u201ccompromise legislation\u201d with innovator manufacturers.", "copyright": "William Reed Business Media", "author": "BioPharma-Reporter.com", "og": {"site_name": "BioPharma-Reporter.com", "description": "In the ongoing fight over whether US pharmacists will be allowed to prescribe biosimilars in place of their reference products, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association has agreed on \u201ccompromise legislation\u201d with innovator manufacturers.", "title": "GPhA reaches compromise on thorny biosimilars substitution question", "url": "http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Markets-Regulations/GPhA-reaches-compromise-on-thorny-biosimilars-substitution-question", "image": "http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/var/plain_site/storage/images/publications/pharmaceutical-science/biopharma-reporter.com/markets-regulations/gpha-reaches-compromise-on-thorny-biosimilars-substitution-question/9542353-1-eng-GB/GPhA-reaches-compromise-on-thorny-biosimilars-substitution-question_medium_vga.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "biopharma-reporter.com", "description": "In the ongoing fight over whether US pharmacists will be allowed to prescribe biosimilars in place of their reference products, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association has agreed on \u201ccompromise legislation\u201d with innovator manufacturers.", "title": "GPhA reaches compromise on thorny biosimilars substitution question", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "biopharma-reporter://Markets-Regulations/GPhA-reaches-compromise-on-thorny-biosimilars-substitution-question"}, "name": {"iphone": "BioPharma-Reporter"}, "id": {"iphone": "id1023356457"}}, "site": "@BioPharmaReport", "image": {"src": "http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/var/plain_site/storage/images/publications/pharmaceutical-science/biopharma-reporter.com/markets-regulations/gpha-reaches-compromise-on-thorny-biosimilars-substitution-question/9542353-1-eng-GB/GPhA-reaches-compromise-on-thorny-biosimilars-substitution-question_medium_vga.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "biopharmaceutical manufacturing, development, biopharmaceutical process, upstream production, downstream processing, upstream processing, biologics", "fb": {"admins": 100000722238608}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "TRUE", "msvalidate.01": "CEC8ACB0DB9777352167906B78F1EF96", "verify-v1": "WHomov305bLuKa7U4ALUYG/IcW/V1/nBXyagl4I9gR0="}, "article_summary": "At present, US states have varying laws, or none, governing biosimilars substitution, as shown in BioPharma-Reporter.com\u2019s infographic.\nGPhA said it supports state laws where pharmacists need not seek permission to prescribe an interchangeable biologic, but must inform the patient\u2019s doctor electronically.\nSo far Florida, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Virginia and Indiana have passed laws surrounding substitution, but legislation has failed in many other states.\nThe proposal does not require pharmacists to tell patients about the substitution.\nIn the ongoing fight over whether US pharmacists will be allowed to prescribe biosimilars in place of their reference products, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association has agreed on \u201ccompromise legislation\u201d with innovator manufacturers."}
