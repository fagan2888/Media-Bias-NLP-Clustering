But to understand John Adams, it seemed I would have to read a book about George Washington. So I did. And, to understand the first two presidents, it seemed I would also have to read a book about the third: Thomas Jefferson. So I did.\n\nAfter that, it seemed I\u2019d developed a new habit. I blew through biographies on the big names \u2014 James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson \u2014 then plunged into a presidential dead zone. I\u2019m talking about the forgotten occupants of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. who crowd dusty histories of America before the Civil War. No one makes Oscar-winning movies starring Daniel Day-Lewis about Martin Van Buren, Zachary Taylor or Millard Fillmore. Few know what they look like \u2014 even when they have cool sideburns.\n\nAfter reaching the president everybody loves to love \u2014 Abraham Lincoln \u2014 I kept going. I became an admirer of Rutherford B. Hayes: civil service reformer, Civil War veteran, cultivator of an awesome beard. I spent $30 on a 500-page hardback about Chester A. Arthur. I scrutinized Amazon.com reviews to figure out whether \u201cWilliam McKinley and His America\u201d is a worthier read than \u201cThe President and the Assassin: McKinley, Terror, and Empire at the Dawn of the American Century.\u201d (One contrarian\u2019s opinion: Yes! The latter looks more fun, but the former is more detailed.)\n\nBefore I knew it, three years had flown by. Though I wasn\u2019t a history professor, a glutton for punishment or an eccentric shut-in, I was reading at least one biography about each president, mostly in chronological order. Today, I\u2019m up to Herbert Hoover, and it\u2019s all downhill from here.\n\nAnd I wasn\u2019t alone. Reading biographies of every U.S. president, it turned out, is a thing that people do.\n\n\u201cIt was something I wanted to do for many years,\u201d said Karen Rosenbaum, a 77-year-old resident of Fairfax, Virginia. At the end of a three-decade stint running a computer camp, Rosenbaum took on the project in 2012 \u2014 before she retired, thank you very much \u2014 and finished 2 1/2 years later.\n\nRosenbaum isn\u2019t the type to sit around poring over dense histories \u2014 she read \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d three times. \u201cI read a lot of books that go in and out of my head, and they\u2019re mostly crap,\u201d she said. But the allure of our nation\u2019s 43 commanders in chief (remember: Grover Cleveland served nonconsecutive terms) proved too much.\n\n\u201cI do think the presidency is such an important phenomenon in our history, and I thought it would be a good way of reviewing American history,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very enriching.\u201d\n\nThe enrichment doesn\u2019t necessarily stop when one closes the final page of a biography of President Barack Obama. Others undertake this reading marathon more than once, swapping recommendations online about which books to read and which to avoid. And many who take the presidential challenge don\u2019t just read. They write about what they\u2019re reading.\n\nAndrew Cordisco is a 27-year-old account manager for a software solutions company living in Raleigh, North Carolina. He first finished his presidential biography journey in December 2012 \u2014 \u201cdid a whole lap,\u201d as he put it. Now he is rereading all of the books and picking another one about each president for his blog, the Presidents Project.\n\nThat sounds like a lot of page turning or Kindle swiping. But for Cordisco, the presidency is like baseball: a game in which even the worst teams win their fair share of matchups and are worthy of respect.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no president that won 162 games and no presidents that won zero,\u201d Cordisco said. \u201cThey all have accomplishments. \u2026 Some don\u2019t turn out to be correct.\u201d\n\nIndeed, one explores those whom history has and hasn\u2019t absolved on this bibliographical journey. Reading about familiar heroes such as Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt \u2014 presidents almost universally admired and emblazoned on currency for taking huge chances that paid huge dividends \u2014 seems like every citizen\u2019s duty.\n\nCordisco even kept a bracket of the presidents the way fans pick college basketball teams during March Madness. \u201cI always knew who was going to win, and that\u2019s Lincoln,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers I talked to sang the praises of one president who often ranks below his more lauded fifth cousin in historians\u2019 rankings: Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n\u201cTeddy, without question,\u201d Rosenbaum said when asked about her favorite president. She thought he could have prevented World War II by handling World War I better than Woodrow Wilson did. \u201cIf Teddy had been president, we would have entered the war a lot earlier, it would have been less painful for the entire world and there would have been a just and honorable peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI liked him as a person,\u201d said Jacki Lewis, a 30-year-old mother of two from Akron, Ohio. \u201cI wanted to be his friend, hunt jaguars with him or something.\u201d\n\nLewis began her presidential journey in January 2011 and blogged about it with other friends she persuaded to read as well. She read one bio per month for 31/2 years \u2014 though, by the end, she had two children under 5.\n\n\u201cI think most years I read right at 100 books,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI read more before I had kids.\u201d\n\nAnother dark horse was among her favorite presidents: civil service reformer Chester A. Arthur.\n\n\u201cThis one obscure president was, like, \u2018This spoils system does not work,\u2019\u201d Lewis said. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re giving jobs on merit.\u2019 That changed how the whole political system worked!\u201d\n\nUnderdogs and villains\n\nLike Lewis, I felt myself drawn to overlooked presidents. Lincoln and FDR are great, but everyone already knows that the mystic chords of memory will again be touched by the better angels of our nature and that we have nothing to fear but fear itself.\n\nWhat about the more ordinary schmucks without vision who, like many of us, are just trying to get by?\n\nReading about hapless presidents who fell into the job through family connections or after another president\u2019s death can be compelling. Some administrations were worthy of a Three Stooges short: the tenures of John Quincy Adams, the first to endure the Freudian nightmare of following Dad into the White House; and \u201caccidental\u201d and hated president John Tyler, the first vice president to assume the presidency after his boss\u2019s death in office and the only commander in chief who died a Confederate.\n\nIf these guys ran a country without destroying it, I can probably figure out how to change the toner in the office copier.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think they have to be the most self-assured persons in the world, but they all were sort of insecure,\u201d said Bob Timmermann, who blogged about his journey.\n\nTimmermann, a 50-year-old librarian in Los Angeles, took a novel approach in his presidential reading: Ditching chronology, he used a random-number generator to guide him through the presidents. He started with Tyler \u2014 bad luck \u2014 in February 2009 and finished with a Ronald Reagan bio almost exactly a year later.\n\nThis seemed normal.\n\n\u201cNo one thought it was too strange, but then again when you work in a library, people have a pretty high tolerance for whatever people are interested in,\u201d Timmermann said.\n\nReading through the presidents demands interest not just in heroes and lovable dolts, but in villains as well.\n\nChief among these is probably Lincoln veep and inveterate racist Andrew Johnson, who whiffed with his destructive Reconstruction policies and got impeached. But he\u2019s at the bottom of a long list of baddies. Among these: the guy who made the Depression worse.\n\n\u201cI grew up with a grandmother who told me Herbert Hoover was a very bad man,\u201d Timmermann said. \u201cThen I read and said: \u2018I see your point.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome readers surprisingly singled out for criticism one gentleman with a huge white statue near the Mall: Jefferson.\n\n\u201cMost of the accomplishments of Jefferson have nothing to do with his presidency,\u201d Cordisco said. \u201cHe wrote his own tombstone, and it didn\u2019t mention he was president.\u201d (For the record: Cordisco is also a Richard Nixon defender, admiring the gutsy California Quaker who \u201cjust willed himself to be exactly who he wanted to be,\u201d he said.)\n\nAnd just because Jefferson got elected doesn\u2019t mean he was a jolly good fellow.\n\n\u201cHe strikes me as a little more of a guy who could have been a better president \u2014 a better human,\u201d said Steve Floyd, 47, who blogs at bestpresidentialbios.com . \u201cHe\u2019s kind of the Karl Rove of the Washington administration \u2014 the bomb thrower.\u201d\n\nFloyd, an investment banker living in Fredericksburg, Virginia, started his reading project in 2012 while commuting for work on 12-hour flights to and from Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cI got tired of drinking free wine and watching cheap movies, so I came up with something better to do,\u201d he said.\n\nFloyd is about two-thirds of the way through his reading, but gets extra credit because he takes on multiple biographies about presidents he finds interesting and, since he\u2019s a pilot, takes photographs of their homes from the air. Plotting out his reading by the week, he said he\u2019ll have read 200 books in four years when he finishes by Presidents Day 2017.\n\n\u201cI try not to speed read, but I\u2019m not taking a test on this stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nTo skip or not to skip\n\nReading less-than-carefully is the greatest temptation for those who decide to read 43 books, some of which are mostly about the gold standard and tariff reduction. Seeking out and paying for the best biography about, say, Benjamin Harrison challenges one\u2019s resolve. Another leading candidate for those tempted to skim: William Henry Harrison \u2014 Benjamin Harrison\u2019s grandfather \u2014 who died of pneumonia on his 32nd day in office.\n\n\u201cI thought about skipping him,\u201d Rosenbaum said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t in office very long.\u201d\n\nStill, a completist is a completist \u2014 and sometimes the forgotten presidents aren\u2019t that forgettable, as Rosenbaum found after she plunked down $35 for a \u201cvery expensive tome\u201d on Harrison.\n\n\u201cI dutifully read it, and I ended up loving it,\u201d she said. \u201cI found his character quite appealing. It concentrated a lot on the Indian wars, and I thought if he had lived and had an influence on Native American policy, we might have done a whole lot better.\u201d\n\nFor those unwilling to spend so much, there\u2019s always Sean Wilentz. A history professor at Princeton University, he took over as editor of the American Presidents Series from legendary presidential historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who died in 2007. The series offers short, inexpensive books on every president (save a few not yet published) for general readers. I turned to it when stumped on choosing what to read about Martin Van Buren, among others.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a breakdown in the connection between historians and general readers,\u201d Wilentz said, bemoaning the esoteric nature of some biographies. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge interest in American history, but the fact of the matter is that the professionalization of scholarship has cut it off.\u201d\n\nWilentz also offered insight on why so many people take the presidential challenge. There are many ways to learn about the American experiment, he said. But the presidency is a great one.\n\n\u201cYou experience American history in a very intimate way when you deal with someone at the center of power,\u201d Wilentz said. \u201cThe president is always the center of what\u2019s going on in the national government. These are human stories.\u201d\n\nA reason to read\n\nOf course, reading about a country through its leaders has shortcomings. Forty-two U.S. presidents were white. All were men. While the supporting cast always includes other characters \u2014 Jackson and the Indians, Lincoln and the slaves, Lyndon B. Johnson and Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 a presidential biography is about a president, not the people he helped or hurt.\n\nOne must suspend disbelief to read so much from the White House\u2019s perspective. But while they spent hundreds of hours reading about politics, those I talked to weren\u2019t reading to take sides. Reinforcing support of a tea party candidate or the Affordable Care Act wasn\u2019t on the agenda.\n\n\u201cI would say I am a little off the center of the political spectrum, but not too far,\u201d Floyd said. \u201cThis has, if anything, probably pushed me to the middle. Only a heartless, unsympathetic person \u2014 a nonself-reflective person \u2014 could read all these different biographies of all these different times in history and not examine their own philosophy.\u201d\n\nSo, if not for politics: Why?\n\nAs a new parent, I\u2019ve kept up with my presidential reading project because I think \u2014 perhaps wrongly \u2014 that looking at the lives of America\u2019s No. 1 citizens will teach me something about being a good dad.\n\nI found I\u2019m not alone. \u201cReading about the presidents helped me raise a newborn,\u201d said Howard Dorre, a 34-year-old project manager living in Los Angeles. His blog, Plodding Through the Presidents, includes detailed photographic studies of presidential action figures. \u201cI think that founding a country is similar to having a family,\u201d Dorre said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like founding your own little nation.\u201d\n\nLewis, who had just had her oldest son when she started the project, said reading about the presidents helped her understand how far her children could go.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a baby \u2014 he could grow up to be president,\u201d she said. She pointed out that commanders in chief \u201cwere just kids that went to school. Now they were the most important person in the world.\u201d\n\nAnd don\u2019t underestimate good ol\u2019-fashioned love of country.\n\n\u201cMy goal was originally just to be entertained and fill up dead time,\u201d Floyd said. But: \u201cThis whole journey is giving me a very interesting perspective on the history of the country and how adaptive it is.\u201d\n\nFloyd\u2019s takeaway: 2016 isn\u2019t that different from 1789. America\u2019s partisan divide may be much in the news these days, but, as Floyd put it, it was this bad during the Washington administration, the Adams administration and every administration after that.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing unique about where we are now,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is America \u2014 and we\u2019re reading about it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It started innocently: I saw a TV show, then read the book it was based on.
