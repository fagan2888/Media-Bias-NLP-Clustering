The veteran Fairview football coach is the biggest supporter of the Knights' version of \"Johnny Football,\" and he is the first to encourage his senior's gunslinger mentality.\n\nFeauto rewarded his coach's faith once again on Saturday, accounting for five touchdowns as the Knights quickly took control of Fairview's first Front Range League rivalry battle with Monarch before cruising to a 35-10 victory.\n\nFairview quarterback Johnny Feauto weaves through the Monarch defense, one of many big plays by the senior in a 35-10 Fairview win Saturday. (Cliff Grassmick / Daily Camera)\n\n\"It seems like some of that dialogue is maybe on some of the headsets, but it doesn't necessarily come from me,\" McCartney said. \"I'm just such a big fan of Johnny. We know what he can do and what he's capable of. Each and every week, his knowledge of different things are very helpful. There's times when teams are dropping eight and taking passing lanes away, and you don't always know what he'll do next, but to me he's done a really good job with his decision-making.\n\n\"I kind of like the gunslinger mentality. You have to know who you are, and I like who he is. He gets better every week.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFeauto threw touchdown passes to four different receivers and also added a short touchdown run early in the third quarter that essentially snuffed any thoughts of a Monarch comeback. Yet it was a few plays that don't immediately jump out of the box score \u2014 such as a 22-yard sideline-to-sideline scramble on second-and-15, or a 10-yard scramble on third-and-eight \u2014 that caused the biggest headaches for a Monarch defense vainly attempting to keep tabs on the Knights' plentiful weapons.\n\n\"Even though they were 4A, they dominated 4A and have been a powerhouse for years,\" Feauto said. \"We knew we were going to get their best game. We just needed to stay focused and do what we could do.\n\n\"The first couple games, I was skittish on my feet. The coaches have been telling me to stay in the pocket, and the offensive line is protecting real well. I feel like I can stay in there longer.\"\n\nOutside an ill-advised late throw back across the middle that was intercepted by Monarch's Erik Lawson early in the fourth quarter, Feauto was flawless. The senior completed 21 of 34 passes for 247 yards, spreading the ball to six different receivers. Feauto added another 50 yards rushing on nine carries.\n\nFairview senior running back Jason Harvey gained 114 yards on 13 carries, and David McWilliams led the Knights' receiving corps with 100 yards on six receptions.\n\n\"They did a good job of mixing up their routes,\" Monarch coach Phil Bravo said. \"We had them in third-and-long and second-and-long quite a bit, and (Feauto's) ability to scramble makes him tough. When you do get pressure on him, you're hesitant because you don't want to miss.\"\n\nAfter handcuffing the vaunted Monarch rushing attack \u2014 McCartney called it one of \"those nightmare games\" trying to prepare for the Coyotes' ground game \u2014 the Knights will have a short week in which to prepare for Rocky Mountain, another 5-0 team and the only other unbeaten squad in the Front Range League.\n\nRocky Mountain visits the fourth-ranked Knights Thursday at Recht Field at 7 p.m.\n\n\"They're 5-0 and they've already beaten Legacy, they've already beaten Horizon, so they have some really solid victories,\" McCartney said. \"What I've noticed is their defense has played really well and are playing really good team football.\"\n\nFollow Pat on Twitter: twitter.com/prooney07\n\nFairview 35, Monarch 10\n\nAt Warrior Stadium\n\nFairview (5-0, 3-0) 14 7 7 7 \u2014 35\n\nMonarch (3-2, 1-2) 0 3 0 7 \u2014 10\n\nFirst quarter\n\nFairview \u2014 David McWilliams 29 pass from Johnny Feauto (Raul Magno kick).
