On “Hannity” Monday evening, Sean Hannity asked members of the Congressional Freedom Caucus — the group of radical conservatives responsible, in part, for hounding House Speaker John Boehner out of office — whether the charges leveled by the speaker against conservatives applied to him.

On “Face the Nation,” Boehner noted that “the Bible says beware of false prophets — and there are people out there spreading noise about how much can get done.” He added that “we got groups here in town, members, the House and Senate here in town who whipped people into a frenzy believing they could accomplish things that they know, they know are never going to happen.”

Hannity seemed to take this comment about Washington insiders as a personal affront, asking members of the caucus, “Do you think I am unrealistic? Am I a false prophet? Was there never a chance to defund Obamacare? Am I spreading noise and advancing a fool’s errand? Am I unrealistic? Am I a false prophet?”

North Carolina Representative Mark Meadows answered that overlong, deliberately repetitive string of questions exactly as Hannity had intended — with a firm “No” and a discussion about how the Congressional Freedom Caucus’ “leadership teams” agreed with Hannity “to fight tooth and nail to represent the will of the American people.”
