Texas is Medi-Share\u2019s largest market, with more than 7,500 members. - Lauren Silverman\n\nDiane Cozart is a believer. She\u2019s a devout Christian whose faith plays out in every aspect of her life, including her health care. So when she began searching for health insurance with her husband fifteen years ago, they selected an alternative, biblical model of sharing. It\u2019s called Medi-Share.\n\nFaith, And Contributions Required\n\nMembers of this faith-based group agree to a strict set of principles. To attend church, abstain from extramarital sex, and avoid alcohol and drug abuse. You violate these rules, and you could lose health coverage.\n\n\u201cI like it that my insurance dollars are not going to help pay for folks who live alternate lifestyles,\u201d Cozart says. \u201cI feel confident I\u2019m not paying for another person\u2019s bad choices, and maybe they do things that are not healthful. So my premiums stay down.\u201d\n\nMedi-Share participants do pay less on average than they might for traditional insurance -- 30 percent less for according to a 2009 study by the industry trade group the Association of Health Insurance Providers. That\u2019s in part because less is covered. Rules on preventative care and pre-existing conditions vary, but you can pretty much forget about the morning after pill, abortions, or drug rehab.\n\nEvery month Cozart contributes $590 \u2013 that\u2019s for her husband and two youngest kids \u2013 to a Member Share Exchange run by a credit union. That credit union transfers funds from one member\u2019s bank account to another\u2019s when there\u2019s a medical need that\u2019s covered.\n\nNo Guarantee\n\nSharing Ministries aren\u2019t insurance \u2013 there\u2019s no guarantee a bill will be covered.\n\nTony Meggs, president of the Ministry which facilitates Medi-Share, explains the 70,000 members of Medi-Share simply agree to share in each other\u2019s medical needs.\n\nThere\u2019s also no reserves.\n\n\u201cIf we were to build reserves,\u201d Meggs says, \u201cWe would be pooling money and that\u2019s insurance. What we have is a patented process that simply enables you and I to share money between our accounts.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worked this way for twenty years and supporters successfully lobbied Congress for an exemption in the Affordable Care Act \u2013 so people like Diane Cozart can stay with their faith-based alternative without penalties.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for health sharing ministries like Medi-Share.\n\nObamacare Fueling Growth\n\nThe two largest health care sharing ministries \u2013 Medi-Share and Samaritan Ministries \u2013 have nearly doubled their membership since 2010. The two groups together count more than 160,000 members across the country.\n\n\u201cSince the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010,\u201d Meggs says, \u201cWe have seen significant growth.\u201d\n\nRegulation Concerns\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans have to cover a set of essential health benefits \u2013 things like lab tests, prescription drugs, and mental health services. You also can\u2019t be turned down because of a pre-existing condition or because you\u2019re gay, for example.\n\nKevin Lucia, a Senior Research fellow at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, explains these consumer protections don\u2019t apply to health care sharing ministries because they\u2019re not regulated as insurance.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a team of regulators watching them closely to make sure that they\u2019re financially solvent, that they\u2019re not going to go bankrupt if they get a huge claim,\u201d Lucia says.\n\nHe also worries that these cost-sharing ministries won\u2019t be held accountable if they refuse to reimburse benefits expressed in their contracts.\n\nBut lack of consumer protections and guarantees hasn\u2019t stopped thousands of people from signing up.\n\nThey\u2019re turning to fellow believers and putting their health in God\u2019s hands.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2014/01/10/health-care/religious-alternative-obamacare", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/silverman.jpg?itok=CF6pWCjy", "type": "article", "description": "An exemption in the Affordable Care Act lets people keep their faith-based alternative without penalties.", "title": "The religious alternative to Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "bFpr8pVIxa7JaJ9tmfU5B5LZkLD0E5jL2gK/E5WR3Gmp77KAHWMgMw/MDcfQx5p5rnE0/Ngpz6vIlcSo6SO2LQ==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcd0\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare Fueling GrowthThe two largest health care sharing ministries \u2013 Medi-Share and Samaritan Ministries \u2013 have nearly doubled their membership since 2010.\nSo when she began searching for health insurance with her husband fifteen years ago, they selected an alternative, biblical model of sharing.\nShe\u2019s a devout Christian whose faith plays out in every aspect of her life, including her health care.\nDiane Cozart and her family chose Medi-Share as their health care alternative.\n\u201cIf we were to build reserves,\u201d Meggs says, \u201cWe would be pooling money and that\u2019s insurance."}
