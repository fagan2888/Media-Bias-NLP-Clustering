In Colorado, the new State Water Plan released says much the same thing about the water frontier.\n\nAfter almost 150 years of yoking its rivers with dams, canals and other water infrastructures, the state is substantially out of raw water to develop. If Colorado doesn\u2019t have an empty water bucket, it is starting to see the bottom.\n\nThis might seem odd, given that Colorado is located at the crest of the continent. No state has a higher mean elevation than Colorado, 6,800 feet. Snowmelt from the silvery peaks make it the mother lode of rivers: the Arkansas, the Rio Grande, and the Platte, among others, plus the namesake Colorado, all of them slashing down through canyons of black gneiss and red sandstone toward gentle plains and scorching deserts.\n\nInterstate compacts mandate two-thirds be allowed to flow downstream to Nebraska, Kansas and New Mexico, and also Nevada, Arizona and California. Of what Colorado can legally keep, farmers claim the vast majority, about 85 percent, with the balance going to cities and industry.\n\nBut the compelling water statistic is told in acre-feet. One is needed every year for two single-family households. Of the 13.7 million acre-feet that originate in Colorado, only an estimated 150,000 acre-feet remain for development. Even that figure is suspect, because it assumes the climate of the 20th century. That\u2019s a risky assumption, given what we now know about the impact of warming temperatures in the Southwest.\n\nStill, the old ways die hard. One idea calls for Colorado to develop that final share of the Colorado River by building a $5 billion pipeline to divert water 400 miles from the state\u2019s northwest corner to the rapidly growing cities at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThis latter idea provokes Colorado\u2019s traditional antagonisms about transmountain diversions. Some 80 percent of water originates west of the Continental Divide, such as near the resorts of Aspen and Vail, while 89 percent of residents live east of the divide, mostly in the Front Range urban corridor. The imbalance is addressed \u2014 and created \u2014 by the 25 tunnels, canals and ditches that altogether export 450,000 to 600,000 acre-feet per year from the Pacific Ocean side of the mountains eastward to the Great Plains.\n\nWhile the state plan does envision new reservoirs to store flood waters, it also emphasizes a new frontier of sharing. For decades, Colorado\u2019s cities have been tapping agriculture water. Many farmers have been only too happy to sell their farms \u2014 and water, too, a practice called buy and dry. But recently Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, at the plan\u2019s adoption, made it clear that this is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the self-interest of everyone in this state that we don\u2019t dry up the state\u2019s agricultural counties,\u201d he said in introducing the new state plan. But Colorado needs to figure out ways to keep farms even as Colorado\u2019s current population, 5.3 million, expands to 9 million or 10 million by mid-century. The new plan doesn\u2019t spell out how this water can be shared. Innovation \u2014 technological and legal \u2014 will be needed.\n\nAnother new frontier of water will be conservation. The plan identifies a goal of wringing 400,000 acre-feet per year of savings without sacrificing uses. That\u2019s about as much as the natural flow of the South Platte River. Just talking about limiting the length of showers misses the point, said Hickenlooper. Conservation is a broader and deeper ambition. Many argue for a new cultural norm about what constitutes an aesthetically pleasing urban and suburban landscape.\n\nDenver has been leading the way. Just a few decades ago, the city\u2019s water agency was reviled as both gluttonous and imperious, prompting a bumper sticker that said: \u201cDamn the Denver Water Board.\u201d But in recent years, it has been leading the way in conservation, with a 20 percent per capita reduction in water consumption in the last decade. \u201cAnd we can do more,\u201d says Jim Lochhead, the agency\u2019s chief executive, without sacrificing quality of life.\n\nColorado\u2019s new ambitions should be viewed within the context of the seven states of the Southwest that share the Colorado River. Surpluses during the 1990s dissolved as drought left bathtub rings on the river\u2019s two giant reservoirs, Mead and Powell.\n\nNow, even after good snow years in the headwaters, water levels in Mead continue to fall, now to 35 percent of capacity, the lowest since the 1930s, soon after Hoover Dam was completed in 1935.\n\nSome predict even further declines as temperatures rise and population demands increase. Calculating the odds, Las Vegas bet on a new tunnel, its third into Mead, the city\u2019s major source of water. The new tunnel, which was completed in September at a cost of $817 million, bores to the very bottom of the reservoir \u2014 just in case the reservoir empties altogether.\n\nWater laws and infrastructure in Colorado and other Western states were created to share abundance.\n\n\u201cToday that pendulum has swung to how \u2018do you manage shortages for all?\u2019 That\u2019s a big difference,\u201d says Russell George, a former state legislator in Colorado who is credited by many as the father of his state\u2019s new plan. \u201cSo what we have to do now is sort of reinvent the total decision-making methodology based on scarcity.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a different conversation from the past, when the major argument was always that prosperity depended upon developing water and other natural resources. But with the water barrel empty, it\u2019s time for a new conversation. As evident in Colorado, the conversation has already begun.\n\nAllen Best is a contributor to Writers on the Range, a column service of High County News (hcn.org).
