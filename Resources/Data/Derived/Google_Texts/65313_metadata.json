According to the Lauderdale County Fire Director Allan Dover, volunteer fire departments from Martin, Collinsville, and Suqualena were dispatched to extinguish an RV fire.\n\nIt took firefighters over two hours to put out the fire. They were able to spare the building next door which was full of propane tanks.\n\nNewscenter 11 spoke with a friend of the owner, who preferred not to be interviewed on camera. He stated that he fell asleep watching TV and awoke to someone banging on his door warning him of the fire.\n\nHe said the RV had just undergone a renovation but now is a total loss. He was thankful for the fire departments who responded to help prevent the fire from spreading.\n\nThe RV was a complete loss but the business next door only received minor damage. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "An RV burned Friday night at a business north of Collinsville.", "language": "english", "author": "Nick Gunter", "og": {"description": "An RV burned Friday night at a business north of Collinsville.", "title": "Flames Nearly Engulf Business in Collinsville", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Flames-Nearly-Engulf-Business-in-Collinsville--288152621.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/A04/BFC/A04BFCB8155D410AB409AA40EFA91E07", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/653/8E6/6538E6D42D054446ADB36DCA1E3A7C25.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "An RV burned Friday night at a business north of Collinsville.", "title": "Flames Nearly Engulf Business in Collinsville", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Flames-Nearly-Engulf-Business-in-Collinsville--288152621.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Fire850.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Flames Nearly Engulf Business in Collinsville", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Flames Nearly Engulf Business in"}, "article_summary": "According to the Lauderdale County Fire Director Allan Dover, volunteer fire departments from Martin, Collinsville, and Suqualena were dispatched to extinguish an RV fire.\nHe stated that he fell asleep watching TV and awoke to someone banging on his door warning him of the fire.\nThe RV was a complete loss but the business next door only received minor damage.\nIf you were traveling along Highway 19 right at the Lauderdale, Newton County line Friday night you may have seen smoke and fire coming from a local business.\nHe said the RV had just undergone a renovation but now is a total loss."}
