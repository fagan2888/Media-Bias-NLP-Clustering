Democrats are happy to see it, because Republican disarray is one of the few things that could prevent another very good election for the GOP. We should all know the reasons for the Republican advantage by now: Midterm voters are older, whiter and more conservative than presidential election voters. Democrats have more Senate seats to defend. Republicans have a huge, baked-in advantage in the House, thanks to redistricting and the clustering of liberal voters in urban districts. So the great Democratic hope is that Republicans will sabotage themselves, by nominating unelectable wingnuts for Senate seats, and demoralizing the base with infighting. So far, Republicans seem to be cooperating.\n\nThe element of the GOP that is dedicated to a magical thinking-based strategy of forcing the nation into default until Obamacare is repealed is not happy with Speaker of the House John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. The party leaders agreed to support a \u201cclean\u201d debt limit increase, so that the party could not be accused of trying to bankrupt the country (again) right before these very important elections. (The plan is to save the next major crisis for 2015, I think.) This, obviously, has been treated as a grand betrayal of conservative principles by the usual players.\n\nTed Cruz \u2014 whose Senate career seems to be leading toward either sabotaging the Republican 2016 campaign or quitting the Senate after one term to become a professional conservative celebrity \u2014 actually forced Senate Republicans to openly vote for the increase, and ever since he has been relentlessly trashing McConnell and the GOP leadership for capitulating. As he told conservative radio firebrand Mark Levin, \u201cThey wanted to be able to tell what they view as their foolish, gullible constituents back home that they didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThat is basically true! It\u2019s also true that McConnell and Boehner can\u2019t really blame Ted Cruz for this being an issue. As Brian Beutler explained, once the GOP leadership allowed the debt limit vote to be used to extort concessions from Democrats, they legitimized debt limit extortion as a tactic. Do it once, and conservatives will understandably wonder why you\u2019re not doing it every time the debt limit is up for a vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By attacking McConnell and Boehner from the right, Cruz and friends make rival Republicans actually look reasonable", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s sulking rage: How his ire could impact GOP leaders", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "By attacking McConnell and Boehner from the right, Cruz and friends make rival Republicans actually look reasonable", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s sulking rage: How his ire could impact GOP leaders", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/19/ted_cruzs_gift_to_boehner_how_he_could_help_gop_leaders_by_undermining_them/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/ted_cruz8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "By attacking McConnell and Boehner from the right, Cruz and friends make rival Republicans actually look reasonable", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s sulking rage: How his ire could impact GOP leaders", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/ted_cruz8.jpg", "creator": "@pareene", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alex Pareene", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, Debt ceiling, Editor's Picks, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Republican Party, Tea Party, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b1b\"", "article_summary": "As Brian Beutler explained, once the GOP leadership allowed the debt limit vote to be used to extort concessions from Democrats, they legitimized debt limit extortion as a tactic.\nDo it once, and conservatives will understandably wonder why you\u2019re not doing it every time the debt limit is up for a vote.\nTopics: 2014 elections, Debt ceiling, Editor's Picks, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Republican Party, Tea Party, Ted Cruz, Politics NewsRepublicans are stumbling toward the 2014 midterm elections fighting among themselves again.\nThe party leaders agreed to support a \u201cclean\u201d debt limit increase, so that the party could not be accused of trying to bankrupt the country (again) right before these very important elections.\nWe should all know the reasons for the Republican advantage by now: Midterm voters are older, whiter and more conservative than presidential election voters."}
