The federal government is seeking the forfeiture of approximately $4.27 million from financial institutions and from residential real estate property taken in Washington State, according to the Justice Department.

A hearing to determine restitution is scheduled for December 1.

On September 25, Rooney was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison, with three years of supervision following his release, according to the Justice Department.

In January, Rooney pleaded guilty and admitted that from 2005 to 2010, he was employed as a consultant by two medical device development and sales companies, Altiva Corporation and Allure Spine Consulting.

Rooney did not disclose that he received money from both Altiva and Allure as he recommended their products for surgical use at Darnall Army Medical Center in Ft. Hood and at William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, according to authorities.
