(WAVY) \u2014 You may have been overcharged when traveling through the tolls at the Downtown and Midtown tunnels.\n\nElizabeth River Crossings\u2019 Leila Rice said, \u201cAbout one percent of those using E-ZPass through the Downtown and Midtown tunnels may have been overcharged \u2026 we are rectifying the problem, and it should be corrected by close of business Thursday.\u201d\n\nRice told 10 On Your Side complaints from motorists brought attention to the problem. E-ZPass took the complaints, called ERC personnel, who checked the license plates and confirmed some two-axle vehicles had been charged the toll price for vehicles with more axles.\n\nWAVY.com spoke with one of the overcharged drivers on Thursday. Julie Foreman checked her account and immediately knew something was wrong.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been driving to and from Portsmouth through the tunnels for 12 years,\u201d said Foreman. \u201cEven a dollar each way seems like a lot of money when you add it up. I decided to check my account on Friday to check my transactions just out of curiosity and I noticed that the very first transaction was $4 and the rest were $1.\u201d\n\nForeman says when she called customer service with questions for them about why $4 had shown up, they had questions for her too.\n\n\u201cRight off the bat they thought I had a trailer, then that I was possibly being tailgated,\u201d said Foreman.\n\nNeither of which was true. They promised to investigate and credit her back. In the meantime, more people realized they\u2019d been overcharged too.\n\nRice blames the mistake on overly sensitive road sensors that recognized two-axle vehicles as having more axles. She said most of the mistakes were made in the westbound lane of the Downtown Tunnel.\n\nOne motorist emailed 10 On Your Side to say she hasn\u2019t been charged at all for eight trips through the eastbound tube of the Downtown Tunnel. When she called ERC, she was told there were issues because the system was new and they \u2018hoped all would be fixed soon.\u2019\n\nShe said she was told she would be billed for the trips later once the system got caught up.\n\nTo check your E-ZPass account, click here.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Hampton Roads Virginia and Northeastern North Carolina News, Weather, Traffic and Sports", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488237027", "og": {"site_name": "WAVY-TV", "description": "PORTSMOUTH, Va.
