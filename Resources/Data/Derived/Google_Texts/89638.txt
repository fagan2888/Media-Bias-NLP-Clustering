KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia — Jean Frederic Chapuis led a French sweep of Olympic skicross, taking gold while Arnaud Bovolenta won silver and Jonathan Midol captured bronze.

The three quickly bolted ahead of the fourth finalist in Thursday’s race, Canada’s Brady Lehman. Lehman briefly moved into the third position but wiped out two-thirds of the way down the mountain, meaning the French only had to stay upright to secure the sweep.

They came to the line single-file, with Midol falling just before the stripe and crossing on his backside.

The French have mastered this course.

Earlier in the week, Pierre Vaultier won men’s snowboardcross to give his country its first Olympic victory in that sport’s version of side-by-side racing.
