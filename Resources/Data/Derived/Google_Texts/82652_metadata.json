He took a selfie.\n\n\u201cWhen I came back the first time here in the locker room, I had all the big memories from last year,\u201d Wawrinka said Saturday, after cruising to his third straight sets victory with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 win over Jarkko Nieminen. \u201cI came to see my picture and to take a picture with me with myself over there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best feeling. To see my picture over there with all these amazing champions,\u201d said the 29-year-old Swiss, who has spent most of his career in the shadow of countryman Roger Federer.\n\nWawrinka is the defending champion, but he does not want to dwell on it - even though he enters post-match news conferences in a bright red T-shirt provided by his sponsor that says \u201cStan the Man.\u201d\n\nHe remains today, as he was right after his victory, more subdued than overjoyed when he talks about winning his first Grand Slam title. He gives the impression of a man who does not want to jinx his success by talking about it.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on the tournament this year. I\u2019m not thinking about last year,\u201d Wawrinka said. \u201cI had some amazing memories last year, for sure. But it\u2019s really important to stay on what\u2019s happened today, and what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIn a news conference earlier in the week, Wawrinka said his approach was \u201cto start at zero again,\u201d to try to wipe out thoughts that could prove distracting.\n\nBut to briefly revisit the past, Wawrinka\u2019s triumph last year included beating the then three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals and then No. 1-ranked Rafael Nadal in the final, despite having never beaten either of them before. As a result, he rose to a career-high ranking of No. 3.\n\nThis year, Wawrinka is ranked No. 4 and could meet Djokovic in the semifinals and face another final against Nadal, who has returned from injuries in a determined bid for the title.\n\nNo. 6 Andy Murray, seeking his third Grand Slam trophy, is another possible opponent for the final.\n\nAs the Australian Open heads into its second week, the spotlight remains riveted on the top players still in the draw. The surprise third-round loss of No. 2 Roger Federer means that only three of the so-called Big Four are still in contention.\n\nSome high-profile observers, like Serena Williams, say Wawrinka cannot be overlooked.\n\n\u201cStan is playing well. He\u2019s kind of flying under the radar,\u201d said Williams, who nonetheless says Murray is her favorite to win.\n\nKeeping a low-profile suits Wawrinka fine.\n\n\u201cFor sure, I\u2019m not the focus. For me it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling great. I\u2019m happy the way I\u2019m playing. To get to the second week again, it\u2019s great. So far, everything is good for me.\u201d\n\nOn Monday in the fourth round, Wawrinka has a score to settle against Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, who beat him in the first round of last year\u2019s French Open.\n\n\u201cThat was a tough loss, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be nice to play him again in a Grand Slam - here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stan Wawrinka is true to his word.", "Author": "JOCELYN GECKER", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Stan Wawrinka is true to his word.", "title": "Stan Wawrinka and a selfie to remember at the Aussie Open", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/24/stan-wawrinka-and-a-selfie-to-remember-at-the-auss/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/24/f7cda500de111e036c0f6a7067009eed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/24/f7cda500de111e036c0f6a7067009eed.jpg", "title": "Stan Wawrinka and a selfie to remember at the Aussie Open", "description": "Stan Wawrinka is true to his word.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8e2\"", "article_summary": "6 Andy Murray, seeking his third Grand Slam trophy, is another possible opponent for the final.\n\u201cIt will be nice to play him again in a Grand Slam - here.\u201d\n\u201cFor sure, I\u2019m not the focus.\n\u201cI came to see my picture and to take a picture with me with myself over there.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the best feeling.\nAs the Australian Open heads into its second week, the spotlight remains riveted on the top players still in the draw."}
