The \u201cAhead of the Curve: Top 10 Emerging Health Care Trends \u2013 Implications for Patients, Providers, Payers and Pharmaceuticals\u201d is the culmination of a six-month research initiative involving targeted literature and an advisory panel made up of thought leaders from academia, industry, managed care, government and patient advocacy.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) jump started health care system evolution by placing the \u201cTriple Aim\u201d at the center of any transformation. This emphasizes the importance of: (1) improving patient satisfaction and quality of care; (2) improved population health; and (3) affordability.\n\n\u201cIn this fast paced environment, it is critical to understand the shifting landscape so that organizations can anticipate changes and prioritize actions,\u201d David Moules, a Vice President of Pfizer, a partner in the survey, said in a release. \u201cThe results of \u2018Ahead of the Curve\u2019 validates the biopharmaceutical industry\u2019s efforts to discover, develop and bring to market medicines deemed to be of value to the health care system including those that are responsible for paying for the medicines.\u201d\n\nThe report uncovered 10 emerging trends that are going to impact managed care pharmacy organizations over the next five years. They include:\n\nMigration from fee-for-service to new provider payment models\n\nIncreased cost pressures are driving payment models away from the popular fee-for-service models and towards systems that are more value-based with incentives for cost control and high-quality patient care.\n\nConsolidation of health care stakeholders\n\nStakeholder consolidation, standardized decisions on care practices and pharmaceutical coverage and creating opportunities to evolve patient care practices is fueled by marketplace competition and payment uncertainty.\n\nWidespread use of data and analytics in patient care\n\nAdding data and analytics to patient care provides a strong opportunity to improve care. However, technology limitations, a lack of data exchange business models and broader organizational barriers are holding back the full potential of data-driven insights.\n\nIncreased utilization and spending for specialty medicines\n\nSpending on specialty medicines will continue to increase. This forces payers and manufacturers to develop new approaches to formulary design and pricing practices that ensure patient access.\n\nMedicaid expansion\n\nExpansion will shift more economic risk from the government to payers and providers. This increases cost pressures across stakeholders and drives the creation of new, innovative models of care delivery that improves efficiency while maintaining quality.\n\nMigration to value-oriented health care marketplace\n\nValue-based models for benefit design and provider reimbursement grows as new approaches to balancing care quality and cost incentivizing use of optimal services. However, the creation of consistent definitions and benchmark metrics are needed.\n\nGrowth and performance of accountable care organizations\n\nThe accountable care organization (ACO) model is expanding with the expectations that its integrated delivery design and dual focus on care coordination and cost outcomes can drive efficiency. However a greater investment is data infrastructure is required.\n\nGreater patient engagement through technology\n\nNew technologies are having a major impact across the health care landscape for managing and coordinating care. However, increased data transparency, patient education and coordination of tools are a must.\n\nIncreasing patient cost-sharing\n\nEmployers and managed care plans are increasing costs in an effort to curtail costs and incentivize patient involvement. This requires proper design, monitoring and patient empowerment to ensure it does not turn a corner and become a negative impact on access and adherence.\n\nHealth care everywhere through new tools and mobile applications.\n\nMobile is growing in popularity and is a new avenue for patient engagement and creating additional ways to deliver health care. The home is playing a larger role and mobile offers a way to monitor patient health when away from a physician or hospital.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy Foundation released a new study that examines emerging trends in the shifting health care market.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/emerging-managed-care-pharmacy-trends-impact-patients-payers", "type": "article", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "title": "Emerging Managed Care Pharmacy Trends Impact Patients, Payers"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy Foundation released a new study that examines emerging trends in the shifting health care market.", "title": "Emerging Managed Care Pharmacy Trends Impact Patients, Payers", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "On October 9, the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) Foundation released a new study that examines emerging trends in the shifting health care market.\nConsolidation of health care stakeholdersStakeholder consolidation, standardized decisions on care practices and pharmaceutical coverage and creating opportunities to evolve patient care practices is fueled by marketplace competition and payment uncertainty.\nWidespread use of data and analytics in patient careAdding data and analytics to patient care provides a strong opportunity to improve care.\nGreater patient engagement through technologyNew technologies are having a major impact across the health care landscape for managing and coordinating care.\nIncreasing patient cost-sharingEmployers and managed care plans are increasing costs in an effort to curtail costs and incentivize patient involvement."}
