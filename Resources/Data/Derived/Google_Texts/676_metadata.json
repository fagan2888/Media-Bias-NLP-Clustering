Bertrand Olotara, a single father, has to work two jobs, 70 hours a week, and still has trouble paying his monthly bills and relies on foodstamps.\n\nOlotara serves some of the most powerful people in the country, and a number of Presidential hopefuls and warns in an op-ed for The Guardian: \u201cAmerican voters should ask themselves: if presidential candidates won\u2019t help the workers who serve them every day, will they really help the millions of low-wage American workers who they don\u2019t know or see?\u201d\n\nOlotara's surprising story highlights the fact that McDonald\u2019s and other fast food chains aren\u2019t the only restaurant companies whose low-paid workers need food stamps and Medicaid to get by. According to a new report \"The Public Cost of Low Wages in the Full-Service Restaurant Industry\" from the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC), the giant corporations operating or franchising full-service restaurants also cost taxpayers billions in public assistance for workers who are not paid enough to make ends meet.\n\nThe biggest offenders: DineEquity, which owns the IHOP and Applebee\u2019s franchises, and Darden Restaurants, owner and operator of Olive Garden and six smaller chains. A single Olive Garden restaurant cost taxpayers almost $200,000 a year in public assistance subsidies to the workers who staff it, the report estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, former Darden CEO Clarence Otis pulled in a cool $7 million in salary and other compensation in fiscal year 2014 (before he was forcibly retired). DineEquity CEO Julia Stewart made $6.6 million in 2014, a staggering sum but barely a quarter of the mind-boggling $24 million she raked in in 2012.\n\nThe Other NRA\n\nWorking with these giant corporations to keep profits and executive salaries up by keeping wages for frontline restaurant workers down, is the National Restaurant Association, \u201cthe other NRA,\u201d a lobbying powerhouse that has successfully kept the federal minimum wage for tipped workers at $2.13 an hour since 1991 and continues to oppose paid sick leave laws and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFull-service restaurant servers use public assistance at three times the rate of the rest of the workforce, says ROC founder Saru Jayaraman. With tips covering the vast majority of wages paid, and so many workers having to rely on public assistance to get by, restaurant corporations have succeeded in dumping a good portion of their labor costs onto customers and taxpayers.\n\nHoping to keep things that way, NRA lobbyists and restaurateurs flown in by the group from around the country took to Capitol Hill April 15 for the industry\u2019s annual \u201cgrassroots\u201d lobbying effort. They were there to pressure Congress to leave both regular and tipped-worker minimum wages untouched, head off momentum for federal paid sick days legislation, and curtail the ability of the National Labor Relations Board to enforce existing labor law.\n\nOn their way to The Hill, they were met by a spirited protest (youtube) from a number of organizations fighting for fair wages, including ROC, Jobs With Justice, Corporate Accountability International, and Food Chain Workers Alliance. Restaurant workers and advocates later testified at the Progressive Caucus forum: A Good Jobs Strategy For The Low Wage Economy (youtube).\n\nLow Wages Cost Taxpayers $9.4 Billion\n\nMore than four million people work in full-service restaurants in the U.S., more than in fast food. Nearly half are enrolled in at least one public-assistance program. More than one full-service restaurant worker in five lives in poverty. According to the ROC report, public assistance to families of workers in the full-service restaurant industry costs taxpayers $9.4 billion a year.\n\nDineEquity, owner and franchisor of the IHOP and Applebee\u2019s brands, was estimated to benefit from $450 million in taxpayer subsidies to the low-paid workers of its franchisees. Darden, which directly employs workers in its restaurants, benefitted to the tune of $340 million. In 2013, Darden admitted that a full 20 percent of its 150,000 strong workforce was paid just $2.13 an hour.\n\nFor just the top five full-service restaurant companies, low worker wages and benefits cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated $1.4 billion a year. Yet these five -- DineEquity, Darden Restaurants, Bloomin\u2019 Brands (Outback Steakhouse and three smaller chains), Brinker International (Chili\u2019s) and Cracker Barrel -- have spent nearly $11 million on federal lobbying and campaign contributions since 2011, according to the report. Darden is particularly aggressive on the lobbying front, spending $6.8 million on federal lobbying alone just since 2011.\n\nThe NRA is of course a lobbying colossus with a $70 million annual budget, 45 lobbyists and 200 staffers.\n\nLow-wage Restaurant Jobs Weaken Local Economies\n\nLow-wage restaurant jobs not only cost taxpayers money. They do nothing to boost local economies. In Oregon and six other states, the minimum wage for tipped restaurant workers is the same as it is for other workers. As Portland restaurateur Ron Toms points out, this means his staff makes enough to actually eat out sometimes, helping support the local restaurant economy.\n\nToms, a member of the Main Street Alliance of Oregon, a statewide network of local, independent small business owners, says, \u201cWhen workers don\u2019t earn enough to pay for the basics \u2013 to pay rent, to pay for child care, and yes, to go out for dinner once in a while \u2013 that\u2019s bad for the whole economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf jobs pay so little that people can work a full eight-hour shift and still walk away without enough money to buy a dinner out, those jobs are not going to bring more customers into my business,\u201d he adds.\n\nCalifornia is another state with no separate, lower minimum wage for tipped workers, and home to some of the highest minimum wages in the country. Yet the NRA\u2019s own data shows that restaurant jobs grew faster in California in 2014 than anywhere else in the nation. NRA chief economist Bruce Grindy reports California\u2019s restaurant workforce has grown by more than 11 percent over just the last two years.\n\nToms and other restaurateurs are supporting ROC\u2019s \u201cOne Fair Wage\u201d campaign, to get rid of the separate tipped worker minimum wage. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, another state with a thriving restaurant industry and no lower minimum wage for tipped workers, is expected to introduce legislation shortly.\n\nAs Toms notes, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to turn the national tide for economy-boosting jobs one business at a time. We need public policies that speed the creation of economy-boosting jobs across the economy, including a shared minimum wage that applies to both tipped and non-tipped workers.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the \"Other NRA's\" long fight to keep wages low at Sourcewatch.org.

Pulitzer judges lauded her for exposing \u201cthe real price of inexpensive menu items and the human costs of income inequality.\u201d\n\nImage by Food Chain Workers", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to a new report from the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC), the giant corporations operating or franchising full-service restaurants cost taxpayers billions in public assistance for workers who are not paid enough to make ends meet.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "PR Watch", "description": "According to a new report from the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC), the giant corporations operating or franchising full-service restaurants cost taxpayers billions in public assistance for workers who are not paid enough to make ends meet.", "title": "Corporate Full-Service Restaurants also Cost Taxpayers Billions", "url": "http://www.prwatch.org/news/2015/04/12794/corporate-full-service-restaurants-also-cost-taxpayers-billions", "image": "http://www.prwatch.org/files/images/ccozvufusae5nml.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-20T13:06:39-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to a new report from the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC), the giant corporations operating or franchising full-service restaurants cost taxpayers billions in public assistance for workers who are not paid enough to make ends meet.", "creator": {"identifier": "@prwatch", "id": 17290902}, "url": "http://www.prwatch.org/news/2015/04/12794/corporate-full-service-restaurants-also-cost-taxpayers-billions", "image": "http://www.prwatch.org/files/images/ccozvufusae5nml.jpg", "title": "Corporate Full-Service Restaurants also Cost Taxpayers Billions", "card": "summary"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "keywords": "alec, alecexposed, democracy, koch, kochexposed, media, scott walker, wisconsin", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-23T08:08:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-20T13:06:39-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde75e\"", "article_summary": "Low-wage Restaurant Jobs Weaken Local EconomiesLow-wage restaurant jobs not only cost taxpayers money.\nLow Wages Cost Taxpayers $9.4 BillionMore than four million people work in full-service restaurants in the U.S., more than in fast food.\nIn Oregon and six other states, the minimum wage for tipped restaurant workers is the same as it is for other workers.\nYet the NRA\u2019s own data shows that restaurant jobs grew faster in California in 2014 than anywhere else in the nation.\nFor just the top five full-service restaurant companies, low worker wages and benefits cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated $1.4 billion a year."}
