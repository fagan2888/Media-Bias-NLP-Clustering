She tweets as @Trudy_Lieberman.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: There is is addendum at the bottom of the post regarding the impact of rate increases on individuals who are eligible for subsidies and stay in the same plan from year to year.]\n\nRecently a web piece from Governing Magazine, which bills itself as the \u201cleading media platform that covers policy, politics, and management for state and local government leaders\u201d and \u201cthe most credible and authoritative voice in its field,\u201d presented a clear reminder that those who write health policy stories can commit the same sins as journos reporting on medical studies and gee-whiz technologies. Too often medical stories emphasize the benefits and omit the harms of those new interventions. So do health policy pieces that stress the benefits of some proposed, rule, regulation, or law to one group without explaining the downsides that are almost always there.\n\nCoverage that minimizes monopoly power\n\nThe story in question \u201cUnitedHealthcare\u2019s Exit Leaves Monopolies in Many Places\u201d is an example of such omission. It summarized the exit of the giant carrier from the Obamacare insurance marketplace, leaving a void in many states and an opportunity for monopoly practices in areas that will be served by a single insurer. That means, of course, the carrier still in business can dictate premiums without competitive pushback. But the overall message of this story was \u201cDon\u2019t worry folks,\u201d as it noted that although \u201cless competition means higher prices for consumers,\u201d that wasn\u2019t necessarily true in the case of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s exit.\n\nOne reason, it said: \u201c86 percent of the people who use the marketplaces get health insurance subsidies\u201d to buy coverage, a point repeated by policy shops and advocates who want to downplay the effects of possible rate increases, whether they pop up in the context of insurance market concentration or of warnings from regulators that rate hikes are in the offing. The news media has been too eager to pass on that message without giving a more complete story. It\u2019s like presenting the relative risk of some new medical intervention without also giving the absolute risk.\n\nGoverning reported that even if people in Kansas and Oklahoma\u2014states where United is pulling out\u2014are left with one carrier, \u201cit\u2019s unlikely that consumers will feel too much of a pinch. If premiums increase, so do their subsidies.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where the story went wrong\n\nSome people do get subsidies, and subsidies do go up, but they\u2019re not created equal. Subsidies diminish in value the more money a family has. A family of four with an annual income of $24,300, or 100 percent of the poverty level, receives a larger subsidy than a family with an income of 300 percent of poverty, which is $72,900. A family with the lower income living in Topeka, Kansas, for example, would get a subsidy of $610 a month to buy the second lowest-cost silver plan available to them, leaving them to pay only $41 a month. (The policy costs $7817 a year.) The higher-income family would get only $66. So they would have to pay $586 of the monthly premium on their own. Higher premiums matter a lot to those receiving smaller subsidies and could potentially force some of them to drop their coverage.\n\nPeople not eligible for any subsidy will also feel the pinch. Subsidies phase out for families with incomes at 400 percent of poverty, or $97,200 for a family of four, and there are no subsidies for those who buy insurance in the individual market outside the exchanges. For 2017 the Congressional Budget Office estimates that three million Americans will get insurance from the exchanges with no subsidies and nine million will buy individual market policies outside the exchanges, exposing 12 million people to rate hikes in the so-called individual market.\n\nIgnoring impact on half of individual market buyers\n\nThat\u2019s the same number buying subsidized policies, but Governing didn\u2019t discuss them. Most news outlets didn\u2019t either, overlooking the effects of high premiums on half the buyers in the individual market. The Hill, in a short piece pegged to warnings of large rate increases this fall and an upbeat report from the Obama administration, told readers \u201cwhile some insurers did spike premiums by double-digits last year, consumers can often switch into a different plan or get help from a tax credit so they don\u2019t necessarily have to pay that increase.\u201d The Fiscal Times reported that \u201cFederal officials stress that the average rate doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, and that in many cases after consumers shop around for the best price and government subsidies are applied, the actual premium increase is lower.\u201d That\u2019s true, but then federal officials weren\u2019t giving the paper the whole story either. No mention of the 12 million policyholders not eligible for subsidies!\n\nDon\u2019t forget copays, deductibles, and premiums\n\nThe AP seems to have recalibrated its coverage after initially leaving the same hole. At first AP cited administration officials who said \u201ctalk of premium increases is premature and overblown\u201d and rate requests will be lowered in some states. \u201cMost significantly,\u201d the AP added, \u201cthe law\u2019s subsidies are designed to shield consumers from rising costs. More than 8 out of 10 customers receive tax credits to help pay their premiums, and that assistance will increase as premiums rise.\u201d A revised story sent a little later the same day offered readers a more complete picture.\n\nMore than 12 million people nationwide get coverage through the health law\u2019s markets, which offer subsidized private insurance. But the increases could also affect several million who purchase individual policies outside the government system.\n\nWhile I\u2019m arguing that health policy stories about rates should be more complete, I will add that any rate story shouldn\u2019t just cover increases or decreases for next year\u2019s rates. Rates are a terrible proxy for the total cost of coverage someone will pay, but are the easiest to compare\u2014and misleading. It\u2019s the combination of deductibles, copays, coinsurance and the premium that determine what a family will pay. Low premiums almost always mean higher out-of-pocket costs. News outlets that leave out those elements are as guilty of the sins of omission as the media organizations that have forgotten the 12 million people ineligible for subsidies.\n\nEditor\u2019s Addendum 5/26/16\n\nWe\u2019ve received comments to the effect that premium increases on plans in the Obamacare insurance marketplace do not affect individuals who maintain the same plan \u2014 the subsidy will increase to make sure that the cost of the plan does not go up overall. Trudy Lieberman\u2019s response follows:\n\nIt\u2019s true that the premium will not change from year to year for individuals who choose the second lowest cost silver plan available in their area if they qualify for a subsidy and their incomes don\u2019t change as a percentage of the federal poverty level. However, the plan that is the second lowest cost silver plan has typically changed every year, which means those people would have to change their plan each year to whatever the new second lowest cost silver plan is in order to retain the same premium.\n\nFor many the second lowest cost silver plan is not always as attractive as other silver plans or other metal tier choices. Rate increases do matter, particularly if a person is going to choose something other than the second lowest silver plan. To avoid a premium rate change when a new second lowest cost silver plan is introduced, the person would need to change to the new second lowest cost plan, which could mean lower or different benefits, possibly more managed care requirements and/or a different provider network often with less choice. If a person chooses a plan other than the second lowest cost silver plan, he or she needs to consider how their premium rates will increase since their subsidy is determined according to the difference between the premium rates of the second lowest cost silver plan and their income-based payment obligation, not on the premium rate of the plan they choose.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.2", "description": "Subsidies won't protect many from big Obamacare rate increases -- a fact not communicated by some news stories.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Rate increases do matter, particularly if a person is going to choose something other than the second lowest silver plan.\nFor many the second lowest cost silver plan is not always as attractive as other silver plans or other metal tier choices.\nAt first AP cited administration officials who said \u201ctalk of premium increases is premature and overblown\u201d and rate requests will be lowered in some states.\nHowever, the plan that is the second lowest cost silver plan has typically changed every year, which means those people would have to change their plan each year to whatever the new second lowest cost silver plan is in order to retain the same premium.\n[Editor\u2019s note: There is is addendum at the bottom of the post regarding the impact of rate increases on individuals who are eligible for subsidies and stay in the same plan from year to year.]"}
