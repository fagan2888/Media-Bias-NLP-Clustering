Sen. Thomas V. Mike Miller speaks to the Senate on the first day… (Algerina Perna, Baltimore…)

Sen. President Thomas V. Mike Miller said the investigations into how the state bungled its $107 million health exchange would continue until lawmakers are satisfied.

“The public wants answers, and the buck stops here,” Miller said.

He added: “This is not anything about corruption or malfeasance. It might be about incompetence, it might be about people not extending proper oversight.”

A panel of state lawmakers had planned to hold their second inquiry this week into the flubbed online insurance marketplace on Friday, recalling the state’s secretary to testify again and requesting every document that has been released about the glitch-ridden site.

Sen. Thomas “Mac” Middleton, chair of the Finance Committee, said that the hearing had been postponed, and he did not offer a reason why. The state's health secretary, Joshua Sharfstein, had been scheduled to appear.
