Unfortunately, they're getting crushed.\u201dUnder Obamacare, companies that employ 50 or more full-time workers must provide health benefits that meet higher standards than were required before the law\u2019s passage or pay a $2,000-per-worker fine to the IRS.As a result of the new rules, many companies that provide health benefits have faced higher health insurance costs and passed those premium increases along to their workers. By some estimates, hundreds of other U.S. companies have cut health benefits, reduced worker hours, and eliminated coverage for part-timers, worker spouses, and retirees to cope with the law\u2019s employer mandate.Carpel tells Newsmax Now that 83 percent of some 2,500 businesses Level Funded Health recently polled said they find it challenging to offer competitive health benefits.\u201cI would say the number one reason is healthcare cost skyrocketing \u2014 and therefore health insurance cost skyrocketing \u2014 but what the ACA has really failed to accomplish is to get healthcare cost under control,\u201d he says.\u201cAnd really the new methodology \u2014 the new way that the health insurance carriers come up with their health insurance premiums \u2014 really penalizes small business more than it does health [insurers] and then in turn it penalizes their employees.\u201dCarpel notes that health insurance costs for a small businesses are the second largest line of expenses.\u201cAt the same time, it's the single most sought out \u2026 employee benefit for any company, far surpassing 401K or pensions or anything similar to that,\u201d he explains.As a result, for many small businesses Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate \u201creally\u2026backs them into a corner.\u201dHe adds: \u201cThey're being mandated if they have 50 or more employees to offer health insurance, but at the same time, the costs are skyrocketing which is hindering their ability to attract and retain the top human capital.\u201dSmall businesses have historically faced higher insurance costs than medium-sized and larger employers, in part because they have fewer resources and a smaller pool of workers with which to negotiate prices with insurers.\u201cSince the premiums are spiking so much on these small businesses, they're the ones that are bearing the brunt of this financial burden\u2026[while] big business like Blue Cross \u2014 [and] folks like this that dominate the market share and the small group health insurance market \u2014 are seeing record profits because of the ACA,\u201d Carpel says.Citing recent comments by GOP presidential candidate Florida Sen.
