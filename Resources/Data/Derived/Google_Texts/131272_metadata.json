Richard Nixon resigned shortly after the court ruled unanimously he must turn over the Watergate tapes.\n\nBill Clinton's impeachment was triggered by the court's decision that he must answer questions under oath in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. And George W. Bush lost before the court when he claimed his power as commander in chief gave him almost unfettered authority over prisoners held at the Guantanamo Bay prison.\n\nNow, as President Obama begins his last year in office, the court is set to render a verdict on his use of his executive authority. The justices will decide whether he violated the law by authorizing more than 4 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation and obtain work permits.\n\nThere are signs that at least some of the justices are ready to rein in the president's ability to take such bold action without the approval of Congress.\n\nNever before has the high court ruled that a president violated his constitutional duty to \u201ctake care\u201d that laws are \u201cfaithfully executed.\u201d Yet when justices agreed to hear the immigration case, they surprised many by asking both sides to present arguments on whether Obama's actions violated the rarely invoked \u201ctake care\u201d provision. That question had not even been at issue when lower courts blocked Obama's plan from taking effect.\n\nIn a separate pending case this term, the court also will rule on whether the president and his healthcare advisors went too far by requiring Catholic charities and other faith-based employers to formally opt out of providing a full range of contraceptives to their female employees by citing their religious objections.\n\nThe faith-based entities argued that by notifying the government of their decision to opt out \u2014 which triggers a process under which employees would get contraceptive coverage by other means \u2014 they would be \u201ccomplicit\u201d in supplying \u201cabortion-inducing drugs.\u201d\n\nThe decisions, both due by summer, will help answer a question that looms over Obama's presidency. Has he properly used his power as chief executive to circumvent congressional gridlock on issues such as immigration, climate change and healthcare, or has he gone too far and violated his duty to enforce the laws as set by Congress?\n\nThe cases come before the court with a backdrop of Republican claims that the president has overreached and abused his power. Former House Speaker John A. Boehner said Obama was \u201cacting like a king\u201d and \u201cdamaging the presidency\u201d when he announced the deportation-relief plan now before the high court.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas promises GOP voters that, if he is elected president, his first task on his first day in the White House will be to \u201crescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action of Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials and supporters of the president counter that Obama's actions are not only legal and well within his discretionary authority, but that Congress has left him no choice by refusing to take action on pressing national problems.\n\nConservative scholars think Obama has left himself vulnerable by announcing broad executive actions on policies that had been considered and rejected by Congress, and which even he once said were beyond his authority.\n\nIn his first term, Obama told Latino activists who were pushing him to take unilateral action that he could not \u201cwaive away the laws Congress put in place\u201d regarding the removal of immigrants who entered the country illegally. But later the president decided he did have the power to suspend deportation and offer \u201clawful presence\u201d and work permits to as many as 5 million of those immigrants.\n\nSo far conservatives have mostly failed to derail Obama in the Supreme Court. Twice, the justices upheld the president's healthcare law against conservative attacks, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. casting his vote with the court's four liberals.\n\nFour years ago, in a key test of state-versus-federal power, the court ruled for Obama after his administration sued to block Arizona from enforcing a law to crack down on immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nIn 2011, Obama and then-Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. raised ruffles on the right when they announced the administration would not defend in court the Defense of Marriage Act, which recognized only marriages between a man and a woman. House Republicans took up the cause, but two years later the high court agreed with the administration and struck down key parts of the law as unconstitutional.\n\nBut the new immigration and contraceptive cases pose a tough test for Obama's lawyers. In last year's healthcare case, they were defending a law that had won approval in Congress, when both chambers were controlled by Democrats. \u201cWe must respect the role of the legislature and take care not to undo what it has done,\u201d Roberts said in upholding its system of insurance subsidies.\n\nThis year, by contrast, Obama is defending an executive action on immigration that was taken without the approval of Congress and in the face of fierce Republican criticism.\n\nSimilarly, the \u201ccontraceptive mandate\u201d was not spelled out in the Affordable Care Act, as lawyers for Catholic bishops often point out. It was adopted later in a regulation issued by Obama's healthcare advisors.\n\nBut Obama's defenders, including immigration law experts, say the critics are missing the crucial point that the deportation laws give the chief executive a free hand to decide how or whether to deport those living here illegally. Contrary to what many assume, the law does not say federal officials must arrest and deport such people. Rather, it says they are \u201csubject\u201d to removal, based on policies and priorities set by the executive branch.\n\nObama's administration says it wants to focus on deporting criminals, security threats, gang members and drug traffickers, not parents and grandparents who have children in the United States legally.\n\nThe administration can quote a powerful voice to back up its view of the matter. \u201cAliens may be removed\u201d if they entered the country illegally and committed crimes, said Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, but \u201ca principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials.... Federal officials, as an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all. As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Supreme Court to render a verdict on Obama's use of executive authority", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The Supreme Court has often dealt a big blow to presidents in their second term.", "title": "Supreme Court to render a verdict on Obama's use of executive authority", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-court-presidential-power-20160208-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56b4ce1b/turbine/la-na-court-presidential-power-20160208", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obama, Supreme Court, immigration", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/85796066", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-02-07", "Description": "The Supreme Court has often dealt a big blow to presidents in their second term.
