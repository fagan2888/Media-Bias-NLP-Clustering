139-year-old California hospital to close this month

Colusa (Calif.) Regional Medical Center and three of its clinics will close April 22.

Regarding the closure, Colusa Regional Interim CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer Wayne Allen said, "During the last three years, it has become increasingly more difficult for a small community hospital to survive."



Although Mr. Allen didn't provide details as to the hospitals pending closure, John Loundon, the CRMC board liaison, told the Appeal-Democrat thatchanging reimbursement models under the Affordable Care Act, loss of capital and a medical paradigm shift to outpatient care are the primary reasons for the closure.

Mr. Allen said CRMC's management will continue to seek potential buyers for the hospital for the next three to six months.
