It's the last day to sign up for a health insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act that begins January 1.

Sorien Schmidt heads up North Carolina operations for the nonprofit Enroll America.

"If you already have a plan on the marketplace, it will end December 31st," Schmidt says. "If you have not selected a new plan by December 15th, you may not automatically transfer over to your next plan, or you may not get the full subsidy for which you're eligible."



Enroll for America is hosting a walk-in enrollment event at Martin Street Baptist Church in Raleigh from 9 a.m.-2 p.m. today. Staff will be on hand to help people choose a plan and find out if they're eligible for financial assistance.

Schmidt says there are health care volunteers and staff in every county in North Carolina helping people look for a plan, sears for subsidies and get enrolled. You can find more information here.

"I think enrollment assisters do walk people through the process, often are able to find out that the person qualifies for more financial help, and then take care of the issue that their premium went up, but they also are gonna get financial assistance to help then pay for it, or help them look at other plans that are available."

The open enrollment period to buy health insurance runs through January, but those who do not have health insurance in January could face penalties.
