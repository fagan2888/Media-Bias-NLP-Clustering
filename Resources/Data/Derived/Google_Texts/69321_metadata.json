My family of three is covered through my wife's job. My wife\u2019s coverage is free for herself, but it\u2019s $1,000 a month for my daughter and me. Can the two of us get coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace in our state (New Jersey)?\n\nA. This is a complicated question, filled with lots of good news and bad news.\n\nGood news: Yes, you and your daughter can get insurance through your state's health insurance marketplace.\n\nBad news: Because of a glitch in the law, you won't be able to get financial help to pay for it. As long as your wife\u2019s contribution to coverage for her alone is less than 9.5 percent of your entire household\u2019s income (it\u2019s free, so it obviously meets this standard), it disqualifies everyone in your family from getting financial assistance to purchase health insurance through new Health Insurance Marketplace. If your wife did not have insurance through her job, your family would eligible for at least some financial help with premiums if it had an annual household income of less than about $78,000.\n\n\n\nGood news: There is nothing to stop you and your daughter from buying unsubsidized health insurance through the marketplace. It might still be cheaper than what you are paying to be on your wife\u2019s plan.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health Insurance Marketplace, New Jersey, employer health plan, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Health, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance, Money", "Title": "Replacing Employer Coverage With a Marketplace Health Plan - Consumer Reports News", "og": {"url": "http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2013/10/replacing-employer-coverage-with-marketplace-health-plan/index.htm", "image": "http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/news_articles/health/CRO_health_askNancy_AdultParentsChild_10-13.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Replacing Employer Coverage With a Marketplace Health Plan - Consumer Reports News"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "publishDate": "2013-10-18T21:00Z", "primarytag": "Health", "last-modified": "2013-10-24T15:29Z", "fb": {"app_id": 551478298314138}, "searchTitle": "Consumer Reports: Replacing Employer Coverage With a Marketplace Health Plan - Consumer Reports News", "keywords": "Health Insurance Marketplace, New Jersey, employer health plan, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Health, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance, Money", "contenttag": "Money", "description": "Families with expensive employer coverage can replace it with a marketplace health plan, but with a possible glitch.
