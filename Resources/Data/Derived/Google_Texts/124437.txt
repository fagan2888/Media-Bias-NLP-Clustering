Blues harmonica on tap at Serb Hall

Jim Liban has been getting a lot of attention lately, for good reason. The local blues harmonica master released a strong new album of 14 originals this year, "I Say What I Mean," and was celebrated last month at Shank Hall for his 50 years playing the harmonica, with a day of jam sessions with some 20-plus musicians who've played with Liban throughout his career.

The Liban love continues: The Wisconsin Blues Harmonica Festival takes place Friday at American Serb Hall, 5101 W. Oklahoma Ave., and a Wisconsin Blues Harmonica Festival wouldn't be complete without one of Wisconsin's best blues harmonica players.

There are many more acts on the bill, including the Dave Miller Band,Westside Andy, Blue Rick Gerek, Lil' Rev,Danny Miller and Doc.

The show begins at 6 p.m., with a fish fry available at 9 p.m. The cover is $10.
