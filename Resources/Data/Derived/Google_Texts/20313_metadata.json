The case was filed in South Florida federal court by former employees from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), a nonprofit provider administering HIV prevention services, testing, and health care, and recently amended with further case details.\n\nThe three whistleblowers \u2014 Jack Carrel, Mauricio Ferrer, and Shawn Loftis \u2014 were fired after they claimed the foundation was paying employees $100 to refer patients who tested positive to their own clinic, pharmacy, and insurance service centers. They said the foundation was using patient referrals as a way to boost funding received by Medicare and Medicaid federal health programs. Both the federal government and the state of Florida formally declined to intervene in any legal action on behalf of the three former employees, which \u201cspeaks volumes about the merits of the case.\u201d AHF President Michael Weinstein said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSmall incentives for linking and retaining people in care are mainstays of public health interventions \u2014 including by many CDC projects,\u201d he added. \u201cWe look forward to the opportunity to rebut these baseless charges in court.\u201d\n\nMore than 1.2 million people are living with HIV in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the number of new infections has remained relatively stable in the last 20 years. Weinstein directed his staff to implement the patient financial incentive program nationwide in order to link HIV-positive people to the services they needed. The Los Angeles-based company treats more than 400,000 patients and is planning a worldwide testing initiative designed to treat approximately 25 million people who didn\u2019t know they were infected, according to their site.\n\n\"Not only has AIDS Healthcare Foundation done nothing wrong,\u201d Weinstein said, \u201cour pro-active approach to finding and linking HIV-positive individuals to lifesaving care and treatment is critical to stopping HIV in this country.\u201d\n\nThe former employees\u2019 attorneys said they were protected under the Federal False Claim Act (FCA), because according to the National Whistleblowers Center it \u201cincludes protection for \u2018whistleblowers\u2019 which allows someone with actual knowledge of alleged violations to even file a lawsuit on behalf of the federal government. A whistleblower whose case is accepted and prosecuted could qualify for a percentage of any recovery to the federal government.\u201d\n\nIf AHF was found guilty, a portion of the settlement with the federal government would go to the three whistleblowers. For each violation, considered in this case as positive test referrals, there could be a penalty of up to $11,000. There were 1,181 referrals Medicare or Medicaid referrals made by the foundation since 2010. On Feb. 9, 2015, \u201cNotice to Decline Intervention by United States of America\u201d was filed, and following day, \u201cNotice to Decline Intervention by State of Florida\u201d was also filed.\n\nIf employees were found to be protected under the FCA for whistleblowers, they may have a viable case because they were promptly fired by the foundation, which violates the False Claim Act. However, the likelihood of the prosecution finding the foundation guilty of Medicare and Medicaid fraud is unlikely, according to the government\u2019s \u201cdeclined intervention.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "aids, foundation, accused, manipulating, medicare, and, medicaid, funding, govt, declines", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A nonprofit foundation administering HIV services sued after paying employees to find patients that tested positive.", "title": "AIDS Foundation Incentivizes HIV Testing, Leads To Lawsuit", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/aids-foundation-accused-manipulating-medicare-and-medicaid-funding-govt-declines-328728", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/09/hiv-test-incentives.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A nonprofit foundation administering HIV services sued after paying employees to find patients that tested positive.", "title": "AIDS Foundation Incentivizes HIV Testing, Leads To Lawsuit", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/aids-foundation-accused-manipulating-medicare-and-medicaid-funding-govt-declines-328728", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/09/hiv-test-incentives.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/09/hiv-test-incentives.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-04-09T17:52:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-09T17:52:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A nonprofit foundation administering HIV services sued after paying employees to find patients that tested positive."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca923\"", "article_summary": "They said the foundation was using patient referrals as a way to boost funding received by Medicare and Medicaid federal health programs.\nHowever, the likelihood of the prosecution finding the foundation guilty of Medicare and Medicaid fraud is unlikely, according to the government\u2019s \u201cdeclined intervention.\u201d\nThere were 1,181 referrals Medicare or Medicaid referrals made by the foundation since 2010.\nFor each violation, considered in this case as positive test referrals, there could be a penalty of up to $11,000.\n\u201cSmall incentives for linking and retaining people in care are mainstays of public health interventions \u2014 including by many CDC projects,\u201d he added."}
