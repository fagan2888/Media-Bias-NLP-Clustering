Individual billionaires and millionaires have dominated the scene instead. Perhaps it\u2019s in part because some corporations dipping their toes into new modes of campaign funding have been rebuffed by hostile consumer and stockholder reaction: witness the backlash in 2010 when Target contributed $150,000 to a 501(c)(4) supporting anti-gay rights gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer in Minnesota.\n\nBut other corporate giants seem to have no such qualms about negative public feedback. Chevron, for example. Based in California, the multinational energy company is the third largest producer of crude in the world and greedily grateful for ongoing, generous subsidies from Congress.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, \u201cIn 2013, its revenue topped those of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Apple Inc. and General Motors Co., trailing only retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and rival Exxon Mobil Corp\u2026 In August, Chevron reported $57.9 billion in revenue for the second quarter, which ended June 30.\u201d\n\nYes, Chevron has money to burn \u2013 look at the millions and millions the company has spent fighting the $9.5 billion in damages they were ordered to pay by the Ecuadorian Supreme Court for pollution of part of the Amazon rainforest. That extravagance extends to electioneering as well, and not only to federal races but right down to a local city council election.\n\nChevron has made big contributions this campaign cycle to the National Republican Senatorial and Congressional Committees, US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Texas Senator John Cornyn, Senate minority whip as well as an influential member of the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 OpenSecrets.org reports thatChevron recently donated $1 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund, \u201ca conservative super PAC with ties to Karl Rove\u2019s dark money network in early July, a rare instance of a prominent publicly traded company taking advantage of the post-Citizens United rules on corporate involvement in politics. It\u2019s not the first time Chevron has made such a donation \u2014 in the 2012 cycle, it gave $2.5 million to the same group\u2026\u201d At the time, the Public Campaign Action Fund noted, \u201cThe donation appears to be the largest from a publicly-traded corporation in the post-Citizens United era.\u201d\n\nIn the midterms so far, OpenSecrets says \u201cthe super PAC has spent just $504,000 on ads, mounting attacks on three Democrats \u2014 particularly Rep. Pete Gallego (D-Texas). But CLF has already paid out close to $2.2 million to a media buying firm for \u2018pre-payment\u2019 of ads that have yet to run; that money almost certainly will be spent, it\u2019s just a question of when and where.\u201d\n\nOne other place we know that Chevron has targeted for its electoral cash largesse is the city of Richmond, California (population 107,571), site of one of the state\u2019s two largest oil refineries \u2013 both owned by Chevron.\n\nIn August 2012, toxic smoke from a fire at the Richmond refinery (there had been other serious fires in 1989 and 1999) sent 15,000 residents to local hospitals seeking treatment, many of them for respiratory problems. A year later, Chevron paid $2 million in fines and restitution and pled no contest to six charges that included, the Associated Press reported, \u201cfailing to correct deficiencies in equipment and failing to require the use of certain equipment to protect employees from potential harm.\u201d\n\nAround the same time as the settlement, Richmond\u2019s City Council decided to file its own suit, accusing Chevron of \u201ca continuation of years of neglect, lax oversight and corporate indifference to necessary safety inspection and repairs.\u201d Fourteen other incidents of toxic gas releases from the refinery since 1989 were cited in the filing.\n\nRichmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin told Democracy Now\u2019s Amy Goodman, \u201cWe owe it to our community to totally ensure their safety and to bring forward and safeguard the rights of our community to live, play and work without the threat of injury because of Chevron and with the threat of Chevron bringing forward yet another incident\u2026 due to the lack of safety in their facilities. We really feel strongly. This is serious in Richmond, and we\u2019re not backing down.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reports reveal the multinational has been pumping cash into Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn's Senate campaigns", "title": "Chevron greases local elections with dark money", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Reports reveal the multinational has been pumping cash into Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn's Senate campaigns", "title": "Chevron greases local elections with dark money", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/25/chevron_greases_local_election_with_geyser_of_cash_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/AP070725183951-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Reports reveal the multinational has been pumping cash into Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn's Senate campaigns", "title": "Chevron greases local elections with dark money", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/AP070725183951-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Winship", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, BillMoyers.com, Chevron, Citizens United, Los Angeles Times", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbaf\"", "article_summary": "Topics: BillMoyers.com, Chevron, Citizens United, Los Angeles Times, Business News, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on BillMoyers.com.\nThat extravagance extends to electioneering as well, and not only to federal races but right down to a local city council election.\nChevron, for example.\nBut other corporate giants seem to have no such qualms about negative public feedback.\nThis is serious in Richmond, and we\u2019re not backing down.\u201d"}
