New York State’s lieutenant governor said in an interview with public radio and TV that she is not harboring ambitions to be the state’s first woman governor.

Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul said she does not know when the state’s proverbial glass ceiling will be broken and New York will have a woman in charge of the chief executive post, but she said it is unlikely it will be her who reaches that milestone. “I don’t harbor higher ambitions,” Hochul said.

The former western New York Congresswoman said when she lost her seat in the conservative leaning district over her support of the Affordable Care Act, she did not expect to be back in elected office until Governor Cuomo contacted her to replace the retiring Robert Duffy. She said she is content with that. “I’m going to embrace it,” she said. “I’m going to enjoy the three and a half years I have left, because I know, in my business, that can be the end of the game.”

Hochul has been traveling the state to promote economic growth and Governor Cuomo’s agenda.
