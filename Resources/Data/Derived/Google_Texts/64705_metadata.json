Now, for me as a Christian \u2014 for me \u2014 for me as a Christian, it is also a sacred union. God\u2019s in the mix.\"\n\nObama maintained his false opposition to gay marriage until May 2012 when he told ABC News' he had \"been going through an evolution on this issue.\"\n\n\"At a certain point I've just concluded that, for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,\" Obama explained.\n\nThe White House then avidly promoted Obama's new found enthusiasm for gay marriage, incorporating it into their reelection campaign outreach to Democratic constituencies like his 2012 Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program and the free birth control provisions of the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Surprise!
