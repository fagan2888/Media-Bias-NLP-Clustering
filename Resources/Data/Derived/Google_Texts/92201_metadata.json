The so-called HHS mandate is not in the Obamacare statute, and indeed if it had been in the law there is no way that Obamacare would have passed either house of Congress in 2010, even given the Democrats\u2019 control of Congress then. Rather, the mandate is a function of the administration\u2019s interpretation of a very broad provision of the statute allowing HHS to define the minimal requirements for health insurance coverage. The administration was under no legal obligation to include contraceptive or abortive coverage in that definition. The White House chose to do that, surely knowing that it would invite exactly the kind of fight that has ensued.\n\nHaving sparked that fight, the administration has since worked at every turn to minimize and narrow any religious exemption included in the rule.

The brief filed on behalf of the Little Sisters of the Poor states plainly that such accommodations are possible from their point of view.
