Warren, perhaps the best-known member, told the magazine he doesn\u2019t endorse candidates.\n\nWarren, an opponent of marriage equality, has worked with both Democrats and Republicans. Then-Sen. Barack Obama appeared at a World AIDS Day event at Saddleback in 2006, and Warren in 2008 hosted a forum for both presidential candidates, Obama and Sen. John McCain. Obama invited Warren to give the opening prayer at his first inauguration, in 2009, a move that brought Obama significant criticism from LGBT activists and other progressives.\n\nWarren and the other board members will \u201cadvise the campaign on a range of issues, including persecuted Christians in the Middle East, legal concerns about the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act, and religious liberty for those opposed to same-sex marriage,\u201d World reports.\n\nSo far in the campaign, Rubio has not highlighted religion as much as some other candidates have, but when he has discussed the topic, he has made his conservative views clear. \u201cWe are at the water\u2019s edge of the argument that mainstream Christian teaching is hate speech,\u201d he told the Christian Broadcasting Network last spring. \u201cBecause today we\u2019ve reached the point in our society where if you do not support same-sex marriage, you are labeled a homophobe and a hater.\u201d\n\nRubio underscores his faith in an ad that just debuted in Iowa, where voters will choose candidates in presidential caucuses February 1, and where the religious conservative vote is important for Republicans. \u201cOur goal is eternity, the ability to live alongside our creator for all time,\u201d he says in the ad (watch below). \u201cTo accept the free gift of salvation offered to us by Jesus Christ. The struggle on a daily basis as a Christian is to remind ourselves of this. The purpose of our life is to cooperate with God\u2019s plan.\u201d\n\nRubio also released another ad, displaying his allegiance to another American tradition that is almost a religion for many: football. Why? As USA Today reported: \"because football.\" You can watch that ad here.\n\nRubio is Roman Catholic; his family joined the Mormon Church at one point in his childhood but went back to Catholicism. He has also sometimes attended a Southern Baptist church.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The candidate appoints a so-called religious freedom advisory board featuring Rick Warren and other prominent conservatives.", "og": {"image": "http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2016/01/08/rubio_warrenx750.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-08T19:53:06-05:00", "type": "article", "title": "Marco Rubio Courts Religious Right and Football Fans, Launches New Ads"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Advocate", "fb": {"page_id": 19799718480, "app_id": 625763650825412, "pages": 6030918854}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-08T17:13:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T17:13:07-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe5155\"", "article_summary": "Marco Rubio Courts Religious Right and Football Fans, Launches New AdsAs leaders of the religious right flock to Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 to the chagrin of fellow Christian conservative Mike Huckabee \u2014 some, including megachurch pastor Rick Warren, are teaming up with Marco Rubio.\nSo far in the campaign, Rubio has not highlighted religion as much as some other candidates have, but when he has discussed the topic, he has made his conservative views clear.\nMembership on the board doesn\u2019t equal an endorsement of Rubio, and members are free to advise other campaigns as well, Eric Teetsel, director of faith outreach for Rubio\u2019s campaign, told Christian magazine World.\nRubio is Roman Catholic; his family joined the Mormon Church at one point in his childhood but went back to Catholicism.\n\u201cWe are at the water\u2019s edge of the argument that mainstream Christian teaching is hate speech,\u201d he told the Christian Broadcasting Network last spring."}
