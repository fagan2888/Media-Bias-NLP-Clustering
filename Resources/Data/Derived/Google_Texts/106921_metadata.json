But the House and Senate will soon vote on a bill that would redefine full-time work to 40 hours or more a week.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., condemned the proposed change, calling it a \u201cpolitical game that jeopardizes\u2026hard-earned health care benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis misguided proposal...would actually create the problem they\u2019re pretending to solve,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBy moving the threshold to 40 hours, a worker who already receives health coverage through their job could see their schedule cut by just one hour a week \u2013 to 39 hours instead of 40 \u2013 and their family\u2019s health care taken away. That\u2019s not just counterproductive, it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats pointed to a Congressional Budget Office report that says changing the definition of full-time work would reduce the number of employers assessed penalties and lower the penalties assessed against other employers, which would decrease the amount of penalties collected and raise the budget deficit.\n\nRepublicans argued that the current law makes it likely that businesses \u2013 especially those that hire low-wage, low-skilled works \u2013 will keep their employees' hours under 30 a week.\n\nDavid French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, said altering the definition will \"restore an established workforce precedent and protect business owners and their employees.\"\n\nHoteliers also hoped for change.\n\n\"Changing the definition of a full-time employee back to the traditional 40 hours is an important adjustment that affords hoteliers \u2013 many of whom are small businesses \u2013 and their employees the flexibility they need in today\u2019s workforce,\u201d said American Hotel and Lodging Association President and CEO Katherine Lugar.\n\nThe legislation is supported by Connecticut business groups, too, including the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.\n\nBut it has hit a roadblock.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House threatened to veto the bill if it reaches President Obama\u2019s desk. A vote by two-thirds of the House and Senate would be needed to override the veto.\n\nIt won\u2019t be the last time Republicans in Congress try to ease the ACA\u2019s requirements on business \u2013 and their efforts are likely win the support of some Connecticut companies.\n\nThe health care law\u2019s effect is far greater on some companies than others, said Jennifer Herz, assistant counsel for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.\n\nHerz said most of the state\u2019s large companies already offer their employers health care coverage \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean the ACA hasn\u2019t had an impact.\n\nFor many Connecticut businesses, the ACA has driven up health care costs because companies have had to improve benefits to comply with the law and pay higher rates and new fees.\n\nHerz said the ACA has had a lesser impact on Connecticut companies that self-insure. Those companies assume the financial risk for providing health care benefits to employees by paying claims as they are incurred instead of paying a fixed premium to an insurance carrier. The ACA has had a greater impact on companies that fully insure, purchasing coverage from an insurer, Herz said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a feeling there\u2019s a looming impact for some companies, and that's the \u2018Cadillac tax'.\u201d\n\nBeginning in 2018, an excise tax will be imposed on employer-provided health care plans whose benefits are determined to be overly generous.\n\nThat includes coverage for executives \u2013 and for many unionized workers who in many cases traded pay raises to keep comprehensive health plans.\n\nSmall businesses, those with between 50 and 100 employees, don\u2019t have to comply with the mandate to cover their workers for another year.\n\nTo help those small businesses, Congress on Tuesday approved a bill that would amend the ACA so that workers who have medical coverage under TRICARE or the Veterans Administration would not be taken into account in determining whether a company has enough workers to trigger the mandate.\n\nThat bill was approved unanimously and did not provoke a veto threat.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/01/08/obamacare-mandate-hits-some-ct-firms-harder-than-others/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Politics, ACA, Affordable Care Act, Cadilllac tax, Chris Murphy, Congress, Connecticut Business and Industry Association, employer mandate, full-time worker", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/01/08/obamacare-mandate-hits-some-ct-firms-harder-than-others/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Connecticut businesses must begin complying with  the Affordable Care Act this year, but the new  Republican-led Congress is trying to blunt the impact.
