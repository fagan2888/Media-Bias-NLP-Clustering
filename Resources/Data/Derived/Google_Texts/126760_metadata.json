One of only five bands from the United States invited to participate in the ceremony, the nationally recognized Marching Knights will perform at the American Cemetery and in the annual parade at Sainte-Mere-Eglise, the first village to be liberated by the American troops, according to a prepared statement.\n\n\u201cI am very proud of the Old Bridge High School Marching Knights to be selected to represent the United States at the 71st Anniversary D-Day Memorial in Normandy, France,\u201d Band Director Melissa Thatcher said. \u201cThis is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the Marching Knights that they will never forget. These dedicated students are so talented and deserve every part of this great honor. We are all looking forward to an amazing performance by the Marching Knights. They will certainly make Old Bridge proud!\u201d\n\nRuggiero began dancing at age 5, and by 10, he was accepted into the New Jersey Tap Ensemble. He performed at Lincoln Center, The Shomberg Museum of Harlem and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark.\n\nUpon entering his sophomore year at Montclair State University, Ruggiero was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare bone cancer of the right leg. After enduring nine surgeries, his leg was amputated, but despite the surgeries and undergoing 16 months of chemotherapy, Ruggiero continued dancing. After hearing about Clayton \u201cPeg Leg\u201d Bates, who taught himself to tap dance after losing a leg in a cotton gin accident, Ruggiero received a peg leg and learned to perform. He has appeared on such programs as \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and the \u201cEllen DeGeneres Show.\u201d\n\nLast year, Ruggiero was awarded the The Courage Award by the Sarcoma Foundation of America and was inducted into the Old Bridge Hall of Fame.\n\nAdmission to the event is $5.
