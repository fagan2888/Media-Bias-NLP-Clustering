Republican John Chapman, who worked in former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's administration, will kick off his congressional campaign Thursday evening.

Chapman is running against incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. William Keating in the 9th congressional district.

Chapman said former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown will attend his campaign kickoff in Cape Cod.

"I am running for Congress because Washington has grown polarized, become more arrogant and lost touch with the people it represents," Chapman said in a statement.

Chapman released an announcement video in advance of the kickoff. The video is mostly biographical.

It also points to the Affordable Care Act as "the poster child of everything wrong with federal government."

Chapman started his political career as an aide in the White House counsel's office under President Ronald Reagan. He worked for the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 1990s and was appointed by Romney as commissioner for the Department of Industrial Accidents.

He is an attorney who worked at the law firm Duane Morris and at the financial services firm Tucker Anthony Incorporated.

The ninth district covers Barnstable, Dukes and Nantucket counties and some cities and towns in Bristol and Plymouth counties. Keating was elected to Congress in 2011.
