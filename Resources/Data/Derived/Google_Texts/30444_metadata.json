At the end of the four-year period, they became eligible for career status, giving them rights to continuing contracts and due process protections from arbitrary or unjustified dismissals.\n\nIn summer 2013, lawmakers enacted a repeal of that law in an effort to rid the state of tenure by 2018, saying that it enabled bad teachers to stay in the system.\n\nThey eliminated tenure for teachers who had not reached career status by August 2013 and revoked career status for all teachers by July 2018.\n\nAs an enticement for already-tenured teachers to act sooner, lawmakers also required local school boards to offer 25 percent of them temporary 4-year contracts with annual raises of $500 in exchange for giving up their tenure rights early.\n\nIn May 2014, Superior Court Judge Robert H. Hobgood ruled that the revoking of tenure for teachers who\u2019d already reached career status was unconstitutional, as was the \u201c25 percent\u201d plan, which Hobgood said included no standards to guide school districts and served no public purpose.\n\nAs to teachers who had not yet achieved career status, though, Hobgood found that they had no protectable contract rights and thus could not challenge the repeal.\n\nIn June 2015, the Court of Appeals largely agreed with Hobgood\u2019s ruling, with Judge Chris Dillon issuing a separate opinion in which he agreed only with the lower court\u2019s finding that tenured teachers had property rights warranting a hearing in the event they were dismissed (something the repeal did not allow).\n\nRead the Supreme Court\u2019s full opinion here.\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "They eliminated tenure for teachers who had not reached career status by August 2013 and revoked career status for all teachers by July 2018.\nThe state Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that the repeal of North Carolina\u2019s teacher tenure law could not be retroactively applied to those teachers who had already achieved that status.\n\u201cWe conclude that repeal of the Career Status Law unlawfully infringes upon the contract rights of those teachers who had already achieved career status,\u201d Justice Robert Edmunds wrote for the Court.\nAs to teachers who had not yet achieved career status, though, Hobgood found that they had no protectable contract rights and thus could not challenge the repeal.\nAt the end of the four-year period, they became eligible for career status, giving them rights to continuing contracts and due process protections from arbitrary or unjustified dismissals."}
