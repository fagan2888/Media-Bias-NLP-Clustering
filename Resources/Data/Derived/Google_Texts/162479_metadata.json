The 54-year-old Washington state lawyer first started bracing for public ridicule in 2008, when he began sharing stories about experiences he claims he had as a child working for a secret military project that enabled him to teleport, time travel, and visit Mars with a young Barack Obama. Now, he\u2019s running for president.\n\nThis year\u2019s presidential race has been, in many ways, so bizarre and entertaining in its own right that we\u2019ve largely overlooked the fringe candidates that have historically provided a welcome reprieve from the boring status quo race. This is unfortunate for Basiago, who told me he couldn\u2019t afford the $4 million he estimated it would cost to campaign enough to get on the ballot. Instead, he\u2019s relying on his thousands of supporters (his Facebook group currently has 16,550 members) to write in their candidate of choice.\n\nHis platform consists of 100 proposals that range from forcing the government to disclose secret time travel technologies and putting bigfoot on the endangered species list, to pardoning Edward Snowden and investing $100 billion in infrastructure and programming for Native Americans.\n\nMotherboard got Basiago, who is still a practicing lawyer, on the phone to talk about his campaign, time travel, the future, and the Donald Trump ideas he thinks are truly crazy.\n\nMotherboard: So why did you decide to run for president?\n\nAndrew Basiago: I entered public life as a whistleblower, describing my experiences in DARPA\u2019s Project Pegasus in the early 70s, which was the US time-space program at the time of the emergence of time travel. That truth campaign was motivated by a moral duty that I felt I had to describe what happened so that millions of dollars aren\u2019t wasted reinventing the wheel in terms of time travel. \u2026 In the process, I thought, well why don\u2019t I go for the top job? If I\u2019m talking about this stuff and if my ideas and my information would be truly transformative, why not just run for president and try to have a larger impact? At least if I don\u2019t win, I\u2019ll have a wider audience.\n\nWhat are some of the truths you\u2019d like to expose?\n\nI want the Tesla teleportation technology that Project Pegasus developed to be introduced socially because if we replace forms of transport that rely on the internal combustion engine\u2014planes, trains, trucks, automobiles, motorcycles\u2014we\u2019re going to be able to prevent 60 percent of the greenhouse gases that human industry contributes to the global emissions each year. \u2026 I went away for a month and wrote 100 distilled statements of things I care about and things I think the country should address over the next four years. Some people might think some of the proposals are laughable.\n\nLike what?\n\nI call for putting sasquatch on the Endangered Species List. That\u2019s probably my most funky proposal. But when I was a four year old in August of \u201866 at Lake Sacandaga in the Adirondacks of New York State, I encountered two sasquatches. I went up to the outhouse and there was an adult male sasquatch probably, I don\u2019t know, 30-40 years old and his five year old son who was my size. I\u2019m essentially insisting on bragging rights that I\u2019m the first presidential candidate since Theodore Roosevelt to affirm the existence of sasquatch based on a personal encounter.\n\nWait, Roosevelt?\n\nT.R. encountered sasquatch when he was on his great North American ape expedition, which was a search for bigfoot that he did when he was a young man. There\u2019s a precedent here and I kind of feel like, as a country, we\u2019re not really processing our own history very well. We\u2019re also unaware that our government achieved time travel over 40 years ago.\n\nWhy would the government keep time travel and teleportation a secret?\n\nThey weaponized teleportation to use it to put troops precisely where they were needed on the battlefield. \u2026 They wanted a technology that would allow, let\u2019s say, 20,000 marines at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina just streaming through teleporters and landing right at the battlefront. These technologies were also viewed as socially and economically disruptive. They would replace entire industries. Think of all the jobs that exist just in the automobiles sector.\n\n\"It creates support for a xenophobe like Donald Trump with the crazy notion of building a 30-foot wall.\"\n\nIf elected, how would you expose all of this?\n\nI\u2019d kick butt and take names! I\u2019d say to the general accounting office and DARPA and everyone: \u201cI\u2019m implementing teleportation and if you don\u2019t help me, you\u2019re going to jail.\u201d I\u2019d pull an FDR on this. I\u2019m going to really pull rank. They\u2019re not going to tell me that we can\u2019t introduce it.\n\nWhat\u2019s your position on immigration?\n\nI\u2019m calling for a temporary, across-the-board moratorium on immigration such as we imposed in 1924. Despite the bigots and the cynics, immigration is good for our country. It brings in people who want to be here, who have dreams they want to achieve in America, who are enjoying a better life by coming here and so are patriotic and loyal. \u2026 But when it becomes commonplace, it begins to overwhelm society. It is a truism that immigrants are now taking jobs from natural-born Americans.\n\nBut [that issue] creates support for a xenophobe like Donald Trump with the crazy notion of building a 30-foot wall 1,500 miles [long] between the United States and Mexico. We\u2019re going to build a wall to keep people out? No.\n\nHow about health care?\n\nI oppose Obamacare and favor its repeal. I also oppose Clinton\u2019s plan. I support a single-payer, Canadian-style healthcare system because that\u2019s the one supported by two-thirds of American voters and because it\u2019s the fairest.\n\nA lot of your ideas are hard to believe. How do you deal with people calling you crazy or a liar?\n\nI just recognize that the truth ultimately prevails. I recognize that some people view me as a liar, or as crazy, or they\u2019re envious that they were not involved. But I\u2019m simply sharing what happened to me. I\u2019ll get a certain amount of disbelievers, but I\u2019ll also get a certain number of believers.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/even-the-presidential-candidate-who-believes-in-sasquatch-thinks-trump-is-crazy-election-campaign-time-travel-andrew-basiago", "twitter": {"site": "@motherboard", "twitter": "Even the Presidential Candidate Who Believes in Sasquatch Thinks Trump Is Crazy", "image": "http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/article/32857/1461347746894947.JPG", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Andrew Basiago is a practicing lawyer, an advocate for single-payer health care, and says the government has been hiding secret time travel technology from the public for decades."}, "keywords": "time travel, teleportation, Election 2016, politics, elections, campaigns, technology, sasquatch, big foot, Q&amp;A, andrew basiago", "sailthru.locale": "en_us", "sailthru.tags": "time travel, teleportation, Election 2016, politics, elections, campaigns, technology, sasquatch, big foot, Q&amp;A, andrew basiago, MB, en_us, mben", "news_keywords": "time travel, teleportation, Election 2016, politics, elections, campaigns, technology, sasquatch, big foot, Q&amp;A, andrew basiago", "msapplication-TileColor": "#7974bd", "sailthru.title": "Even the Presidential Candidate Who Believes in Sasquatch Thinks Trump Is Crazy", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-150x150.png?v", "thumbnail": "http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/article/32857/1461347746894947.JPG", "description": "Andrew Basiago is a practicing lawyer, an advocate for single-payer health care, and says the government has been hiding secret time travel technology from the public for decades.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-05-02", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-310x150.png?v", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-70x70.png?v", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-310x310.png?v", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-144x144.png?v", "sailthru.description": "Andrew Basiago is a practicing lawyer, an advocate for single-payer health care, and says the government has been hiding secret time travel technology from the public for decades.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Motherboard", "description": "Andrew Basiago is a practicing lawyer, an advocate for single-payer health care, and says the government has been hiding secret time travel technology from the public for decades.", "title": "Even the Presidential Candidate Who Believes in Sasquatch Thinks Trump Is Crazy", "locale": "en_us", "image": "http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/article/32857/1461347746894947.JPG", "url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/even-the-presidential-candidate-who-believes-in-sasquatch-thinks-trump-is-crazy-election-campaign-time-travel-andrew-basiago", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-25 12:00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.publish_date": "2016-04-25 12:00:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "eac54d01e7a940c4380d0105a2a58912"}, "sailthru.item_type": "article"}, "article_summary": "Image: Andy2016.comAndrew Basiago told me he\u2019s used to people thinking he\u2019s crazy.\n\"It creates support for a xenophobe like Donald Trump with the crazy notion of building a 30-foot wall.\"\nI\u2019m essentially insisting on bragging rights that I\u2019m the first presidential candidate since Theodore Roosevelt to affirm the existence of sasquatch based on a personal encounter.\nI\u2019m going to really pull rank.\nMotherboard got Basiago, who is still a practicing lawyer, on the phone to talk about his campaign, time travel, the future, and the Donald Trump ideas he thinks are truly crazy."}
