Republican-controlled Congress still needs to ratify the agreement, but Obama, a Democrat, said he is optimistic it will pass.\n\nBut Trump compared the 6,000-page deal to Obamacare, saying it's \"so complex that no one's read it.\"\n\nLIVE COVERAGE: 4th Republican presidential debate\n\n\"This is one of the worst trade deals,\" the billionaire businessman and former Atlantic City casino tycoon said during the main debate Tuesday in Milwaukee. \"I would rather not have it. I'd rather make individual deal with individual countries.\"\n\nTrump, a real estate magnate who leads the GOP race in many national polls, added that despite his opposition to the deal, he is in favor of free trade.\n\n\"I love trade,\" he said. \"I'm a free trader, 100 percent.\"\n\nTrump added the pact doesn't even addressed China's alleged currency manipulation.

Rand Paul of Kentucky interjected: \"We might want to point out, China is not part of this deal.\"\n\nTrump, however, said that the agreement will \"allow China to take advantage of everybody.\"\n\nBrent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com.
