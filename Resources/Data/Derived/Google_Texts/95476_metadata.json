And beeping. And beeping. And beeping.\n\n\u201cWonder what happened,\u201d Dixon joked.\n\nJust a harrowing crash at the NHRA Gatornationals that gave Dixon, fellow drivers, crewmembers and thousands of fans some anxious moments.\n\nThe three-time Top Fuel champion managed to walk away from the wreckage, providing relief for everyone watching, waiting and worrying.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be like going to Disneyland and being on a roller coaster and you fly off the track,\u201d Dixon said three hours after the crash. \u201cNow what are going to do? You\u2019ve just got to wait to land and hope everything\u2019s doing its job for you.\u201d\n\nDixon\u2019s dragster started to buckle at nearly 280 mph, broke in half, got airborne, landed hard on the asphalt and then slid into the outside retaining wall at Auto-Plus Raceway.\n\nDixon remained in the cockpit as safety workers reached him. He was alert, awake and talking to safety personnel as they helped him out. He walked to a waiting ambulance under his own power and waved to the crowd.\n\nHis upper back and left knee were a little sore, but Dixon was pretty much unscathed. It was quite different from his similar wreck at Memphis in 2000 when he didn\u2019t have a Head and Neck Support (HANS) device, a seven-point harness system or padded head rests surrounding his helmet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through worse,\u201d he said. \u201cLast time I did that, I had a helicopter ride.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear what caused the chassis to buckle at such high speed. Dixon said the car had 60 or 70 passes on it, so frame rails shouldn\u2019t have been stressed to the point of failure.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d said Dixon, who drives for Bob Vandergriff Jr., and has 62 career victories. \u201cThere\u2019s no rhyme or reason for it.\u201d\n\nThe 48-year-old Dixon was expected to see a doctor later Saturday before deciding whether to race in the elimination rounds Sunday.\n\nHe said he would have no hesitation about getting back behind the wheel.\n\n\u201cI feel invincible in that race car,\u201d he said. \u201cDriving to the track I\u2019m more fearful for my life than I am in that car. That car is designed to go through that. You don\u2019t fear it. You\u2019re counting on all your equipment to do its job.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NHRA\u2019s Larry Dixon walks away from scary crash at Gatornationals", "title": "NHRA\u2019s Larry Dixon walks away from scary crash at Gatornationals", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/14/nhras-larry-dixon-walks-away-from-scary-crash-at-gatornationals/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150314__larry-dixonp1.jpg", "height": 446}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150314__larry-dixonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-14T18:34:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T20:37:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019d be like going to Disneyland and being on a roller coaster and you fly off the track,\u201d Dixon said three hours after the crash.\nHis phone immediately started beeping.\nJust a harrowing crash at the NHRA Gatornationals that gave Dixon, fellow drivers, crewmembers and thousands of fans some anxious moments.\n\u201cI feel invincible in that race car,\u201d he said.\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. \u2014 Larry Dixon sat down in the track tower Saturday afternoon and got cell service for the first time in hours."}
