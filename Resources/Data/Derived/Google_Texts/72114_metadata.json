About $56.5 million of Edwards' award concerns the FHA portion of the case, and $7.4 million concerns the VA portion. Wasinger declined to discuss his legal fees.\n\nEdwards, a Louisiana resident, had worked for JPMorgan or its predecessors from 2003 to 2008, and had been an assistant vice president supervising a government insuring unit. He originally sued in January 2013 under the federal False Claims Act, which lets individuals sue government contractors and suppliers for allegedly defrauding taxpayers. The U.S. Department of Justice later joined as a plaintiff.\n\nWhistleblowers can recover portions of False Claims Act settlements, which often grow if the government gets involved.\n\nWasinger also represented Edward O'Donnell, whose tips led to an October 2013 jury finding that Bank of America Corp was liable for fraud over defective mortgages sold by its Countrywide unit. The government is seeking $2.1 billion of penalties in that case.\n\nCitigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG and Flagstar Bancorp Inc were among lenders that settled False Claims Act mortgage cases in recent years.\n\nThe Justice Department in December said it had paid out roughly $1.98 billion of whistleblower awards from 2009 to 2013.\n\nThe case is U.S. ex rel.
