Foodshare distributes food to the Greater Hartford Region by partnering with local food pantries, soup kitchens, and emergency shelters. This week, its mobile truck has been delivering a product that's not usually available to families in need.

Gloria McAdam, President and CEO of Foodshare said, "Back in October, Stop and Shop asked their customers to donate money to help foodbanks provide milk to people." She said $5600 was donated and Guida Milk provided dairy at lower than retail price. "We have opted to use that money this week," she said, "because we know next week when kids are out of school is when families struggle the most. Because those kids get lunch at school, and all of a sudden are home all week, and need that help."

Through partner agencies, Foodshare helps 128,000 people. McAdam said about 50,000 of them are children. "It's really kind of frightening," she said, "because right here in Connecticut, one out of five children live in households that are food insecure. That's a household that doesn't always know where their next meals are coming from."

People often think of donating food around the holidays, but McAdam said the need is year-round, especially in the summer when kids are out of school.
