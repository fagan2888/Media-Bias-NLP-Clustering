According to the president of the California Medical Association, Dr. Richard Thorp, residents there could find limited options at the start of the new year.\n\nThorp told the Washington Examiner the primary reason that seven-out-of-10 California doctors are boycotting the Obamacare exchange is due to the state\u2019s low Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement rates, which typically land 30 percent below those in other parts of the country.\n\nFor example, Medicare typically pays doctors $76 for return-office visits, but in California doctors only receive $24. A tonsillectomy, meanwhile, pays out between $500 and $700, whereas doctors in California receive $160 for the procedure.\n\n\u201cWe need some recognition that we\u2019re doing a service to the community,\u201d Thorp said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t do it for free. And we can\u2019t do it at a loss. No other business would do that.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Medi-Cal reimbursement rates have long been a sticking point for doctors, but when insurance companies revealed their rates would be tied to the state\u2019s Medicaid program, many physicians balked.\n\nTo make matters more confusing, multiple medical association leaders told the Examiner that many of the doctors listed as participants in Covered California, the state\u2019s insurance marketplace, have not stated they\u2019d accept patients from the exchange.\n\n\u201cThey may be listed as actually participating, but not of their own volition,\u201d said Donald Waters, executive director of the Alameda-Contra Costa Medical Association.\n\nAlthough numbers have not been revealed at this point, a similar feeling seems commonplace among doctors in New York. In October, a survey of 409 doctors by the New York State Medical Society found that 44 percent of the state\u2019s physicians aren\u2019t participating as ACA providers, while an additional 33 percent were undecided.\n\nAs in California, doctors pointed towards low reimbursement rates to defend their lack of involvement.\n\n\u201cThis is so poorly designed that a lot of doctors are afraid to participate,\u201d said Dr. Sam Unterricht, president of the 29,000-member medical society, to the New York Post. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of resistance. Doctors don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to get paid.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, bipartisan efforts to permanently reform how Medicare doctors are paid have stalled in Congress. According to CNN, Lawmakers from the Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means committees have been working on legislation that would freeze payments through 2023 before implementing a policy that includes raises and bonuses. The law would also change Medicare\u2019s reimbursement method into a system that favors \u201cvalue over volume.\u201d\n\nThe reforms are unlikely to pass Congress this year, however, meaning negotiations will extend into 2014.\n\nHow that would affect doctor participation in California and other parts of the United States is unclear, but if doctors continue to hold out, patients could find their choice of physicians shrink, leading to increased waiting times and less access to their doctor.\n\n\u201cEnrollment doesn\u2019t mean access, because there aren\u2019t enough doctors to take the low rates of Medicaid,\u201d Alex Briscoe, health director for Alameda County Health Care Services Agency in California, said to the Examiner. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough primary care physicians, period.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "About 70 percent of California\u2019s 104,000 doctors are reportedly planning to stay out of the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, a move that could have significant impact on implementation of the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "About 70 percent of California\u2019s 104,000 doctors are reportedly planning to stay out of the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, a move that could have significant impact on implementation of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "70 percent of California doctors plan to boycott Obamacare exchanges", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/6f/f0/00/california-doctors-boycott-obamacare.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/california-doctors-boycott-obamacare-959/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "About 70 percent of California\u2019s 104,000 doctors are reportedly planning to stay out of the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, a move that could have significant impact on implementation of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/6f/f0/00/california-doctors-boycott-obamacare.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfead\"", "article_summary": "For example, Medicare typically pays doctors $76 for return-office visits, but in California doctors only receive $24.\nAs in California, doctors pointed towards low reimbursement rates to defend their lack of involvement.\nAccording to the president of the California Medical Association, Dr. Richard Thorp, residents there could find limited options at the start of the new year.\nA tonsillectomy, meanwhile, pays out between $500 and $700, whereas doctors in California receive $160 for the procedure.\nThorp told the Washington Examiner the primary reason that seven-out-of-10 California doctors are boycotting the Obamacare exchange is due to the state\u2019s low Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement rates, which typically land 30 percent below those in other parts of the country."}
