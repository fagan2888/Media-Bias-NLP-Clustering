And they project the tax-supported proportion will rise to 67.1 percent over the coming decade as the baby boom generation ages and retires \u2014 nearly as high as Canada\u2019s 70 percent.\n\n\u201cWe are actually paying for a national health program, we\u2019re just not getting it,\u201d Woolhandler says.\n\nNow, Himmelstein and Woolhandler have an agenda. For decades, they\u2019ve been perhaps the leading researchers promoting the kind of single-payer health system that Socialist and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has put on the debate agenda. One recent poll suggests more than half of Americans (and 30 percent of Republicans) support the idea.\n\nBut even if you disagree with the Himmelstein-Woolhandler ideology, their research is generally regarded as sound, and their method is straightforward.\n\nThey added up what federal and state governments spend on health through Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Health Administration, government employees\u2019 health care premiums, tax subsidies and other programs. They argue that accounting by government agencies (the Center for Medicare and Medicaid) undercounts the real tax burden because it leaves out major pieces of the pie \u2014 such as government employees\u2019 care ($156 billion a year) and tax subsidies for private, employer-sponsored coverage (nearly $300 billion).\n\nAnd whatever you think about Medicare-for-all, it\u2019s a good idea to see the present U.S. health care system for what it is \u2014 an increasingly government-funded financing scheme.\n\nThat\u2019s because, however this political season unfolds, you\u2019re going to hear a lot more claims about what\u2019s wrong with the U.S. health care system and how to fix it. Beyond the debate between Sanders and Hillary Clinton over Medicare-for-all versus the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the Republicans are expected to put forward their ideas on replacing Obamacare.\n\nThe more you know about the way the current system works, the better able you\u2019ll be to sort through the blizzard of reform ideas.\n\nSo here are some facts to take on board from the Woolhandler-Himmelstein paper and other sources:\n\nThe predominance of tax support in our current system is not just because of Obamacare. It\u2019s been happening for decades. In 1965, before the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid, about one in every three health care dollars was government-funded. By 1980, a little more than half was. Even before Obamacare was passed in 2010, tax dollars accounted for at least 60 percent of the nation\u2019s health care bill. No matter what happens, this trend will not be easy to reverse.\n\nThe other standout feature of the U.S. health care system is its highest-in-the-world cost. No other nation comes close to the $9,267 cost-per-person of U.S. health care. But even more striking, according to the new analysis, the total health care bill of every other country except Switzerland is lower than what America spends on just the tax-funded portion of its bill \u2014 nearly $6,000 per person.\n\nHere\u2019s another cost yardstick: how much health care consumes of national wealth, as measured by gross domestic product, the total value of all goods and services. In the U.S., it\u2019s more than 17 percent, again the world\u2019s highest. But consider this: Just the tax-funded portion of U.S. health care \u2014 11.2 percent of GDP, according to the new paper \u2014 is more than any other nation, including all those that are totally tax-supported.\n\nMomentum is not on the side of health care cost control. The U.S. health care bill just passed $3 trillion a year \u2014 20 percent higher than just seven years ago \u2014 according to new government figures in the current issue of Health Affairs. That total bill is bound to increase in coming years because of the graying of America and other factors, such as expensive medical innovations. (Just one recent innovation \u2014 new drugs to cure hepatitis C \u2014 had substantial impact on total drug spending, government analysts say.) Even modest rates of medical inflation loom large when applied to such staggeringly high spending.\n\nThese facts and trends should be kept in mind while weighing political arguments over health care.\n\nFor instance, take the recent back-and-forth between Sanders and Clinton. Sanders can take heart from the Himmelstein-Woolhandler analysis, because it shows the nation is already most of the way toward a totally tax-funded health system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not that far away from collecting the taxes we would need to pay for a single-payer system like Canada\u2019s,\u201d Woolhandler says. \u201cWe already pay so much in taxes for health care that it\u2019s not that big a stretch.\u201d\n\nIn the most recent Democratic candidates\u2019 debate on Jan. 17, Sanders said his plan would offset the needed tax increase to fund Medicare-for-all by abolishing private health insurance premiums. \u201cMy proposal \u2014 provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance \u2014 (would) lower the cost of health care for middle-class families by 5,000 bucks,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nClinton countered that Sanders\u2019 plan is politically unrealistic. She pointed out that even when the Democrats controlled Congress, they couldn\u2019t pass a more modest proposal \u2014 allowing Americans to \u201cbuy into\u201d Medicare. \u201cThere are things we can do to improve [Obamacare], but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nBut one important aspect of that debate got little attention \u2014 the failure of Vermont, Sanders\u2019 home state, to implement Medicare-for-all. Sanders slid by a question on that. \u201cYou might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it,\u201d he said.\n\nBy one recent analysis, the cost of the project is what sank it.\n\nThe administration of Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin figured it would cost the state $2.5 billion to implement a single-payer health system. \u201cThe state only raises $2.7 billion in taxes a year,\u201d journalist Sarah Kliff pointed out this week in Vox. \u201cThe single-payer plan would mean doubling tax collections. \u2026 That\u2019s a big lift even if it would replace existing health premiums.\u201d\n\nKliff says totally government-financed health care needn\u2019t cost Vermont $2.5 billion a year. But she says making it affordable would require a massive rollback in payments for doctors, hospitals, pharmaceuticals and diagnostic tests such as MRIs, to levels comparable with those across Vermont\u2019s border with Canada. That\u2019s an even heavier political lift.\n\nWoolhandler takes issue with that analysis. \u201cThe main lesson from Vermont is you do need a national program, or at least national support for a state program,\u201d she says. After all, that\u2019s how Massachusetts was able to implement its more modest Obamacare precursor program in 2006.\n\nWoolhandler says Vermont could have squeezed more administrative costs out of health care than it was planning to do. And she said it\u2019s \u201ca piece of mythology\u201d that doctors and other health care providers would have to be impoverished to make a single-payer plan affordable.\n\nSo the feasibility of Medicare-for-all isn\u2019t yet clear. But at least the debate is venturing into territory never before covered in a national political debate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study finds that 64.3 percent of U.S. health expenditures are government-financed.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A new study finds that 64.3 percent of U.S. health expenditures are government-financed.", "title": "U.S. Health Care Is Less Private, More \u2018Socialist\u2019 Than You Might Think", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2016/01/health-care-publicly-financed-single-payer", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2016/01/AP_255088480588-620x357.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2016/01/health-care-publicly-financed-single-payer", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2016/01/AP_255088480588-620x357.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "U.S. Health Care Is Less Private, More 'Socialist' Than You Might Think"}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-22", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 16:18:59 -0500"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc674\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMy proposal \u2014 provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance \u2014 (would) lower the cost of health care for middle-class families by 5,000 bucks,\u201d Sanders said.\nU.S. Health Care Is Less Private, More \u2018Socialist\u2019 Than You Might ThinkBy Richard KnoxReaders, a pop quiz:The proportion of U.S. health care paid by tax funds is (a) less than 30 percent, (b) about half or (c) more than 60 percent.\n\u201cMany perceive that the U.S. health care financing system is predominantly private, in contrast to the universal tax-funded health care systems in nations such as Canada, France or the United Kingdom,\u201d David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler write in a new analysis of U.S. health spending in the American Journal of Public Health.\nAnd whatever you think about Medicare-for-all, it\u2019s a good idea to see the present U.S. health care system for what it is \u2014 an increasingly government-funded financing scheme.\n\u2026 That\u2019s a big lift even if it would replace existing health premiums.\u201dKliff says totally government-financed health care needn\u2019t cost Vermont $2.5 billion a year."}
