McCarthy referenced several bills that are in the works, including one from Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) and Larry Bucshon (R-Ind.) that would improve opioid abuse treatment and prevention efforts. Other bills McCarthy referenced would improve guidelines for physicians, help infants born to opioid-addicted mothers and improve the country\u2019s drug laws.\n\n\u201cWe want to build on efforts to prevent addiction and treat those suffering, crafting legislation that will gather bipartisan support and get signed into law,\u201d McCarthy wrote. \u201cThe President\u2019s own proposals to combat opioid addiction demonstrate that there is ample opportunity to reach a bipartisan consensus, and the Senate\u2019s recent work to combat opioid addiction shows bicameral legislative interest.\u201d\n\nThe Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act earlier this year, which authorized funding for new federal programs to improve treatment and prevention programs. McCarthy credited Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), both vulnerable Republicans up for re-election, for their work on the bill.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "The House could vote on legislation\u00a0related to the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic in May, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u00a0wrote in an Independent Journal op-ed published Thursday.
