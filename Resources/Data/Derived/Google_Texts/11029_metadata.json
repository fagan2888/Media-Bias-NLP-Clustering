Nearly a year after the case\u2019s resolution, some of them are recalling the bankruptcy proceedings and what the case has meant to their lives.\n\nShirley Lightsey, president of the Detroit Retired City Employees Association, had a seat at the negotiating table during the bankruptcy proceedings. As one of about 20,000 city retirees affected by Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy, Lightsey worked for Detroit\u2019s Water and Sewerage Department for three decades. She says, as an employee, she never doubted the security of the city\u2019s pension system.\n\n\u201cYou were told that you were going to have a pension. They had the formula for the pension, which had been improved over the years, and we expected to have our pension never to be diminished or impaired,\u201d\n\nSandra Svoboda\n\nBut decades of Detroit\u2019s fiscal instability threatened that guarantee. According to court records, the city owed more than $3 billion toward pension funding when it filed for bankruptcy, and that debt was part of the reason Detroit entered Chapter 9. According to the settlements reached in the case and outlined in the Plan of Adjustment, the city won\u2019t make substantial contributions to its pension systems for almost a decade. When it does, those payments could be even lower.\n\nFor general service retirees, like Lightsey, the settlement translated to a 4.5 percent reduction in each monthly pension check. Cost-of-living allowances also were eliminated.\n\nDetroit\u2019s police and fire departments have a separate pension system. After the bankruptcy, terms for those pensioners are different than for other city workers. Nothing was cut from police and fire pension checks, and they retained 45 percent of their cost of living allowances.\n\nBut for both groups, reductions in health care benefits were staggering.\n\nAnnamarie Sysling\n\n\u201cThe biggest hit personally, and to our members was the loss of health care. Police and fire don\u2019t participate in social security so many of ours don\u2019t qualify for Medicare,\u201d says Don Taylor, president of the Retired Detroit Police and Firefighters Association. \u201cPersonally I worked side jobs so I did qualify for Medicare, but the additional cost that I assumed when the bankruptcy went into effect, I went from paying basically zero for healthcare premiums to roughly $950 a month.\u201d\n\nThe city slashed its estimated $4.3 billion dollar obligation for healthcare and other benefits by 90 percent. But in doing so retirees were essentially left to fund their own health care plans.\n\nRetired Detroit firefighter John Tucker says because of his other personal investments, he\u2019s in a better position than some of his former co-workers. But he says he\u2019s still feeling the impact of the cuts.\n\n\u201cAfter 36 years I thought my wife and myself would receive health care the rest of our life, and it\u2019s gone now,\u201d Tucker says. \u201cPublic employees historically work for less hourly pay because they have a promise for better benefits and better promise of better pension in retirement and now, like I say I was 10 years into retirement and all of the sudden the bankruptcy occurred, and we lost mainly we lost the healthcare benefit.\u201d\n\nSimilar to when two of Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers reconfigured employee health care programs to save money, part of Detroit\u2019s financial restructuring included the formation of new committees responsible for managing retiree health care benefits: Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Associations that operate as health care trusts for retirees, who have had to navigate another system for their benefits.\n\nLightsey says the fact that the Affordable Health Care Act was going into effect at the same time Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy was taking away retiree benefits made the new systems even more complicated. \u201cWe have a very little amount of money for what we need and we are trying to be very conservative and give the retirees the best that we can and not change things too much for them because they\u2019ve had enough uncertainty in the last two years,\u201d Lightsey says.\n\nDuring the proceedings as settlements were announced, city and state officials praised Lightsey for her work in helping reach deals with pensioners. Indeed a majority of pensioners who voted on the Plan of Adjustment last year did so in favor of the settlements.\n\nBut some retirees remain critical of Lightsey and the settlement. Rudolph Markoe says his rights were not adequately represented during the bankruptcy proceedings. \u201cThe people who were supposed to be our advocates, at the end of the day, they all sold us out for whatever silver they got out of the deal. And you feel abandoned you feel lied to, you feel cheated,\u201d he says.\n\nMarkoe is a member of another retiree group. It\u2019s called the Detroit Active and Retired Employees Association.\n\n\u201cPrincipally we are a group that have been and continue to be concerned about the Detroit bankruptcy especially as it adversely affected our pensions,\u201d says the group\u2019s president, William Davis. \u201cThe whole thing was just wrong and as far as we\u2019re concerned it was illegal.\u201d\n\nDavis says his group is continuing its fight in court. In September a federal judge in Detroit threw out the latest appeal challenging the city\u2019s bankruptcy. Several other challenges have been unsuccessful. But Davis says he expected the rejection and is taking the case to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nAnnamarie Sysling\n\n\u201cOur constitutional rights were violated,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong on so many levels.\u201d\n\nOne year after the city\u2019s exit from the largest municipal bankruptcy in history, many Detroit retirees have moved on, trading feelings of indignant confusion for the bittersweet hope that their financial sacrifices will go toward creating a better and more stable city.But there are still some retirees who refuse to see the bankruptcy as a thing of the past.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1,width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "As one of about 20,000 city retirees affected by Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy, Lightsey worked for Detroit\u2019s Water and Sewerage Department for three decades.\nFor City of Detroit retirees, the changes brought by bankruptcy are measured in the cuts they\u2019ve taken to monthly pension checks and health care benefits.\n\u201cAfter 36 years I thought my wife and myself would receive health care the rest of our life, and it\u2019s gone now,\u201d Tucker says.\n\u201cPrincipally we are a group that have been and continue to be concerned about the Detroit bankruptcy especially as it adversely affected our pensions,\u201d says the group\u2019s president, William Davis.\nShirley Lightsey, president of the Detroit Retired City Employees Association, had a seat at the negotiating table during the bankruptcy proceedings."}
