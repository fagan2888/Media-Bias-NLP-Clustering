The idea behind both bills is to speed up the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval process for new drugs and boost funding for research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nThe 21st Century Cures bill passed the House on a bipartisan vote in July, but since then the momentum has slowed.\n\nAlexander had previously said that the committee would finish its work on the bill by the end of the year, but the panel has not released a bill, much less advanced it to the full Senate.\n\nStill, Alexander noted the bipartisan support for the idea behind the measure and said the panel is moving forward.\n\nOne of the major points of contention has been deciding whether the funding increase for the NIH will be in the form of mandatory spending, meaning that it is guaranteed over a number of years and not subject to the annual appropriations process.

He also said he wants the NIH funds to be offset by cutting other mandatory spending, which could cause Democrats to balk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to consider [mandatory funding] under some circumstances,\u201d Alexander said, if it \u201creplaces other mandatory funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all my Republican colleagues are, but I\u2019m willing to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m willing to do it because this is such an exciting time in science. We\u2019re coming up with so many things to help people, and we\u2019ve got a person like Francis Collins, who\u2019s a genius heading the National Institutes of Health, we ought to take advantage of that.\n\n\u201cIt affects every American, so I\u2019m willing to do something that I normally wouldn\u2019t do, and that\u2019s going to be one of the toughest parts of the innovation bill that we have to decide next year.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lawmakers are seeking to speed up the approval process for new drugs.", "description": "Lawmakers are seeking to speed up the approval process for new drugs.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Lawmakers are seeking to speed up the approval process for new drugs.", "title": "Senate chairman: Cures bill is next priority", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/263927-health-chairman-medical-cures-bill-is-next-priority", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/alexanderlamar09212015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/263927-health-chairman-medical-cures-bill-is-next-priority", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-21T13:29-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-21T13:29:58-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/263927-health-chairman-medical-cures-bill-is-next-priority", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Lawmakers are seeking to speed up the approval process for new drugs.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate chairman: Cures bill is next priority"}, "dcterms.title": "Senate chairman: Cures bill is next priority"}, "article_summary": "1, what we want to turn our attention to next is what we call our innovation bill,\u201d Alexander said on C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers.\u201dThe innovation bill is the Senate\u2019s version of a measure that has already passed the House, called 21st Century Cures.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m willing to do it because this is such an exciting time in science.\nThe 21st Century Cures bill passed the House on a bipartisan vote in July, but since then the momentum has slowed.\nAlexander reiterated on C-SPAN that he is willing to have mandatory funding but acknowledged that not all Republicans are.\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to consider [mandatory funding] under some circumstances,\u201d Alexander said, if it \u201creplaces other mandatory funding.\u201d\u201cNot all my Republican colleagues are, but I\u2019m willing to do it,\u201d he said."}
