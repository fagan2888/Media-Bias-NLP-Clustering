The CSU roster includes two players from Aurora: 6-foot-10 junior forward-center Marcus Holt and 6-3 freshman guard Carlton Hurst. And next season, Rangeview High School star Jeremiah Paige will make it a trio, with the 6-2 senior guard having signed a national letter of intent with CSU in November.\n\n\u201cHaving three of us at CSU, that\u2019s going to be cool,\u201d Holt said. \u201cCarlton and I are really close. And Jeremiah lives only about five minutes from where I\u2019m from. I remember when he was a freshman at Rangeview and I was a senior. I kind of took him under my wing and told him to stay confident. Look where he is now.\u201d\n\nHolt helped lead Rangeview to the state quarterfinals as a senior, then played two seasons of junior college ball in Texas. Hurst, meanwhile, averaged 24.3 points last season for Aurora Central. Paige is generally rated the No. 2 senior prospect in the state, behind Colorado-bound guard Dominique Collier of Denver East.\n\nHaving the top in-state players stay at home is becoming a trend along the Front Range. Next summer, Collier will join two CU starters from the state: 6-10 Josh Scott (Lewis-Palmer High School in Monument) and 6-9 Wesley Gordon (Colorado Springs Sierra).The rosters of Air Force, Denver, Northern Colorado and Wyoming also include Coloradans.\n\n\u201cThere are probably more current and future Division I players from this state than we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said veteran Denver East coach Rudy Carey. \u201cWe see more recruiters from colleges in other states coming in here to look at our players. And high schools in Colorado are hiring better coaches.\u201d\n\nMike Brookhart, the longtime coach at Cherry Creek, said the growth of area AAU teams has made an impact.\n\n\u201cThere are more opportunities for kids to play basketball year-round now,\u201d Brookhart said. \u201cThis year\u2019s senior class is very strong. But there are also some really good classes coming up. It takes a really top athlete with special skills to compete at the D-I level, and you\u2019re seeing more kids from Colorado with that ability.\u201d\n\nCSU coach Larry Eustachy said it\u2019s \u201cmostly coincidental\u201d that his team will include three players from Aurora by next season. Independently, Eustachy was impressed by each player\u2019s potential.\n\nHolt barely weighs 200 pounds and averaged fewer than four points per game in junior college. But he is long and bouncy. Holt comes off the bench for the Rams, playing behind 6-9 senior Gerson Santo.\n\n\u201cMarcus is really raw,\u201d Eustachy said. \u201cBut he\u2019s really athletic and he blocks shots. And he can shoot. He\u2019s skilled.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably the most improved player on our team from when he first arrived in the summer. His potential is off the charts. Marcus just needs to work on playing through adversity, fighting through it when things are going wrong in practice or in games.\u201d\n\nDespite posting modest numbers at Paris (Texas) Junior College, Holt also was invited for official visits to Marquette and Nebraska before signing with CSU.\n\n\u201cI wanted to come home,\u201d Holt said of choosing the Rams. \u201cMy mom didn\u2019t get to see me play when I was in Texas playing in junior college. I thought it would really mean a lot to her to come to every CSU home game.\u201d\n\nHurst has started four games this season but was slowed by a toe injury and now comes off the bench. CSU\u2019s coaching staff likes what it sees.\n\n\u201cCarlton has the potential to maybe become an all-league player before it\u2019s over,\u201d Eustachy said. \u201cHe has the mental makeup to become that. He\u2019s tough enough.\u201d\n\nHurst picked CSU after also making official recruiting visits to Nebraska, Saint Mary\u2019s and Wyoming.\n\n\u201cThe biggest change at this level is having to play hard on every possession,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cLike Coach (Eustachy) says, every day is a new opportunity. So I try to go hard every day and get better. I knew what I was getting myself into coming here; I knew he is a demanding coach. But I also knew, at the end of the day, he is going to help me improve.\u201d\n\nPaige\u2019s offer list also included Utah State, Wyoming and San Francisco. At Rangeview, he averaged 20.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.6 assists as a junior.\n\n\u201cJeremiah is an unbelievable talent with huge upside as he gets stronger,\u201d Eustachy said. \u201cHe can really shoot it. He has the mental makeup.\u201d\n\nEustachy said he was convinced he should recruit Paige after hearing reports from CSU players who played with Paige in pickup games.\n\n\u201cBecause of NCAA rules, we can\u2019t watch those (pickup games),\u201d Eustachy said. \u201cBut afterward, guys on our team came up to me said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to get him. He took it to some of our guys.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat was good enough for me. Players know players.\u201d\n\nEspecially in-state players, it seems.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler\n\nColorado influx\n\nThe quality of basketball along the Front Range has greatly improved in recent years and area schools are taking notice, signing the top tier players to stay near home.
