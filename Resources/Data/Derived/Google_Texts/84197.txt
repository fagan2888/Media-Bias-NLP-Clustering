Updated 11:00 a.m. | Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering announced a bid in Illinois' 10th District Tuesday, putting Democrats on a likely primary collision course in a must-win seat for the party.

Rotering hopes to face GOP Rep. Robert Dold, a moderate Republican who won his second, non-consecutive term in this suburban Chicago-based district in 2014. But she is likely to face a primary against former Rep. Brad Schneider, the Democrat who lost to Dold in November.

Schneider moved closer to entering the contest this month, after national Democrats brought him to Washington, D.C., to convince him to run.

In her announcement, Rotering seemed unmoved by the prospect of a primary.
