In the short term, the answer is surely no. Knowing that stocks are expensive tells you nothing about what they\u2019ll do today, this week or this month. Over the longer term, however, there is a relationship: When stocks are more expensive, they have lower future returns on average.\n\nSince 1881, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has had a price-earnings ratio of at least 24 \u2014 just a bit below where it is now \u2014 the average return over the next 10 years is negative 3 percent.\n\nBy comparison, the average 10-year return over that entire period, regardless of P/E ratio, is 36.3 percent. (All the calculations here are based on monthly data and on a P/E ratio using the previous 10 years of corporate earnings.)\n\nThe relationship isn\u2019t perfect, by any means. But it\u2019s noticeable.\n\nMore Expensive Stocks, Lower Average Returns Annual average return on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over a 10-year period since 1881, organized by the price-earnings ratio at the beginning of the period. Each dot represents one month. 10 20 30 40 +10% 0 -10 Ratio \u2192 \u2191 Return Current P/E ratio 20 40 +10% 0 -10 Ratio \u2192 \u2191 Return Current P/E ratio\n\nThere have been times \u2014 like the last few years \u2014 when stocks are expensive and they continue rising rapidly regardless. So it is not out of the question that stocks will rebound from their recent decline and rise over the next few months or years. More often than not, though, high-priced stocks lead to mediocre returns, at best, over the ensuing decade.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141017101755, "twitter": {"description": "A high price-earnings ratio over the last 125 years has usually been followed by years of mediocre returns.", "title": "When Stocks Are Expensive, Returns Have Been Lower", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/upshot/when-stocks-are-expensive-returns-have-been-lower.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003180703"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "DLeonhardt", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/17/upshot/18stockychart-1413499278491/18stockychart-1413499278491-thumbLarge.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/upshot/when-stocks-are-expensive-returns-have-been-lower.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003180703", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/upshot/when-stocks-are-expensive-returns-have-been-lower.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 17, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index,Stocks and Bonds", "ad_sensitivity": "noads", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "David Leonhardt", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/17/upshot/18stockychart-1413499278491/18stockychart-1413499278491-thumbLarge.png", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By DAVID LEONHARDT", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A high price-earnings ratio over the last 125 years has usually been followed by years of mediocre returns.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/17/upshot/18stockychart-1413499278491/18stockychart-1413499278491-thumbStandard.png", "description": "A high price-earnings ratio over the last 125 years has usually been followed by years of mediocre returns.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 17, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/david_leonhardt/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2014-10-17", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Stocks and Bonds", "published": "2014-10-17", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "18up-stocks", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141017112710, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/upshot/when-stocks-are-expensive-returns-have-been-lower.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/17/upshot/18stockychart-1413499278491/18stockychart-1413499278491-videoSixteenByNine1050.png", "type": "article", "description": "A high price-earnings ratio over the last 125 years has usually been followed by years of mediocre returns.", "title": "When Stocks Are Expensive, Returns Have Been Lower"}, "pdate": 20141017, "des": "Stocks and Bonds", "articleid": 100000003180703, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "When Stocks Are Expensive, Returns Have Been Lower", "col": "Market Volatility", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Over the longer term, however, there is a relationship: When stocks are more expensive, they have lower future returns on average.\nMore Expensive Stocks, Lower Average Returns Annual average return on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over a 10-year period since 1881, organized by the price-earnings ratio at the beginning of the period.\nKnowing that stocks are expensive tells you nothing about what they\u2019ll do today, this week or this month.\n10 20 30 40 +10% 0 -10 Ratio \u2192 \u2191 Return Current P/E ratio 20 40 +10% 0 -10 Ratio \u2192 \u2191 Return Current P/E ratioThere have been times \u2014 like the last few years \u2014 when stocks are expensive and they continue rising rapidly regardless.\nMore often than not, though, high-priced stocks lead to mediocre returns, at best, over the ensuing decade."}
