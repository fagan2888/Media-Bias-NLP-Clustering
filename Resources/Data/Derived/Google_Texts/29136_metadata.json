Dowd told ABC the scandal is evidence that there are some things, like health care, \"that the government doesn't do well and efficiently.\" Castellanos told CNN it's the perfect example of a \"top-down Washington bureaucratic system\" gone wrong.\n\nAnd when Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., was asked on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" whether he worried that the scandal was becoming too politicized, he said he remains focused on the substance of the allegations, not the politics behind them.\n\nThis is not about \"transient politics,\" he said. \"This really is an issue that needs to be solved. We're talking about the men and women who put their lives on the line.\"\n\nStill, the emerging commentary from conservative pundits linking the VA and Obamacare could be a look at where Republicans will take the narrative as the controversy continues churning.\n\nLeft-leaning analysts have pushed back, disputing the charge that Obamacare will eventually create problems like those seen in the VA system.\n\nUSA Today's Kirsten Powers emphasized a key difference between the VA system and Obamacare, saying the former is government-run single payer system, while the latter is merely a series of reforms of the private health insurance industry.\n\n\"Obamacare and the VA are not the same thing,\" she told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Of course, the VA is really government-run healthcare where you have the government controlling everything. That's not what Obamacare is.\"\n\nOn that count, Powers received some backup from fact-checking website Politifact, which ruled Guilfoyle's claim that Obamacare will become \"one big, fat VA system\" false.\n\n\"The VA is owned and operated by the federal government,\" the website explained. \"Its staff are government employees. In contrast, Obamacare builds upon the existing private sector health industry.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some conservative pundits say the problems with veterans&#039; healthcare are a sign of things to come under the president&#039;s health care law", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-gift-from-god-conservatives-use-va-scandal-to-attack-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/05/25/5bc6e8ef-4756-4f26-a977-5fc843dcbd82/thumbnail/1200x630/7dbab3e898937bf7bd8d77eb66c30124/166824675.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Some conservative pundits say the problems with veterans' healthcare are a sign of things to come under the president's health care law", "title": "\"A gift from God\": Conservatives use VA scandal to attack Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some conservative pundits say the problems with veterans' healthcare are a sign of things to come under the president's health care law", "title": "\"A gift from God\": Conservatives use VA scandal to attack Obamacare", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/a-gift-from-god-conservatives-use-va-scandal-to-attack-obamacare/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/a-gift-from-god-conservatives-use-va-scandal-to-attack-obamacare/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-gift-from-god-conservatives-use-va-scandal-to-attack-obamacare/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/05/25/5bc6e8ef-4756-4f26-a977-5fc843dcbd82/thumbnail/1200x630/7dbab3e898937bf7bd8d77eb66c30124/166824675.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-gift-from-god-conservatives-use-va-scandal-to-attack-obamacare/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/a-gift-from-god-conservatives-use-va-scandal-to-attack-obamacare/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f8e\"", "article_summary": "Left-leaning analysts have pushed back, disputing the charge that Obamacare will eventually create problems like those seen in the VA system.\nOn that count, Powers received some backup from fact-checking website Politifact, which ruled Guilfoyle's claim that Obamacare will become \"one big, fat VA system\" false.\nDowd told ABC the scandal is evidence that there are some things, like health care, \"that the government doesn't do well and efficiently.\"\nAnd Fox News host Kimberley Guilfoyle warned on Wednesday that America can expect \"one big, fat VA system in the form of Obamacare\" if the health care law continues taking root.\n\"Obamacare and the VA are not the same thing,\" she told \"Fox News Sunday.\""}
