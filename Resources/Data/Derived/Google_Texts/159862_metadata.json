Jan Brewer (R) has never exactly been a reliable ally of President Obama, and she\u2019s certainly never been a fan of the Affordable Care Act. After \u201cObamacare\u201d became law, the Republican governor was one of the first in the nation to file suit, hoping to destroy the law in the courts.\n\nBut the political circumstances have clearly changed. Over the summer, Brewer successfully demandedthat Republicans in the state legislature accept Medicaid expansion under the federal law. This week, Brewer has a messagefor Republicans in Congress: leave Obamacare alone (thanks to my colleague Tricia McKinney for the heads-up).\n\nGov. Jan Brewer said Wednesday that she does not want U.S. House Republicans to succeed in their bid to shut down the Affordable Care Act, saying it would \u201cdevastate\u201d the state budget. [\u2026] \u201cThe bottom line is we need that money in our economy to save rural hospitals and jobs in the rural areas,\u201d the governor said, as well as making sure hospitals in metropolitan areas, where most AHCCCS patients are seen, get paid. \u201cIt\u2019s all about jobs and getting back federal dollars that our taxpayers have paid to the federal government, to bring them home.\u201d [\u2026] And Brewer said those involved need to be realistic and recognize that Obamacare was enacted, it remains the law and the votes are not there to repeal it.\n\nOK then.\n\nThe point, of course, isn\u2019t that Brewer is incorrect. On the contrary, she\u2019s absolutely right \u2013 repealing or defunding the health care law would be dreadful for state budgets, would hurt hospitals, and would cost jobs. The governor is also correct that repealing the law isn\u2019t realistic, House Republicans\u2019 46 repeal votes notwithstanding.\n\nRather, what\u2019s interesting here is who\u2019s making these comments. I expect the Affordable Care Act to have champions in gubernatorial offices nationwide; I don\u2019t expect Arizona\u2019s Jan Brewer to be among them. There aren\u2019t many who\u2019ve made the transition from \u201clet\u2019s destroy the entirety of the law\u201d to \u201cdon\u2019t you dare mess with this law,\u201d but this Republican governor appears to have pulled it off.\n\nOne assumes she\u2019ll hear \u201cRINO\u201d taunts going forward, but given how conservative Brewer is on everything else, will anyone take the criticisms from the seriously?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Repealing or defunding the health care law would be dreadful for state budgets", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obamacares-unexpected-ally-arizona", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Repealing or defunding the health care law would be dreadful for state budgets", "title": "Obamacare's unexpected ally in Arizona", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obamacares-unexpected-ally-arizona", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap641917909814.jpg?itok=l4D_W27Q", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obamacares-unexpected-ally-arizona", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap641917909814.jpg?itok=sZskEMYB", "height": 553}, "title": "Obamacare's unexpected ally in Arizona", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Repealing or defunding the health care law would be dreadful for state budgets"}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-11T01:38:54-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "rachel-maddow-show", "contentId": 20903212, "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obamacares-unexpected-ally-arizona", "published": 1, "date": "10/11/2013 01:38:54 EDT", "title": "Obamacare's unexpected ally in Arizona"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Repealing or defunding the health care law would be dreadful for state budgets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Jan Brewer (R) has never exactly been a reliable ally of President Obama, and she\u2019s certainly never been a fan of the Affordable Care Act.\nI expect the Affordable Care Act to have champions in gubernatorial offices nationwide; I don\u2019t expect Arizona\u2019s Jan Brewer to be among them.\nOver the summer, Brewer successfully demandedthat Republicans in the state legislature accept Medicaid expansion under the federal law.\nAfter \u201cObamacare\u201d became law, the Republican governor was one of the first in the nation to file suit, hoping to destroy the law in the courts.\nOn the contrary, she\u2019s absolutely right \u2013 repealing or defunding the health care law would be dreadful for state budgets, would hurt hospitals, and would cost jobs."}
