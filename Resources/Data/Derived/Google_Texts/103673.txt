Broncos backup middle linebacker and special teams regular Steven Johnson, listed as questionable on the injury report, will not play against the San Diego Chargers tonight because of an injured left ankle.

In his place will be second-round receiver Cody Latimer, who will play for the first time since the season-opener Sept. 7 against Indianapolis. Latimer is expected to play on many special teams units although probably not much as a receiver, if at all.

Backup cornerback Tony Carter is also expected to play in place of cornerback Omar Bolden, who is down as he recovers from a concussion suffered late in the Broncosâ€™ win Sunday night against San Francisco. Carter was inactive in four of the past five games.
