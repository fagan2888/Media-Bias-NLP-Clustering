He proceeded to say that either Vice President Joe Biden or former State Secretary Hillary Clinton would make \u201coutstanding\u201d presidents. He also said Biden would \u201cgo down in history as one of the best vice presidents\u2013 ever.\u201d Obama said the same for Clinton as state secretary.\n\nBoth Clinton and Biden are widely believed to be at least considering a run for president.\n\nDuring the interview, which took place in front of students at American University and mostly dealt with Obamacare, the President was asked why young people should want to sign up under the new healthcare exchanges.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when I looked healthy like these folks and thought I was never gonna get sick,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut what you discover is that\u2013 some tough stuff happens. You\u2013 you have a run of bad luck. You suddenly need hospitalization. You have an accident. You get an illness. And for young people to recognize that it is in their financial interest and their health interest to be able to get ongoing preventive care, to be able to get \u2014 free contraception and \u2014 you know, benefits that \u2014 like mammograms that allow them to maintain their health throughout their lives, without fear of going bankrupt or making their family bankrupt if they get sick \u2014 that\u2019s something that\u2019s priceless.\u201d\n\nRecent reports have said government systems facilitating the health care law are vulnerable to hackers who could potentially access private information of enrollees. Still, Obama assured Americans that information provided to the government is \u201cprotected.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, there are a whole bunch of things where you\u2019re providing information to the government. It\u2019s protected. It\u2019s governed by a whole series of laws,\u201d Obama said.\n\nHe continued, rejecting any comparison between Obamacare and the NSA: \u201cI can\u2019t confirm or get into the details of every aspect of what the NSA does. \u2026 I\u2019ve said before and I will say it again, the NSA actually does a very good job about not engaging in domestic surveillance, not reading people\u2019s emails, not listening to their\u2013 the contents of their phone calls. Outside of our borders, the NSA\u2019s more aggressive.\u201d\n\nObama said he would soon be \u201cproposing some self-restraint on the NSA.\u201d\n\nAsked to respond to recent polls showing a decline in trust in both the federal government and Obama himself, Obama directed blame at the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cThe entire Republican Party brand over\u2013 since Ronald Reagan has been, \u2018Government\u2019s the problem,\u2019\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd if you, day after day, week after week, election after election are running on that platform and that permeates our culture. And it\u2019s picked up by, you know, ordinary citizens who grow skeptical. Then it\u2019s not surprising that over time, trust in government declines.\u201d\n\nHere Obama answers why young people should sign up for health insurance using the Obamacare exchanges:\n\nAnd here Obama talks about public distrust in government:\n\nEditor\u2019s note: All quotes were provided by MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball\u201d in the form of a transcript.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Eddie Scarry (@eScarry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The toughest question President Barack Obama was asked during an interview Thursday with MSNBC's Chris Matthews was, ironically, probably the easiest to answer.
