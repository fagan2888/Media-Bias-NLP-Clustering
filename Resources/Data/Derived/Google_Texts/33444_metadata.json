That's my real goal. Then obviously, the goal is always the same, [to] try to have the [best] result possible.\"\n\nThe nine-time French Open king captured a second straight Madrid title last year by beating Nishikori in the final of this Masters 1000 tournament.\n\nUp next for the record 27-time Masters champ will be sixth-seeded Czech and 2012 Madrid runner-up Tomas Berdych, who outlasted 16th-seeded American John Isner 3-6, 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-1) in 2 hours, 9 minutes.\n\nBerdych topped Isner despite failing to break serve on Day 6. The American tallied the only break of the match in the opening set.\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Isner launched 29 aces in a losing effort.\n\nNadal is 18-4 lifetime against Berdych, including a victory in the 2010 Wimbledon final and in a pair of Madrid quarterfinals, in 2006 and last year. Berdych, however, captured their last meeting in the quarters at this year's Australian Open.\n\n[SportsNetwork.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Red-hot Andy Murray and two-time defending and four-time overall champion Rafael Nadal posted quarterfinal victories Friday at the Madrid Open.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Red-hot Andy Murray and two-time defending and four-time overall champion Rafael Nadal posted quarterfinal victories Friday at the Madrid Open.", "title": "Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal into Madrid Open semis", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2015/05/08/Andy-Murray-Rafael-Nadal-into-Madrid-Open-semis/3041431116676/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/3041431116676/2015/1/4cbd20d35ec14fe2610bfa02c6afc597/v2.1/Andy-Murray-Rafael-Nadal-into-Madrid-Open-semis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3041431116676/2015/upi/4cbd20d35ec14fe2610bfa02c6afc597/v2.1/Andy-Murray-Rafael-Nadal-into-Madrid-Open-semis.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Red-hot Andy Murray and two-time defending and four-time overall champion Rafael Nadal posted quarterfinal victories Friday at the Madrid Open.", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal into Madrid Open semis"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Sports, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray, David Ferrer, French Open, John Isner, Tomas Berdych, Wimbledon 2013", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Sports, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray, David Ferrer, French Open, John Isner, Tomas Berdych, Wimbledon 2013"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda5d7\"", "article_summary": "Red-hot Andy Murray and two-time defending and four-time overall champion Rafael Nadal posted quarterfinal victories Friday at the Madrid Open.\nThe nine-time French Open king captured a second straight Madrid title last year by beating Nishikori in the final of this Masters 1000 tournament.\nThis year's Australian Open runner-up captured the title here in Madrid in 2008 when the event was staged on hardcourts.\nThe six-time Madrid finalist Nadal improved to 6-0 lifetime against the 23- year-old Dimitrov.\nNadal is 18-4 lifetime against Berdych, including a victory in the 2010 Wimbledon final and in a pair of Madrid quarterfinals, in 2006 and last year."}
