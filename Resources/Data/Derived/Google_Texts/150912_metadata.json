A team of researchers from Stanford University say they\u2019ve improved the same technology used by the Argus II, a prosthetic built by Second Sight Therapeutics and approved by U.S. regulators for the condition last year.\n\nE. J. Chichilnisky, a professor of neurosurgery at Stanford, says precise electrical stimulation of retinal cells reproduced activity patterns observed when the retina sees a moving object. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that we can reproduce natural patterns of activity in the retina with exquisite precision,\u201d he said in a press statement.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers focused on parasol cells, a type of retinal ganglion cell associated with the detection of movement and its direction and speed -- the dynamic objects within one\u2019s immediate environment. Knowing these cells activate in waves when tracking an object, the researchers sent pulses of electricity to patches of retina placed on a 61-electrode grid. The parasol cells became apparent among other retinal cells reacting differently to the pulses, with differing levels of stimulation required to activate each kind of cell.\n\nYet although the reverse-engineering allowed the reproduction of basic retinal response to moving objects the researchers say much work remains in improving prosthetics available now in Western Europe and the United States.\n\n\u201cThere is a long way to go between these results and making a device that produces meaningful, patterned activity over a large region of the retina in a human patient,\u201d Chichilnisky said. \u201cBut if we can handle the many technical hurdles ahead, we may be able to speak to the nervous system in its own language, and precisely reproduce its normal function.\u201d\n\nIn the coming years, developers may effectively cure retinitis pigmentosa and several other diseases that cause blindness by replacing photoreceptor cells within the first of several cellular layers of the retina. Systems such as the Argus II, available in the U.S. at some medical centers, replace the need for parasol cells by directly stimulating the retinal ganglion cell layer, which then relays visual signals to the brain.\n\nThat system comprises a camera mounted atop a pair of goggles, which transmits a wireless signal to an electrode grid implanted in the retina. Rough shapes, edges, and changes in light and contrast appear to the prosthetic user, says Chichilnisky, who was not involved in developing that product.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting for someone who may not have seen anything for 20-30 years -- it\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s a long way from natural vision.\u201d\n\nThe reproduction of natural vision through the stimulation of retinal cells would require even greater precision than possible today, given an estimated 1 to 1.5 million retinal ganglion cells of at least 20 varieties. The ability to see as a human depends upon a cellular concerto just beyond the reach of today\u2019s developers, according to Thomas Greenwell, a director of retinal neuroscience at the National Institutes of Health, which funded the study.\n\n\u201cRetinal prosthetics hold great promise, but this research is a marathon, not a sprint,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nStanford\u2019s study was published Thursday in the journal Neuron.\n\nSource: Chichilnisky, E.J., Jepson, Lauren H., Pawel, Hottowy.
