This is about nothing but raw power. Any appeal you hear to high principle is phony \u2014 brazenly, embarrassingly so.\n\nIn Year Seven of the George W. Bush administration, Sen. Chuck Schumer publicly opposed filling any Supreme Court vacancy until Bush left office. (\u201cExcept in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d None such arose. Surprise!) Today he piously denounces Republicans for doing exactly the same for a vacancy created in Year Eight of Barack Obama.\n\nRepublicans, say the Democrats, owe the President deference. Elections have consequences and Obama won re-election in 2012.\n\nBIDEN: OBAMA'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE WILL HAVE GOP APPEAL\n\nYes. And the Republicans won the Senate in 2014 \u2014 if anything, a more proximal assertion of popular will. And both have equal standing in appointing a Supreme Court justice.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to swallow demands for deference from a party that for seven years has cheered Obama\u2019s serial constitutional depredations: his rewriting the immigration laws by executive order (stayed by the courts); his reordering the energy economy by regulation (stayed by the courts); his enacting the nuclear deal with Iran, the most important treaty of this generation, without the required two-thirds of the Senate (by declaring it an executive agreement).\n\nMinority Leader Harry Reid complains about the Senate violating precedent if it refuses a lame-duck nominee. This is rich. It is Reid who just two years ago overthrew all precedent by abolishing the filibuster for most judicial and high executive appointments. In the name of what grand constitutional principle did Reid resort to a parliamentary maneuver so precedent-shattering that it was called the nuclear option? None. He did it in order to pack the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia with liberals who would reliably deflect challenges to Obamacare.\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama loftily called upon Congress to rise above ideology and partisanship in approving his nominee. When asked how he could square that with his 2006 support of a filibuster to stop the appointment of Samuel Alito, Obama replied with a four-minute word salad signifying nothing. There is no answer. It was situational constitutional principle, i.e., transparent hypocrisy.\n\nAs I said, this is all about raw power. When the Democrats had it, they used it. The Republicans are today wholly justified in saying they will not allow this outgoing President to overturn the balance of the Supreme Court. The matter should be decided by the coming election. Does anyone doubt that Democrats would be saying exactly that if the circumstances were reversed?\n\nSIX BIG CASES BEFORE SUPREME COURT FOLLOWING SCALIA'S DEATH\n\nWhich makes this Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s moment. He and his cohorts have taken a lot of abuse from \u201canti-establishment\u201d candidates and media for not using their congressional majorities to repeal Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood, block executive orders, etc.\n\nHis last wish (LARRY DOWNING/REUTERS)\n\nWhat was the 2014 election about, they say? We won and got nothing. We were lied to and betrayed by a corrupt leadership beholden to the \u201cWashington cartel.\u201d\n\nAs it happens, under our Constitution, the opposition party cannot govern without the acquiescence of the President, which it will not get, or a two-thirds majority of the Congress, which it does not have.\n\nBut no matter. Things are different now. Appointing a Supreme Court justice is a two-key operation. The President proposes, the Senate disposes. There is no reason McConnell cannot hold the line. And he must. The stakes here \u2014 a radical generation-long reversal of direction of the Supreme Court \u2014 are the highest this Senate will ever face.\n\nHERE'S OBAMA'S SHORTLIST FOR NEW SUPREME COURT JUSTICE\n\nIf McConnell succeeds, he will have resoundingly answered the \u201cwhat did we get for 2014?\u201d question. Imagine if the Senate were now in Democratic hands. What we got in 2014 was the power to hold on to Scalia\u2019s seat and to the court\u2019s conservative majority.\n\nBut only for now. Blocking an Obama nominee buys just a year. The final outcome depends on November 2016. If the GOP nominates an unelectable or unconservative candidate, a McConnell victory will be nothing more than a stay of execution.\n\nIn 2012, Scalia averred that he would not retire until there was a more ideologically congenial President in the White House. \u201cI would not like to be replaced,\u201d he explained, \u201cby someone who immediately sets about undoing everything that I\u2019ve tried to do for 25 years.\u201d\n\nScalia never got to choose the timing of his leaving office. Those who value the legacy of those now-30 years will determine whether his last wish will be vindicated. Let McConnell do his thing. Then in November it\u2019s for us to win one for Nino.\n\nletters@charleskrauthammer.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles Krauthammer", "twitter": {"description": "The Supreme Court fight is about nothing but raw power.
