But the opportunity isn't just about the unemployed uninsured \u2014 it can affect prospective retirees as well.\n\nLeading off this month's highlighted retirement reading articles is a look at how the new health insurance exchanges could have a big (positive) impact on retiring boomers.\n\nBoomers May Benefit Most From Obamacare \u2014 Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are limited in the difference in how much they charge older people versus younger people. As a result, many baby boomers are finding that their prospective health insurance costs may decline significantly next year, especially if their income is below the threshold if $46,000 for an individual and $62,000 for a couple (where the premium assistance tax credits kick in). For lower income individuals, the impact is dramatic; a 60-year-old nonsmoker in Toledo may pay (only) $420/month for a basic insurance policy next year, but if his income is $25,000 his share of the premium would drop to $48/month. While the health insurance exchanges and new pricing are a moot point for those age 65 or older who are eligible for Medicare, the new health insurance rules could have a significant impact on those trying to decide whether to retire early now that their access to health insurance is guaranteed without any limitations for pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe Income Annuity Puzzle: Why Don't More People Use Them? \u2014 Even though mathematically an immediate annuity should be the \"perfect\" solution to creating a retirement income that can't be outlived, the actual number of people who choose to annuitize is surprisingly small. Two economists \u2014 Felix Reichling of the Congressional Budget Office and Kent Smetters of the Wharton School of Business \u2014 think they have the answer: The risk of health shocks in retirement. While immediate annuities may guarantee income for life, they are generally very illiquid, and may leave retirees with insufficient liquid assets to handle a surprising health care shock (unless they are already rather affluent), and the problem is exacerbated by the fact that the implied value of the annuity itself would drop if current health declined. The surprising conclusion from the research: Risk-averse retirees, and/or those with limited retirement assets, may want to avoid annuities altogether. (For those interested, a full copy of the research study is available here on SSRN.)\n\nHow Has the Financial Crisis Affected the Consumption of Retirees? \u2014 From the Center for Retirement Research, this study looks at the consumption of retirees through the financial crisis, and how their spending habits did (or didn't) change in response. The results show that the 40% with the least financial assets were hardly impacted, nor were the top 5% with the largest net worths. For the rest in the middle, there were declines in consumption, with those who held balanced portfolios decreasing their spending modestly, and those who were relying on interest from short-term deposits exhibiting a larger spending decline as interest rates fell.\n\nA Better Way To Save For Retirement? \u2014 With the struggles of workers to save enough in their 401(k) plans, while pensions are on the decline, the Center for American Progress is proposing a new kind of investment vehicle that would combine features of the two. Contributions would be managed professionally like a pension, and retirees would receive regular lifetime payments like a pension, but like a 401(k) the plans would be portable for workers and allow for more predictable and stable contributions for employers. A version of this plan is being considered in California already, and would require employers with at least five employees to automatically deduct 3% of a worker's pay into a tax-deferred investment with a guaranteed minimum return backed by insurance. On the other hand, critics suggest that workers may not be willing to relinquish the amount of control necessary to establish such a plan, and that the kinds of 401(k) costs the proposal is designed to save are largely ameliorated by the economies of scale available to most large 401(k) plans already.\n\nDo 401(k) Plans Favor The Rich? \u2014 Continuing the prior theme, a researcher studying 401(k) plans has found that the tax breaks associated with 401(k) plans may be skewed toward the wealthy, when arguably it's lower income workers in the most need of tax assistance. The core of the issue is the fact that since 401(k) plans provide a tax deduction valued at the worker's marginal tax rate, higher-income individuals at the top tax rates are getting the greatest value from the deduction. In addition, researchers are also finding that such tax benefits rarely incentivize the affluent to save more; instead, it merely encourages them to move savings out of taxable investment accounts and into the tax-preferenced plans instead, leading them to capture the lion's share of nearly $100 billion of retirement contribution tax breaks. On the other hand, research from EBRI suggests that because there are also contribution caps on 401(k) plans, the highest income workers in their 60s actually have a smaller account balance relative to their income than lower-income individuals, which means the tax benefits may not be so skewed after all.\n\nLong Term Savings, Relying On Returns, And Retirement Date Risk \u2014 While the \"start saving early and let compounding work for you\" retirement strategy has been popular, this article shows that just relying on compounding to do most of the retirement work can leave prospective retirees highly vulnerable to a delayed retirement. As the annual increases in the account balance approaching retirement are more and more dependent on market returns, volatility results in not only an account balance that can rise and fall precipitously, but a retirement date that can be greatly accelerated or drastically delayed. While this doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea to delay saving for retirement, the article notes that the more future retirees rely on a long time horizon to compound returns, the more uncertain their retirement date will be; as a result, saving more and investing more conservative means not only will the portfolio itself be less volatile, but there will be less \"retirement date risk\" too.\n\n4 Reasons Aging is a Good Thing \u2014 With all the negativity about aging, this article provides a nice reminder that there are some very good things going for today's aging seniors. As baby boomers enter retirement, they bring a tremendous spending power to products crafted for seniors, which is leading to a boom in consumer-product companies innovating on new products to meet their needs. For those who haven't retired yet, many workplaces are crafting increasingly flexible job opportunities for their most experienced staff to help keep them around, for the benefit of both the firm and a little more income for the aging worker. Meanwhile, for all the negativity about Social Security and Medicare, the odds that the programs will be materially changed is still fairly limited, and their success in reduced poverty for older seniors in the past 50 years has been dramatic. And as more baby boomers become eligible for AARP, the organization's ability to continue to lobby for benefits for seniors continues to grow, and social attitudes are shifting increasingly favorably toward aging and the elderly.\n\nWhile there may still be some challenges ahead, arguably there's never been a better time to grow old.
