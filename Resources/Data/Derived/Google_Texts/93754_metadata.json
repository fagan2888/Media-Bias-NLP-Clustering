Part two of the speech can be viewed here.)\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2014 The CEO of Alabama\u2019s public employees\u2019 pension system has a lengthy list of foul-mouthed grievances with the citizens of Alabama and their elected representatives, and he made it known in no uncertain terms during a recent speech.\n\nDr. David Bronner, who has led the taxpayer-backed Retirement Systems of Alabama since 1973, told the Alabama State Employees Association last week that there are several things about Alabama he cannot understand.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t figure out why our legislature loves to pass unconstitutional laws,\u201d Bronner said to begin his list. \u201cIt sure as hell doesn\u2019t do any good for the people of Alabama.\u201d\n\nHe did not elaborate on which laws he was referring to, but did get more specific about several of his other frustrations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve yet to figure out why Alabamians hate the federal government,\u201d he continued.\n\nAlabama\u2019s relatively high poverty rate results in a disproportionate flow of federal dollars into the state in the form of social welfare programs, which Dr. Bronner says should be encouraged rather than shunned.\n\nBut he saved some of his most stinging criticism for conservative Alabamians who he believes are irrationally opposed to higher taxes and expanding government healthcare programs.\n\n\u201cTell me logically how anybody who says, \u2018Ok, I\u2019m going to give it to you for free for three years,\u2019 and you say, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want that old Obama insurance stuff, because golly, what would I do with a billion and a half dollars for three years for free?'\u201d\n\nExpanding Medicaid under ObamaCare would mean the program would cover adults who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal government has promised to pay 100 percent of the expansion\u2019s cost for the first three years, then would steadily decrease their contributions in future years, shifting more of the burden to the state. But whether the money is flowing through the state or federal government, taxpayers are still the ones footing the bill, leaving many of them to likely take exception to Bronner\u2019s characterization of it as \u201cfree\u201d money.\n\nThe Alabama Senate earlier this year passed a resolution voicing their opposition to expanding Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThe state should pursue reforms based on reducing Medicaid dependence, rather than increasing dependence,\u201d the resolution stated. Legislative leaders expressed concerns that an expansion of the program would further strain the state\u2019s beleaguered General Fund, where Medicaid is already the largest line-item.\n\nDr. Bronner \u2014 who is Alabama\u2019s highest paid non-coach state employee \u2014 dismissed those concerns, saying it is time for Alabamians to get over their opposition to higher taxes and increased state government spending.\n\n\u201cWhat I say to Alabamians is, you want football to be the best, why won\u2019t you fund anything else to at least be normal?\u201d\n\nDr. Bronner did not mention in his speech, however, that Alabama taxpayers currently fund his organization far above what many analysts would describe as \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nThe RSA\u2019s investment returns are not sufficient to cover its obligations to retired state employees, leaving Alabama taxpayers to prop up the fund to the tune of almost $1 billion per year.\n\nA state legislative committee is currently researching reforms tried by other states in an attempt to get the burgeoning costs of the pension system under control.\n\nBut efforts to stabilize the system in the long term have been met with fierce opposition by Dr. Bronner, who dismisses calls for reform as a conspiracy by billionaire conservative industrialists the Koch Brothers, the favorite boogeymen of many Democrats on the federal level.\n\n\u201cThe Koch Brothers are dead ass serious about taking away your pension and cutting your healthcare,\u201d Bronner intoned, \u201cand I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nHe slammed conservative policy organizations and free market groups around the state for being in on the conspiracy, including Troy University\u2019s economics department and the Alabama Policy Institute, both of which have questioned the RSA\u2019s recent struggles.\n\nAnd to top it all off, Bronner made sure to take a parting shot at Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI know the bastard, he ain\u2019t worth anything,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI assure you, if Mr. Trump was president, you wouldn\u2019t like it. That I can promise.\u201d\n\nLike this article? Hate it?
