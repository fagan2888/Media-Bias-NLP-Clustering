Since he invaded Crimea, Putin\u2019s approval ratings in Russia have gone up 10 points. In another of his historic \u201cfirsts,\u201d Obama has done what no other president has done: make Putin look better.\n\nAs the Obama administration argues over which symbolic, empty gestures it plans to use next, Putin smiles (or sneers, I\u2019m not sure which; with him, it\u2019s a creepy-yet-subtle distinction).\n\nRussia caught Obama off-guard. Prior to the invasion of Crimea, in Obama\u2019s mind, our nation\u2019s biggest threats were the Koch brothers, the Tea Party and health care providers. Now added to that list is the Russian situation, but only to the degree that it makes Obama look politically weak.\n\nHillary and the O-bots did what they do best: made speeches on the matter, one even comparing Putin to Hitler. To be fair, all Putin did was take back part of a bordering country that used to be a part of the Soviet Union and whose residents probably wanted to rejoin Mother Russia, anyway. It\u2019s not like Putin forced all the citizens of a country to buy expensive, government-mandated health insurance he deemed they needed.\n\nFor those keeping sanctions score at home, so far, Obama has only gotten Putin kicked out of a meaningless G8 meeting. Don\u2019t underestimate this \u2013 it means Putin doesn\u2019t get his 2014 G8 T-shirt or the handsome tote bag with Angela Merkel\u2019s picture on it.\n\nThe lesson here is that invading another country gets you out of a boring meeting. I might invade the cubicle next to me if it gets me out of the upcoming human resources meeting.\n\nWe choose to try minimal economic sanctions in order to punish Russia. If we really cared, we'd get Lindsey Lohan to stop drinking Russian vodka and make Donald Trump vow not to marry any models born east of Poland. Or, the nuclear option: force Obamacare on them.\n\nTo be fair, Putin did allow Crimeans to vote to join Russia. The ballot only had an \u201copt-in Yes\u201d block; there was no option to vote \u201cNo.\u201d Putin got the idea from the ATT two-year sign-up \u201cUser Agreement.\u201d\n\nObama is an affirmative-action product of academia, schooled in the theoretical world of liberal, naive, faculty-lounge notions and arrogant discourse. Putin is a pragmatic, cold-blooded, ex-KGB thug. If someone made movies about their lives, which one would you want to watch?\n\nObama was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize before he was in office even a year. Just weeks after invading Crimea, Putin was also nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, of course, have one. Hitler was nominated for one in 1939 but didn\u2019t win. He blamed it on the Jews.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize has become a joke, hijacked by a leftist committee. Ronald Reagan was never nominated, but, through strength, he demolished the Berlin Wall and gave freedom to millions.\n\nI\u2019d like to have seen the faces of Putin\u2019s fellow \u201cPeace Prize\u201d nominees when the KGB asked for their names, addresses and brief descriptions of their cars.\n\nThe White House does produce one thing well: excuses. The O-bots said they did not see the Crimea invasion coming because Putin does not use a cellphone and so they could not keep up with him. It makes me wonder if I should not be keeping better tabs on my 80-year-old parents, for the same reason.\n\nObama seems powerless to do much about the macho Putin. Putin pumps iron, while our presidents don\u2019t even pump their own gas. He is a man who rides shirtless on horses and spears fish. Our only hope of scaring him is to have a shirtless Chris Christie ride in on a Clydesdale horse and spear his own fried-shrimp dinner at Red Lobster.\n\nThe U.S. has a feckless president, obsessed with his pop culture image. As Putin expands his empire, Obama does his March Madness brackets on TV, joins the cast of \u201cThe View\u201d and \u201cEllen,\u201d and does an Internet show with Zach Galifianakis. If all that does not work, Obama plans to appear on the \u201cRachael Ray Show\u201d and cook Vegetables Parmesan with her.\n\nObama is not paying attention. Sadly, neither are American voters. God help Estonia if the finals of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and the NBA Finals happen on the same day.\n\nRon Hart is a syndicated op-ed humorist, author and TV/radio commentator.
