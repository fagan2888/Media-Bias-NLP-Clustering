His speech was only supposed to last 10 minutes, but Trump is known for going off script.\n\nHe said he wants to make American great again, and he promised to build up the military, take care of veterans and repeal Obamacare.\n\nTrump took several jabs at other presidential candidates. He said politicians are killing this country, but he is not a politician, he said. He is a businessman who knows how to create jobs.\n\n\u201cI'm almost more disappointed in Republican politicians and even the people running for office. I watch them all the time and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set. They walk around talking about the weather. I say people just want a job,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIt won't be long before Trump is back in Iowa. His state director said Trump will be in Oskaloosa and Winterset on June 27.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 22:18:55 CDT", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Laura Terrell", "og": {"site_name": "KCCI", "description": "Donald Trump was in Iowa Tuesday for his first campaign stop.", "title": "In Iowa: Trump says he's a businessman, not a politician", "url": "http://www.kcci.com/politics/in-iowa-trump-says-hes-a-businessman-not-a-politician/33620976", "image": "http://www.kcci.com/image/view/-/33621884/medRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/x6gsfbz/-/img-In-Iowa-Trump-says-he-s-a-businessman-not-a-politician.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.kcci.com/politics/in-iowa-trump-says-hes-a-businessman-not-a-politician/33620976", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "kcci://content/article/33620976", "iphone": "kcci://content/article/33620976", "googleplay": "kcci://content/article/33620976"}, "name": {"ipad": "kcci", "iphone": "kcci", "googleplay": "kcci"}, "id": {"ipad": 505215818, "iphone": 505215818, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.kcci"}}, "site": "@KCCINews", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "kcci://content/article/33620976", "app_name": "kcci", "package": "com.hearst.android.kcci"}, "ios": {"url": "kcci://content/article/33620976", "app_store_id": 505215818, "app_name": "kcci"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 239632779417960}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.kcci.com/politics/in-iowa-trump-says-hes-a-businessman-not-a-politician/33620976"}, "google-site-verification": "ouVXmtXTUso5qDougWesGSbnCjhBjWT_Ab9ajDvLc8A", "keywords": "donald trump, commitment 2016, hoyt sherman, des moines", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/LauraNicholsKCCI"}, "news_keywords": "donald trump, commitment 2016, hoyt sherman, des moines", "description": "Donald Trump was in Iowa Tuesday for his first campaign stop."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc28\"", "article_summary": "Donald Trump was in Iowa Tuesday for his first campaign stop where he told Iowans that he will make the best president in 2016.\nIt won't be long before Trump is back in Iowa.\nHe said he is a businessman who knows how to run the country.\n\u201cIf I win, we will guarantee to make America great again,\u201d Trump said.\nOther Stories PhotosWatch videoIt was a packed house at Hoyt Sherman Place for Trump, who was not shy about touting his accomplishments and wealth."}
