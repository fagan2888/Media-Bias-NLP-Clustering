It\u2019s closely divided between the two major parties. Three-term incumbent Democrat Kurt Schrader\u2019s biggest rival is another Clackamas County resident, Republican Tootie Smith.\n\nSchrader and his Republican challenger, have at least one thing in common. They both split their time between official and campaign duties. Both had official reasons for being in Oregon City last week.\n\nRob Manning/OPB\n\nSmith was on the dais for a Clackamas County commission meeting. She was one of several board members explaining the complex considerations in raising local revenue:\n\n\u201cIf we put out a proposal to the voters, and it fails, then we will go without. Gee, what are my decisions? I can take some officers off the highway. I can do less mental health. I can cut back on our clinics\u2026\u201d\n\nHours before that, Kurt Schrader had toured Benchmade Knife Company. He asked where the company got its steel. Vice president David Fee said some of it has to be imported from Austria. Fee says that affects his company\u2019s ability to use the \u201cMade In America\u201d label.\n\n[We\u2019re] \u201ctrying to struggle right now with the Federal Trade Commission and try to determine whether or not we can use that label,\u201d Fee said.\n\nSchrader told him, \u201cwell, check with our office - we\u2019re big on making it in America. Our problem - if sometimes the problem is if you can\u2019t get raw material or whatever, we\u2019ve got to make sure that folks like you who are trying to do the right thing, don\u2019t get penalized. We want to encourage this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201dsaid Fee. \u201cI\u2019ll take you up on that. So we\u2019re going to head out this door right here\u2026.\u201d\n\nBut if Schrader and Smith both juggle official and campaign duties, their similarities mostly end there.\n\nRob Manning/OPB\n\nBefore Schrader toured the knife factory in Oregon City, he was locking horns with Smith, at a debate in Happy Valley where the two staked out very different ground on a number of issues.\n\nTake the Affordable Care Act, for instance.\n\n\u201cThe President gave exemptions to huge big blocks of people - to the unions, and as a matter of fact, Congress even exempted themselves from healthcare,\u201d said Smith at the debate. She continued, \u201cas a Clackamas County commissioner, I have the exact same healthcare that all 2,800 of our employees do.\u201d\n\nSchrader came back with, \u201cfor the record, most of what my opponent said about the health care bill, of course, is totally inaccurate.\u201d He generally defended the health care act, though not everything about it:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t confuse the debacle with Cover Oregon with promoting health care. The doctors, the hospitals, the health care organizations - the coordinated care organizations we have here in Oregon - have signed up a bunch of people.\u201d\n\nAnd the two disagreed about what a U.S. representative should be: a fighter or a team player.\n\nSchrader presented himself as the latter. \u201cIf you want someone who knows how to work with both sides of the aisle to get it done, you want me to be there.\u201d\n\nSmith highlighted her willingness to battle - even with her own party. \u201cI think it\u2019s very obvious that Washington, DC is not working for the people,\u201d she said. \u201cSeventy percent say that they feel government is dysfunctional, and they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t like the Republican leadership any more than some of you do.\u201d\n\nSmith kept her focus at the chamber of commerce debate on economic issues facing businesses and families, like hers. When student debt came up, she reacted as a mother.\n\n\u201cSo where in the world, on this earth, can I get a three percent loan for my daughter, who is a college graduate?\u201d she asked. \u201cShe\u2019s working in her field as an accountant. But guess what, she\u2019s still living at home, trying to save money, so she can be independent. That is not prosperity.\u201d\n\nSchrader agreed with Smith\u2019s worries about student loans, calling debt levels \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the only time the two candidates seemed aligned. The candidates took turns blasting the Environmental Protection Agency. Schrader said he read the agency the \u201criot act\u201d recently. \u201cI\u2019m actually the lead Democrat in Washington, DC, in the House of Representatives in fighting the expansion of the Clean Water Act, as suggested by the EPA. It\u2019s a vast, huge overreach.\u201d\n\nSmith contended environmental rules are wrecking local economies, and Schrader just hasn\u2019t done enough.\n\nThere are three minor-party candidates in the race - Ray Baldwin for the Constitution Party, Independent Party candidate Marvin Sannes, and Libertarian, Daniel Souza.\n\nSchrader is leading the money race by a mile. He\u2019s raised nearly $1.5 million. Smith is the only other candidate who\u2019s actively raised money, and she has raised a little more than $50,000.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Rob Manning", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/article/schrader-versus-smith/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,g_north_west,h_300,q_90,w_400/101514_TootieS_RM_mmjyxw.jpg", "description": "At a debate,in Happy Valley, Kurt Schrader and Tootie Smith staked out different positions on a number of issues.", "title": "Schrader Versus Smith"}, "twitter": {"description": "<p>At a debate,in Happy Valley, Kurt Schrader and Tootie Smith staked out different positions on a number of issues.</p>", "title": "Kurt Schrader And Tootie Smith Stake Out Positions At Recent Debate", "image": {"src": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,g_north_west,h_348,q_90,w_620/101514_TootieS_RM_mmjyxw.jpg"}, "creator": "@OPB", "site": "@OPB", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "org_id": "OPB", "fb": {"pages": 17790154938}, "google-site-verification": "KMaJ_LFRGDv_xknYuKImf3uF3H8gkUuIblN-HIVIjAM", "sniply-options": "block", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce991\"", "article_summary": "So we\u2019re going to head out this door right here\u2026.\u201dBut if Schrader and Smith both juggle official and campaign duties, their similarities mostly end there.\nSmith is the only other candidate who\u2019s actively raised money, and she has raised a little more than $50,000.\nIt\u2019s a vast, huge overreach.\u201dSmith contended environmental rules are wrecking local economies, and Schrader just hasn\u2019t done enough.\nTake the Affordable Care Act, for instance.\nI can cut back on our clinics\u2026\u201dHours before that, Kurt Schrader had toured Benchmade Knife Company."}
