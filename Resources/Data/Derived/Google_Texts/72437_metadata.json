(Cliff Owen/Associated Press)\n\nPoliticians and pundits these days seem to be making unusually awful arguments in support of their political preferences and objectives. In some cases, you wonder if they are serious.\n\nVice President Biden: \u201cThere may be reasons why I don\u2019t run, but there\u2019s no obvious reason, for me, why I think I should not run.\u201d Oh, sure there are, Joe. You\u2019re going to be 73 years old in 2016. Hillary Clinton would trounce you. The media would mock you. And you\u2019ll probably say a bunch of stuff that will embarrass your current boss.\n\nDemocrats: Obamacare will make sure you\u2019re not \u201clocked\u201d into a job. Well, health-care reform wasn\u2019t supposed to work that way; it was supposed to increase jobs and economic growth. But if Dems think they can convince working Americans to subsidize health care for able-bodied people who\u2019d rather work part-time so they can write poetry on the couch, they should go for it.\n\nAnti-immigration advocates: Immigration reform will imperil working Americans. First off, having people already here illegally and subject to exploitation (e.g. work below legal wages or in dangerous conditions) is a bigger competitive threat to American workers. This is one reason to bring them out of the shadows. Second, virtually all free-market economists believe the anti-growth argument is bunk, especially in regard to high-skilled workers. (If it were true that illegal immigration destroys jobs for native-born Americans, why is Texas the leader, by far, in job creation over the last few years?) Third, if they think a secure border is a necessity, there is no way to get it other than by a negotiated comprehensive immigration package (or several chunks of one), which, by the way, will also include e-Verify, guest-worker provisions (which minimize permanent, illegal migration) and regulation of visa overstays. Fourth, what would happen to the economy if 11 million people were deported or self-deported? (If you think 2.5 million jobs leaving because of the Obamacare is bad news, why isn\u2019t 11 million exiting people even worse?)\n\nAnti-immigration Republicans: We can\u2019t pass immigration because we don\u2019t trust the president to enforce it. Puleez. If the president is going to play king for a day and do whatever he wants, it is a lot easier to do so in the absence of passed legislation. More to the point, they can have it go into effect when he leaves (considering the time frame it will take to pass and advance on border security, that will inevitably be the case.)\n\nAnti-internationalists on the right and left: We don\u2019t have national interests in Syria. Are they still saying that? Jeffrey Goldberg tentatively argues that \u201cthis story is moving out of the humanitarian catastrophe column or the \u2018this is bad for our regional allies\u2019 column into a kind of pre-9/11 Afghanistan story.\u201d It has actually been that way for years \u2014 ever since thousands of jihadis moved in. The ongoing war has ravaged U.S. credibility and bolstered Syria\u2019s senior partner Iran as well as Hezbollah. As expected, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has slow-walked compliance with the chemical weapons agreement \u2014 thereby underlying that we have neglected a very real national interest, namely the proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.): Democrats should give back campaign money from the purported \u201csexual predator\u201d Bill Clinton. Really, does this sound like a serious person who wants to be president? Bill Clinton is overwhelmingly popular. Rand Paul too often sounds wacky (e.g. defending the Southern Avenger, arguing for containment of Iran). And holding Hillary Clinton responsible \u2014 otherwise why bring it up? \u2014 for her husband\u2019s shenanigans smacks of sexism.\n\nU.S. News & World Report columnist: \u201cWhat the truth might be, and what few politicians would dare say, is there might simply be some value in lower economic growth.\u201d Few politicians would say it because among these bad political arguments this may be the worst. At a most basic level this columnist may confuse a single person\u2019s trade-off between income and leisure time with the country\u2019s economic growth as a whole. (The CBO says Obamacare will net out a 2.5 million job loss.) As for the country, there is no one in public office or running for office rooting for the economy to slow down. If you want more opportunity, less inequality, less poverty, longer life span, more technological advancement and more prosperity, you sure better root for more growth, which is why politicians of both parties do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How bad are these arguments?", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "How bad are these arguments?", "title": "Arguments better not made", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/02/10/arguments-better-not-made/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/02/06/Production/WashingtonPost/Images/APTOPIX_Biden_Unions-05e1f-2696.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/02/10/arguments-better-not-made/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obamacare job lock, immigration and growth, immigration and workers, Syria national interes,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare job lock, immigration and growth, immigration and workers, Syria national interes,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc32\"", "article_summary": "(Cliff Owen/Associated Press)Politicians and pundits these days seem to be making unusually awful arguments in support of their political preferences and objectives.\nIf you want more opportunity, less inequality, less poverty, longer life span, more technological advancement and more prosperity, you sure better root for more growth, which is why politicians of both parties do.\nWell, health-care reform wasn\u2019t supposed to work that way; it was supposed to increase jobs and economic growth.\n(If you think 2.5 million jobs leaving because of the Obamacare is bad news, why isn\u2019t 11 million exiting people even worse?)\nVice President Joe Biden at the 2014 UAW National Community Action Program Conference in Washington on Feb. 5."}
