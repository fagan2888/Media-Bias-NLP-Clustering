The crowd was tense as the verdict was delivered. For the assembled winter-weary crowd the news couldn't have been better. ...although no one had the heart to tell them that Punxsutawney Phil's forecasts have been correct only 39 percent of the time.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "video", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://yospace-cds1.reuters.com/u/resize~ad1~50X50/0/f/~image_jpeg~9999-1/1/m/d/b/0/m/u82u/reuters04?videoId=115550360", "sailthru.author": "Thomson Reuters", "description": "Pennsylvania's most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil emerges from his den but sees no shadow, indicating an early spring according to tradition.
