Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH). Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has predicated his campaign against Hillary Clinton in part on his utter disdain of Wall Street and what he perceives as the Federal Reserve\u2019s coziness with the top executives of major banks and financial institutions that had to be bailed out by the Fed and the Treasury Department during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nRelated: The Fed Just Raised Rates. Here\u2019s What It Means for Your Money\n\nSanders penned an op-ed piece in The New York Times on Wednesday rivaling Republicans for advocating some of the most draconian changes to an institution that has long prided its independence from political influence.\n\nSanders notes that almost every one of the banks is bigger today than they were at the time of the crisis, and that \u201cIf any were to fail again, taxpayers could be on the hook for another bailout, perhaps a larger one this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo rein in Wall Street, we should begin by reforming the Federal Reserve, which oversees financial institutions and which uses monetary policy to maintain price stability and full employment,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, an institution that was created to serve all Americans has been hijacked by the very bankers it regulates.\u201d\n\nSanders argues that the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement Dec. 17 ending a seven-year policy of near-zero interest rates by raising its benchmark rate was \u201cthe latest example of the rigged economic system. \u201cBig bankers and their supporters in Congress have been telling us for years that runaway inflation is just around the corner\u201d and must be prevented through a rise in interest rates, Sanders said. \u201cThey have been dead wrong each time.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Banks Win and You Lose from Fed Rate Hike\n\nHe insisted that raising interest rates now will be a serious blow to small businesses that need loans to expand their operations, which would also help average Americans who need more jobs and higher wages. As a rule, he added, the Fed should not raise interest rates until unemployment is lower than 4 percent.\n\n\u201cThe sad reality is that the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t regulate Wall Street,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cWall Street regulates the Fed. It\u2019s time to make banking work for the productive economy and for all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy speculators.\u201d\n\nLiberal Democrats and conservative Republicans long have differed over the Fed\u2019s near-zero interest monetary policy aimed at encouraging the long-term economic recovery. But Sanders\u2019s op-ed today clearly delineated where the left and the right see eye to eye on the Fed\u2019s operations and the remarkable overlap in their prescriptions for change.\n\nHere are a few of Sanders\u2019s most sweeping proposals:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has been taking heavy flak recently from critics on", "title": "Here\u2019s What Bernie Sanders Would Do to the Fed", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/23/Here-s-What-Bernie-Sanders-Would-Do-Fed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/bernie_sanders_delivering_speech.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/23/Here-s-What-Bernie-Sanders-Would-Do-Fed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/bernie_sanders_delivering_speech.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has been taking heavy flak recently from critics on", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe sad reality is that the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t regulate Wall Street,\u201d Sanders wrote.\nAs a rule, he added, the Fed should not raise interest rates until unemployment is lower than 4 percent.\n\u201cBig bankers and their supporters in Congress have been telling us for years that runaway inflation is just around the corner\u201d and must be prevented through a rise in interest rates, Sanders said.\n\u201cWall Street regulates the Fed.\nBut the Fed has been drawing fire from the left as well, including from Sens."}
