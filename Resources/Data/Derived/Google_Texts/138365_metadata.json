A few calls come in now, but once Oct. 1 comes, the call center is expected to be a busy place, with potential customers \u201ckicking some tires.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a lot of lookers,\u201d MNsure\u2019s chief operating officer Eric Larson said.\n\nLarson anticipated the \u201cgetting to know\u201d period to extend well into November before people start purchasing plans toward the start of 2014.\n\n\u201cInsurance is not a simple thing to understand, so what we\u2019ve tried to do is provide the tools that people can really understand and compare,\u201d Larson said.\n\nIt\u2019s something that Portico Healthnet has been doing for nearly 20 years. The St. Paul-based nonprofit finds health coverage for uninsured Minnesotans. And the head of the nonprofit says it\u2019s a time-consuming process.\n\n\u201cThree to six months,\u201d Portico president Debra Holmgren said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re thinking with MNSure it will be quite a bit faster.\u201d\n\nHolmgren said that means Portico be able to serve many more people than before.\n\nAs with any new program, especially an online program, there will be a learning curve. But back at MnSURE, Larson said they\u2019ve made the website as simple as possible to navigate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very similar to TurboTax,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really guides you step-by-step.\u201d\n\nThat is where the call center comes into play, to assist those who will be signing up.\n\nBut what about privacy and security? MNSure made headlines after an employee mistakenly made public sensitive information about more than 1,600 insurance brokers.\n\nLarson says that was an isolated incident, and had nothing to do with the computer system that will be used to sign people up to MNSure.\n\n\u201cPeople should feel comfortable that they can come to the website and shop around, and apply securely.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the Affordable Care Act, click here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a spacious new office overlooking Seventh Street in Downtown St. Paul, help is just a phone call away.
