Geoff Duncan, a Cumming Republican, said Georgia is \u201cin the midst of a crisis in rural health care.\u201d HB 919, he added, \u201callows us to do something in Georgia that\u2019s special.\u2019\u2019\n\nDuncan agreed to reduce the bill\u2019s original $250 million in state tax credits that would be available per year to $100 million.\n\nThe receiving organization must be a nonprofit, must treat patients who are indigent or on Medicaid or Medicare, and must be located in a rural county.\n\nDuncan and other Republicans said the legislation would boost the economies of rural areas.\n\nBut the debate on HB 919 also included a push from Democrats to spend such funds on Medicaid expansion, which they said would help rural hospitals and extend insurance coverage to hundreds of thousands of Georgians. (Treating a lower percentage of uninsured people helps a hospital\u2019s bottom line.)\n\nThe Affordable Care Act encourages states to expand their Medicaid programs, with the federal government providing funds for this project. Most states have approved expansion. Georgia, one of the states that has not done so, says it would ultimately be too costly.\n\nFour rural hospitals have closed in Georgia since the beginning of 2013. A fifth, Hutcheson Medical Center in Fort Oglethorpe, briefly closed in December before reopening in a downsized format.\n\nMany others are struggling financially. Rural hospitals face some steep challenges, including many patients who are likely to be unemployed, insufficiently insured or not insured at all.\n\n\u201cOur rural health care system is in crisis,\u2019\u2019 said Robert Trammell (D-Luthersville) during debate on the bill. He said hundreds of thousands of Georgians are in a \u201ccoverage gap\u2019\u2019 because the state has rejected Medicaid expansion.\n\nThese people make too much money to qualify for Medicaid under the state\u2019s current rules, but not enough to qualify for subsidies when buying insurance on the ACA exchange.\n\n\u201cThere is investment on the table for us to consider\u201d \u2013 from the funds the feds would provide under Medicaid expansion, Trammell said. He added that he supported the rural health proposal, but urged lawmakers \u201cto do more.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Health and Human Services Committee recently discussed a bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Michael \u201cDoc\u201d Rhett of Marietta that would create an expansion-like program \u2014 though not standard Medicaid expansion \u2014 in Georgia. No vote was taken on it, and no further action is expected during this legislative session.\n\nRep. Winfred Dukes, an Albany Democrat, said during the debate on the tax credit bill Thursday that rural hospitals in southwest Georgia have been closing over the years. With $100 million, Georgia could fund Medicaid expansion and draw billions of federal dollars into the state, he said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Stacey Abrams (D-Atlanta) said there is no accountability in House Bill 919 on how the funds pegged for rural health care facilities would be spent. She said that under the bill, \u201cnot a single dollar received\u201d has to be spent on patient care.\n\nUnder the bill, the contributing individual would get a tax credit of 80 percent of the actual amount donated or $2,500 per tax year, whichever is less; or in the case of a married couple filing a joint return, 80 percent of the amount contributed or $5,000 per tax year, whichever is less.\n\nA corporation or other entity would be allowed a tax credit in an amount not to exceed 80 percent of the actual amount expended, or 75 percent of the corporation\u2019s income tax liability, whichever is less.\n\nThe contributor would designate the specific organization that gets the donation.\n\nDuncan likened the rural health proposal to the Georgia Student Scholarship Organization, which accepts and manages tax-credit donations funding scholarships for children attending private schools in the state.\n\nJimmy Lewis, CEO of HomeTown Health, an association of rural hospitals in Georgia, said after the 130-37 vote that HB 919 \u201cis the largest rural health initiative in my 20 years of doing this.\u201d\n\nHe said hospitals can use the cash \u2018\u2018to fix a lot of operational problems . . . and take care of their depleted infrastructure.\u201d\n\nTim Sweeney of the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute said Thursday that investing money in the health care system is a worthy goal, but that the state could spend the money more efficiently through regular Medicaid, or through expanding the program under the ACA.\n\nThat way, he said, Georgia could get matching federal dollars on top of the state spending.\n\n\u201cWe would generate substantial new federal resources,\u2019\u2019 Sweeney said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/largetile.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams (D-Atlanta) said there is no accountability in House Bill 919 on how the funds pegged for rural health care facilities would be spent.\n\u201cOur rural health care system is in crisis,\u2019\u2019 said Robert Trammell (D-Luthersville) during debate on the bill.\nATLANTA -- The Georgia House passed a bill Thursday that would allow an individual or corporation to get a state tax credit for donating money to a rural health care organization.\nRural hospitals face some steep challenges, including many patients who are likely to be unemployed, insufficiently insured or not insured at all.\n\u201cThere is investment on the table for us to consider\u201d \u2013 from the funds the feds would provide under Medicaid expansion, Trammell said."}
