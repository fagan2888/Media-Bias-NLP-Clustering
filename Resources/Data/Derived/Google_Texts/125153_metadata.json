During the 2014 election cycle, $113 million \u2013 16 percent of money raised by all super PACs \u2013 went to committees dominated by one donor. That was quadruple their 2012 share.\n\nRelated: Americans Spend More on Taxes Than on Food, Clothing and Shelter\u200b\u200b\n\nThe rise of single-donor groups is a new example of how changes in campaign finance law are giving outsized influence to a handful of funders.\n\nThe trend may continue into 2016. Last week, National Review reported that Texas Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s bid for the Republican presidential nomination would be boosted not by one anointed super PAC but four, each controlled by a single donor or donor family.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United ruling helped usher in the era of super PACs. Unlike traditional political action committees, the independent groups can accept donations of any dollar size as long as they don\u2019t coordinate with the campaign of any candidate. Previously, much of the focus in big-money fundraising was on \u201cbundlers\u201d - volunteers who tap friends and associates for maximum individual contributions of $5,400 to a candidate, then deliver big lump sums directly to the campaigns. Former president George W. Bush awarded his most prolific bundlers special titles such as \u201cRanger\u201d and \u201cPioneer.\u201d\n\nWhile bundling intensified the impact of wealthy donors on campaigns, the dollar limits and the need to join with others diluted the influence of any one person. With a super PAC, a donor can single-handedly push a narrower agenda. Last year, National Journal profiled one such donor \u2013 a California vineyard owner who helped start the trend by launching his own super PAC and becoming a power player in a Senate race across the country.\n\nRelated: 16 Tycoons Who Give the Most Campaign Cash\n\nBeyond the single-donor groups, big donations are dominant across all kinds of super PACs, according to the analysis. Six-figure contributions from individuals or organizations accounted for almost 50 percent of all super PAC money raised during the last two cycles.\n\n\u201cWe are anointing an aristocracy that\u2019s getting a stronger and stronger grip on democracy,\u201d said Miles Rapoport, president of Common Cause, an advocacy group that seeks to reduce the influence of money on politics.\n\nProPublica\u2019s analysis identified 59 super PACs that received at least 80 percent of their funding from one individual during the 2014 cycle. They raised a total of $113 million, compared with the $33 million raised by the 34 such groups that existed in 2012.\n\nDonors who launch their own PACs are seeking more control over how their money is spent. And many have complained about the commissions that fundraising consultantstake off the top of their donations to outside groups. But the move carries risks if the patron is new to the arena.\n\nIn one cautionary tale, a reclusive 89-year-old Texas oilman with no political experience launched Vote2ReduceDebt, one of the nation\u2019s highest-spending conservative super PACs. A ProPublica investigation found that much of the donor\u2019s millions went to entities run by the group\u2019s consultants or their close associates. The super PAC imploded as principals traded allegations including self-dealing, faked campaign events and a plot to siphon the PAC\u2019s money to a reality TV show.\n\nBill Burton, a former Obama administration official who helped found Priorities USA, the juggernaut super PAC affiliated with the president\u2019s reelection campaign, said he expects donors to face more problems if they continue to go it alone.\n\nRelated: Obamacare's Cadillac Tax Hits the College Campus\u200b\n\n\u201cOne of two things is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will either see widespread flaunting of coordination rules or we will see some pretty spectacular failures to the tune of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nThe single-donor super PACs identified by ProPublica span the political spectrum. Among the top conservative donors were Richard Uihlein, a packaging supplies businessman, and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg spent heavily on both sides but leaned Democrat. Hedge fund titan Tom Steyer dominated on the left.\n\nIn 2012 the largest single-donor super PAC was former TD Ameritrade CEO Joe Ricketts\u2019 Ending Spending Action Fund, which raised over $14 million, 89 percent of which came from Ricketts. It was the ninth-largest super PAC by spending. In 2014 Steyer\u2019s Nextgen Climate Action was the largest super PAC, raising almost $78 million, 85 percent from Steyer. (Steyer\u2019s wife, Kat Taylor, is a member of ProPublica\u2019s board of directors, and the couple has donated to ProPublica.)\n\nIn addition to the super PACs dominated by a single individual, dozens more received the great majority of their funding from one corporation, labor group or advocacy organization. In 2014, those PACs represented 8.6 percent of super-PAC fundraising.\n\nRelated: The Blood Feud Between Reid and the Kochs Boils Over\n\nPACs dominated by one donor could run afoul of disclosure laws, according to Larry Noble, the former top lawyer for the Federal Election Commission. Under the rules, political ads must include disclosures about who funded them. Noble said election law would require groups funded by one person to list that donor\u2019s name, not just the name of the PAC \u2013 though he couldn\u2019t recall the FEC addressing such a case.\n\nNaming the super PAC instead of the donor in the ad, Noble said, also allows the groups to delay disclosing where their money comes from until the next FEC filing date \u2013 potentially weeks after the ad runs.\n\n\u201cIt defeats the purpose of the law to allow someone to hide behind a super PAC if they are the only funder,\u201d Noble said. \u201cThey want to make it more authoritative, like there\u2019s more support. It looks better to say the ad is from Americans for Good Government than from John Smith\u2026 That just makes a mockery of the law.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in ProPublica and was co-published with The Daily Beast.\n\nFor more coverage of campaign finance, read ProPublica\u2019s previous reporting on Super PAC Men, secret donors and gaps in campaign finance rules.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The wealthiest Americans can fly on their own jets, live in gated compounds and watch", "title": "Super PACs: Dems\u2019 Single Donors Outspent the GOP\u2019s by 400 Percent", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/20/Super-PACs-Dems-Single-Donors-Outspent-GOP-s-400-Percent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04192011_Taxes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/20/Super-PACs-Dems-Single-Donors-Outspent-GOP-s-400-Percent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04192011_Taxes_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The wealthiest Americans can fly on their own jets, live in gated compounds and watch", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Six-figure contributions from individuals or organizations accounted for almost 50 percent of all super PAC money raised during the last two cycles.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United ruling helped usher in the era of super PACs.\nProPublica\u2019s analysis identified 59 super PACs that received at least 80 percent of their funding from one individual during the 2014 cycle.\nA growing number of political committees known as super PACs have become instruments of single donors, according to a ProPublica analysis of federal records.\nIn 2014 Steyer\u2019s Nextgen Climate Action was the largest super PAC, raising almost $78 million, 85 percent from Steyer."}
