According to a study published by the Judicial Watch, a large number of votes cast by non-citizens were responsible for US President Barack Obama's victory in the 2008 elections.

The study, "Do non-citizens vote in U.S. elections?" which examined the participation rates of non-citizens in United States elections using a nationally representative sample found that it does indeed happen on such a large scale that it can make significant impact on the election outcomes. The study also claims that it is likely for Obama to have won his Presidency owing to the illegal votes of non-citizens.

Thanks to Obama's immigration plan, many non-citizens tend to favour Democrats and more than 80% of such voters from the 2008 sample collected by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, voted likewise.

The influence of the illegal votes is so much that it even affects the Electoral College votes, and Congressional Elections. The study claims, "Non-citizen votes likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress."

If the results of the study are accurate, it means that Obama's presidency is the result of fraud; Obamacare, which is the most significant refurbishing of the US healthcare system since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, was the result of fraud; and the repeal of "Don't ask, don't tell" policy, was the result of fraud.

Washington Post, in the article "Could non-citizens decide the November election?" had revealed that while most "non-citizens do not register, let alone vote. But enough do that, so their participation can change the outcome of close races."

Judicial Watch, the politically conservative, nonpartisan government watchdog, has long maintained that foreign nationals have helped Democrats steal the recent elections and this study confirms the same.
