The truth, however, is that they are now irrevocably linked to Obama\u2019s repeated bald-faced lies. Apparently South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson had it right back in 2009, when he interrupted Obama\u2019s introduction of his nationalized health care scheme to a joint session of Congress: \u201cYou Lie! You LIE!\u201d yelled Wilson. Subsequently, the ObamaCare deception has been affirmed, repeatedly, by a key architect of ObamaCare, MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber.\n\nI concur with the assessment of political analyst Jonah Goldberg that Obama\u2019s lies are \u201cthe biggest lies about domestic policy ever uttered by a U.S. president.\u201d\n\nAs politically vulnerable Demos in the Senate are scurrying away from the ObamaCare train wreck, their intrepid leader, Sen. Harry Reid, yet again repeated Obama\u2019s Big Lie: \u201cWhat he said was true. If you want to keep the insurance you have you can keep it. The problem is, we did not put the bill into effect that way.\u201d\n\nIn other words, you can keep your insurance and doctor, except \u201cwe did not put the bill into effect that way.\u201d This must be why he exempted some of his staff from ObamaCare.\n\nI was as stupefied by Reid\u2019s reiteration of this now-infamous lie as was the reporter who asked him about it. Is Reid suffering from acute dementia? Has he been imprisoned in some sensory deprivation tank for the last two months? Or is he, like Obama, thoroughly accomplished in the art of the Big Lie? Recall that this audacious technique is a staple of the biggest deceptions propagated by Leftist cadres since the rise of Marxism and its murderous manifestations in successive regimes, most notably the National Socialist German Workers' Party from the 1930s through the end of World War II.\n\nSome reading this will question: Really Alexander? Obama and Hitler? Is this another histrionic example of Godwin\u2019s Rule of Nazi Analogies: \u201cAs an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1\u201d?\n\nIf you\u2019re among those who\u2019d rather dismiss such associations because they seem too strident \u2013 or because you want to help maintain Obama\u2019s deception \u2013 then your answer is yes. But the fact is, Obama\u2019s lies fit neatly into the Big Lie framework defined by another pathological narcissist, Adolf Hitler.\n\nReid\u2019s repetition of Obama\u2019s lie invokes the need to review the origin of Big Lie theory, as well as the proliferation of Big Lie propaganda today.\n\nAdolf Hitler defined the Big Lie in his 1925 autobiography, Mein Kampf, writing that it must be so \u201ccolossal\u201d that the public would be confident that no national leaders \u201ccould have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying.\u201d\n\nHitler\u2019s Propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels, affirmed that \u201cthe principle that when one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it. \u2026 It is the absolute right of the state to supervise the formation of public opinion.\u201d\n\nIf you still have trouble making the Big Lie connection, perhaps you can make the Socialist connection.\n\nIn Mein Kampf, Hitler also wrote of his Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers' Party, or NAZI), \u201cThe party \u2026 must not become a servant of the masses, but their master.\u201d With respect to the socialist state and individual Liberty, he wrote, \u201cThe unity of a nation\u2019s spirit and will are worth far more than the freedom of the spirit and will of an individual; and that the higher interests involved in the life of the whole must here set the limits and lay down the duties of the interests of the individual.\u201d\n\nHitler\u2019s regime was founded on his premise, \u201cWe are Socialists, we are enemies of the capitalistic economic system \u2026 and we are all determined to destroy this system under all conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be a socialist,\u201d Goebbels affirmed, \u201cis to submit the I to the thou; socialism is sacrificing the individual to the whole.\u201d\n\nFor those who still find the Big Lie comparison too strident, I refer you to Jacob Hornberger\u2019s paraphrase of the esteemed classical liberal economist Friedrich von Hayek: \u201cThere is no difference in principle, between the economic philosophy of Nazism, socialism, communism, and fascism and that of the American welfare state and regulated economy.\u201d\n\nBritish historian Dr. John Joseph Ray followed, \u201cThe Big Lie of the late 20th century was that Nazism was Rightist. It was in fact typical of the Leftism of its day. It was only to the Right of Stalin\u2019s Communism.\u201d\n\nAs for Obama\u2019s Biggest Lies, it\u2019s difficult to pick just one, given that his entire presidency is a lie. Indeed, his whole life is a lie. Even his official White House bio begins, \u201cHis story is the American story \u2013 values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family\u2026\u201d\n\nNothing could be further from the truth.\n\nObama was a disciple of bigotry and hate, and he was steeped in Marxist ideology from a young age. His indoctrination is a case study in the advancement of statist tyranny and oppression of Liberty.\n\nSurely one of Obama\u2019s Biggest Lies was his 2008 election night assertion, \u201cThe dream of our founders is alive!\u201d Does any right-thinking person now seriously believe that his agenda to supplant Rule of Law with rule of men is consistent with our nation\u2019s founding principles of Liberty, \u201cendowed by our creator?\u201d Of course not.\n\nHis sycophantic constituents, however, are another matter. They were too dullard then, and most are still too ignorant to realize they\u2019ve been lied to. The Big Lie remains so big that, cascades of facts not withstanding, they adamantly cling to hope that there is another explanation.\n\nMore accurate would be Obama\u2019s victory night declaration, \u201cAt this defining moment, change has come to America,\u201d which reaffirmed this infamous claim from a week earlier: \u201cWe are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.\u201d Indeed, that transformation is well underway \u2013 though by no means does it still have enough momentum that it is unstoppable.\n\nAnd here is a sampling of other BIG Lies which I have rebutted in one or more columns in recent years.\n\nObama promised to have \u201cthe most transparent administration in history\u201d when, in fact, his has been one of the least transparent. Remember the \u201cfive days\u201d everyone will have to review his proposals online? He said, \u201cI will restore trust in Government.\u201d That one is as laughable as, \u201cWhistle blowers will be protected in my administration.\u201d His failure mantra for his first four years was, \u201cBlame Bush.\u201d He sold the massive \u201cstimulus\u201d fraud as necessary to create \u201cshovel-ready jobs,\u201d and it didn\u2019t \u2013 unless you were among his government union constituents. Oh, and taxpayers \u201cgot back every dime\u201d government \u201cinvested\u201d in the bailouts. And where the private sector succeeds despite government obstacles, Obama reminded us, \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that.\u201d He promised to put an end to the type of politics that \u201cbreeds division, conflict and cynicism,\u201d but his entire administration platform has been built on a foundation of fomenting division, conflict and cynicism, particularly his classist and racist plays. He deals race cards at any opening, like claiming those Cambridge cops were \u201cacting stupidly,\u201d and suggesting that if he \u201chad a son, he would look like Trayvon.\u201d Of course, the murders at Benghazi were because of a YouTube video, and in Syria, it was \u201cthe world\u2019s red line.\u201d Holding talks with Iran would be sufficient to contain their nuclear weapons ambitions. He knew nothing about \u201cFast and Furious,\u201d or the depth of NSA surveillance on U.S. citizens, or the IRS targeting conservative groups. Heck, he did not even know his illegal alien uncle, when he was living with him during law school.\n\nBut in my assessment, Barack Obama\u2019s Biggest Big Lie was uttered twice, when he took his constitutionally prescribed oath of office. If memory serves, it went something like this: \u201cI do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nReputable public opinion surveys indicate that Americans have less trust for Obama, at this point in his presidency, than even Richard Nixon. Democrats hope that their association with Obama\u2019s deceptions will not bankrupt their political fortunes, suggesting that his precipitous 35-point collapse in public trust is due to recent revelations about his O'Care lies. However, Obama had already slid 30 points four months before the ObamaCare launch.\n\nFor now, at least, Obama has been snared by his own litany of Big ObamaCare Lies. Let\u2019s hope he stays caught.\n\nPro Deo et Constitutione \u2013 Libertas aut Mors\n\nSemper Fortis Vigilate Paratus et Fidelis", "article_metadata": {"description": "No president since Franklin Roosevelt has mastered the art of the \"Big Lie\" as effectively as Barack Hussein Obama.", "csrf-token": "3iXjNfVVPjJDFVJiqxOLZ3LX/ECD9kFI/Hvj6VPCYys=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "No president since Franklin Roosevelt has mastered the art of the \u201cBig Lie\u201d as effectively as Barack Hussein Obama.", "title": "Mastering the Art of the BIG Lie", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/alexander/22209", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2013-12-12-0470e60c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Reid\u2019s repetition of Obama\u2019s lie invokes the need to review the origin of Big Lie theory, as well as the proliferation of Big Lie propaganda today.\nThe Big Lie remains so big that, cascades of facts not withstanding, they adamantly cling to hope that there is another explanation.\nNo president since Franklin Roosevelt has mastered the art of the \u201cBig Lie\u201d as effectively as Barack Hussein Obama.\nBut the fact is, Obama\u2019s lies fit neatly into the Big Lie framework defined by another pathological narcissist, Adolf Hitler.\nOr is he, like Obama, thoroughly accomplished in the art of the Big Lie?"}
