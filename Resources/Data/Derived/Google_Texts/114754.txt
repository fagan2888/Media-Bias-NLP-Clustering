SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) - Federal authorities say a Pakistani man living in a Mitchell hotel room paid a smuggler to be taken from his home country to Saudi Arabia and then get a visa to enter the U.S. under false pretenses.

Ihtisham Anwar has pleaded not guilty to possession or use of a fraudulent immigration document.

Court records show authorities arrested Anwar this month after a federal record check stemming from a July speeding ticket found his visa had been revoked.

A complaint filed in federal court in Sioux Falls says Anwar falsely claimed he was traveling to the U.S. in 2014 for a medical conference.

Authorities say Anwar admitted he paid the equivalent of $18,000 to be smuggled from Pakistan and get the visa.

An attorney for Anwar didnâ€™t immediately return a request for comment.
