It is now home to the Mendocino Coast Hospitality Center. Many local residents oppose a social services agency in the downtown business district. ( Google Street View )\n\nKevin Scanlon walks out of the main coffee shop in downtown Fort Bragg. One block to the left is the ocean, and miles of trails along the Mendocino coastline. Scanlon turns right, toward the four-block stretch of small shops selling socks, books and tchotchkes.\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t say we\u2019re against it. We said we\u2019re against it here. \u2026 And that\u2019s not being prejudiced, just pragmatic.\u2019\n\nKevin Scanlon, Fort Bragg resident\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a tourist town now. Logging\u2019s done. Fishing\u2019s done,\u201d says Scanlon, a general contractor who has worked on many of the local buildings. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to keep the integrity of downtown.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not only tourists who have taken a liking to Fort Bragg. So have the homeless. And this worries Scanlon.\n\n\u201cIf you have a lot of transitional people coming, it just turns tourists off,\u201d he says.\n\nScanlon stops outside the historic Old Coast Hotel. It was vacant for years, until the city approved a grant to the nonprofit Mendocino Coast Hospitality Center to buy it. The agency moved in this summer and began providing case management and mental health services to the homeless. It will eventually use the hotel rooms as transitional housing.\n\nThe plans threw the town into an uproar. Scanlon, and more than 1,000 other local residents and business owners, signed a petition to keep the homeless out of the hotel.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t say we\u2019re against it. We said we\u2019re against it here,\u201d Scanlon says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not being prejudiced, just pragmatic.\u201d\n\nThe hotel sits at the gateway to the burgeoning downtown commercial district. Scanlon and other opponents say the building should go to a thriving business. Like a hotel, or a restaurant.\n\n\u201cYou could get bed tax. You could get the food tax,\u201d Scanlon says. \u201cThat could be a financial gain for the city, as opposed to a financial drain.\u201d\n\nOpponents feel so strongly about the hotel that they filed a lawsuit to block the sale. It failed. They threatened to recall the mayor for supporting the project. That didn\u2019t work. Now they\u2019ve put a measure on next June\u2019s ballot that would ban all social services from downtown.\n\nBut leaders of the hospitality center say there\u2019s been community pushback at every location they considered.\n\n\u201cPart of it is simply that \u2018not in my backyard,\u2019 \u201d says Executive Director Anna Shaw.\n\nBut when they landed at the Old Coast Hotel, it really hit a nerve. Shaw says people have nostalgia for watching sports at the polished wood bar, and seeing their teams win. One man proposed to his wife here 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cI think some people have a feeling that it\u2019s kind of too good for the homeless and the mentally ill,\u201d Shaw says.\n\nThe building is more than 100 years old and is considered an architectural gem. The hallway walls are pressed tin. The hotel rooms upstairs still have Victorian details \u2014 layered window dressings, wainscoting, marble fireplaces.\n\nShaw says that when homeless people have a nice place to stay like this, they do better.\n\n\u201cBecause people\u2019s self-esteem is higher. It\u2019s much harder to throw trash on the floor when the room looks beautiful like this,\u201d Shaw says. \u201cIf it\u2019s really squalid, there\u2019s no incentive to behave.\u201d\n\nShe says being downtown is also important. It\u2019s easier for people to get to appointments, and it helps reduce stigma when people are integrated into the community.\n\n\u201cLots of homeless people and people impaired with mental illness feel marginalized,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s important that folk get to come to a place where the value we place on them is expressed through the building.\u201d\n\nBut Anne Marie Cesario, a retired social worker, says that\u2019s not the way to combat stigma.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s like using people as guinea pigs in order to further some liberal\u2019s idea about consciousness raising,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d\n\nCesario is one of several mental health professionals opposed to the downtown location. She says it\u2019s not private enough, especially for people who suffer from paranoia.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen when they go to the doctor. They don\u2019t want to be seen when they go to the therapist,\u201d she says. \u201cThat building is on one of the busiest corners in town, and it\u2019s a four-way stop.\u201d\n\nShe, and other members of the Concerned Citizens of Fort Bragg, believe a more appropriate location would be the former social services building on the edge of town, near the hospital and police station. Or an old motel on Highway 1. Or a building 3 miles north of Fort Bragg.\n\nThe Hospitality Center declined all those properties. And now the Concerned Citizens group is hoping voters will pass their ballot measure prohibiting social services in the downtown commercial district, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2015.\n\nBut even if the measure does pass, it\u2019s unclear what impact it will have on the Old Coast Hotel. An analysis from the city attorney\u2019s office says that, under legal precedents, the Hospitality Center would most likely be allowed to continue operating at the hotel. It would be grandfathered in under any new zoning rules as a \u201cnon-conforming use.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will result in nothing but lawsuits,\u201d says Scott Menzies, who runs a tai chi studio in town, and helped organize another group of small business owners, called Go Fort Bragg, who are against the ballot measure.\n\n\u201cThe measure is so broad-reaching, it will cause far more collateral damage,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re using a cannon that targets every other social services organization in the business district.\u201d\n\nAll the tension and fighting is frustrating for Debbie Gibney, a client of the Hospitality Center.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bipolar and I have post-traumatic stress syndrome, from being an abused wife,\u201d she says. \u201cI take medication and I see a therapist regularly.\u201d\n\nGibney is 58. A few years ago, she was forced to retire early from her job. Then she lost her home. She got help at the Hospitality Center, and now she\u2019s back on her feet, helping other homeless people at the Old Coast Hotel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to walk in here,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause of the beauty of the building, and the reception that we get here, and the way the staff accepts us and loves us unconditionally.\u201d\n\nAt the agency\u2019s previous location, in a strip mall near the DMV, clients had to wait in an alleyway for appointments. But since moving to the Old Coast Hotel, Gibney notices the clients are more relaxed and more respectful.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we\u2019re part of the city now,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Mendocino Coast town will soon vote on whether to ban mental health services in downtown shopping district.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Tiny Fort Bragg Bitterly Divided over Downtown Homeless Center\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/11\\/19\\/fort-bragg-bitterly-divided-downtown-homeless-center\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-19 00:12:06\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-20 11:17:44\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":109971,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Mental Health\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/11\\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-17-at-2.43.17-PM.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The Mendocino Coast town will soon vote on whether to ban mental health services in downtown shopping district.", "title": "Tiny Fort Bragg Bitterly Divided over Downtown Homeless Center", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/11/19/fort-bragg-bitterly-divided-downtown-homeless-center/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/11/SocisalSign-400x300.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "mental health,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Old Coast Hotel building (L) sits at the edge of downtown Fort Bragg.\n\u2026 And that\u2019s not being prejudiced, just pragmatic.\u2019Kevin Scanlon, Fort Bragg resident\u201cWe\u2019re a tourist town now.\nBut since moving to the Old Coast Hotel, Gibney notices the clients are more relaxed and more respectful.\n( Google Street View )Kevin Scanlon walks out of the main coffee shop in downtown Fort Bragg.\nIt was vacant for years, until the city approved a grant to the nonprofit Mendocino Coast Hospitality Center to buy it."}
