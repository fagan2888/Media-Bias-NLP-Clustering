Offices and bulletin boards, which once showed photo tributes to dead American and British soldiers, had been stripped.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s eerily empty,\u201d said Lt. Will Davis, of the Queen\u2019s Dragoon Guards in the British Army. Camp Bastion was also where Prince Harry was based in 2012 as an Apache helicopter gunner.\n\nIn all, 2,210 American soldiers and 453 British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, when the U.S.-led coalition toppled the Taliban government for harboring al Qaeda after the militant group carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.\n\nThe coalition has been led by NATO since 2003, and includes forces from Germany, Italy, Jordan and Turkey.\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s withdrawal, the Afghan National Army\u2019s 215th Corps will be headquartered at the 28 sq km (11 sq mile) base, leaving almost no foreign military presence in Helmand.\n\nThe U.S. military is leaving behind about $230 million worth of property and equipment \u2014 including a major airstrip at the base, plus roads and buildings \u2014 for the Afghan military.\n\n\u201cWe gave them the maps to the place. We gave them the keys,\u201d said Col. Doug Patterson, a Marine brigade commander in charge of logistics.\n\nCivilian casualties in Afghanistan may reach an all-time high this year, with the United Nations reporting nearly 5,000 killed or wounded in the first half of 2014, most of them by the insurgency.\n\nSeveral Afghans at Sunday\u2019s ceremony expressed pride at taking over the base, mixed with sadness at the international forces with whom they have worked with for years leaving for good.\n\n\u201cWe are going to miss our friends,\u201d said Afghan Brig. Gen. Nasim Sangin. \u201cBut we will still be in touch by email.\u201d\n\nInternational forces in Afghanistan boosted their numbers to about 140,000 in 2010 troops with the aim of wresting control of the Helmand province back from the Taliban. By Jan. 1, that number will be about 12,500, comprising mostly trainers and advisers.\n\nOf those, 9,800 will be American, with the rest from other NATO members. The British will keep a small contingent at an officer training school in Kabul.", "article_metadata": {"description": "British troops ended their combat operations in Afghanistan on Sunday as they and U.S. Marines handed over two huge adjacent bases to the Afghan military, 13 years after a U.S.-led invasion launched the long and costly war against the Taliban.", "parsely-tags": "Nation and World,News,Government,Politics", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nation-and-world/us-marines-british-troops-leaving-afghanistan", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1949651"}, "author": "KAY JOHNSON REUTERS", "parsely-title": "US Marines, British troops leaving Afghanistan", "twitter": {"description": "British troops ended their combat operations in Afghanistan on Sunday as they and U.S. Marines handed over two huge adjacent bases to the Afghan military, 13 years after a U.S.-led invasion launched the long and costly war against the Taliban.", "title": "US Marines, British troops leaving Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nation-and-world/us-marines-british-troops-leaving-afghanistan", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/NDN-VIDEO-27998042.mov"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=2145092", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=2145092", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "KAY JOHNSON REUTERS", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Nation and World,News, Government, Politics,", "parsely-section": "Nation and World", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-26T08:55:04-07:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "British troops ended their combat operations in Afghanistan on Sunday as they and U.S. Marines handed over two huge adjacent bases to the Afghan military, 13 years after a U.S.-led invasion launched the long and costly war against the Taliban.", "title": "US Marines, British troops leaving Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nation-and-world/us-marines-british-troops-leaving-afghanistan", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/marineafghan.JPG", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/marineafghan.JPG", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-10-26T15:55:04Z"}, "article_summary": "CAMP LEATHERNECK, Afghanistan \u2014 British troops ended their combat operations in Afghanistan on Sunday as they and U.S. Marines handed over two huge adjacent bases to the Afghan military, 13 years after a U.S.-led invasion launched the long and costly war against the Taliban.\nOffices and bulletin boards, which once showed photo tributes to dead American and British soldiers, had been stripped.\nThe U.S. military is leaving behind about $230 million worth of property and equipment \u2014 including a major airstrip at the base, plus roads and buildings \u2014 for the Afghan military.\nTheir departure leaves Afghanistan and its newly installed president, Ashraf Ghani, to deal almost unaided with an emboldened Taliban insurgency after the last foreign combat troops withdraw by year-end.\n\u201cIt\u2019s eerily empty,\u201d said Lt.
