It\u2019s the 50th such affiliation for CVS, the pharmacy chain whose 900 Minute Clinics are also a major provider of retail primary care.\n\nIn the affiliations, CVS is sharing prescription and visit information of assigned patients with the participating providers through electronic health record integration, and offering access to \u201cclinical support, medication counseling, chronic disease monitoring and wellness programs.\u201d\n\n[Also: Walgreens cuts ties with two ACOs]\n\nCVS, which runs 7,800 stores across the country, is one of several retailers entering healthcare along with Walgreens, Walmart and Target. While the others have various models of basic primary care, from Walmart\u2019s branded clinics to Target\u2019s partnerships with Kaiser Permanente, CVS is unique in forging partnerships with hospital systems and pitching both pharmacy data services and access to walk-in consults.\n\nThese programs \u201cenhance access to patient care, improve health outcomes and lower healthcare costs in the communities they serve,\" said Troyen Brennan, MD, CVS Health chief medical officer. \"By integrating our electronic health records and information systems, we will collectively have a more comprehensive view of our patients, which can aid in health care decision making and help ensure patients adhere to important medications for chronic diseases.\"\n\n[Also: See where the Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs are]\n\n\u201cThe fundamental challenge of managing chronic conditions is coordinating and monitoring care when patients are not here in the Rush physician\u2019s office\u201d said Anthony Perry, MD, vice president for ambulatory care and population health at Rush University Medical Center. \u201cOftentimes having patients schedule more frequent visits at Rush is not feasible, but this agreement extends our physicians\u2019 reach through the hundreds of CVS pharmacies and retail clinics in the area.\u201d\n\nIn the CVS affiliations, providers at the health systems receive data on interventions conducted by CVS pharmacists to try to improve medication adherence, and alerts about non-adherence, such as failure to pick up a prescription. Clinicians at the affiliate health system are also able to work with nurse practitioners and physicians assistants at the Minute Clinics.\n\n\u201cFor those patients who do not have regular access to health care, MinuteClinic provides information to help patients in finding a primary care physician and a greater opportunity for continuity of healthcare,\u201d CVS said in a statement. \u201cIf more comprehensive care is needed, patients can follow up with their primary care provider and have access to the services at the medical center as appropriate.\u201d For physicians who are part of the affiliates, like Rush University Medical Center and Tucson Medical Center, CVS digitally shares Minute Clinic visit summaries with primary care providers. Non-affiliated providers receive visit summaries by mail or fax.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cvs-affiliates-rush-tuscon-coordinate-care", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/CVS-Golden-Gate-Theater-wiki-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The pharmacy chain will share prescription and visit information of assigned patients with the participating providers through electronic health record integration.", "title": "CVS affiliates with Rush, Tuscon to coordinate care"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/CVS-Golden-Gate-Theater-wiki-feature.gif"}, "description": "The pharmacy chain will share prescription and visit information of assigned patients with the participating providers through electronic health record integration.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CVS affiliates with Rush, Tuscon to coordinate care"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "CVS Health this week signed two new clinical affiliations, one with Chicago\u2019s Rush University Medical Center and another with Banner Health\u2019s Tucson Medical Center and its ACO Arizona Connected Care.
