Militant tea party Republicans and the supposedly moderate establishment Republicans both want to destroy the Affordable Care Act, for instance, but the former believe shutting down the government is a good way to accomplish that goal, while the latter disagree.\n\nBut we may be seeing the emergence of a genuine, substantive split within the GOP on foreign policy, with a significant faction not only rejecting the most important Republican foreign policy initiative of the last couple of decades (the Iraq War), but formulating ideas that could produce different kinds of decisions in the future.\n\nYou may be thinking, \u201cOh, you\u2019re talking about Rand Paul,\u201d and I am, but it\u2019s not just him. While Paul is eager to tell anyone who\u2019s listening that he\u2019s no isolationist, this week he committed a rather dramatic heresy by saying explicitly that invading Iraq in 2003 was a mistake. \u201cAll the way back to the Iraq War, I think it was a mistake to topple Hussein. Hussein was the bulwark against Iran,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m worried [Iran] is twice as strong as it was before the Iraq War.\u201d\n\nThis is significant for a couple of reasons. First, support for the Iraq War defined Republican foreign policy for a decade, and for someone running a serious candidacy for president to turn his back on it while still trying to win his party\u2019s presidential nomination is remarkable. Second, Paul\u2019s justification involves an acknowledgment that military action can have serious, even catastrophic unintended consequences, something Republicans haven\u2019t been too eager to talk about in recent years. They\u2019re much more likely to present military action as simple and straightforward.\n\nWhile there are plenty of Republicans who will disagree, Paul is not alone. As conservative columnist Matt Lewis wrote: \u201cWhat Paul said about Iraq takes guts. There are surely plenty of Republicans across the country who privately agree with him. But there are many more \u2014 and not just Bush-era neocons \u2014 who will never cop to this publicly.\u201d\n\nLast night, the Daily Caller published an interview with Ted Cruz in which he lays out the \u201cCruz Doctrine.\u201d Its first two points are the same thing everyone always says about foreign interventions \u2014 that they should have a clear objective and be undertaken with overwhelming force. It\u2019s the third point that differs:\n\n\u201cThird, we should get the heck out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the job of the U.S. military to engage in nation building to turn foreign countries into democratic utopias.\u201d Cruz\u2019s foreign policy differs from Rand Paul\u2019s because, among other things, he appears more willing to commit American military might if necessary than the Kentucky senator, such as potentially in Iran. But Cruz sometimes opposes more hawkish senators like John McCain, Lindsey Graham and \u2014 arguably \u2014 Marco Rubio because he doesn\u2019t believe America should use the military to help spread democracy abroad.\n\nWhile the interview didn\u2019t mention George W. Bush, this is a clear rejection of the grandiosity of Bush\u2019s foreign policy, in which we send our military to a foreign country, depose a dictatorial government, and then stay for years to build a democracy. Perhaps Cruz has taken the experience of the flourishing and peaceful nations of Iraq and Afghanistan to heart.\n\nWe should be careful not to overstate the diversity of thought within the GOP. Most Republicans will still say that invading Iraq was a splendid idea (even if it ran into a few bumps along the way and Barack Obama ruined the whole thing), and the idea that democracy-building is a fool\u2019s errand is far from a majority position within the party. And Cruz and Paul, like other Republicans, still favor a good bombing campaign here and there. But I suspect that it isn\u2019t just Iraq that\u2019s causing this kind of rethinking \u2014 it\u2019s Syria and Iran too.\n\nWhile people have taken a variety of positions on Syria, even those most eager for us to intervene will admit that the situation is enormously complex. Even the barest understanding of the civil war makes clear that deposing Bashar al-Assad, brutal dictator and war criminal though he may be, could well lead to chaos and the installation of an Islamist regime no less oppressive. Even the most hawkish Republican wouldn\u2019t be so stupid as to suggest that the application of military force could result in a flowering of Syrian democracy.\n\nAnd on Iran, those who want to reject any possibility of a nuclear deal and start planning the bombing campaign will hurry to emphasize that they don\u2019t want to invade. The military intervention they\u2019d like would be limited to targeting the country\u2019s nuclear facilities \u2014 a finite, if important, goal. Whatever they may actually think, they aren\u2019t going to invoke the image of American soldiers patrolling the streets of Tehran.\n\nIn short, when it comes to the places the next Republican president will be under pressure to invade, things look extremely complicated, with another disaster a real possibility. Some of the candidates are as hawkish as ever, and there\u2019s one who isn\u2019t going to step away from the Bush Doctrine, since his name just happens to be Bush. But in the presidential primaries we could see a real foreign policy debate, not just over which candidate can condemn Barack Obama with the most vehemence, but over what the next Republican president should actually do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A genuine, substantive split on foreign policy is emerging in the GOP.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A genuine, substantive split on foreign policy is emerging in the GOP.", "title": "Will the GOP candidates (other than Jeb) keep the Bush Doctrine at arm\u2019s length?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/29/will-the-gop-candidates-other-than-jeb-keep-the-bush-doctrine-at-arms-length/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2013/07/South_Carolina_2016_image_982w.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/29/will-the-gop-candidates-other-than-jeb-keep-the-bush-doctrine-at-arms-length/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "republicans, iraq war, iraq, isis, ted cruz, jeb bush, george w. bush, bush doctrine,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "republicans, iraq war, iraq, isis, ted cruz, jeb bush, george w. bush, bush doctrine,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d7a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAll the way back to the Iraq War, I think it was a mistake to topple Hussein.\nHussein was the bulwark against Iran,\u201d Paul said.\nSome of the candidates are as hawkish as ever, and there\u2019s one who isn\u2019t going to step away from the Bush Doctrine, since his name just happens to be Bush.\nAnd Cruz and Paul, like other Republicans, still favor a good bombing campaign here and there.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried [Iran] is twice as strong as it was before the Iraq War.\u201dThis is significant for a couple of reasons."}
