211 is now taking appointments for the AARP Tax-Aide program.

This service offers free help with the preparation of Federal and State income tax returns and is available to people of all ages with middle and low income, with special attention to those 60 and older. This program is staffed by IRS-trained and certified local volunteers.

This yearâ€™s income tax filing process is again a little more difficult following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

The process is particularly complex among those who have insurance purchased through the marketplace and may have insurance subsidies through Covered California.

Appointments are available on Mondays 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. starting February 1 through April 13 (please allow two hours for the tax preparation process). Community members who are interested in free tax filing assistance should call 211 to schedule an appointment. No walk-ins will be accepted.
