Photo: Steve Remich for The Wall Street Journal\n\nJoel Pierson has a message for concert hall and theater bookers: Who needs another string quartet, dance troupe or touring Broadway show when you can hire a jazz combo playing music from Bugs Bunny cartoons?\n\nMr. Pierson is the founder and keyboardist of the Queen\u2019s Cartoonists, a six-man New York band that dedicates itself to playing tunes from swing-era animations, along with similarly silly and fast-paced fare from \u201cThe Simpsons, \u201d the Muppets shows, \u201cStar Wars\u201d and more.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019d be a great novelty act,\u201d said Mr. Pierson, speaking shortly before the band launched into a 30-minute Saturday afternoon set designed to showcase and hopefully sell their concept.\n\nThe occasion was the annual conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters (APAP), a winter New York gathering where some 3,600 attendees from the U.S. and more than 30 countries\u2014mostly programmers for theaters and concert halls\u2014come to scope out acts that might help them fill their performance calendars in the seasons ahead.\n\nThe conference, the performing-arts industry\u2019s biggest trade show, concludes Tuesday, with most events taking place at the New York Hilton in Midtown.\n\nENLARGE Tsering Phuntsok creates a sand mandala in the Mystical Arts of Tibet booth.

Now, just about anything goes.\n\nThat \u201canything\u201d ranges from the Red Hot Chilli Pipers, a nine-piece bagpipe ensemble from Scotland who call themselves \u201cthe masters of bagrock,\u201d to Steve Trash, the self-proclaimed \u201crockin\u2019 eco hero\u201d who builds his music and magic-filled show around the theme of garbage.\n\nAlso featured: a Juilliard graduate and Army veteran named Janice Martin who performs as an aerial violinist and Benise, a one-name guitarist who bills his Spanish-themed show as \u201cthe Latin Riverdance.\u201d\n\nSuch hype comes with the territory for APAP hopefuls, said Nate Linegar, a booking agent for Benise: \u201cHis name is Ron and he\u2019s from Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nThe talent roster also includes past TV and film stars who fashion shows recounting their days of glory. Dawn Wells, the one-time starlet who played Mary Ann on the hit series \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island,\u201d for example, offers an evening of memories billed as \u201cWhat Would Mary Ann Do?\u201d\n\nJohn Castonia, Ms. Wells\u2019s booking agent, says the actress is a solid draw on the arts-center circuit: \u201cShe\u2019s 76 and she\u2019s still smoking hot.\u201d\n\nENLARGE A booth at the Association of Performing Arts Presenters conference. Photo: Steve Remich for The Wall Street Journal\n\nLike others in the industry, Mr. Castonia said it isn\u2019t surprising that the performing-arts world has increasingly emphasized popular entertainment and variety acts. With the older crowd of patrons who heavily favored classical music, ballet and traditional theatrical fare now dying off, presenters are trying to court the baby boomers and younger generations.\n\n\u201cThe audience has changed,\u201d Mr. Castonia added.\n\nToday\u2019s patrons have a \u201cmuch broader appetite,\u201d said APAP President Mario Garcia Durham, and they place fewer boundaries on what is considered art.\n\nWhile traditional classical and dance artists are still well represented on the exhibit floors and in the performance showcases, it isn\u2019t unusual to see even dyed-in-the-wool traditionalists venture into novelty-act territory.\n\nWe Want to Hear From You Have something to say about an article in Greater New York?

She says she wrangled so many bookings for her offbeat show, she didn\u2019t have time to attend this year.\n\n\u201cI even got one gig from somebody I met in the bathroom,\u201d she said.",
