College for the next two seasons before completing his final two years of eligibility at Trevecca Nazarene University.\n\nHe takes over a Lady Knight team that will have had its fourth different head coach in four seasons. Sterling Nabours coached the team last year, after Megan Forester led the Lady Knights during the 2013 season. Mike McLaren had been the team\u2019s only head coach through the 2012 season, when he stepped aside and recommended Forester for the job.\n\n\u201cYou want to build some consistency, and having four different coaches in four years hurts a little bit,\u201d Trobaugh said. \u201cBut the girls haven\u2019t really let that take them a step back. They\u2019ve really put in a lot of work, and whoever their coach is, they\u2019re going to give everything they\u2019ve got to that person.\u201d\n\nBefore Trobaugh\u2019s hiring, which was made official last week, PJP II athletic director Alan Mila \u2013 who also coaches the school\u2019s boys soccer program \u2013 was running the Lady Knights\u2019 practices while the hiring process was being completed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been running practices myself,\u201d Mila said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where having knowledge of the sport is helpful, but at the same time, we were trying to get a coach in the position.\u201d\n\nNow that Trobaugh is running the program, his focus is on moving the Lady Knights closer to a berth in the state\u2019s final four. Last year, PJP II\u2019s season ended with a 5-2 loss at Father Ryan in the state quarterfinals. The Lady Knights finished the 2014 campaign with a 7-10-1 record.\n\n\u201cFrom the limited time I\u2019ve had with them, they\u2019re a great group,\u201d Trobaugh said. \u201cThey put in a lot of hard work, and they listen. I\u2019m excited about them and about this year.\u201d\n\nAn aggressive mentality will be the focal point of Trobaugh\u2019s coaching style.\n\n\u201cTo build a good program, you want to be a bit attack-minded,\u201d Trobaugh said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to implement that kind of system where we dominate the tempo of games, create (scoring) chances and be solid defensively. The formation can always change depending on who we\u2019re playing, but the mindset is always to put the other team on their back foot.\u201d\n\nTrobaugh said he would like to try to play against his alma mater at some point as well.\n\n\u201cAt some point, if we can get that set up, I\u2019d like to play (White House),\u201d Trobaugh said. \u201cI came in pretty late, so I didn\u2019t really have much to do with the schedule this year. For me, the way you measure yourself is to play the best teams around, whether it\u2019s Division II teams or public schools. There\u2019s a lot of great competition locally, and I\u2019d like to put the girls up against anybody and see how they compete and hopefully watch them do well.\u201d\n\nSeeing the Lady Knights is Trobaugh\u2019s primary goal.\n\n\u201cI have pretty high expectations,\u201d Trobaugh said. \u201cAs a player, I always wanted to be the best that I could be at whatever I did. Now as a coach, I try to have that same mindset. I want to have the best team out on the field, every time.\u201d\n\nThe Lady Knights are slated to open the regular season on Aug. 18 at St. Cecilia.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1TcihZ9", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "White House High alum is fourth PJP II head coach in four years", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "White House High alum is fourth PJP II head coach in four years", "title": "Trobaugh to lead Lady Knights soccer program", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/sumner/2015/08/10/trobaugh-lead-lady-knights/31397065/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "White House High alum is fourth PJP II head coach in four years", "title": "Trobaugh to lead Lady Knights soccer program", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a9b657c41a766a5ba6b331361d7c2f3e883112f3/c=0-336-1424-1760&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/10/Nashville/B9318372564Z.1_20150810000630_000_G58BIU7VJ.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Pope John Paul II High School, Slidell", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Places/Pope John Paul II High School, Slidell", "title": "Trobaugh to lead Lady Knights soccer program", "author": "Chris Brooks", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/sumner", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cba0fc574b75ce8f473878af552cb340f91667b3/c=0-98-1424-1997/local/-/media/2015/08/10/Nashville/B9318372564Z.1_20150810000630_000_G58BIU7VJ.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/244452007a7246b9e9d204f63dcade165aafe7ca/c=0-336-1424-1760/local/-/media/2015/08/10/Nashville/B9318372564Z.1_20150810000630_000_G58BIU7VJ.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a94d79159da314ead401ccb6257a7d47988b81f1/c=0-514-1424-1582/local/-/media/2015/08/10/Nashville/B9318372564Z.1_20150810000630_000_G58BIU7VJ.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f945482e595a194f5b1534145c89609663a04df/c=0-648-1424-1449&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/10/Nashville/B9318372564Z.1_20150810000630_000_G58BIU7VJ.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-09T23:06:30-05:00", "shorthed": "Trobaugh to lead Lady Knights", "articleid": 31397065, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a9f2eb1ffc959dc3e43de8ae67ce6bd76a55899/c=0-648-1424-1449/local/-/media/2015/08/10/Nashville/B9318372564Z.1_20150810000630_000_G58BIU7VJ.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/28ffabb3125e6bd319daba2962e5e58bc61f1105/c=122-0-1301-2096/local/-/media/2015/08/10/Nashville/B9318372564Z.1_20150810000630_000_G58BIU7VJ.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "PJP II, JPII, Knights, White House, Trobaugh"}, "article_summary": "Zack TrobaughIt took Pope John Paul II High some time to fill its head-coaching vacancy for the girls soccer program, but the Lady Knights have a new leader in Zack Trobaugh.\nSterling Nabours coached the team last year, after Megan Forester led the Lady Knights during the 2013 season.\nThe Lady Knights finished the 2014 campaign with a 7-10-1 record.\nI want to have the best team out on the field, every time.\u201dThe Lady Knights are slated to open the regular season on Aug. 18 at St. Cecilia.\nHe takes over a Lady Knight team that will have had its fourth different head coach in four seasons."}
