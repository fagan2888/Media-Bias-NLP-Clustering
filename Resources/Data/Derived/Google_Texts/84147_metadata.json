(AP) - The Civil War ended 150 years ago in 1865, but there are still several people alive today whose fathers fought in the Confederate Army.\n\nThere was one \u201creal son\u201d of a Confederate veteran living in the Birmingham area as recently as two years ago. Tyus K. Denney, 91, who died March 6, 2013, was the son of Thomas Jefferson Denney, a Confederate soldier. The elder Denney was about 77 when his son was born in 1921.\n\n\u201cI was 13 years old when he died,\u201d Denney told AL.com in 2011 in an interview at his home in Tarrant, where he kept 10 beehives in the backyard to harvest honey. \u201cHe never did talk about the Civil War. He never said nothing about it.\u201d\n\nHis father, Thomas Jefferson Denney, is heavily documented as having fought in the Civil War, as part of Company H in the 31st Alabama Infantry regiment. He was captured by Union forces on June 15, 1864 near Marietta, Ga., and held prisoner at Rock Island Barracks, Illinois, where he signed an oath of allegiance to the United States upon his release on June 18, 1865.\n\nTyus Denney may have been the last living \u201creal son\u201d of a Confederate veteran in Alabama, according to the Sons of Confederate Veterans, an organization made up mostly of descendants several generations further removed from their Confederate ancestors.\n\nTyus Denney\u2019s sister, Vivian Smith, 89, of Cullman, was believed to be the last living \u201creal daughter\u201d of a Confederate veteran in Alabama. She died Jan. 7, 2012.\n\nPeople today marvel and wonder why women of childbearing age were marrying elderly men in the Depression era, said Jim Shackelford, a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.\n\n\u201cIt was hard times,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of these women needed support and these Confederate veterans got a pension, maybe $13 to $20 a month. That was a lot of money in the Depression.\u201d\n\nAlabama and other former Confederate states paid out Confederate pensions as late as the 1950s, Shackelford said. Tom Strain of Athens, a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, said a national database kept by the group listed 48 men in 2011 who were \u201creal sons\u201d of Confederate veterans. In 2001, there were more than 500, he said. By 2012, the list had dwindled down to 18 men and 16 women whose fathers were documented to have been Confederate soldiers.\n\nThe last few on the list have been dying so quickly it\u2019s hard to know exactly how many are left.\n\nLast month, Georgia\u2019s last son of a Confederate soldier died. H.V. Booth, 96, of Elberton, Ga., died June 7. His father, Isham Johnson Booth, was a guard at Camp Sumter, also known as the Andersonville, Ga., Confederate prison camp where nearly 13,000 Union soldiers held as prisoners of war died of disease, starvation and heat.\n\nA woman living in Georgia whose father fought in the Civil War was interviewed last year by National Geographic magazine. At the time, Iris Lee Gay Jordan was one of only 11 surviving daughters of Southern soldiers documented by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. She was nine when her father, Lewis F. Gay, died in 1931.\n\n\u201cMostly, he told stories on Sundays,\u201d she said. \u201cI could sit on the porch and listen to his stories all day.\u201d\n\nShe recalled people visiting from around the county to hear his stories.\n\n\u201cOn Sundays my mother would be in the kitchen cooking a big meal, and there would be people from all over,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was the oldest man in the county, and everybody knew he had been in the War Between the States. They would come and sit on the front porch and ask questions, and he would answer them.\u201d\n\nHer father talked about being held by the Union as a prisoner of war. \u201cMy father said that the men in the North were just like he was,\u201d Iris said. \u201cHe told us, \u2018We were all far away from home, and we all would much rather have been home with our families.\u2019 There was no bitterness on his part at all.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, National Public Radio interviewed Mattie Clyburn Rice, then 88, who is the daughter of a black Confederate soldier, Weary Clyburn, who applied for a Confederate pension in 1926.\n\nThere are sons and daughters of Union soldiers still living too.\n\nNational Geographic\u2019s story last year included an interview with the son of a Union soldier who met President Abraham Lincoln. Fred Upham, 93, is the son of William Upham, who was a private in the Union Army\u2019s Second Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He was severely wounded at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861 and later was personally appointed by President Lincoln to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He shook hands with Lincoln in the White House.\n\nAlabama\u2019s last real son may have been Denney. \u201cTo my understanding, he was the last one, at least that we know of, in Alabama,\u201d said Lane Roper, of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. \u201cThere are very few left in the country.\u201d\n\nWhen Tyus Denney lived in Tarrant, few of his neighbors knew about his connection to the Civil War. Many people knew him for his beehives. He sold jars of honey to people in the neighborhood.\n\nHis father, Thomas Jefferson Denney, was born in 1844, according to the 1900 U.S. Census, so he was about 18 when he enlisted with the Confederate Army in 1862. He was in his seventies when he married his last wife, Dora, a widow.\n\n\u201cShe was in her forties when I was born,\u201d Denney said. Thomas and Dora had three children together before the Civil War veteran died at age 91 in 1934. Tyus\u2019 older brother Wiley died in 1998.\n\nTyus Denney was born May 8, 1921. He was a veteran of World War II, trained as a machine gunner at the end of the war, but he never saw combat. Denney worked for 39 years at the Dolcito Quarry in Tarrant as a heavy equipment operator.\n\nHe kept a picture of himself, around age 10, and his sister, about 8, with his parents. His father, the aging Confederate soldier, wore dark-rimmed glasses, a dark suit jacket and had a bushy white mustache and long wispy beard.\n\nTyus Denney had three daughters, including Rolline Sisson, 71, of Tarrant. She never thought it was odd that her grandfather fought in the Civil War.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just lived with it all my life and didn\u2019t think that much of it,\u201d Sisson said. \u201cA lot of people are amazed. It is amazing.\u201d\n\nIn 1986, the Sons of Confederate Veterans made Tyus Denney a lifetime member, not required to pay dues. He sometimes went to Civil War reenactments. He was a genial character and a cherished novelty, a relic with an intimate connection to a long-ago war that tore apart this country.\n\n\u201cI just watch,\u201d he would say of the re-enactments. \u201cI don\u2019t know nothing about the war.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Civil War ended 150 years ago in 1865, but there are still several people alive today whose fathers fought in the Confederate Army.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/12/are-there-people-alive-whose-dads-fought-in-the-ci/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The Civil War ended 150 years ago in 1865, but there are still several people alive today whose fathers fought in the Confederate Army.", "title": "Are there people alive whose dads fought in the Civil War?"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The Civil War ended 150 years ago in 1865, but there are still several people alive today whose fathers fought in the Confederate Army.", "card": "summary", "title": "Are there people alive whose dads fought in the Civil War?"}, "Author": "GREG GARRISON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "A woman living in Georgia whose father fought in the Civil War was interviewed last year by National Geographic magazine.\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala.
