The CDC estimates two million a year in the U.S. are hit with hospital-acquired infections and 20,000 die. Tomorrow there will be an additional $110 million from the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) fighting to end this nightmare.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) today awarded this funding to 17 national, regional, or state hospital associations and health system organizations to continue efforts in reducing preventable hospital-acquired conditions and readmissions.\n\nOne-third of these infections are considered preventable, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most common nosocomial infections are of the urinary tract, surgical site and various pneumonias.\n\nThrough the Partnership for Patients initiative \u2013 a nationwide public-private collaboration that began in 2011 to reduce preventable hospital-acquired conditions by 40 percent and 30-day readmissions by 20 percent \u2013 the second round of the Hospital Engagement Networks will continue to work to improve patient care in the hospital setting.\n\n\u201cWe have made significant progress in keeping patients safe and we are focused on accelerating improvement efforts through collaboration and reliable implementation of best practices,\u201d said Patrick Conway, M.D., CMS acting principal deputy administrator and chief medical officer.\n\n\u201cThis second round of Hospital Engagement Networks will allow us to continue to improve health care safety across the nation.\u201d\n\nSince the launch of the Partnership for Patients, the vast majority of U.S. hospitals and many other stakeholders have joined the collaborative effort and delivered results.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that 50,000 fewer patients died in hospitals and approximately $12 billion in health care costs were saved as a result of a reduction in hospital-acquired conditions from 2010 to 2013.\n\nNationally, patient safety is improving, resulting in 1.3 million adverse events and infections avoided in hospitals since in that time period. This translates to a 17 percent decline in hospital-acquired conditions over the three-year period.\n\nThe Partnership for Patients and the Hospital Engagement Networks are one part of an overall framework established by the Affordable Care Act to deliver better care, spend dollars more wisely, and improve care.\n\nInitiatives like the Partnership for Patients, Accountable Care Organizations, Quality Improvement Organizations, and others have helped reduce hospital readmissions in Medicare by nearly 8 percent between January 2012 and December 2013 \u2013 translating into 150,000 fewer readmissions \u2013 in addition to the quality improvements mentioned above.\n\nRound two of the Hospital Engagement Networks will continue to work to develop learning collaboratives for hospitals and provide a wide array of initiatives and activities to improve patient safety.\n\nThey will be required to:\n\n> conduct intensive training programs to teach and support hospitals in making patient care safer;\n\n> provide technical assistance to hospitals so that hospitals can achieve quality measurement goals; and\n\n> establish, implement, and improve the system to track and monitor hospital progress in meeting the Partnership for Patients\u2019 quality improvement goals.\n\nThe activities of the Hospital Engagement Networks will be closely monitored by CMS to ensure that they are generating results and improving patient safety.\n\nThe 17 organizations (listed in alphabetical order) receiving contracts in round two of the Hospital Engagement Networks are:\n\n\u00b7 American Hospital Association;\n\n\u00b7 Ascension Health;\n\n\u00b7 Carolinas HealthCare System;\n\n\u00b7 Dignity Health;\n\n\u00b7 Healthcare Association of New York State;\n\n\u00b7 Health Research Education Trust of New Jersey;\n\n\u00b7 Hospital & Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania;\n\n\u00b7 Iowa Healthcare Collaborative;\n\n\u00b7 LifePoint Health;\n\n\u00b7 Michigan Health & Hospital Association Health Foundation;\n\n\u00b7 Minnesota Hospital Association;\n\n\u00b7 Ohio Children\u2019s Hospital Solutions for Patient Safety;\n\n\u00b7 Ohio Hospital Association;\n\n\u00b7 Premier, Inc.;\n\n\u00b7 Tennessee Hospital Association;\n\n\u00b7 VHA-UHC Alliance NewCo Inc.; and\n\n\u00b7 Washington State Hospital Association.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act takes important steps toward a more accessible, affordable, and higher-quality health care system. Today\u2019s announcement is part of a broader effort to transform our health care system into one that works better for the American people. The Administration has a vision of a system that delivers better care, spends our dollars in a smarter way, and puts patients in the center of their care to keep them healthy.\n\nFor a fact sheet on round two of the Hospital Engagement Networks, please visit:\n\nhttp://cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2015-Fact-sheets-items/2015-09-25.html.\n\nFor more information on the Partnership for patients, please visit: partnershipforpatients.cms.gov.\n\nFor more CDC information about Healthcare-associated Infections (HAI) at the CDC.\n\nAdditional CDC Patient Safety Websites:\n\n\u00b7 Antibiotic Resistance\n\n\u00b7 Blood Safety\n\n\u00b7 Dialysis Safety\n\n\u00b7 Get Smart for Healthcare\n\n\u00b7 Hand Hygiene\n\n\u00b7 HICPAC\n\n\u00b7 Injection Safety\n\n\u00b7 Medication Safety\n\n\u00b7 MRSA\n\n\u00b7 National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)\n\n\u00b7 Nursing Homes and Assisted Living\n\n\u00b7 Sepsis\n\n\u00b7 Sharps Safety\n\n\u00b7 Transplant Safety\n\n\u00b7 Vaccine Safety\n\nFollow on and", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sept. 25, 2015 \u2013 There are probably few senior citizens who do not know at least one person who has suffered and, maybe, died from a hospital-acquired infection or other dangerous condition.
