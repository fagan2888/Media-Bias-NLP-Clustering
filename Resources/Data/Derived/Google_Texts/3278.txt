It was a million dollar night tonight for the Bids for Kids charity auction.



Tonight marked the twentieth anniversary of the bids for kids charity auction they are hoping to reach a million dollar mark tonight for charitable donations.



This annual charity event held at the Bayfront Convention Center supports Make-A-Wish, Boys & Girls club and Shriners Children's Hospital...



Last year the event raised one hundred forty thousand dollars in one night and tonight they hope to surpass that goal and reach their milestone of one million dollars since the event began.





" It's really exciting to see such an involved community and diverse community come out to support a cause like this we can all gather around to support one common cause "



We were able to meet the girl who began it all. Eighteen-year old Lydia Stroul was the first make-a-wish child to attend this annual fundraising event. After being diagnosed with leukemia at the age of five, she received her own wish of a cruise vacation with her family.



" It really let me escape my reality have to go and explore in the world is a little kid i learned so much about every thing a lot of opportunity you get by donating"



Now fifteen years later she joined the Make-A-Wish foundation tonight to show her continuous support for those who helped her at the make-a-wish foundation.





" Helping a lot of kids it's so important for the kids to get their wishes going through some hard times"



The event tonight is hoping to raise money to help make other childrens wishes come true just like Lydias.
