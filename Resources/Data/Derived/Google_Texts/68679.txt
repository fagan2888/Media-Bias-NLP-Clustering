Norma Sherman is registered nurse at Christus Hospital Saint Elizabeth.



"I love being around people I've always wanted to be a nurse," Sherman said.

Hospitals need more people like Norma Sherman.

"Nationwide there's certainly a nursing shortage," said Ruthie Robinson. "One thing is the number of baby boomers, it's exploding and generally usually the older one gets the more health care services they require."

Robinson says another reason for the nursing shortage: the affordable care act is leading to more people with insurance seeking health care.

Not only that..

"Many decades ago women were going to be a nurse, a teacher, or a secretary. And that's no longer true you can do anything you want," Robinson said.

Paul Guidroz is the Chief Nursing Executive at Christus Health.



"Certainly there is a nursing shortage," said Paul Guidroz

He says the national turnover rate for acute care RN's is 17.2%.

"We're blessed here at Christus Southeast Texas; our percentage of turnover is 4.9%," said Guidroz.

The national turnover rate is affected by nurses becoming older and leaving acute care for other nursing opportunities, Guidroz says.

The question is if the nursing shortage could affect patient care.

"The ratio of nurses to patients... We support having the appropriate number of staff available for the patients that we have," Guidroz said.

Christus partners with Lamar University to provide hospitals where nurses can train.

A new residency program at Christus and increased pay for those who specialize are aimed at retaining nurses.

"If you love people the way I do, if you want to care for another person, then absolutely become a nurse," Sherman said.
