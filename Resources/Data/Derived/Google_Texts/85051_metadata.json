Instead, she said staff at Philadelphia's Thomas Jefferson University Hospital removed her son\u2019s brain, eyes, and other internal organs were removed during an autopsy without the family\u2019s consent.\n\n\u201cHe was just a loving person. He showed love and he wanted love. I let him down. I feel guilty,\u201d Mary Anderson told MyFoxPhilly. \u201cThey gutted him out. He is just a shell. Part of him,where is it in the garbage or somewhere? Where's he at?\u201d\n\nAlthough Anderson recalls signing the hospital\u2019s autopsy-permission form, she said the fine print was not clear about what would happen with her son\u2019s organs. Anderson\u2019s attorney, Glenn Ellis, also said the hospital staff did not do their job in explaining the condition that her son would be delivered to the undertaker. The hospital\u2019s permission form said nothing about removing organs for educational purposes.\n\n\u201cThey believed, according to the doctor we spoke to, the organs were donated for educational purposes,\u201d Ellis told MyFoxPhilly. \u201cThey were not and after they were done, they disposed them as hazardous waste something completely not consented to by the family.\u201d\n\nDuring a deposition last month, Ellis asked the person who signed the autopsy report, Dr. John Farber: \"After you were done teaching those residents and perhaps any medical students who were present, what happened to the organs?\" According to the transcript, Farber responded \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\"When performing complete autopsies, it is customary for academic medical centers, that are engaged in educating future doctors, to remove and retain organs and tissues for teaching and continued analysis,\" hospital spokeswoman Jackie Kozloski said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mary, vance, anderson, organ, autopsy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A mother is suing Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia for removing her son's organs without her consent.", "title": "Hospital Allegedly Removes Man's Organs During Autopsy Without Family's Consent [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mother-sues-philadelphia-hospital-after-sons-organs-were-allegedly-removed-during-autopsy-without", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/mary-anderson.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A mother is suing Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia for removing her son's organs without her consent.", "title": "Hospital Allegedly Removes Man's Organs During Autopsy Without Family's Consent [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mother-sues-philadelphia-hospital-after-sons-organs-were-allegedly-removed-during-autopsy-without", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/mary-anderson.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/mary-anderson.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-26T12:21:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-26T12:21:58-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A mother is suing Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia for removing her son's organs without her consent."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0230\"", "article_summary": "Instead, she said staff at Philadelphia's Thomas Jefferson University Hospital removed her son\u2019s brain, eyes, and other internal organs were removed during an autopsy without the family\u2019s consent.\n\u201cThey believed, according to the doctor we spoke to, the organs were donated for educational purposes,\u201d Ellis told MyFoxPhilly.\nWhere's he at?\u201dAlthough Anderson recalls signing the hospital\u2019s autopsy-permission form, she said the fine print was not clear about what would happen with her son\u2019s organs.\nI feel guilty,\u201d Mary Anderson told MyFoxPhilly.\nGrieving mother Mary Anderson said all she was trying to do was find out what led to the death of her 51-year-old son, Vance Anderson."}
