About two dozen protesters called the Texas governor and other politicians “bigoted” for their desire to keep Syrian refugees away from the U.S.

The protesters braved chilly weather and held signs up to passing motorists. A few honked in support.

The demonstration came after terrorist attacks on Paris prompted Gov. Greg Abbott to declare that Texas will not accept refugees from Syria. Abbott said he didn’t trust the federal vetting process for refugees and feared a few terrorists could slip through and create “unacceptable peril.”

Several Republican presidential candidates, including real estate mogul Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have expressed similar opinions.

Dallas activist Hadi Jawad said the politicians are “fear-mongering.”

“They are making a political football out of this desperate situation,” he said Saturday.

“I just wanted to do something other than post something on Facebook and say ‘this is sad,’” said Marty Ruggles, 52. “I’m just standing up for love. If I had space, I’d invite a family to move in with me.”

Ruggles and others at the protest said they are Christians and believed turning away refugees was against their values. Some held signs that said “Jesus was a refugee.”

Laurel Moran, 38, and her husband brought their two young children to the protest. She said she that she goes to protests sometimes when she believes there has been a “great injustice.”

“I believe that we have a lot of privilege, and we’re very fortunate to live in a safe place. But it’s basically luck,” she said. “We have good luck, and people who are coming from Syria as refugees are not having very good luck right now. And as human beings, we have to help each other.”
