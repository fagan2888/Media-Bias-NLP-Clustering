Update, 12:20 p.m.: DART spokesman Morgan Lyons said the wreck happened when a car heading north on Second Avenue drove through the railroad crossing as the gates were going down. The train hit the car on the driver’s side.

The driver, who has not been identified, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Lyons said 24 people were on the train. Four reported injuries, but none of them were transported to the hospital.

The train usually travels 35 miles per hour in that area, Lyons said.

“The operator saw the car in the intersection, went into maximum brake mode to stop the train, but it simply wasn’t possible to stop the train at that time,” he said.

Rail service was stopped in the area for over two hours. The scene has now been cleared and the train line is operating normally, Lyons said.
