President Obama PARDON THE INTERRUPTION ... I'm Golfing with ESPN Hosts

Happy time, people ... at least it was for "Pardon the Interruption" hosts Michael Wilbon and Tony Kornheiser yesterday when they snuck in a full round of golf with PRESIDENT OBAMA!The gang all met up at the Congressional Country Club in Bethseda, Maryland yesterday ... along with a White House aide (who completed the 4-some) ... and played the 90-year old course.It's not the first time the Prez hooked up with the PTI gang for some golf -- last year, they played at the course at the Fort Belvoir military base in Virginia.So far, no word on who won.
