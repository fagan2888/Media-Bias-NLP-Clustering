The other parts of the Medicare family\u2014B, C and D\u2014get more attention, but Part A is hardly a wallflower. Perhaps most importantly, it can be used at no charge to help folks with group health insurance to defray some of their health care bills. Thanks to Casey Schwarz of the Medicare Rights Center and Lina Walker at AARP for tutoring sessions on (and I can\u2019t help myself here) the ABCs of Part A.\n\nPart A is also known as the \u201cfree\u201d Medicare benefit. That\u2019s because there are no premiums for people who also are eligible to collect Social Security benefits. This threshold is 40 quarters of work in jobs \u201ccovered\u201d by Social Security, which means jobs where the person has to pay payroll taxes to Social Security. If you don\u2019t have sufficient covered quarters of work, however, the Part A premium is really stiff\u2014up to $407 a month this year. However, if a spouse does not qualify for free Part A on their own earnings record, they usually can still get free Part A if their spouse has the required quarters of covered work\u2014call it a Medicare spousal benefit!\n\nPart A covers stays in hospitals, medically necessary care (not what\u2019s called custodial care) in skilled nursing facilities, hospice and even home health care. There is a $1,260 deductible for each distinct benefit period in a hospital. You can have multiple benefit periods in a year, but each must be separated by at least 60 days without in-patient care. After 60 continuous days in a hospital or 20 in a skilled nursing facility, steep coinsurance fees kick in.\n\nGOT MEDICARE QUESTIONS? Ask Phil Here\n\nThere can be a tricky set of decisions about whether or not to sign up for Medicare if you turn 65 but still have employer group health insurance. People who work for employers with 20 or fewer employees generally have to sign up for Medicare, because the rules say that Medicare becomes the primary payer of covered health insurance expenses for Medicare-eligible employees in such plans. In larger plans, the employer plan remains the primary player, and Medicare becomes the secondary payer if you have it.\n\nFor people who do not need to pay Part A premiums, signing up for this coverage is usually a good idea. The exception is when the employee is in a high-deductible health plan that includes a health savings account that is funded with pre-tax dollars. These plans are not open to anyone taking Medicare, including Part A. In fact, in a bit of regulatory fortune telling that has always amazed me, you are supposed to stop contributing to your HSA six months before you begin Medicare. Anyway, if you have an HSA, you need to consider if Part A is for you. (Note: claiming Social Security benefits also includes mandatory enrollment in Part A, regardless of whether you have continuing employer group coverage or not.)\n\nIf you\u2019re in a group health plan with a larger employer, you generally do not need to sign up for Medicare when you turn 65, although you should talk with your human resources department and, to be extra sage, give Social Security a call as well (it handles Medicare enrollments).\n\nMORE FROM MAKING SEN$E\n\nThe big gotcha here, which many people don\u2019t have a clue about, is that your employer plan\u2019s prescription drug coverage must be at least as good as what you could get from a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. If it\u2019s not, you could be required to enroll in a Part D plan or face steep premium surcharges when you finally do enroll in a Part D plan after your group health plan coverage ends. Realistically, if your drug coverage was this bad, you might well be better off dropping out of your employer plan and moving totally onto Medicare.\n\nIf you do sign up for Part A, and it is the secondary payer, it can help you with some of the hospital expenses your private insurer does not cover. You still need to pay your Part A deductible for each applicable benefit period, and Part A will only help you with expenses that do not exceed Medicare-approved limits for covered provider procedures.\n\nFor example, if a hospital charged you $1,000 for a procedure and you had a 20 percent co-pay, Part A could pay the $200 difference (assuming you had already paid the $1,260 deductible). But if the Medicare-approved limit for this procedure was only $900, than Part A would pay you only $100 and you\u2019d be on the hook for another $100. As with nearly everything about Medicare, you need to do your homework here, and if you are dealing with an elective procedure, you should do it before you go into the hospital or other covered care facility.\n\nHowever, with hospital expenses quickly soaring into enormous sums after even a short stay, the odds are that Part A can really come in handy as the secondary payer should you encounter a health issue that requires hospitalization.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Part A Medicare gets less attention, but it plays an important role in hospital, nursing and home health care.", "pubdate": 20150617, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Part A Medicare gets less attention, but it plays an important role in hospital, nursing and home health care.", "title": "Don\u2019t overlook the benefits of 'free' Part A Medicare coverage", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4111061387_7c4e116fab_o.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/dont-overlook-benefits-free-part-medicare-coverage/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Part A Medicare gets less attention, but it plays an important role in hospital, nursing and home health care.", "title": "Don\u2019t overlook the benefits of 'free' Part A Medicare coverage", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4111061387_7c4e116fab_o.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "medicare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Making Sen$e, medicare"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s because there are no premiums for people who also are eligible to collect Social Security benefits.\nThis threshold is 40 quarters of work in jobs \u201ccovered\u201d by Social Security, which means jobs where the person has to pay payroll taxes to Social Security.\n(Note: claiming Social Security benefits also includes mandatory enrollment in Part A, regardless of whether you have continuing employer group coverage or not.)\nPerhaps most importantly, it can be used at no charge to help folks with group health insurance to defray some of their health care bills.\nIn larger plans, the employer plan remains the primary player, and Medicare becomes the secondary payer if you have it."}
