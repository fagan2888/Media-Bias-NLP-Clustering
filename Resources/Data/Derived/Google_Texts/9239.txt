Should Hillary Run in 2016? Vote Now

Despite sky-high name recognition, a best-selling book and a weak Democratic presidential field, most Democrats just aren't that excited about Hillary Clinton at the moment.While a solid majority dutifully say they'll support the former first lady and secretary of state if she wins their party's presidential nomination, only a minority are excited about that prospect, a poll released Sunday revealed. The CNN/ORC International poll found that 63 percent of Democrats and independents who lean toward the party said they'd most likely support Clinton as the nominee."Clinton remains the prohibitive front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, but there are signs that rank-and-file Democrats may be willing to consider other candidates," said CNN polling director Keating Holland."There are big differences between liberal and moderate Democrats that indicate that a primary challenger who runs to the right of Clinton may get more traction than a progressive challenger would," adds Holland."Fifty percent of liberal Democrats say they would be enthusiastic about Clinton winning the nomination, but only 36 percent of moderate Democrats feel the same way."Overall, only 41 percent of Democrats said they're "enthusiastic" if Clinton wins the nomination while 42 percent said they'd be satisfied with her nomination. One in 10 said they'd be dissatisfied, and 5 percent said they'd be upset.The survey was conducted for CNN by ORC International May 29-June 1, with 1,003 adults nationwide, including 481 Democrats and independents who lean towards the party, and 452 Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP, questioned by telephone.
