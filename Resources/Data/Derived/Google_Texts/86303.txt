Adam Bell is our choice for Democrats voting in the 3rd Congressional District primary.

Bell, 38, who owns a title company in Allen, is a political newcomer, and his understanding of some of the nuances at play in major policy disputes is still developing. But Bell offers a pragmatic approach to working with Republicans, a plus in both this fall’s contested general election and in Congress, should he win the seat now occupied by Rep. Sam Johnson.

He and his opponent, tech executive Michael Filak, 59, share many of the same views. They both urge a higher minimum wage, oppose cuts to Social Security and believe climate change is a serious threat to Texas. They support President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievements, Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms.

But Bell stands out in part because of his willingness to challenge his party’s orthodoxy. For instance, he says small bankers he works with have convinced him that Dodd-Frank reforms have fallen too heavily on small lenders. He’d like to work with Republicans to change that.

He also cites rising premiums as one unintended consequence of Obamacare, and is open to building on that law to rein in the cost of care.

Filak cites his global perspective as a game-changer, but we aren’t convinced his two years in Thailand make the difference in this race. Still, his campaign has shown energy and his positions are thoughtful. But Bell is the superior choice.
