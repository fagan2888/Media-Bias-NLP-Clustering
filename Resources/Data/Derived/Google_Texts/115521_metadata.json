leaders in North Korea, Iran and other authoritarian states to increase the grip on the Internet, one of the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s five members warned on Wednesday.\n\nAjit Pai, one of the two Republicans on the FCC, told a tech industry event on Capitol Hill that other countries are likely to take cues from increasing regulatory control of Web access in the U.S.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf in the United States we adopt regulations that assert more government control over how the Internet operates ... it becomes a lot more difficult for us to go on the international stage and tell governments: \u2018Look, we want you to keep your hands off the internet,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEven if the ideas aren\u2019t completely identical, you can appreciate the optical difficult in trying to make that case,\" he added.\n\nThe attack comes as part of a broader case Pai is making against the new net neutrality rules, which would regulate not just the \u201clast mile\u201d of Internet access \u2014 which occurs between an individual Web user and their service provider such as Comcast or Time Warner Cable \u2014 but would also give the FCC new powers to police how companies transfer traffic on the back-end of the Internet.\n\nPai has said that the new plan recently unveiled by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler \u201cmarks a monumental shift toward government control of the Internet.\u201d\n\nIn the background, meanwhile, countries such as North Korea and Cuba are trying to exact more control of the Internet through an arm of the United Nations called the International Telecommunication Union, he warned.\n\nNations such as Turkey and China are also enacting new controls in their own countries and \u201ctesting the waters to see how much they can get away with,\u201d Pai said.\n\n\u201cI think the U.S.-based system of Internet governance has served us very well and I hope we don\u2019t do anything to jeopardize that in the near future.\u201d\n\nWheeler and supporters of the new plan have contested Pai\u2019s characterization and reiterated that the rules govern Internet service providers, not the Internet itself.\n\n\u201cChairman Wheeler\u2019s proposed open Internet rules strengthen core democratic values online,\u201d an FCC spokesman told The Hill in an email. \u201cThe proposal prevents cable and wireless companies who provide access to the Internet from acting as gatekeepers, ensuring the Internet remains an open platform for free speech and expression for all Americans.\u201d\n\n\u2014Updated at 6:08 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "U.S. rules make it \"a lot more difficult\" to scold other countries how to behave, one FCC member said.",
