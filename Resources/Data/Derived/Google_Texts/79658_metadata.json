The more lenient sentence, however, amounts to what many still consider cruel and unusual punishment for exercising non-violent speech; the writer now faces eight years in prison and 800 lashes over 16 sessions.\n\nAshraf Fayadh\u2019s troubles with the Saudi government began after he had a personal dispute with an individual in the southwestern city of Abha in 2013. That person, Shaheen bin Ali Abu Mismar, reported him to authorities, alleging \u201che was cursing against Allah and the prophet Muhammad, insulting Saudi Arabia and distributing a book ofhis poems that promoted atheism,\u201d the Guardian explained. Fayadh\u2019s book was filled with love poems that describe his experience as a refugee from Palestine.\n\nHe was also accused of having photographs on his phone of women he met at an art show. Fayadh was detained by the country\u2019s religious police, the mutaween, and released after a day. He was arrested again on January 1, 2014, and detained for 27 days before being transferred to a local prison.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nFayadh was charged with apostasy, but some of his supporters believe the charges were an act of revenge by the country\u2019s religious police because he posted a video of a public flogging online.\n\nRegardless of the government\u2019s motivation, in May 2014, Fayadh was sentenced to four years in prison, as well as 800 lashes, by a general court in Abha.\n\nIn November 2015, however, a new panel of Saudi judges rejected his appeal and inflicted a harsher punishment: death by beheading. The court ruled his repentance was not enough to prevent execution. After hearing the news, Fayadh\u2019s father suffered a stroke, and Fayadh was barred from seeing him before he died last month. He was not allowed to attend the funeral.\n\nThe decision to kill Fayadh sparked worldwide outrage, and countless artists and organizations renounced the sentence. In an appeal issued last month, Fayadh\u2019s lawyer, Abdulrahman al-Lahem, argued the charges against him were based on \u201cuncorroborated allegations\u201d from Abu Mismar, also noting the court had failed to acknowledge that Fayadh suffers from a mental illness. Further, Lahem maintained he had been denied a fair trial.\n\nThe Guardian summarized Lahem\u2019s appeal, which a panel of judges heard in court on Tuesday:\n\n\u201cIn documents considered by the panel of judges on Tuesday, Lahem argued that Fayadh\u2019s initial arrest in 2013 was unlawful as it was not ordered by the state prosecution service. The allegation of apostasy made by Shaheen bin Ali Abu Mismar, who is alleged to have had a personal dispute with the poet, was not corroborated by other evidence, which goes against the principles of sharia law, he argued.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this appeal, the court ruled this week to rescind his death sentence in favor of eight years in prison and 800 lashes. Though Lahem posted on Twitter that the punishment had changed, he also noted that Fayadh\u2019s apostasy conviction was upheld.\n\nThe Saudi \u2018justice\u2019 system continues to execute individuals at an alarming rate, earning a designation from Amnesty International as one of \u201cthe most prolific executioners in the world.\u201d Numerous individuals have been sentenced to death for criticizing the government and allegedly insulting Islam. In 2015, the governmentexecuted 157 people, the highest number in two decades.\n\nIn Fayadh\u2019s case, critics have pointed out the inhumanity of subjecting a writer to 800 lashes and prison time for the simple act of penning poems about love and hardship, and allegedly insulting Islam \u2014 a charge Lahem maintains is based on lies.\n\nAdam Coogle, an investigator at Human Rights Watch, did not necessarily view the change in Fayadh\u2019s sentence as a victory. \u201cInstead of beheading Ashraf Fayadh,\u201d he said, \u201ca Saudi court has ordered a lengthy imprisonment and flogging. No one should face arrest for peacefully expressing opinions, much less corporal punishment and prison. Saudi justice officials must urgently intervene to vacate this unjust sentence.\u201d\n\nAuthor Irvine Welsh was more candid: \u201cWhen this twisted barbarism is thought of as a compromise, it\u2019s way past time western governments stopped dealing with this pervert regime,\u201d he said, possibly referring to ties between the Saudi monarchy and the United States and British governments \u2014 in spite of the Saudis\u2019 ongoing human rights abuses, both domestically and in foreign bombing campaigns.\n\nJo Glanville, director of English PEN, a literary organization that appealed for Fayadh\u2019s release, expressed cautious comfort at the court\u2019s ruling on Tuesday, but insisted the battle is not over:\n\n\u201cIt is a relief that Ashraf Fayadh no longer faces execution, but this is a wholly disproportionate and shocking sentence. It will cause dismay around the world for all Ashraf\u2019s many supporters,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe charges against him should have been dropped and he should be a free man today. We will continue to campaign for his release.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Saudi \u2018justice\u2019 system continues to execute individuals at an alarming rate, earning a designation from Amnesty International as one of \u201cthe most prolific executioners in the world.\u201d , Ashraf Fayadh, beheading, lashes, Saudi Arabia,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Carey Wedler | AntiMedia", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The Saudi \u2018justice\u2019 system continues to execute individuals at an alarming rate, earning a designation from Amnesty International as one of \u201cthe most prolific executioners in the world.\u201d , Ashraf Fayadh, beheading, lashes, Saudi Arabia,", "title": "Saudi Arabia Reduces Poet's Sentence From Beheading To 800 Lashes", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/213472-2/213472/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/48338271.cached.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-05T10:44:54-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Saudi \u2018justice\u2019 system continues to execute individuals at an alarming rate, earning a designation from Amnesty International as one of \u201cthe most prolific executioners in the world.\u201d , Ashraf Fayadh, beheading, lashes, Saudi Arabia,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/saudi-arabias-tight-knit-art-scene-is-horrified-by-the-death-sentence-given-to-poet-asher-fayadh-body-image-1448900289-size_1000.jpg", "title": "Saudi Arabia Reduces Poet's Sentence From Beheading To 800 Lashes", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Saudi Arabia", "published_time": "2016-02-06T05:00:22-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-05T10:44:54-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Adam Coogle, an investigator at Human Rights Watch, did not necessarily view the change in Fayadh\u2019s sentence as a victory.\n\u201cInstead of beheading Ashraf Fayadh,\u201d he said, \u201ca Saudi court has ordered a lengthy imprisonment and flogging.\nRegardless of the government\u2019s motivation, in May 2014, Fayadh was sentenced to four years in prison, as well as 800 lashes, by a general court in Abha.\nThe more lenient sentence, however, amounts to what many still consider cruel and unusual punishment for exercising non-violent speech; the writer now faces eight years in prison and 800 lashes over 16 sessions.\nIn November 2015, however, a new panel of Saudi judges rejected his appeal and inflicted a harsher punishment: death by beheading."}
