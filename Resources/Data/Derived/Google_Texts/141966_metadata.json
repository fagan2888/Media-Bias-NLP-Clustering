Health experts say that waist training isn\u2019t effective, or even entirely safe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to make you look slimmer when you have it on, but I don\u2019t know any physiology that would explain that you\u2019re going to lose body fat by wearing this device,\u201d Stephen Ball, associate professor in the department of nutrition and exercise physiology at the University of Missouri, told TODAY.com. \u201cPeople want a quick fix. They don\u2019t want to put in the effort that it actually takes and so I\u2019m sure lots of women will see these pictures and go out and spend their money on these types of devices when they should be focusing on exercise and healthy eating.\u201d\n\nCorsets have been used throughout history to induce form-fitting beauty standards. Also known as tightlacing, the practice diminishes the volume of the lungs, making it more difficult for the tightlacer to breathe. In addition, tightlacing can change rib structure as well as the position of organs such as the liver, which is pressed upward. It was particularly popular during the Victorian era, but has since lost its appeal in general fashion. But the practice has reemerged in recent years among celebrities like Jessica Alba, who used a corset to help her keep her shape after giving birth. There\u2019s also something called the \u201cCorset Diet,\u201d which essentially squeezes your stomach to the point that makes it painful to eat too much \u2014 and painful to breathe, and probably to move, as well.\n\n\u201cWaist training would be more aptly named \u2018waste training,\u2019 because you are training yourself to waste time and money,\u201d Jeff Halevy, TODAY Show fitness correspondent, said. \u201cThe notion of an external brace or corset reshaping your midsection is pure pseudoscience. While it is possible to elongate or stretch a body part over years, as some African tribes have proven with their customs, it is not at all possible to do the same to the trunk of the body \u2014 especially after coming into adulthood, when the torso\u2019s bones, tissues, and organs have grown to maturity.\u201d\n\nSo before spending money on a corset because Kim Kardashian got one, choose the safer and healthier route instead: diet and exercise.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tightlacing, waist-training, kim kardashian", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Kim Kardashian posted an Instagram selfie wearing a corset, depicting her latest attempt to lose weight after childbirth.", "title": "Kim Kardashian\u2019s \u2018Waist Training\u2019 Might Just Be A Waste Of Time", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kim-kardashian-trying-shrink-her-waist-size-corsets-why-tightlacing-ineffective-and-unsafe-299466", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/27/kim-kardashian-waist-train.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kim Kardashian posted an Instagram selfie wearing a corset, depicting her latest attempt to lose weight after childbirth.", "title": "Kim Kardashian\u2019s \u2018Waist Training\u2019 Might Just Be A Waste Of Time", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kim-kardashian-trying-shrink-her-waist-size-corsets-why-tightlacing-ineffective-and-unsafe-299466", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/27/kim-kardashian-waist-train.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/27/kim-kardashian-waist-train.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-23T14:22:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-27T10:37:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Kim Kardashian posted an Instagram selfie wearing a corset, depicting her latest attempt to lose weight after childbirth."}, "article_summary": "Kim Kardashian\u2019s attempts to get skinnier after having a child might be inspiring to some, but in reality, waist training isn\u2019t probably the best way to go about toning your figure.\nHealth experts say that waist training isn\u2019t effective, or even entirely safe.\n\u201cWaist training would be more aptly named \u2018waste training,\u2019 because you are training yourself to waste time and money,\u201d Jeff Halevy, TODAY Show fitness correspondent, said.\nAlso known as tightlacing, the practice diminishes the volume of the lungs, making it more difficult for the tightlacer to breathe.\nIn the caption, she writes: \u201c#Hourglass #WaistTraining #NoPhotoshopNecessary.\u201d The corset she\u2019s wearing reportedly costs $139, and was made by a company that claims a \u201cpotential waist reduction\u201d of seven inches."}
