The Bible Continues\u201d fuses the biblical epic with the current rage for taut political dramas - \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d in sandals.\n\nThe first of the 12 episodes airs at 9 p.m. EDT Easter, picking up where its predecessor, the wildly popular \u201cThe Bible\u201d series from the History Channel left off and going on to tell the story of what happened to Christ\u2019s disciples after the crucifixion.\n\nIt is choosing this time period that makes \u201cA.D.\u201d such a departure from past Bible stories, most of which end with the resurrection.\n\nHere, it is just a beginning and a rough one as well, with an anguished Mother Mary (played by Greta Scacchi) watching her son die on the cross while the terrified apostles fear the rage of the crowd and try to distance themselves from their leader.\n\n\u201cThe decade following the crucifixion, from the perspective of the Apostles, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times,\u201d creator Mark Burnett, whose credits include \u201cSurvivor,\u201d \u201dThe Bible\u201d and \u201cShark Tank,\u201d told The Associated Press from his home in Malibu. \u201cEvery day, they thought they could be killed.\u201d\n\nHe and his co-producer and wife, Roma Downey, actress and former star of CBS\u2019 \u201cTouched By an Angel,\u201d touched a chord with the original Bible series that debuted in 2013 on the History channel to 13 million viewers, prompting NBC pick up their plans to craft a sequel for network television.\n\nThis new series, however, goes for a more gritty and human approach that tries to understand the characters as humans caught up in the politics of the day. Only about half of the material comes from the Bible, with the rest from historians of the period.\n\n\u201cIf anyone comes to it expecting to see only the Bible, they will be interested to see that we have created a much larger and historic and political contest to set that story in,\u201d said Downey, as she took a lunch break during the filming outside the grandiose set that represents Pontius Pilate\u2019s Roman palace in Morocco.\n\n\u201cI think what it does it allows you to have a fuller understanding of that story because when you see the oppression of the times that they are living in, when you understand that danger lurks in every alley, and the inhumanity of the times,\u201d she said.\n\nThe original series took advantage of existing sets in Ouarzazate, Morocco which has hosted Bible-themed films for decades, but this time around, show creators decided to build their own highly detailed sets in the middle of the rolling desert hills outside of the city.\n\nWorkmen created the streets and shops of ancient Jerusalem and Damascus as well as the sumptuous confines of Pilate\u2019s palace - an investment into future seasons of the show. Downey points out that with the Bible as source material, the show could go on for quite some time.\n\nThe attempt for a more realistic approach to the period extends to the characters.\n\nPilate, played by the icy blue-eyed Vincent Regan (\u201c300,\u201d \u201dTroy,\u201d \u201dClash of the Titans\u201d) is the Roman governor of an occupation that is only tenuously in control of a land. He has to juggle between competing factions and somehow keep the peace.\n\nForever tarnished with the stigma of washing his hands at Christ\u2019s death, Pilate\u2019s decision to allow the execution in the series makes a certain degree of sense.\n\n\u201cWhen Jesus was killed, there were over a million people in the city at the time (for Passover). As far as he was concerned, he was faced with a no-win situation: He either crucifies this one guy or all hell breaks loose and there would be rioting,\u201d said Regan, resplendent in his costume of Roman armor.\n\nPilate not only has to contend with the city\u2019s competing factions but his own wife Claudia (Joanne Whaley, Willow), whose sleep is troubled by visions of Christ and opposes her husband\u2019s increasingly desperate efforts to crack down on the apostles.\n\nIn their tense exchanges, he finds himself having to angrily justify his actions to her - \u201cthe man was a danger to the status quo\u201d - as he tries to govern restive outpost of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe series has several strong female roles in it, including Leah, the ambitious wife of High Priest Caiaphas (Richard Coyle), who pushes her husband to amass more power.\n\nThe role of Mary Magdalene is also central. While she doesn\u2019t quite attain the status of head of the nascent church given her by Dan Brown\u2019s \u201cThe Da Vinci Code,\u201d she is clearly one of the key members of the group as it tries to figure what comes next after the crucifixion.\n\n\u201cOur interpretation is that while many organizations are fronted by men, women were the ones that kept the cogs moving,\u201d said Chipo Chung, the actress that plays Mary and has appeared previously in \u201cDoctor Who\u201d and \u201cSherlock.\u201d\n\nWhen the disciples begin to lose faith and talk of fleeing it is Mary Magdalene and Mother Mary herself that hold fast and shame them into keeping faith. \u201cShe stuck through it when all the guys faltered,\u201d said Chung.\n\nThe show is an ambitious attempt to bring in not just the millions that flocked to the original \u201cBible\u201d series but also those attracted to tense political thrillers.\n\n\u201cThis is not Sunday school,\u201d said Downey. \u201cThis is Sunday night drama.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nEntertainment writer David Bauder contributed to this report from Malibu, California.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The people are restive, the priesthood is scheming and a fanatic band of insurgents known as the zealots are plotting assassinations - and now to make matters worse, the body of a condemned cult-leader known as Jesus has disappeared from the tomb, apparently following some ancient prophecy.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The people are restive, the priesthood is scheming and a fanatic band of insurgents known as the zealots are plotting assassinations - and now to make matters worse, the body of a condemned cult-leader known as Jesus has disappeared from the tomb, apparently following some ancient prophecy.", "title": "\u2018A.D.
