The doctor is in.

Baltimore pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson announced Tuesday that he has filed paperwork to launch an exploratory committee to investigate a run for the 2016 Republican nomination for President.

The surgeon, who railed against Obamacare at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week — and placed fourth in the activists' straw poll — also fired up a new website, bencarson.com, to promote his potential candidacy.

"In every aspect of Dr. Carson's life, he has exemplified true leadership. Overcoming dire poverty in his youth to become head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Carson is uniquely situated to understand the needs and hopes of all Americans," Terry Giles, Carson's longtime friend and "prospective campaign manager," said in a release.

Carson, 63, has attracted Tea Party loyalists with his message about lessening government dependency and slashing the national debt.
