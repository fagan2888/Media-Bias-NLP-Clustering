“The hyper-politicized debate about Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been often more about ideology than data,” says former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton during a Feb. 26 keynote presentation to thousands of attendees at the 2014 Health Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) in Orlando, Florida. Clinton called for a return to an evidence-based policy debate to fix the healthcare system to benefit Americans. Healthcare faces major obstacles as policymakers look to open access to healthcare, simultaneously reduce costs, and improve quality and outcomes, Clinton says.
