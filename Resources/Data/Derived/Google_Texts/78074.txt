Toyota will expand its southwestern Indiana assembly plant again, adding 300 jobs by 2016.

The Japanese automaker said the $100 million expansion of its Princeton plant will allow it to boost production of the Highlander midsize sport utility vehicle.

Sales of the SUV have taken off since Toyota began producing the Highlander in Indiana last year. From January through July 2014, Toyota sold about 90,000 Highlanders, an increase of 16 percent over the same period the previous year, the company said.

The latest expansion will bring Toyota Indiana’s overall investment to $4 billion and increase employment at the plant to about 5,000 people.

“The Highlander has been a great product for our plant,” said Toyota Indiana President Norm Bafunno. SUVs from the plant not only supply U.S. markets but are exported to Australia, New Zealand and Eastern Europe.

The Indiana Economic Development Corp. offered Toyota up to $350,000 in training grants based on the company’s job creation plans. Gibson County also is expected to grant property tax abatement or other economic incentives.

“Hoosier-built products like the Toyota Highlander are known around the world for their precision and quality,” Gov. Mike Pence said in a statement. “And with suppliers in all corners of the state, Toyota is helping to strengthen and grow Indiana’s economy.”

Toyota opened the Princeton plant in 1996. It’s one of four U.S. auto plants for the Japanese company, including one in Georgetown, Ky.
