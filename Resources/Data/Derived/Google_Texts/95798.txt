People would not need a state-issued permit to carry a concealed gun in a purse, briefcase or other fully enclosed satchel, under a bill that's now passed the House and Senate.

The bill now goes to Gov. Phil Bryant, who is expected to sign it into law.

The bill would reduce fees for people to receive and renew a concealed-carry permit.

It also specifies that disabled veterans, people on active-duty military service and current or honorably retired law enforcement officers don't need a permit to carry a concealed gun.
