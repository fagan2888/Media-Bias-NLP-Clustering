Today’s edition of quick hits:

* It’s incredible the officer survived this shooting : “A man who shot and wounded a Philadelphia police officer sitting in a patrol car told investigators that he did it in the name of Islam and the Islamic State, police officials said Friday, adding that the gunman gave no indication that he was part of a broader conspiracy.”

Wasting no time : “President Barack Obama notified Congress on Friday that he has vetoed their legislation to repeal huge parts of the Affordable Care Act, because of course he did.”

Mexico : “Infamous drug kingpin Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman, who humiliated authorities when he tunneled out of a maximum-security prison in July, has been captured, Mexico’s president said Friday.”

LePage : “Maine’s tough-talking governor admitted he made a ‘mistake’ and apologized Friday for making what has been widely condemned as a racist remark at a town hall meeting. But Gov. Paul LePage insisted he was being unfairly pilloried for ‘one slip-up.’”

Wall Street : “U.S. stocks ended one of their worst opening weeks in history with another sharp decline on Friday, as concerns about sagging energy prices overwhelmed early optimism about stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs numbers and a stabilization of Chinese markets.”

Quakes : “Oklahoma was rocked Wednesday night by two of the state’s largest earthquakes in recent years, further fueling scientists’ concern that the continued burial of oil and gas wastes in seismically active areas was courting a much more powerful earthquake.”

* Wages: “Just before the new year began, Doug Short posted his monthly take on both nominal and inflation-adjusted median household income. The November number is the best since the Great Recession began but still falls short of where it was in January 2008 and the peak in January 2002.”

* It’s worth keeping an eye on this : “Some Democrats are signaling they may be ready to work on a compromise with Republicans on legislation authorizing the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.”

* One of the week’s unintentionally funny stories: “Lobbyists who have sex with a Missouri lawmaker or a member of a lawmaker’s staff would have to disclose it to the Missouri Ethics Commission under a bill introduced Wednesday in the Missouri House. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Bart Korman, a Montgomery County Republican, defines sex between lobbyists and legislators as a gift. As such, sexual relations would have to be included on monthly lobbyist gift disclosure forms.”
