Talks are underway at Mount St. Mary's and have just begun at Kenmore.\n\nGiambini said that as the health care industry moves toward reducing hospitalizations and readmissions, more staffing will allow nurses to spend more time with patients, resulting in better overall quality of care.\n\n\u201cIf nurses have less patients to care for, you\u2019re going to increase the quality of care,\" she said. \"You\u2019re going to decrease admissions, you\u2019re going to decrease mistakes, you\u2019re going to decrease hospital acquired infections, which always makes everything more costly.\u201d\n\nThe health system doesn\u2019t see it that way.\n\nStrapped for cash and evolving to changes in health care delivery, Catholic Health says it simply cannot afford additional staffing.\n\n\u201cHealth care is in the midst of tremendous changes due to the Affordable Care Act and other healthcare reform,\u201d the health system said in a statement. \u201cLike other healthcare employers, Catholic Health is grappling with millions of dollars in reimbursement cuts and other changes in health care delivery, as we continue to pursue a fair contract for our registered nurses at St. Joseph Campus. For Catholic Health, these cuts will total more than $330 million over the next 10 years.\u201d\n\nBut the union claims that making a monetary commitment to staffing will help mitigate costs in the future.\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll realize that the cost up front to hire the nurses might initially be a cost incurred by the hospitals, but at the end they\u2019ll end up just saving a ton of money and people would be healthier and have a better quality of life,\u201d Gambini said.\n\nStaffing has also been on the forefront for the New York State Nurses Association, the state\u2019s largest registered nurses union, which has made the issue the focal point of its negotiations.\n\nDuring the most recent legislative session, NYSNA and the CWA unsuccessfully pushed lawmakers to approve a \u201csafe staffing\u201d bill that would require hospitals to keep a minimum number of nurses on staff at all times and set mandatory nurse-to-patient ratios.\n\nThough the two sides remain far apart, and Catholic Health has accused the union of \u201cexhibiting a pattern of bad-faith bargaining,\u201d a strike has not been discussed.\n\n\u201cWe always tell our members, a strike is literally the last resort, Gambini said. \"You have no other avenues ... It's not good for the company and it\u2019s very stressful for the workers.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Politico PRO", "description": "<p>ALBANY - About 220 registered nurses at Sisters of Charity Hospital, St. Joseph Campus, in Cheektowaga have been working without a contract since the end of August as their union continues negotiations with Catholic Health System.</p>", "title": "Contract talks continuing with nurses at Buffalo-area hospitals", "url": "http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2015/10/contract-talks-continuing-with-nurses-at-buffalo-area-hospitals-026402", "image": "http://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a%20-%20MtStMarys.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "<p>ALBANY - About 220 registered nurses at Sisters of Charity Hospital, St. Joseph Campus, in Cheektowaga have been working without a contract since the end of August as their union continues negotiations with Catholic Health System.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| Twitter Contract talks continuing with nurses at Buffalo-area hospitalsALBANY \u2014 About 220 registered nurses at Sisters of Charity Hospital, St. Joseph Campus, in Cheektowaga have been working without a contract since the end of August as their union continues negotiations with Catholic Health System.\nStrapped for cash and evolving to changes in health care delivery, Catholic Health says it simply cannot afford additional staffing.\nStaffing has also been on the forefront for the New York State Nurses Association, the state\u2019s largest registered nurses union, which has made the issue the focal point of its negotiations.\n\u201cHealth care is in the midst of tremendous changes due to the Affordable Care Act and other healthcare reform,\u201d the health system said in a statement.\n\u201cIf nurses have less patients to care for, you\u2019re going to increase the quality of care,\" she said."}
