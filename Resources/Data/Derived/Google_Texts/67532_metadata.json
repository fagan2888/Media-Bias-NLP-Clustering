Solving it, however, apparently is not so simple.\n\nThe trouble is Clarke has a double first name. The combination of \u201cMary\u201d and \u201cRuth\u201d is considered her first name \u2014 Margaret is her middle name \u2014 and that somehow has flummoxed government computers. She has been told her identity could not be confirmed.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have a solution \u2014 they just told me what the problem was,\u201d she said. \u201cI was very excited about the promise of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nClarke\u2019s income fluctuates, and smaller premiums would come in handy during lean years. She\u2019s been self-employed and obtained her own insurance over the past 30 years.\n\nClarke\u2019s case was brought to the attention of MarketWatch, after which Department of Health and Human Services officials were contacted to see if they could make sense of the matter. An HHS spokesman said Clarke\u2019s name and her particulars needed to be confirmed through the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe 54-year-old Clarke says she\u2019s had a Social Security number for many years and presented her identification to so-called navigators during four visits to local sign-up centers. But according to the HHS spokesman, identities are verified through means other than in-person visits.\n\n\u201cI have no insurance at this point,\u201d Clarke reports. \u201cI canceled my Blue Cross/Blue Shield.\u201d\n\nAfter Clarke was put together with HHS officials via MarketWatch, the issue still was not resolved. Clarke says that after she explained her situation to a woman at the HHS offices, the aide ultimately could only encourage her to reapply next year.\n\nBecause Clarke had a lean year in 2013, she\u2019s also applying for Medicaid. She says the HHS officer didn\u2019t know initially that Medicaid had been expanded and told her she was ineligible. Then the HHS officer looked it up and discovered that, yes, she could be eligible.\n\nIn an email after the exchange, Clarke called that conversation \u201cjaw dropping.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was jaw dropping in that it went on and on, and round and round, and solved NOTHING,\u201d she wrote.\n\nClarke says she has yet to hear from Illinois Medicaid personnel about her application despite applying online in December, making two visits in February and March and phoning several times.\n\nFollow @russbrittmktw\n\n\n\nFollow @MWHealthBlog\n\n\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nPopular Obamacare plan premiums to rise in eight states\n\nValeant makes it official, files tender offer\n\nRival to Gilead\u2019s pricey Sovaldi expected to hit market later this year", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-06-18T18:18:57-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "One Chicago woman wanted to sign up for Obamacare, but couldn't because of an issue with her name -- and now she's left without insurance.", "title": "Identity issue keeps Chicago woman from getting Obamacare plan", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/06/18/identity-issue-keeps-chicago-woman-from-getting-obamacare-plan/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CG794_clarke_MG_20140605112433.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Department of Health and Human Services,health care,Mary Ruth Clarke,Obamacare", "article.headline": "Identity issue keeps Chicago woman from getting Obamacare plan", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "description": "One Chicago woman wanted to sign up for Obamacare, but couldn't because of an issue with her name -- and now she's left without insurance.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "news_keywords": "Department of Health and Human Services,health care,Mary Ruth Clarke,Obamacare", "article.published": "2014-06-18T18:18:57-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/06/18/identity-issue-keeps-chicago-woman-from-getting-obamacare-plan/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "One Chicago woman wanted to sign up for Obamacare, but couldn't because of an issue with her name -- and now she's left without insurance.", "title": "Identity issue keeps Chicago woman from getting Obamacare plan", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/06/18/identity-issue-keeps-chicago-woman-from-getting-obamacare-plan/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CG794_clarke_MG_20140605112433.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2646", "article.updated": "2014-06-18T20:07:19-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced0f\"", "article_summary": "Mary Ruth Clarke, a screenwriter and playwright whose credits include the 2000 hit \u201cMeet The Parents,\u201d says the problem boils down to a simple issue: her name.\n\u201cI canceled my Blue Cross/Blue Shield.\u201dAfter Clarke was put together with HHS officials via MarketWatch, the issue still was not resolved.\nMary Ruth Clarke.\nShe says the HHS officer didn\u2019t know initially that Medicaid had been expanded and told her she was ineligible.\nWhile it was reported recently that nearly one-fourth of those who signed up for Obamacare have had issues with information given to health officials, consider the plight of a Chicago woman who couldn\u2019t even get the ball rolling to get coverage despite numerous attempts."}
