Mother Jones, Twitter\n\nBottled water companies are drinking California dry. Big-name companies, like Aquafina, Dasani, Crystal Geyser and Arrowhead source their water straight from California, a state experiencing the third-driest year on record.\n\nMother Jones released the map below, indicating the locations across the United States where these big-name companies are getting their water from, either through ground water collection or from the municipal water supply. The majority of the water comes from all across California, but also other dry states, like Nevada, Arizona, and Texas.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Mother Jones Photo courtesy of Mother Jones\n\nSince these companies are well-aware the Golden State is very, very dry, why aren\u2019t they reducing their collection? \u201cYou have to remember this is a 120-year-old brand,\u201d Arrowhead\u2019s Jane Lazgin told Mother Jones. \u201cSome of these sources have long, long been associated with the brand.\u201d Other brands have also been established in California for more than a century.\n\nCalifornia is the only western state without groundwater regulation, which is a bottled water company\u2019s dream. Whatever water the companies find when they drill into the ground, they are legally allowed to use. \u201cThis industry has very successfully turned a public resource into a private commodity,\u201d scientist Peter Gleick wrote on his blog. Companies also aren\u2019t required to publicly disclose exactly where their sources are. Gleick, author of Bottles and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession With Bottled Water, writes, \u201cI don\u2019t think people have a clue \u2014 no one knows\u201d where their bottled water comes from.\n\nAs long as the companies keep making a profit, it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re going to stop sourcing from the driest areas in the country any time soon. Sales are continuing to boom, and in the next decade might even surpass the sales of carbonated soft drinks, The New York Times reported. In 2012, in the United States alone, bottled water sales revenues were $12 billion.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bottled water, drought", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Big-name brands like Aquafina and Dasani source their water from the driest states in the country, like California.", "title": "Your Bottled Water Is Most Likely From States Experiencing Severe Droughts", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/aquafina-dasani-and-other-bottled-water-companies-source-drought-zones-california-298244", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/bottled-water-drought-map.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Big-name brands like Aquafina and Dasani source their water from the driest states in the country, like California.", "title": "Your Bottled Water Is Most Likely From States Experiencing Severe Droughts", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/aquafina-dasani-and-other-bottled-water-companies-source-drought-zones-california-298244", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/bottled-water-drought-map.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/bottled-water-drought-map.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-08-15T11:52:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-15T11:52:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Big-name brands like Aquafina and Dasani source their water from the driest states in the country, like California."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8d9\"", "article_summary": "Gleick, author of Bottles and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession With Bottled Water, writes, \u201cI don\u2019t think people have a clue \u2014 no one knows\u201d where their bottled water comes from.\nMother Jones, TwitterBottled water companies are drinking California dry.\nBig-name companies, like Aquafina, Dasani, Crystal Geyser and Arrowhead source their water straight from California, a state experiencing the third-driest year on record.\nIn 2012, in the United States alone, bottled water sales revenues were $12 billion.\nYour bottled water is most likely sourced from some of the driest states in the country."}
