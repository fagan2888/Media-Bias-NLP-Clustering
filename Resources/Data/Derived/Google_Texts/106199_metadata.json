The rate of babies born to teenage mothers is less than half of what it was in 1991\u2014from 61.8 births per 1,000 teenagers to 29.4.\n\nBut the lower numbers don\u2019t mean fewer teens are having sex. Rather, society\u2019s new moral good is having \u201csafe sex,\u201d replacing the once-common call for abstinence. With easy access to contraceptives and lax sexual education programs, the message to teenagers is, \u201cHave sex. Just don\u2019t get pregnant.\u201d\n\nAnd the stats match up to this new normal. According to a 2013 study by the Guttmacher Institute, 1 in 3 16-year-olds and almost 3 in 4 19-year-olds are sexually active. Of these teens, a study found that \u201cmore than 80 percent of 16-year-olds used a method at first sex, and by one year following first sex, 95 percent of those teens had used contraception.\u201d\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

In some cases, the drug keeps embryos from implanting in the uterus, destroying the conceived life. So while fewer teens ages 15-19 are having abortions\u201414.3 per 1,000 teenagers in 2009, compared to 37.6 in 1991, according to the CDC\u2014this rate does not include emergency contraception.\n\nThe family planning industry, however, is heralding the news as a victory for society at large. Sarah Brown, CEO of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy announced on her organization\u2019s website, \u201cThe stunning turnaround in teen births is truly one of the nation\u2019s great success stories of the past two decades.\u201d\n\nThe CDC study also found that in 2012, 2 in 5\u201440.7 percent\u2014of births, were to unmarried mothers, up from roughly 1 in 5 births in 1980. Only 17 percent of these single mothers are teens, revealing a new social acceptance of adults having children without first getting married.\n\nHeritage Senior Fellow Robert Rector reports that children of single-parent families are more likely to \u201chave emotional and behavioral problems; be physically abused; smoke, drink, and use drugs; be aggressive; engage in violent, delinquent, and criminal behavior; have poor school performance; and drop out of high school.\u201d Children born to married women are 82 percent less likely to live in poverty than children of single parents.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is rapidly evolving into a two caste system with marriage and education at the dividing line,\" Rector said. \u201cChildren in the top half of the population are born to married couples with a college education; children in the bottom half are born to single mothers with a high school degree or less.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "The teen birth rate in the United States has dropped to a historic low, according to preliminary 2012 data released last week by the Centers for Disease Control", "title": "WORLD | Fewer babies but not necessarily less sex for teens | Kiley Crossland | Sept. 13, 2013", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2013/09/fewer_babies_but_not_necessarily_less_sex_for_teens", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/istock_000014017900large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "The teen birth rate in the United States has dropped to a historic low, according to preliminary 2012 data released last week by the Centers for Disease Control"}, "article_summary": "But the lower numbers don\u2019t mean fewer teens are having sex.\nOnly 17 percent of these single mothers are teens, revealing a new social acceptance of adults having children without first getting married.\nLogin NowAnother factor keeping teens from having babies is the introduction of emergency contraceptives 15 years ago, including abortifacients such as Ella and Plan B.\nRather, society\u2019s new moral good is having \u201csafe sex,\u201d replacing the once-common call for abstinence.\nWith easy access to contraceptives and lax sexual education programs, the message to teenagers is, \u201cHave sex."}
