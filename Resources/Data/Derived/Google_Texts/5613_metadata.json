He is the candidate of sunny aspirations in a race that has glowered with anger. He was the candidate who wanted immigration reform until he didn\u2019t, angering all sides. He was too young, too impatient, too thirsty, too profligate with other people\u2019s money \u2014 and then there were those much-mocked high-heeled boots.\n\nAnd now? Marco Rubio is the presidential campaign\u2019s newest sensation, the target of laser-like attention Tuesday after his surprising third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, opening his New Hampshire campaign with the hope that Midwestern momentum will propel him past all those who doubted.\n\nIn the graceful old town hall in Exeter, he began his pitch to voters Tuesday night \u2014 one familiar to those who have followed him, but now being watched by a new, broader audience. It also is full of contradictions, harsh and apocalyptic warnings about the future of the country merging with lyrical optimism.\n\nHe blistered President Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, popular culture, Obamacare, fellow Republicans, efforts to impinge on the 2nd Amendment and circumstances that he said led to a country that \u201cis slipping away.\u201d\n\nWhen he is elected, he said, \u201cI am going to repeal every single one of Barack Obama\u2019s unconstitutional executive orders. That means that all these crazy EPA rules that are destroying jobs in America \u2014 on my first day in office they\u2019re gone. This executive order that undermines the 2nd Amendment; on my first day in office it\u2019s gone.... On my first day in office any work to impose Common Core stops \u2014 on my first day in office.\u201d\n\nBut he leavened the tough talk with a kind of personal appeal that few in the Republican field can emulate, repeating the evocative personal story of his bartender father and his mother, a maid. It served to connect his life experiences to voters for whom siding with a candidate named Rubio is an unusual leap.\n\n\u201cWhat makes America special is not that we have rich people \u2026 but what makes us special are the millions of people that know they\u2019re never going to be rich, and that\u2019s not what they want,\u201d he said, lauding nurses and teachers and firefighters. \u201cThey want to be happy.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s words appeared to take hold; many of the 700 people on hand left bearing Rubio signs. But now the hard part begins.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Rubio has pushed the notion that he is best equipped to take on the Democratic nominee in November, and voters in Iowa responded to that message. Of the 21% of voters in that state\u2019s caucuses who said November was uppermost in their minds, Rubio won 44%.\n\nUntil Monday night, he had been caught in a tight quartet of single-digit candidates on the establishment side of the GOP spectrum, a group that included Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Rubio moved swiftly Tuesday to redirect the party\u2019s establishment money to him alone.\n\n\u201cMy opponents are going to try to ignore my showing in Iowa,\u201d he wrote in a fundraising missive. \u201cThey will increase their relentless attacks in the hopes that we will not put up a fight and fade into the distance. And that could not be further from the truth.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Rubio has been under sustained assault in New Hampshire, particularly from the well-financed allies of Bush, who saw Rubio as the impediment to his own upward mobility.\n\nBush\u2019s allies have asserted in ads on New Hampshire television that Rubio is \u201cjust not ready to be president.\u201d Bush in a Monday night speech in Manchester called Rubio and Iowa winner Ted Cruz \u201cbackbenchers that have never done anything of consequence in their lives.\u201d Both men are first-term senators, a circumstance that Bush and other candidates have argued is too reminiscent of Obama during his presidential quest.\n\nRubio has returned fire with an ad, opening with sepia-toned pictures of Clinton and Bush, calling them \u201ctwo names from the past, tied to the past, with ideas from the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for a new generation of leadership,\u201d Rubio said, words that were echoed in radio advertisements in New Hampshire.\n\nHis challenges are many. On the financial front, Rubio is competing with Donald Trump, who can finance the campaign out of his wallet if need be, and Cruz, who has amassed a broad donor base amid impressive early fundraising.\n\nRubio may benefit from a deep well of establishment conservatives in New Hampshire, although a substantial showing would require him to cut significantly into Trump\u2019s double-digit lead here. After New Hampshire, the terrain gets even more complicated.\n\nOn Tuesday, he picked up the support of Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, which holds the first GOP contest after New Hampshire on Feb. 20. Scott reiterated the campaign\u2019s theme: \u201cWe have one shot in 2016 to beat Hillary Clinton and that shot is Marco Rubio, and with him as our candidate, we win.\u201d Yet Rubio faces stiff competition in a state known for hardball politics.\n\nMatt Moore, chairman of the South Carolina GOP, said Cruz had been in the state often \u201cand that matters.\u201d Trump, he said, has been greeted with \u201cgigantic crowds.\u201d\n\nThe Palmetto State\u2019s Republicans, he suggested, require some dexterity.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be a one-trick pony in South Carolina,\u201d Moore said. \u201cYou have to be liked by a broad spectrum in the state.\u201d\n\nNevada, the fourth Republican contest, offers some hope for Rubio, given that he spent part of his childhood in Las Vegas. But he has lagged in polls there. After that come the Southern primaries, which are dominated by evangelical voters who have rallied to Cruz\u2019s side this year and formed the base of his Iowa victory.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Rubio enjoys a moment in the sun -- now the hard part starts", "date": "2016-02-03", "Description": "In the nine months in which he has run for president, Marco Rubio\u2019s ambitions have been confounded by contradictions.
