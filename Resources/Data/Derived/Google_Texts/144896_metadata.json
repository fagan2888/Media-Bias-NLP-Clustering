There\u2019s no telling exactly how many companies would attempt to employ the same \u201creligious freedom\u201d arguments to deny their employees coverage for certain health services.\n\nBut it is pretty apparent who will be affected first: The people who work at the dozens of other companies that tried to get their birth control objections in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nSince the spring of 2012, 71 other companies have attempted to challenge Obamacare\u2019s birth control provision in court. Gretchen Borchelt, the senior counsel and director of state reproductive health policy at the National Women\u2019s Law Center (NWLC), told Mother Jones that a ruling in favor of Hobby Lobby would most immediately affect the estimated 22,000 people who work at those businesses. After all, their bosses have obviously already tried to seek this loophole.\n\nNWLC has been tracking the ongoing contraceptive lawsuits closely, and by their count, over 100 lawsuits have been filed in federal court based on the same claims that Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Woods are making. That includes cases brought by both for-profit and non-profit employers. Aside from Hobby Lobby, 46 of these cases involving for-profit companies are still pending, and their outcomes may directly depend on how the Supreme Court rules.\n\nThe businesses that have sued to withhold coverage for birth control range from construction companies, to law firms, to dairy corporations, to car dealerships.\n\nHobby Lobby\u2019s supporters are attempting to downplay the ripple effects of the company\u2019s Supreme Court case. \u201cTo me, the implications of the case are not all that huge,\u201d Mark Rienzi, a law professor at Catholic University and for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the group that is arguing against the contraceptive provision on behalf of Hobby Lobby, told NBC News. \u201cVirtually all businesses are fine with the contraceptive mandate. It\u2019s only a tiny percentage that sued.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the plaintiffs in these cases, along with their supporters, have done an excellent job of crafting the messaging and shaping the debate, and it\u2019s been playing out on their grounds,\u201d Adam Sonfield, a senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute, told ThinkProgress in an interview earlier this month. Sonfield recently published a policy review about the central claims in the Supreme Court case, and believes that allowing corporations to compromise their workers\u2019 full range of insurance benefits is a \u201cfrightening road for us to be going down\u201d as a society.\n\nFor instance, in addition to taking away coverage for workers\u2019 birth control prescriptions, a Hobby Lobby win also threatens to compromise the doctor-patient relationship. Since the company also argues it doesn\u2019t want to provide \u201crelated education and counseling\u201d about the birth control methods it opposes, that could prevent workers from discussing those types of contraception with their doctor if they want that doctor\u2019s visit to be covered by their insurance. And legal experts also warn that a broader interpretation of religious liberty could compromise LGBT Americans\u2019 access to health care services.\n\nThe 71 other companies that are likely eager to capitalize on the Hobby Lobby ruling could end up making a very poor business decision if they stop covering their workers\u2019 birth control. Wider access to birth control helps keep women in the workforce. And covering contraception in employees\u2019 health benefits actually tends to save money in the long term, given the high costs of pregnancy and childbirth.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "And that's just the beginning.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "And that's just the beginning.", "title": "A Hobby Lobby Win Would Put Birth Control Coverage In Jeopardy At 71 Other Companies", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/04/02/3422115/hobby-lobby-birth-control-other-companies/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ceo-healthcare-hobby-lobby-scotus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "And that's just the beginning.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ceo-healthcare-hobby-lobby-scotus-321x214.jpg", "title": "A Hobby Lobby Win Would Put Birth Control Coverage In Jeopardy At 71 Other Companies", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ceo-healthcare-hobby-lobby-scotus.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ceo-healthcare-hobby-lobby-scotus.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-02T13:00:01+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "For instance, in addition to taking away coverage for workers\u2019 birth control prescriptions, a Hobby Lobby win also threatens to compromise the doctor-patient relationship.\nSince the spring of 2012, 71 other companies have attempted to challenge Obamacare\u2019s birth control provision in court.\nThe 71 other companies that are likely eager to capitalize on the Hobby Lobby ruling could end up making a very poor business decision if they stop covering their workers\u2019 birth control.\nThe businesses that have sued to withhold coverage for birth control range from construction companies, to law firms, to dairy corporations, to car dealerships.\nWider access to birth control helps keep women in the workforce."}
