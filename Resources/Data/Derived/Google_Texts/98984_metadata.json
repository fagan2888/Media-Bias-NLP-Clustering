The Food and Drug Administration created a new standard for gluten-free food labeling. Any packaged food that is labeled \u201cgluten free\u201d must now contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, the protein that occurs naturally in wheat, rye, barley and their derivatives. The 20 ppm is the lowest level that can be reliably detected (other countries use the same criteria). The tiny amount satisfies the medical and scientific communities in terms of safety for those who cannot eat gluten.\n\nThe ruling will help the 3 million Americans who suffer from celiac disease, a chronic autoimmune disorder. For these people, eating foods with gluten can inflame and destroy the small intestine \u2013 blocking critical absorption of minerals and nutrients \u2013 and until now consumers with the disease couldn\u2019t tell if something slapped with the term \u201cgluten free\u201d was actually gluten free enough.\n\nRelated: The 9 Highest Calorie Fast Food Meals\n\nSymptoms of celiac disease, an inherited illness, include chronic diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, iron-deficiency anemia, bone and joint pain, cramping, bloating, and more. Some people have no symptoms at all but feel generally unwell.\n\nThere is no cure for celiac disease \u2013 \u201cwhich is actually a disease, as opposed to an eating preference,\u201d Marilyn G. Geller, CEO of Celiac Disease Foundation (CDF), told The Fiscal Times on Wednesday. \u201cThe only treatment at present is to follow a strict gluten-free diet.\u201d\n\nDietitician and nutrition expert Ellie Krieger told MSNBC, \u201cYou\u2019ll see a lack of growth in children [with celiac disease] \u2026 It\u2019s very serious.\u201d\n\nWhy It Matters. The gluten-free market has exploded in the past few years, partly because of increased awareness of celiac disease and gluten insensitivity, but also because \u201ceating gluten free\u201d has become a trendy lifestyle choice. Most gluten-free foods are more expensive than others due to certification requirements, but they\u2019re also far more accessible than before.\n\nRelated: 13 Extreme Foods for Daredevil Eaters\n\nIn 2012 alone, the \u201cretail market was estimated at $4.2 billion, according to Packaged Facts, a marketing research firm,\u201d USA Today reported. By 2017, Packaged Facts has estimated \u201cthat sales will exceed $6.6 billion.\u201d Another market research firm, Mintel, estimates that sales of gluten-free foods and beverages will soar to $15.6 billion in 2016.\n\nWith the new FDA standard, however, foods that are naturally gluten free \u2013 such as fruits and vegetables \u2013 can also be labeled gluten free. \u201cWhen people put together the numbers on the gluten-free marketplace, right now we can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re including the naturally gluten-free foods or the foods that are being specially prepared, packaged and labeled gluten free,\u201d says Geller of CDF.\n\nWhile 11 percent of American households follow a gluten-free diet, about 1 in 4 consumers believe gluten free is good for everyone, says research firm NPD Group. \u201cClearly a segment of the population avoids gluten for reasons other than gluten sensitivity or disease, providing a greater opportunity for food manufacturers and retailers,\" said Darren Seifer, an NPD food and beverage analyst.\n\nWhat It Means for You. Consumers who must eat foods without gluten can now be confident the packaged foods they buy are \u201cstrictly gluten free and can be tolerated for their medical conditions,\u201d says Geller.\n\nRelated: The Big Fat Lie We\u2019ve Been Fed About Our Diet\n\nWhile the new rule applies to packaged food, restaurant menu items are still a bit of a wild card. The FDA has said only that food establishments should try to keep any gluten-free labels consistent with the new regulation.\n\nA blood test for celiac disease is covered by insurance; the out-of-pocket cost is about $30 for most people, says Geller of CDF. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, inexpensive and the first step in testing\u201d for celiac disease. A more expensive follow-up endoscopic biopsy is the only way to confirm a diagnosis.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic says those with gluten issues, aside from avoiding barley, rye, wheat and triticale (a cross between wheat and rye), must also avoid a wide range of foods unless they\u2019re clearly labeled gluten free, including breads, cakes, candies, pies, cereals, French fries, pastas, processed luncheon meat and salad dressings.\n\n\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "What Happened.", "title": "Gluten-Free Food Labels Finally Have Teeth", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/06/Gluten-Free-Food-Labels-Finally-Have-Teeth", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Bread_Caution_Tape_Gluten_Free.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/06/Gluten-Free-Food-Labels-Finally-Have-Teeth", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Bread_Caution_Tape_Gluten_Free.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "What Happened.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Food and Drug Administration created a new standard for gluten-free food labeling.\nThere is no cure for celiac disease \u2013 \u201cwhich is actually a disease, as opposed to an eating preference,\u201d Marilyn G.
