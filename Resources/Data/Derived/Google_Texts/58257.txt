WASHINGTON, March 8, 2014 — Jenny Beth Martin, President and Co-Founder of the Tea Party Patriots spoke at CPAC today.

“We want a country where personal freedom is cherished,” said Martin. “We will win! Our values, personal freedom, economic freedom and a debt free future will win.”

In her introduction of Rep. Michele Bachmann, Martin said, “Michele Bachman knows America needs the Tea Party.”

“We will have a woman for president, just the right one. We are the only party to have a women on the presidential ticket this century,” Bachmann said. “We have to keep our eyes on the prize, taking the gavel out of Harry Reid’s hands on the first Tuesday in November … [It] is going to feel pretty sweet … His reign is over!” “Our movement at its core is an intellectual movement,” said Bachmann.”The Constitution, limited government, free enterprise, strong families — these are the principles that have passed the test of time.”

Following from www..org press release:

Jenny Beth Martin is the President and Co-Founder of Tea Party Patriots. In February of 2009 following a series of massive expansions of the United States government, Jenny Beth and several other concerned citizens formed the beginnings of the modern Tea Party movement.

Making use of her already established social and blogging network, as well as an email list of contacts that she had built over years of political volunteer work, she contributed to the nascent Tea Party movement by reaching out to and mobilizing thousands of like-minded citizens.

CPAC took place March 6-8, 2014 at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center, offering three days of blockbuster speeches, policy discussions and networking opportunities — all celebrating the shared principles of smaller government, a strong national defense and traditional American values.
