Premera has requested a 19.6 percent rate hike, spokeswoman Melanie Coon said.\n\nAbout 155,000 Washingtonians have an individual Premera or Lifewise plan purchased through the state health insurance exchange or directly from the Premera website, Coon said. About 17,000 of those people are in one of the affected counties.\n\nThe network changes also affect a small number of employer-sponsored plans. Customers can see if they're affected by looking at the network name on their health insurance cards. Plans in the Heritage Prime network, which is employer-sponsored, and the Heritage Signature Network, which is individual, will no longer have access to most providers in the Providence, Swedish and Franciscan systems.\n\nA handful of hospitals and facilities from the dropped providers will remain in-network to provide adequate care in places with few options.\n\nFacilities remaining in-network include St. Luke's Rehabilitation Institute in Spokane , Providence St. Joseph's Hospital in Chewelah , Providence Mt. Carmel Hospital in Colville and Providence St. Mary Medical Center in Walla Walla . Rockwood Health System will remain in-network.\n\nCoon said the changes are in response to rising healthcare costs as more people have signed up for coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Premera saw a spike in claim costs in 2015, the second year many people had insurance through individual plans.\n\nCoon said many of those customers had been deferring medical care for years and spent more on health care once they figured out how to use their new insurance plans. That has driven up costs across the system, she said.\n\nCosts have been especially high in many rural areas where there's little competition, Coon said. Premera was faced with a choice between raising premiums further or exiting the market in some counties entirely.\n\n\"We can't offer competitive rates if we're everywhere in the state,\" she said.\n\nWithout the changes, Coon estimates Premera would have asked for a rate increase closer to 25 percent.\n\n___\n\n(c)2016 The Spokesman-Review (Spokane, Wash.)\n\nVisit The Spokesman-Review (Spokane, Wash.) at www.spokesman.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "article_metadata": {"description": "May 12-- One of Washington's largest health insurance providers will drop most Providence, Swedish and CHI Franciscan providers from its network for individual health insurance plans starting in 2017..
