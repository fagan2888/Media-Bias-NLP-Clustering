The insurer hoped that the healthcare law\u2019s bailout fund would pay for its losses. However, it only paid insurers a fraction of what it promised. Wyoming legislators rejected Medicaid expansion last year because they worried the federal government would renege on its promises and here is a prime example. Insurers have found out the hard way the federal government can\u2019t be trusted. Let\u2019s hope it is a lesson learned by legislators still pushing for Medicaid expansion.\n\nObamacare foists enormous costs on insurers. For starters, they must offer insurance to anyone who wants it, regardless of health status. Insurers must also cover a range of expensive Essential Health Benefits. These include maternity care, pediatric service, and prescription drugs.\n\nTo help pay for the costly mandates, Obamacare established a slush fund, or Risk Corridor, to bailout struggling insurers. Carriers with larger than expected earnings have to contribute half of their profits to this account to compensate those that earned significantly less than expected. Like all government spending schemes, the federal government claimed it would make money for taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office estimated this fund would generate $8 billion in savings to taxpayers over three years.\n\nBut not many insurers are profitable under Obamacare. Out of $2.87 billion in aid insurers requested, the fund could only pay out $362 million, according to the Center for Medicare Services. Without this bailout fund\u2019s support, insurers now face millions in losses, and some have stopped selling insurance for good.\n\nThe insurer WINhealth was hit particularly hard by this broken promise and has decided to leave Wyoming\u2019s insurance exchange. The company expected a $5 million payout but received a mere $600,000. Stephen Goldstone, the company\u2019 president and chief executive officer, laid the blame squarely on Obamacare\u2019s broken promises:\n\n\u201cThe federal government\u2019s decision to significantly reduce the reimbursement we would receive under the risk corridor program came as a complete surprise to WINhealth, This, combined with the continuous delays in repayment, has caught WINhealth flat-footed with no choice but to turn down participating in the exchange for 2016.\u201d\n\nWith WINhealth gone, Blue Cross Blue Shield is the sole insurer on Wyoming\u2019s exchange. BCBS is now free to raise premiums knowing patients have nowhere else to turn to for insurance. They will also undoubtedly increase premiums now that they know the federal Risk Corridor program cannot be relied upon to cover their losses.\n\nThe Obama Administration\u2019s announcement shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone at this point. We have been consistently mislead by Obamacare\u2019s promises. During the 2008 election, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama boasted his healthcare plan would reduce annual premiums by $2,500 for a typical family. Instead, premiums for the average family rose $708 in Wyoming according to the Heritage Foundation.\n\nThen, as Obama was pushing his healthcare law through Congress, he reassured voters, \u201cIf you like your healthcare plan, you will be able to keep your healthcare plan, period.\u201d Wrong again. 4.7 million patients saw their plans cancelled because they were in violation of Obamacare\u2019s onerous regulations.\n\nObamacare\u2019s broken promises holds important lessons for Wyoming\u2019s legislators in 2016. Governor Mead recently announced he will try yet again to expand Medicaid, claiming the federal government will pay 90 cents on the dollar for the program. Senator Charlie Scott warned his colleagues during last year\u2019s legislative session of the perils of trusting the federal government:\n\n\u201cYou know the federal government is going to back off of its promise to pay 90 percent. You know that because when you look at their finances, they\u2019re in bad trouble across the United States.\u201d\n\nIf the federal government can\u2019t manage a meager $3 billion insurer bailout fund, why should we trust it to fully fund the $500 billion Medicaid program? Patients, insurers, and taxpayers have been misled at every turn under Obamacare. Our legislators must stand firm and again reject Medicaid expansion in Wyoming.\n\nThis piece was first published by the Wyoming Liberty Group.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "With just a few days until open enrollment, WINhealth is closing down.
