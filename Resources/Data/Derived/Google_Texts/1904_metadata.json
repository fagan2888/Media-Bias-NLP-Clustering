In \u201cStonewall,\u201d directed by Roland Emmerich, it takes only a brick to set off revolutionary tumult, as a riot erupts outside the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village on June 28, 1969.\n\nThe movie, which premiered last week at the Toronto International Film Festival, opens in theaters on Friday. It might seem an unusual project for Mr. Emmerich, whose blockbusters include \u201c2012,\u201d \u201cIndependence Day\u201d and \u201cThe Day After Tomorrow,\u201d but it was also a very personal choice for a director who grew up, he said, \u201cdeeply closeted\u201d in a small German town during the 1960s.\n\n\u201cHe has an enormous amount of fun making giant movies where things blow up and the aliens come,\u201d said Jon Robin Baitz, the playwright (\u201cOther Desert Cities\u201d) who wrote the screenplay for \u201cStonewall.\u201d \u201c[But] what are you going to do as a gay filmmaker in Hollywood that will represent who you are\u2014and not simply that the world is coming to an end?\u201d\n\nMr. Emmerich\u2019s efforts to recapture history drew criticism from LGBT activists when a trailer for \u201cStonewall\u201d was released last month. They charged that the film\u2019s focus on a fictional white male protagonist named Danny (played by Jeremy Irvine of \u201cWar Horse\u201d) played down the important roles played by real-life black, Latino and transgender participants, such as Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, who were dynamic figures in the community.\n\nThe filmmakers have said that the trailer stirred a false, and incomplete, impression of the movie.\n\nENLARGE The Stonewall Inn today.

The cast includes Jonny Beauchamp (\u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d) in a prominent supporting role as a composite character based on Ray Castro and Ms. Rivera, and actor Otoja Abit as Ms. Johnson, among others playing figures real and fictive. \u201cWe wanted to show all forms of gayness and gay life, from a transgender woman to a guy who basically has a marriage.\u201d\n\nThe coming-of-age story follows Danny, a Midwestern teenager who arrives in Greenwich Village after his parents discover he is gay and throw him out of the house. With nowhere to sleep, he falls in with a wild and motley crew of street youth who frequent the mob-run Stonewall to dance and hustle dates.\n\nWatch a film clip from \"Stonewall,\" starring Jeremy Irvine, Jonny Beauchamp and Vladimir Alexis. Photo: Philippe Bosse\n\nDanny\u2019s introduction to his new life includes turning a trick and starting a romance with a slick, older gay activist ( Jonathan Rhys-Meyers ) involved with the Mattachine Society, an early gay-rights organization. He also endures a police beating that coincides with intensifying raids at the Stonewall, run by a shady manager named Ed Murphy ( Ron Perlman ).\n\n\u201cDanny\u2019s the classic catalyst character who gets changed by all these people,\u201d said Mr. Emmerich, who assembled the $17 million cost of the film, shot in Montreal.\n\n\u201cIt completely represents the spectrum, racially and gender-identification wise,\u201d Mr. Baitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not going to make the people who are unhappy any happier, but the film painstakingly re-created the events as we\u2019ve seen in news footage and photographs.\u201d\n\nAs part of his research, Mr. Beauchamp was introduced to members of the Stonewall Veterans\u2019 Association and spent time with Martin Boyce, one of the most visible of the dwindling number of Stonewall survivors. It was from Mr. Boyce that the actor learned the now-forgotten concept of \u201cscare drag.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019d paint your face, or wear a ponytail, but you\u2019d have a man\u2019s shirt or pants,\u201d Mr. Beauchamp said. \u201cIt was a mix-and-match so you could get by in the streets.\u201d The actor, who learned about Stonewall in college, said he was struck by descriptions of pervasive public violence against homosexuals. \u201cIt was like the ultimate survival mode at all times,\u201d he said. \u201cThese kids were tough.\u201d\n\nMr. Emmerich said it was such characters\u2014homeless, young and scrapping for themselves\u2014that largely inspired him to make \u201cStonewall,\u201d regardless of how his interpretation is met by critics. \u201cThey can all see the movie and they can say what they want,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of our producers said we already succeeded in putting Stonewall more in the zeitgeist. It\u2019s such a mythical word, and very few people can say \u2018I was there.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2015-09-23T01:12:00.000Z", "article.section": "US", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "With \u2018Stonewall,\u2019 director Roland Emmerich made a personal choice.", "title": "A Director Defends His \u2018Stonewall\u2019", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KK961_NYSTON_G_20150922174722.jpg", "alt": "With \u2018Stonewall,\u2019 director Roland Emmerich made a personal choice", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KK961_NYSTON_D_20150922174722.jpg"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB12177959380318133490704581237870178284358&headline=With%20%u2018Stonewall%2C%u2019%20director%20Roland%20Emmerich%20made%20a%20personal%20choice&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB12177959380318133490704581237870178284358"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "christopher street,gay liberation,gay-rights movement,lgbt rights,stonewall inn,stonewall movie,stonewall riots,west village,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,festivals,film festivals,human rights,civil liberties,movies", "news_keywords": "christopher street,gay liberation,gay-rights movement,lgbt rights,stonewall inn,stonewall movie,stonewall riots,west village,political,general news", "article.headline": "With \u2018Stonewall,\u2019 director Roland Emmerich made a personal choice", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KK961_NYSTON_E_20150922174722.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KK961_NYSTON_D_20150922174722.jpg"}}, "description": "With \u2018Stonewall,\u2019 director Roland Emmerich made a personal choice.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB12177959380318133490704581237870178284358&headline=With%20%u2018Stonewall%2C%u2019%20director%20Roland%20Emmerich%20made%20a%20personal%20choice&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB12177959380318133490704581237870178284358", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "New York", "article.emb": "video_emb", "article.summary": "With \u2018Stonewall,\u2019 director Roland Emmerich made a personal choice.", "page.site": "wsj", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-09-23T01:12:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-4bd4", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"internal_link_count": 1, "video_count": 1, "image_count": 2, "word_count": 709, "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "With \u2018Stonewall,\u2019 director Roland Emmerich made a personal choice.", "title": "A Director Defends His \u2018Stonewall\u2019", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-director-defends-his-stonewall-1442970723", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KK961_NYSTON_G_20150922174722.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Steve Dollar", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "A Director Defends His \u2018Stonewall\u2019", "article.type": "NY Culture", "article.id": "SB12177959380318133490704581237870178284358", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-09-23T01:12:00.000Z"}, "article_summary": "Photo: brendan mcdermid/Reuters\u201cRobin and I tried to be as inclusive as we could,\u201d said Mr. Emmerich.\nIn \u201cStonewall,\u201d directed by Roland Emmerich, it takes only a brick to set off revolutionary tumult, as a riot erupts outside the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village on June 28, 1969.\nWatch a film clip from \"Stonewall,\" starring Jeremy Irvine, Jonny Beauchamp and Vladimir Alexis.\n\u201cOne of our producers said we already succeeded in putting Stonewall more in the zeitgeist.\nHe also endures a police beating that coincides with intensifying raids at the Stonewall, run by a shady manager named Ed Murphy ( Ron Perlman )."}
