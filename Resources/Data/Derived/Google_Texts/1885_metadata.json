Little Junior is heading back to school and will need to be dropped off and picked up; there are a few growing potholes on the interstate that need the good legislators\u2019 personal attention. After a few high-profile legislative battles, it\u2019s time for these state representatives to ground themselves and attend to the business back home.\n\nJust kidding, they\u2019re all going to Iowa to run for president.\n\n\u201cSix Republicans mulling a campaign for the presidency will traverse the Hawkeye State over the next two weeks,\u201d U.S. News reports, \u201cwith most of them devoting multiple days to the pilgrimage.\u201d Paul alone has double-digit stops planned this week \u2014 10 by U.S. News\u2019 count, \u201cat least a dozen\u201d according to the Des Moines Register \u2014 including visits to \u201cfive local Republican Party offices and \u2026 two fundraisers for congressional candidates.\u201d Cruz was in Iowa on Saturday \u201cfor an exclusive party at GOP donor and agribusiness leader Bruce Rastetter\u2019s home, where he also attended a fundraiser for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst.\u201d Rubio was also in the Rastetter dude\u2019s backyard, where he was the big speaker and \u201cstayed for the summer party.\u201d Delightful!\n\nThe senators will be joined by other hopefuls traversing the state. Texas Gov. Rick Perry is doing \u201cevents at nine venues in four days.\u201d Rick Santorum will visit three cities in two days. Mike Huckabee will fly out to Iowa on Thursday night for a Friday morning \u201csession with Christian conservative activists at an Iowa Renewal Project event in Cedar Rapids,\u201d then fly back to liberal New York City to tape his weekend Fox News show, then return Saturday.\n\nThe main reason so many of these jokers \u2014 Perry, Cruz, Santorum, Huckabee and Bobby Jindal \u2014 will be in Iowa next Saturday is for the big Family Leadership Summit in Ames, where they will all give speeches. The event, which the DMR dubs \u201cthe first big cattle-call event of the cycle,\u201d is an opportunity to kiss the ring of Bob Vander Plaats, the generally awful head of the Family Leader organization and self-christened gatekeeper to Iowa\u2019s social conservative votes. Expect some choice (depressing) quotes as these potential presidential candidates try to outdo each other for the SoCons\u2019 hearts next weekend.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses make it great to be an Iowa Republican politician for the next 17 months. If you\u2019re in the state\u2019s GOP House delegation, you\u2019ll get whatever you want from Congress; if you\u2019re Senate candidate Joni Ernst, the national party\u2019s best fundraisers will flock to whatever small-town barbecue or diner you\u2019re at to keep your campaign coffers full. (Rubio\u2019s PAC alone has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Ernst.) And then there\u2019s Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who\u2019s served five terms and is running this year for his sixth. The amount of ass-kissing that Branstad receives from Republican presidential hopefuls is otherworldly. As New York Times Magazine reporter Mark Leibovich wrote in a story about Chris Christie\u2019s recent visit to Iowa, \u201c[i]f there\u2019s one thing every Republican presidential candidate can agree upon, it is that Branstad represents the peak of American leadership, if not the pinnacle of all human achievement.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul, Cruz, Rubio and other potential candidates descend on Iowa this week, 17 months ahead of the useless caucuses", "author": "Jim Newell", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Paul, Cruz, Rubio and other potential candidates descend on Iowa this week, 17 months ahead of the useless caucuses", "title": "Republicans\u2019 mad Iowa dash begins: A presidential pander-fest for the ages", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/04/republicans_mad_iowa_dash_begins_a_presidential_pander_fest_for_the_ages/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/paul_rubio_cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paul, Cruz, Rubio and other potential candidates descend on Iowa this week, 17 months ahead of the useless caucuses", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/paul_rubio_cruz.jpg", "title": "Republicans\u2019 mad Iowa dash begins: A presidential pander-fest for the ages", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Republicans\u2019 mad Iowa dash begins: A presidential pander-fest for the ages", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Bob Vander Plaats, Bobby Jindal, campaigning, Editor's Picks, GOP, Iowa, Iowa caucuses, Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Republicans, Rick Perry, Senate, Social conservatives, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Iowa caucuses make it great to be an Iowa Republican politician for the next 17 months.\nRick Perry is doing \u201cevents at nine venues in four days.\u201d Rick Santorum will visit three cities in two days.\nThe amount of ass-kissing that Branstad receives from Republican presidential hopefuls is otherworldly.\nExpect some choice (depressing) quotes as these potential presidential candidates try to outdo each other for the SoCons\u2019 hearts next weekend.\nAfter a few high-profile legislative battles, it\u2019s time for these state representatives to ground themselves and attend to the business back home."}
