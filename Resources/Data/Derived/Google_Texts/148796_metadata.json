Also, several company representatives falsely told investigators that two short-term plans, HealtheFlex and Principal Advantage Plan, were in compliance with the federal Affordable Care Act, according to Kerr.\n\nAny Arkansan who has received a sales call from the company or purchased one of its short-term plans is encouraged to call the Insurance Department at (800) 852-5494, Kerr said.\n\nA call to Health Insurance Innovations on Monday was answered by a recording stating the company\u2019s mailbox was full.\n\nKerr released the following tips for consumers who receive a call from anyone attempting to sell insurance:\n\n\u2014 The open enrollment period for the 2016 health insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act ended Jan. 31. The next open enrollment period will run Nov. 1 of this year through Jan. 31 of next year. There is no special \u201cstate enrollment period\u201d for individual health insurance. Anyone offering insurance plans through an \u201cenrollment period\u201d outside of open enrollment is not selling an ACA-compliant policy.\n\n\u2014No one offering ACA-compliant health care coverage will ask if you have a pre-existing condition.\n\n\u2014Be wary of telemarketers from the \u201cnational enrollment center,\u201d \u201cnational healthcare center,\u201d or other official-sounding name. The federal government will not call you to sell you health insurance.\n\n\u2014Do not provide anyone your bank account or health information or agree to any request to send money over the phone. If you are being pressured to provide this information, hang up.\n\n\u2014Purchase insurance only from a licensed agent. Do not be afraid to ask agents for their license number. If they refuse, hang up.\n\n\u2014If you receive a sales call from someone selling health insurance, ask the caller to email or send you information about the policy, including premiums. If they refuse, hang up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 State Insurance Commissioner Allen Kerr said Monday he has issued a cease-and-desist order against a Florida-based company over allegations it has used deceptive practices to try to sell short-term health insurance plans in Arkansas.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Arkansas News Bureau", "og": {"url": "http://pbcommercial.com/news/local/insurance-commissioner-warns-alleged-fraud", "site_name": "Pine Bluff Commercial", "type": "article", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 State Insurance Commissioner Allen Kerr said Monday he has issued a cease-and-desist order against a Florida-based company over allegations it has used deceptive practices to try to sell short-term health insurance plans in Arkansas.", "title": "Insurance commissioner warns of alleged fraud"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://pbcommercial.com/news/local/insurance-commissioner-warns-alleged-fraud", "title": "Insurance commissioner warns of alleged fraud", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 State Insurance Commissioner Allen Kerr said Monday he has issued a cease-and-desist order against a Florida-based company over allegations it has used deceptive practices to try to sell short-term health insurance plans in Arkansas.", "creator": "@pbcommercial"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "pbcommercial://?eid=966708", "app_name": "pbcommercial", "package": "com.stephensmedia.pinebluffcommercial"}, "ios": {"url": "pbcommercial://?eid=966708", "app_store_id": 983957200, "app_name": "pbcommercial"}}, "keywords": "Local,,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-28T16:11:07-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "Kerr said in a news release that in a phone call with Insurance Department investigators, a Health Insurance Innovations employee offered insurance plans and gave price quotes despite admitting he was not a licensed insurance agent.\nKerr also released a list of tips for avoiding falling prey to dishonest telemarketers trying to sell health insurance plans.\nA call to Health Insurance Innovations on Monday was answered by a recording stating the company\u2019s mailbox was full.\nLITTLE ROCK \u2014 State Insurance Commissioner Allen Kerr said Monday he has issued a cease-and-desist order against a Florida-based company over allegations it has used deceptive practices to try to sell short-term health insurance plans in Arkansas.\nAnyone offering insurance plans through an \u201cenrollment period\u201d outside of open enrollment is not selling an ACA-compliant policy."}
