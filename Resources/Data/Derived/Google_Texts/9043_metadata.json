Marco Rubio attempted to reframe Republican thinking about President Obama at Saturday\u2019s debate in a way that could help him.\n\nThrough most of the Obama Administration, conservative critics have charged that the Obama is in over his head, to some success. When the Pew Research Center asked for one word to describe the President in 2015, the top two picks were \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cincompetent.\u201d\n\nBut that framing could hurt Rubio, another first-term Senator known for his eloquence who is running for the White House, so he put forward an alternative Saturday.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he argued. \u201cHe knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nHe then cited the Affordable Care Act health insurance changes, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation and the 2009 stimulus as examples.\n\nHe later elaborated on the point: \u201cWe are not facing a president that doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows what he is doing. That\u2019s why he\u2019s done the things he\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nBut the other Republicans on stage\u2014particularly those who aren\u2019t also first-term Senators\u2014didn\u2019t buy that vision of President Obama.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush took exception to Rubio\u2019s argument, painting the Florida Senator with the same brush.\n\n\u201cLook, let\u2019s be clear,\u201d he said. \u201cMarco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States, but we\u2019ve tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got\u2014we didn\u2019t get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up.\u201d\n\nReal estate mogul Donald Trump also disagreed with Rubio.\n\n\u201cI think we have a president who, as a president, is totally incompetent, and he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think he has no idea what he\u2019s doing. And our country is going to hell. So, I just want to say, we disagree on that. Is that okay?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida Sen.
