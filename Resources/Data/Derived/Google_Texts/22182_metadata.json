Whether that could mean a countywide tax increase, Greene would not say.\n\n\"I'm not saying that yet. I really need to see what they have first,\" she said following the Council of Independent Business Owners meeting at the Enka campus of Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College. About 60 people attended the meeting, including political leaders state Rep. Brian Turner, D-Buncombe, Buncombe County Board of Commissioners Vice Chairman Joe Belcher, Commissioner Mike Fryar, and City Councilwoman Gwen Wisler.\n\nThe state requires local governments to pass balanced budgets by July 1. Currently, Greene is anticipating a $303 million budget. That's a 1 percent increase over this year's anticipated spending of $300 million.\n\nIncreases would come in part from changes in human services, including a 29 percent increase since 2007 in the number of people receiving the government funded health insurance Medicaid. To keep up, county leaders are looking to build a $49 million human services facility downtown.\n\n\"We've seen our biggest growth because of the Affordable Care Act and the NC FAST system,\" the county manager said.\n\nNorth Carolina Families Accessing Services through Technology is a new state system seeking to give people access to multiple social services through one system.\n\nA rise in new construction should cover such new costs, Greene said.\n\nBut the $303 million projection uses last year's education figures of $79 million. Local education officials are waiting on better state numbers before finalizing this year's numbers, which are expected to be higher.\n\nThe county helps pay for the Asheville City School System, Buncombe County Schools and A-B Tech.\n\nState spending on education, while increasing, has in past years not kept up with inflation and a rising student population. That has put more pressure on local governments.\n\nThis year's county budget had 28 percent of its total going toward education, the second-biggest piece after human services at 35 percent.\n\nMore than half of county revenue comes from property taxes. The county tax rate is currently 60.4 cents for every $100 of assessed value.\n\nThat means the owner of a $200,000 home pays $1,208 in annual county taxes. Property owners inside other tax districts, such as the city and city schools, pay additional taxes on top of the county's.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1yla5fv", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "County Manager Wanda Greene would not say if more education spending will equal a tax increase.", "og": {"site_name": "Citizen Times", "description": "County Manager Wanda Greene would not say if more education spending will equal a tax increase.", "title": "County manager: Education costs pressure local taxpayers", "url": "http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2015/04/11/asheville-buncombe-county-tax-increase-education-million-property-tax-general-assembly/25626671/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/citizen-times.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "County Manager Wanda Greene would not say if more education spending will equal a tax increase.", "creator": "@asheville", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ecfb06fe387a3d27a27cf9a801742520fdf21c22/c=584-0-2920-2336&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Asheville/2015/04/11/B9316931500Z.1_20150411102208_000_G2UAFH11S.1-0.jpg", "title": "County manager: Education costs pressure local taxpayers", "site": "@asheville", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=787264923", "fb": {"app_id": 117201858348253}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/JoelBurgess.ACT"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Asheville, Buncombe County, tax increase, education, $303 million, property tax, General Assembly"}, "article_summary": "But an expected rise in local education costs will put pressure on local taxpayers.\nLocal education officials are waiting on better state numbers before finalizing this year's numbers, which are expected to be higher.\nThat means the owner of a $200,000 home pays $1,208 in annual county taxes.\nThe county tax rate is currently 60.4 cents for every $100 of assessed value.\nState spending on education, while increasing, has in past years not kept up with inflation and a rising student population."}
