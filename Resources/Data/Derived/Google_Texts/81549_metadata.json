With hospitals expected to receive more insurance payments, the law included a series of cuts to the federal program that traditionally funded charity care.\n\nBut hospitals are concerned that the cuts will occur before enough people become newly insured through private insurance.\n\nThe cuts are due begin on January 1, with New Jersey hospitals potentially seeing a $29.3 million annual reduction in disproportionate share hospital (DSH) funding, which is part of the federal Medicaid program, according to Suzanne Ianni, president and CEO of the Hospital Alliance of New Jersey. The alliance, which represents the state\u2019s 16 safety-net hospitals, focused on the looming spending cuts during an event held Friday to mark the organization\u2019s 20th anniversary.\n\nWhile President Barack Obama has requested that the cuts be delayed until the fiscal year that starts next October, the delay itself has been stalled as part of ongoing federal budget talks.\n\nIanni believes that the safety-net hospitals should be protected from the cuts when they occur, at least until it\u2019s clear that insurance payment increases will offset the cuts that the hospitals would see.\n\nThe ACA was premature in scheduling funding cuts to hospitals before the increase in insurance clients was assured, according to alliance Chairman Joseph F. Scott, president and CEO of LibertyHealth System, which operates Jersey City Medical Center.\n\nWhile all Americans are required to buy insurance under the provisions of the ACA, Scott is concerned that the penalty in the first year \u2013 the greater of $95 or 1 percent of a person\u2019s income \u2013 will not be enough of an incentive.\n\nTechnical problems that have plagued the website for the federal healthcare marketplace or exchange also worry Scott. The site, healthcare.gov, is intended to be a one-stop shop for residents to purchase insurance and learn whether they\u2019re eligible for federal insurance subsidies.\n\n\u201cThe whole thought process was hospitals like ours would turn around and see all these people with insurance,\u201d Scott said. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m concerned. Between what\u2019s happening with the exchange, (hospitals) getting people to understand why it\u2019s important for them to have insurance and this whole timing issue of getting the cuts before people are on the exchange, it could have devastating impacts on hospitals that serve the highest-need populations.\u201d\n\nThe alliance also is pushing fora local hospital tax, which would allow the safety-net hospitals to qualify for federal funding to match the local funding. The bill is opposed by hospitals that serve fewer low-income residents, which contend that it sets a bad precedent for more local hospital taxes.\n\n\u201cIt's crazy for us not to get those matching dollars, particularly in light of the cuts that are coming,\u201d Scott said, adding that opponents of the bill \u201chave high operating margins and they don\u2019t serve the medically needy,\u201d and noting that other states have begun to explore whether hospitals with high operating margins should maintain their nonprofit status.\n\nThe alliance\u2019s lobbying effort at the state level is matched by a federal effort. Dr. Bruce Siegel, leader of America\u2019s Essential Hospitals, called the ACA an important milestone in improving the country\u2019s healthcare system, saying it could provide insurance for 600,000 to 800,000 New Jerseyans.\n\n\u201cIt will make this state a better place to do business,\u201d Siegel said, before adding that the bill\u2019s treatment of Medicaid cuts was an error. \u201cPurely and simply, getting the Affordable Care Act right means getting the safety-net right.\u201d\n\nIf the funding cuts occur without offsetting gains in insurance payments, \u201cyou\u2019ll be forced to make choices that no community should ever have to make,\u201d said Siegel, who was state health commissioner from 1992 to 1994.\n\nSiegel\u2019s organization, which represents safety-net hospitals nationally, is pushing for a three-year delay in any Medicaid funding cuts, so that federal officials can assess how the increase in insurance is progressing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s foolhardy and it\u2019s reckless,\u201d to make cuts based on pre-ACA data, Siegel said.\n\nEast Orange General Hospital President and CEO Kevin Slavin said cuts to his hospital\u2019s budget would force it to look at cutting programs that serve the broader region so it could maintain services to its local community.\n\n\u201cThe economic impact that these hospitals have on their cities is going to suffer as well,\u201d Slavin said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all learned that when the urban hospitals in the past have closed, it\u2019s not just healthcare and the individuals that have suffered, communities have suffered, with businesses closing, banks closing around the hospitals.\u201d\n\nSister Jane Frances Brady, the alliance\u2019s first leader, attended the event. She said the ongoing struggles for funding for the safety-net hospitals showed the continuing need for the alliance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there will ever be a time when these safety-net hospitals are financially secure,\u201d said Brady, adding that the alliance plays a vital role in protecting their interests.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://assets.njspotlight.com/assets/13/0807/2009"}, "google-site-verification": "eSiTqCyhbNrILKPNvPOLORFjlPbqSQLW3WfNOcpjdcg", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "NJ Spotlight", "description": "Safety-net hospital advocates say funding reductions could be premature, repeat call for local tax", "viewport": "width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde765\"", "article_summary": "Ianni believes that the safety-net hospitals should be protected from the cuts when they occur, at least until it\u2019s clear that insurance payment increases will offset the cuts that the hospitals would see.\n\u201cThe whole thought process was hospitals like ours would turn around and see all these people with insurance,\u201d Scott said.\nShe said the ongoing struggles for funding for the safety-net hospitals showed the continuing need for the alliance.\nThe site, healthcare.gov, is intended to be a one-stop shop for residents to purchase insurance and learn whether they\u2019re eligible for federal insurance subsidies.\nThe alliance, which represents the state\u2019s 16 safety-net hospitals, focused on the looming spending cuts during an event held Friday to mark the organization\u2019s 20th anniversary."}
