It happened at Central Florida hospitals from 2007 to 2011.\n\n\u201cThese actions put patients at needless risk in an attempt to boost profits at taxpayer expense,\u201d said Shimon R. Richmond, Special Agent in Charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in a statement. \u201cThis settlement demonstrates that such practices have consequences.\u201d\n\nFlorida Hospital said in a statement none of the patients had adverse effects. The hospital says the allegations were overbroad and incorrect, but resolved them to focus on patient care.\n\n\u201cAfter learning of the issue, we brought in two national patient safety experts to perform an exhaustive audit, reported this incident to appropriate health care agencies, and launched a broader review to ensure there were no other issues,\u201d Florida Hospital said in a statement. \u201cWe immediately implemented new procedures and have rectified billing issues by refunding all monies to the government. We stopped using hand-written physician orders, and implemented new supervisory protocols, training and electronic dosing.\u201d\n\nA whistleblower who filed the complaint will get a cut of the settlement.
