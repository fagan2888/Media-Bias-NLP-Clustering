Rick Perry delivered a powerful and soulful speech on Saturday at the South Carolina Freedom Summit, where he emphasized the critical need for experienced Republican leadership to turn America around from the slump it has fallen into over the past few years, specifically with regard to foreign policy.\n\n\u201cA recovery of epic proportion needs to be on the table for us,\u201d Perry said, emulating a commander-in-chief. \u201cAnd when we elect a Republican president in 2016, America will do better.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPerry, 65, has yet to announce whether he will run for president in 2016. Growing up in Paint Creek, Texas, Perry said his family didn\u2019t have a lot of money. In fact, he described how his mom would sew clothing for him up until he enrolled in college and mentioned that they didn\u2019t even have indoor plumbing for many years.\n\nWe never thought we were poor though. Because the fact is we were rich. We were very rich in values. We were taught the value in hard work, the importance of family. I was taught it was my duty to protect freedom for the next generation.\n\nHe volunteered to serve in the Air Force and relayed how his profound love and appreciation for the freedoms America affords its citizens amplified after he spent time in Asia and countries in the Middle East like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Turkey \u2014 nations whose citizens suffer from human rights abuses.\n\n\u201cCommon sense,\u201d Perry exclaimed would be the key to restoring America\u2019s place internationally. He called out President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cgross incompetence\u201d and \u201cnaive ideological ignorance,\u201d with regard to his inability to see the true evil that exists in this world and defeat it.\n\n\u201cWe watched the president end a war without a plan to keep the peace.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s premature troop withdrawal from Iraq amplified the strength of the Islamic State (ISIS, ISIL) throughout the region. Terrorists acting on behalf of the group are on U.S. soil in the form of now-activated sleeper cells.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this delusional thinking of the left which is epitomized by our president where criminals obey the gun laws; where state-sponsors of terrorism will put down their arms to obey a nuclear agreement; where radical groups like ISIS are not religious in nature.\n\nWith regard to Iran, Perry said the deal as it now stands \u201cdoesn\u2019t limit Iranian nuclear ambitions; it legitimizes it.\u201d\n\nPerry said 2016 will be a \u201cshow me, not tell me election\u201d where voters will look at what\u2019s tangibly been achieved. As the Lone Star State\u2019s longest-serving Governor, Perry had guided Texas through several crises which he said provides him with a solid foundation as to the skill sets required to run a nation that faces threats on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with America today that cannot be fixed with new leadership. I happen to believe that America\u2019s best days are in front of us. Let\u2019s let America be America again.\u201d\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rick Perry: Republican President Will Deliver 'Recovery of Epic Proportions'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rick Perry: Republican President Will Deliver 'Recovery of Epic Proportions'", "title": "Rick Perry Says America's Best Days Are Ahead", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Rick-Perry-confident-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-05-09T14:07:10-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/09/rick-perry-republican-president-will-deliver-recovery-of-epic-proportions/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rick Perry: Republican President Will Deliver 'Recovery of Epic Proportions'", "creator": "@AdelleNaz", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Rick-Perry-confident-AP.jpg", "title": "Rick Perry Says America's Best Days Are Ahead", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential races, Breitbart News, foreign policy, Iran, ISIS, Rick Perry, South Carolina Freedom Summit,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Rick Perry", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-05-09T12:21:18-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-05-09T14:07:10-07:00", "tag": "South Carolina Freedom Summit", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5d2\"", "article_summary": "Growing up in Paint Creek, Texas, Perry said his family didn\u2019t have a lot of money.\n\u201cAnd when we elect a Republican president in 2016, America will do better.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPerry, 65, has yet to announce whether he will run for president in 2016.\nI happen to believe that America\u2019s best days are in front of us.\n\u201cA recovery of epic proportion needs to be on the table for us,\u201d Perry said, emulating a commander-in-chief.\nLet\u2019s let America be America again.\u201dFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz"}
