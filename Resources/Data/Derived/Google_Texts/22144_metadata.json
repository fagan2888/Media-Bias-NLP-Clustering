Adam Levin from Credit.com offered some perspective on what happens if you don't pay.\n\nFirst, remember a late payment is a problem. Depending on which bill you pay late, it can drop your credit score by as much as 50 points or more. And remember that a credit score is what you need to get loans and good interest rates.\n\nSo here is a bit of a strategy: Pay your most important bill in full and first.\n\nMost credit experts agree your mortgage payment is your most important bill. So pay it, and pay it on time.\n\nIf you can\u2019t, you can try to contact your lender, but News4 has already heard from some who say reaching out to their mortgage companies has brought no relief at all.\n\nNext: Your credit card bills. Visa, Mastercard, even your department store cards.\n\nThese are a bit easier as most credit card bills provide you the option of making a minimum payment. Furloughed workers should consider just paying the minimum at this point and preserve cash.\n\nStudent loans are a bit tougher. You can ask for a hardship deferment, but it takes a while for those to be processed. Contact your loan officer and ask.\n\nSo which other bills are most important to pay? it\u2019s good to know which of your creditors report to the credit bureaus and which ones don\u2019t.\n\nTypically, late rental payments are not reported to the credit bureau. So talk to your landlord if you need to delay your rent check.\n\nLate utility payments are not typically reported, either. Again, contact Pepco, Dominion Virginia Power or Washington Gas and explain your situation.\n\nInsurance bills and medical bills also are not typically reported if they are late. So these may be bills you can negotiate a deferment.\n\nOne more thing to remember: Most lenders don\u2019t report a late payment until you are 30 days late. So making a payment a few days beyond the due date usually doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\nALSO SEE:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adam Levin from Credit.com offered some perspective on what happens if you don't pay bills.", "title": "Which Bills Should You Pay First During Furlough", "og": {"site_name": "NBC4 Washington", "description": "Adam Levin from Credit.com offered some perspective on what happens if you don't pay bills.", "title": "Which Bills Should You Pay First During Furlough", "url": "http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Which-Bills-Should-You-Pay-First-During-Furlough-227530451.html", "image": "http://media.nbcwashington.com/images/1200*675/holiday9-wallet-money-generic.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Adam Levin from Credit.com offered some perspective on what happens if you don't pay bills.", "title": "Which Bills Should You Pay First During Furlough", "url": "http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Which-Bills-Should-You-Pay-First-During-Furlough-227530451.html", "image": "http://media.nbcwashington.com/images/1200*675/holiday9-wallet-money-generic.gif?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcwashington", "site": "@nbcwashington", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 168641655540}, "keywords": "credit score, bill, furlough, shutdown, late, payment", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/nbcwashington"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "credit score, bill, furlough, shutdown, late, payment"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabd9\"", "article_summary": "Depending on which bill you pay late, it can drop your credit score by as much as 50 points or more.\nFor many furloughed federal employees, being able to pay their bills is a problem hitting home.\nInsurance bills and medical bills also are not typically reported if they are late.\nSo which other bills are most important to pay?\nSo pay it, and pay it on time."}
