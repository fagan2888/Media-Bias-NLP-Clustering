The current economic and employment plight of \u201cthe middle class\u201d is a go-to of President Obama\u2019s in speech after speech after speech, and yet measures of income inequality have only grown increasingly worse during the five years of his tenure.\n\nPerhaps, to more thoroughly explain the situation, we can look at a slightly more contained example of liberal policies working in precisely the way they are intended in one of our fifty laboratories of democracy, without all of that pesky and spiteful Republican \u201cobstruction\u201d standing in the way. I\u2019m referring, of course, to that sunny bastion of liberalism, California, and it just so happens that Joel Kotkin has an in-depth piece about the economic conditions in California over at the Daily Beast\u2026 detailing its growing rates of poverty, inequality, downward mobility, and elite-driven economy that, he argues, are bringing it dangerously close to model of medievalism:\n\nAs late as the 80s, California was democratic in a fundamental sense, a place for outsiders and, increasingly, immigrants\u2014roughly 60 percent of the population was considered middle class. Now, instead of a land of opportunity, California has become increasingly feudal. According to recent census estimates, the state suffers some of the highest levels of inequality in the country. By some estimates, the state\u2019s level of inequality compares with that of such global models as the Dominican Republic, Gambia, and the Republic of the Congo.\n\nAt the same time, the Golden State now suffers the highest level of poverty in the country\u201423.5 percent compared to 16 percent nationally\u2014worse than long-term hard luck cases like Mississippi. It is also now home to roughly one-third of the nation\u2019s welfare recipients, almost three times its proportion of the nation\u2019s population.\n\nLike medieval serfs, increasing numbers of Californians are downwardly mobile, and doing worse than their parents: native born Latinos actually have shorter lifespans than their parents, according to one recent report. Nor are things expected to get better any time soon. According to a recent Hoover Institution survey, most Californians expect their incomes to stagnate in the coming six months, a sense widely shared among the young, whites, Latinos, females, and the less educated.\n\nAnd sure, California can boast of plenty of wealth within its borders \u2014 especially if you happen to have a job in Hollywood or Silicon Valley.\n\nThe state\u2019s digital oligarchy, surely without intention, is increasingly driving the state\u2019s lurch towards feudalism. Silicon Valley\u2019s wealth reflects the fortunes of a handful of companies that dominate an information economy that itself is increasingly oligopolistic. In contrast to the traditionally conservative or libertarian ethos of the entrepreneurial class, the oligarchy is increasingly allied with the nominally populist Democratic Party and its regulatory agenda. Along with the public sector, Hollywood, and their media claque, they present California as \u201cthe spiritual inspiration\u201d for modern \u201cprogressives\u201d across the country.\n\nThrough their embrace of and financial support for the state\u2019s regulatory regime, the oligarchs have made job creation in non tech-businesses\u2014manufacturing, energy, agriculture\u2014increasingly difficult through \u201cgreen energy\u201d initiatives that are also sure to boost already high utility costs. One critic, state Democratic Senator Roderick Wright from heavily minority Inglewood, compares the state\u2019s regulatory regime to the \u201cvig\u201d or high interest charged by the Mafia, calling it a major reason for disinvestment in many industries.\n\nRead on for a lot of dismaying (and yet not very surprising) information, including Kotkin\u2019s illustrative definitions of California\u2019s new socioeconomic classes: The Oligarchs, the Clerisy, the New Serfs, and the Yeomanry. It ain\u2019t pretty, and with California\u2019s current Democratic supermajority ruling the roost, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m hoping for Californians\u2019 prospects to improve any time soon.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Oof.", "title": "Kotkin: So, California is looking kind of feudal these days, huh?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/10/06/kotkin-so-california-is-looking-kind-of-feudal-these-days-huh/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-06T21:01:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-06T03:15:29+00:00"}, "keywords": "California, Democrats, employment, jobs, majority, progressives, technology,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3815\"", "article_summary": "Kotkin: So, California is looking kind of feudal these days, huh?\nNow, instead of a land of opportunity, California has become increasingly feudal.\nAccording to recent census estimates, the state suffers some of the highest levels of inequality in the country.\nThe state\u2019s digital oligarchy, surely without intention, is increasingly driving the state\u2019s lurch towards feudalism.\nAlong with the public sector, Hollywood, and their media claque, they present California as \u201cthe spiritual inspiration\u201d for modern \u201cprogressives\u201d across the country."}
