After he droned through the usual spiel \u2013 website, 800-number etc. \u2013 Seacrest asked him about his recent highly publicized trip to a Gap store in New York City (where he was headlining a couple of fundraisers to woo liberal \u201c1 percenters\u201d able to shell out big bucks to for the Democrat defenders.)\n\nSeacrest ribbed Obama about a Gap sales woman who implied the president\u2019s taste in blue jeans was as lacking as his approach to Vladimir Putin.\n\nObama\u2019s response shows he takes personal offense more seriously than national defense. He\u2019s been, like, \u201cunfairly maligned.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is, generally, I look very sharp in jeans,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere was one episode like four years ago in which I was wearing some loose jeans, mainly because I was out on the pitcher\u2019s mound and I didn\u2019t want to feel confined while I was pitching, and I think I\u2019ve paid my penance for that. I got whacked pretty good. Since that time, my jeans fit very well.\u201d\n\nFrom another a less narcissistic president, a less artificial president \u2013 a guy named Mitt Romney comes to mind \u2013 this might have been funny, self-deprecating and friendly. From this president, from his tone and from his record, it sounded like he actually means it.\n\nHe really does think he looks sharp in jeans.\n\nVery sharp.\n\nCheck out the \u201cmommy jeans\u201d portion of the interview here. And when the president gets to the part about low-paid sales people, remember who he\u2019s on his way to mingle with as soon as he leaves the Gap.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Russia is in the middle of a land grab in Europe and his political party is heading for an election that could doom his last two years in office, but President Obama thinks the best way to spend his time is calling celebrity Ryan Seacrest\u2019s radio show to say he really does look sharp in \u2026", "title": "Obama whines to Ryan Seacrest: 'I've been unfairly maligned' about mommy jeans", "locale": {"alternate": "en_US", "identifier": "en_US"}, "image": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamajeans0315horiz.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-16T14:13:25+00:00", "url": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/2014/03/15/obama-whines-to-ryan-seacrest-ive-been-unfairly-maligned-about-mommy-jeans-106575", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "alexaVerifyID": "qC73ojZoktel85cbl12SAFJar9k", "fb": {"admins": "10152426200106417,10152720237657852,10200650572686956,3854753687919,100215693385946,549853448412696", "pages": 169204449790211, "app_id": 1502886339979348}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsToday", "section": "News", "published_time": "2014-03-15T12:49:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-16T14:13:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s been, like, \u201cunfairly maligned.\u201d\u201cThe truth is, generally, I look very sharp in jeans,\u201d Obama said.\nSeacrest ribbed Obama about a Gap sales woman who implied the president\u2019s taste in blue jeans was as lacking as his approach to Vladimir Putin.\nHe really does think he looks sharp in jeans.\nActually, he said he looks \u201cvery sharp\u201d in jeans.\nObama made the call Friday afternoon, as part of his nationwide sales pitch for the Obamacare scam."}
