McConnell had 12 points and six assists for the Wildcats, who shot 54 percent and could be in line for a No. 1 seed when the NCAA Tournament bracket is announced on Sunday.\n\n\u201cFor every great team, there comes a point where you really have to come together as a team and we\u2019ve done a great job of doing that,\u201d Ashley said after celebrating under a mammoth shower of confetti at center court. \u201cIt\u2019s just the right time; everyone seems to be clicking.\u201d\n\nOregon (25-9) was out of it almost from the start after Arizona went on two big first-half runs. The Ducks played better offensively in the second half, but had no chances of catching the racing Wildcats.\n\nJoseph Young had 19 points Dillon Brooks added 13 and for Oregon, which still should be in good position to get an NCAA Tournament invite on Selection Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe way it ended, everybody hates to lose, but at the same time, this is a young team and we\u2019ve just got to use it as a learning experience,\u201d Young said.\n\nArizona has been in this spot before; the Wildcats were playing in their fourth Pac-12 championship game in Sean Miller\u2019s six years as coach.\n\nWinning it has been another story. Arizona Pac 12 title drought included a loss to UCLA in the championship game last season.\n\nThe Wildcats won the regular-season title and got to this year\u2019s championship game by beating California and UCLA.\n\nOregon had a strong finish to the regular season, then beat Colorado and Utah to strengthen its NCAA Tournament chances.\n\nArizona rolled over the Ducks twice during the regular season, winning by 18 in Eugene and 24 in Tucson.\n\nThe Wildcats did it to the Ducks again, blowing past them with a 14-0 run in the first half and another 10-0 spurt to lead 36-21 at halftime.\n\nArizona hit 15 of 31 shots, had eight offensive rebounds and held the Ducks to 7-of-25 shooting. The Wildcats also hounded Young, holding him to seven points - two after a quick flurry to start the game - on 2-of-10 shooting.\n\n\u201cThroughout the first half, our shot selection was not good,\u201d Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \u201cThe ball didn\u2019t get moved, we took some off-balance ones, some very contested shots. Arizona is a very good defensive team and they got us out of our offensive rhythm for sure.\u201d\n\nOregon played better offensively in the second half and Young got untracked. The Ducks made 11 of 20 shots and Young confidently stroked in jumpers, scoring 13 in the half.\n\nOregon never put a dent in Arizona\u2019s lead, though, because it couldn\u2019t stop the Wildcats.\n\nArizona made 15 of 24 shots in the second half, stretching the lead even more as the clock wound down to put itself in position for a No. 1 seed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the conversation,\u201d Miller said.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nOregon: Elgin Cook and Arizona\u2019s Kaleb Tarczewski were called for double technical fouls in the second half after getting tangled and jawing at each other. \u2026 A few minutes later, Young was hit with a Flagrant 1 foul for taking a swipe at Tarczewski while fighting for a loose ball.\n\nArizona: The Wildcats had a 36-18 advantage in the paint and 37-20 rebounding. \u2026 Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had had seven points, nine rebounds and five assists.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOregon is likely headed to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nArizona is hoping for a high seed in the NCAA Tournament", "article_metadata": {"description": "Through all the success the Arizona Wildcats have had, the regular-season titles, the deep NCAA Tournament runs, they were hounded with one question: When are you going to win the Pac-12 Tournament again?", "Author": "JOHN MARSHALL", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Through all the success the Arizona Wildcats have had, the regular-season titles, the deep NCAA Tournament runs, they were hounded with one question: When are you going to win the Pac-12 Tournament again?", "title": "No. 5 Wildcats roll over Ducks 80-52 in Pac-12 title game", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/15/no-5-wildcats-roll-over-ducks-80-52-in-pac-12-titl/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/15/8627b6ade99dcc0b700f6a7067001f12.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/15/8627b6ade99dcc0b700f6a7067001f12.jpg", "title": "No. 5 Wildcats roll over Ducks 80-52 in Pac-12 title game", "description": "Through all the success the Arizona Wildcats have had, the regular-season titles, the deep NCAA Tournament runs, they were hounded with one question: When are you going to win the Pac-12 Tournament ag", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "5 Arizona ended 13 years of frustration with a dominating 80-52 win over Oregon in the Pac-12 Tournament championship game Saturday night.\nThe Wildcats won the regular-season title and got to this year\u2019s championship game by beating California and UCLA.\nThe Ducks played better offensively in the second half, but had no chances of catching the racing Wildcats.\nArizona has been in this spot before; the Wildcats were playing in their fourth Pac-12 championship game in Sean Miller\u2019s six years as coach.\nOregon had a strong finish to the regular season, then beat Colorado and Utah to strengthen its NCAA Tournament chances."}
