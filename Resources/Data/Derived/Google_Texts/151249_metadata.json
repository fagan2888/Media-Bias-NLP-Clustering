Viehbacher pictured in May. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nSanofi became the second European drug maker to be hit by cold winds from across the Atlantic Tuesday, as pharmaceutical companies reel from price squeezes in the U.S., their most profitable market.\n\nShares in Sanofi fell 8% as its forecast of flat diabetes drug sales next year stunned investors. Analysts had penciled in double-digit growth in the French company\u2019s most important business line.\n\nSales of its best-selling drug, the insulin Lantus, disappointed analysts in the third quarter, while its new forecast could spark low to mid-single digit earnings downgrades for 2015, estimates Deutsche Bank.\n\nU.S. pricing pressures have forced Sanofi to cut the price of Lantus in order to compete with rivals, and the company noted that \u201cthe increased rebates in the U.S. and the impact of the Affordable Care Act will continue in 2015.\u201d\n\nSanofi isn\u2019t the only drug maker feeling the chill. GlaxoSmithKline PLC cited U.S. price pressures in respiratory drugs as the main reason for its full-year earnings downgrade in July. Earlier this month, Glaxo Chief Executive Andrew Witty talked of a \u201cnew reality\u201d in pricing and competitor dynamics.\n\nAnd the market was quick to seize on wider implications from Sanofi\u2019s announcement Tuesday. Shares in Novo Nordisk, which markets Lantus\u2019 big competitor, the long-acting insulin Levemir, fell 3% in morning trading. Between them, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk dominate the U.S. insulin market.\n\nU.S. price pressures are particularly acute in the \u2018primary care\u2019 space, analysts note: these are drugs prescribed by general physicians, rather than those prescribed by hospital specialists.\n\nThat\u2019s partly due to increased competition, amid a wave of drug launches in areas like heart disease, diabetes and respiratory conditions.\n\nIt\u2019s also because payers are getting more aggressive and savvy, thinks Alistair Campbell, a health care analyst at Berenberg bank.\n\n\u201cThere are battles to be fought now, and where the payers can see a battle they can win they\u2019re definitely getting more effective at fighting them.\u201d\n\nU.S. pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts \u2013 which negotiates drug prices on behalf of employees and health insurers \u2013 excluded certain drugs from its suggested prescribing list this year, including Glaxo\u2019s Advair, and Novo Nordisk\u2019s insulins Novolin and Novolog, recommending doctors prescribe cheaper alternatives instead.\n\nThe U.S. payer market is also becoming more consolidated. Glaxo estimates that the top 10 commercial plans now control 86% of the marketplace, creating more visibility on contracting strategies and pricing.\n\n\u201cI think you have a general shift in power toward the purchaser,\u201d said Mr. Witty on a call to analysts last week.\n\nMr. Campbell thinks these dynamics could force a more widespread rethink of pricing expectations. He notes another worrying trend: that new drug launches have also been hit by the pricing squeeze, citing a \u201cpainfully slow\u201d start for U.S. prescriptions of Glaxo\u2019s new respiratory drug Anoro.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen right from the start difficult reimbursement discussions on new launches for even drugs that have reasonable data on clinical efficacy\u2013 now that is a concern.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Sanofi SA became the second European drug maker to be hit by cold winds from across the Atlantic Tuesday, as pharmaceutical companies reel from price squeezes in the U.S., their most profitable market.", "title": "Sanofi Stuns Investors as U.S. Price Pressure Bites", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/10/28/sanofi-stuns-investors-as-u-s-price-pressure-bites/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FF929_1028sa_P_20141028024550.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Sanofi Stuns Investors as U.S. Price Pressure Bites", "description": "Sanofi SA became the second European drug maker to be hit by cold winds from across the Atlantic Tuesday, as pharmaceutical companies reel from price squeezes in the U.S., their most profitable market.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Hester Plumridge", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Sanofi SA became the second European drug maker to be hit by cold winds from across the Atlantic Tuesday, as pharmaceutical companies reel from price squeezes in the U.S., their most profitable market.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-28T13:33:15-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/10/28/sanofi-stuns-investors-as-u-s-price-pressure-bites/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-28929", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Sanofi SA became the second European drug maker to be hit by cold winds from across the Atlantic Tuesday, as pharmaceutical companies reel from price squeezes in the U.S., their most profitable market.", "title": "Sanofi Stuns Investors as U.S. Price Pressure Bites", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/10/28/sanofi-stuns-investors-as-u-s-price-pressure-bites/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FF929_1028sa_P_20141028024550.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-28929", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-28T13:33:37-04:00"}, "article_summary": "GlaxoSmithKline PLC cited U.S. price pressures in respiratory drugs as the main reason for its full-year earnings downgrade in July.\nShares in Sanofi fell 8% as its forecast of flat diabetes drug sales next year stunned investors.\nThat\u2019s partly due to increased competition, amid a wave of drug launches in areas like heart disease, diabetes and respiratory conditions.\nHe notes another worrying trend: that new drug launches have also been hit by the pricing squeeze, citing a \u201cpainfully slow\u201d start for U.S. prescriptions of Glaxo\u2019s new respiratory drug Anoro.\nU.S. price pressures are particularly acute in the \u2018primary care\u2019 space, analysts note: these are drugs prescribed by general physicians, rather than those prescribed by hospital specialists."}
