Crews have rescued 48 people from two tram cars at a New Hampshire ski resort after it became stuck 40 feet off the ground in sub-zero temperatures.

The trams became stuck shortly before 2 p.m. Sunday at Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway in Franconia in the White Mountains.

WMUR-TV reports one of their editors was on one tram. Paula Tracy said she evacuated around 4:45 p.m. She said the people on the trams, mostly adult skiers, felt a "jolt" before they stopped.

A Cannon Mountain spokesman said people were rappelled down to safety from the lower and upper parts of the car.

He said officials said there was a service brake issue. Crews do not believe the cold temperature was a factor.

No injuries have been reported.
