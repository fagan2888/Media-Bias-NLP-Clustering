Shall we stick him in the clink, do we put him in Wandsworth [prison] or somewhere?'\n\n'I don't think you can actually do that. Surely it's the public who have got to enforce the TV debates by the reaction to people who are too scared to turn up.'\n\nLabour said the new system would work on similar lines to the current rules for planning the number, length and timing of party political broadcasts.\n\nThat would mean parties are consulted but not given the right to veto the debates taking place.\n\nEd Miliband has accused David Cameron of 'running scared' of facing him in televised leaders' debates\n\nLabour believes this could be done by establishing the Broadcasters' Liaison Group as a trust in statute so it is the recognised legal body for deciding dates, format, volume and attendees of the debates.\n\nA Labour government would set a deadline of 2017 for changes to be put in place, giving more than enough time to plan the debates for a 2020 election.\n\nMr Miliband told The Observer: 'In recent days the British public has been treated to the unedifying and tawdry spectacle of a prime minister seeking to duck out of the TV debates he once claimed to support with great enthusiasm.'\n\nHe said the broadcasters had 'made it clear they would not be cowed by his tactics but it is wrong for them and the British public to have governing parties use this kind of pressure in campaign periods'.\n\nMr Miliband added: 'It is time to ensure, once and for all, that these debates belong to the people, not the prime minister of the day.'\n\nThe four broadcasters - the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel 4 - have said they will stick to their previously-announced plans for three debates during the election campaign, and urged the Prime Minister to 'reconsider' his refusal to take part in these shows, including a head-to-head showdown with Mr Miliband.\n\nEducation Secretary Nicky Morgan (left) said the broadcasters had made a 'mess' of the election debates, but Harriet Harman accused David Cameron of trying to scupper them\n\nMr Cameron, Nick Clegg and Gordon Brown faced off in TV debates ahead of the 2010 general election\n\nBut Mr Cameron's chief spin doctor Craig Oliver said their response was 'disappointing' and restated the Prime Minister's 'final position' was for a single debate to take place in the week starting March 23.\n\nThe broadcasters said they would stick to plans for a seven-way debate involving Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Nick Clegg of the Lib Dems and the leaders of the Greens, Ukip, Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru on ITV on April 2, followed by a second show on BBC featuring the same line-up on April 16.\n\nA final one-on-one clash with the Tory and Labour leaders invited is scheduled to be broadcast on Sky News and Channel 4 on April 30 - exactly a week before the May 7 election.\n\nIn a letter to Mr Oliver, the broadcasters made clear they were ready to go ahead with the debates even if Mr Cameron decides not to take part.\n\nDowning Street's Director of Communications Craig Oliver has rejected the broadcasters' ultimatum\n\nEducation Secretary Nicky Morgan today accused the broadcasters of making a 'real hash' of trying to organise the debates.\n\nShe said: 'The prime minister has made a very clear offer. A 90-minute debate involving everybody the week of March 23.\n\n'So we get to the short campaign ... we can get out into the country.'\n\nAsked on Sky News' Murnaghan specifically about a head to head between Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron, she replied: 'They are up against each other pretty well every week at prime minister's questions.\n\n'Frankly I think the broadcasters have made a real hash of this because the processes and discussions have been going on for months and months now.\n\n'They invited this party and that party. The prime minister has made a very clear offer - get seven parties in the same place, have a 90-minute debate before the campaign starts.\n\n'Otherwise all we are doing all the way through the campaign itself is talking about the debates.\n\n'I think actually we ought to be ... getting out of Westminster, getting out of the TV studios ... talking to people on the campaign trail.'\n\nBut deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman said there should be a legal framework underpinning the TV debates as there is in relation to pre-election broadcasts and election spending.\n\nShe told Sky News' Murnaghan: 'I think the debates are an important part of our democracy, in which case let's not have the prime minister of the day ducking and weaving because he is afraid of actually justifying his record.\n\n'Let's have a legal framework set out and then we won't have this all over again next time round.\n\n'The bottom line is - it is not too late for David Cameron to actually say ... I think if somebody is saying I want to be prime minister, I want to be in Number 10 Downing Street, but by the way I'm not going to go out there and debate it, it's not acceptable.\n\n'He should have the guts to go out there and say, this is what I have done since I have been prime minister and this is what I want to do next.\n\n'The fact he won't do that shows that he is not prepared to justify what he has done over the last few years.\n\n'All he seems to be doing is talking up other parties in fact.\n\n'Our democracy is important, more important than any one particular party. It is about people in this country being able to see what they are voting for.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Cameron,given,campaign,BBC,fails,TV,debates", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2985293/Cameron-given-campaign-BBC-fails-TV-debates.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "The BBC is understood to have backed down from threats to 'empty chair' Mr Cameron if he refuses to debate Ed Miliband.
