As they eat, a group of four U.S. Air Force A-10 pilots talk about their war against Daesh, which is what the U.S. military and its coalition partners call ISIS.\n\nEven with their close-cropped hair and tan flight suits, there\u2019s nothing outwardly remarkable about the pilots. They might pass for any other Americans in their late 20s and early 30s. They smile a lot as they talk and casually tease each other based on inside jokes accumulated after living and working together 24/7 for about five months. Most have families and children back home. They have the normal complaints for deployed troops, including restrictions on mustache size, which is a major topic of conversation. Dinner at a U.S. military chow hall in 1944 probably wouldn\u2019t be very different from this one.\n\nAs the pilots talk, they use all the familiar lingo and clich\u00e9d expressions common to military aviation. But among the typical lexicon there\u2019s another word they use a lot, which seems to stand out from the rest: \u201chunting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing stuff here that I never thought I\u2019d get to do,\u201d one pilot, an Air Force major said. \u201cWe\u2019re hunting. And there are very few sorties when you\u2019re not shooting.\u201d\n\nMany U.S. military pilots and other personnel have chosen not to reveal their identities due to security concerns. Mainly, they\u2019re concerned about domestic ISIS sleeper cells retaliating on their families back in the U.S.\u2014a threat they consider deadly serious.\n\nThe pilots say their mindset flying against ISIS is different from the one they had in Afghanistan, a theater in which most of these pilots have also flown in combat. In Afghanistan, they say, they had a defensive mindset; the priority was to defend U.S. troops on the ground with close air support. In the war on Daesh over Iraq and Syria, however, they describe their mindset as offensive. In addition to close air support and bombing missions, they also fly air interdiction missions in which they patrol for targets of opportunity\u2014essentially hunting for ISIS militants to kill. And they kill a lot. Sometimes one pilot will kill dozens of ISIS fighters in one sortie.\n\nEach pilot flies every one to three days, racking up about 100 combat hours a month. Due to the large airspace they patrol, the sorties are long, sometimes lasting about eight hours. The pilots prepare their bodies to endure the physical demands of long missions in a single-seat attack aircraft with massages and special workout programs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like professional athletes at the end of a season,\u201d a pilot said. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting a legit war here, and it\u2019s active.\u201d\n\nStalemate\n\nOverall, Operation Inherent Resolve (the U.S.-led combined joint task force in Iraq and Syria) is killing about 1,000 ISIS fighters a month. The death toll roughly matches the number of new recruits ISIS is able to field each month, effectively capping its manpower strength at about 30,000 to 40,000 fighters.\n\n\u201cThis is a war, just based on the magnitude of the people we\u2019re killing.\u201d said Col. Michael Koscheski, commander of the 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing (the iconic \u201cRed Tails\u201d from World War II in which the Tuskegee Airmen flew) in an interview from an undisclosed deployed location.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re killing a lot of them\u2014I mean a lot,\u201d Koscheski added. \u201cThe body count is a factor. It\u2019s not the only factor, but it\u2019s a factor. It will be interesting to see if Daesh can maintain its current attrition rate.\u201d\n\nAlthough Operation Inherent Resolve comprises more than 60 countries, only 12 are actively conducting airstrikes. According to Department of Defense data released Sept. 8, the coalition has conducted 6,700 airstrikes and flown an estimated 53,278 total sorties.\n\nU.S. and coalition commanders explain their overall objective in Operation Inherent Resolve as twofold\u2014both to destroy ISIS and to train and equip the Iraqi Security Forces, Kurdish Peshmerga, and Free Syrian Army to take back territory under ISIS control and to eventually shoulder the fight on their own.\n\n\u201cSuccess is the implosion of Daesh from within,\u201d Koscheski said. \u201cOver time it will be like a cancer; it will eat itself from the inside out.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the Iraqis have to do this for themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the end goal. Without Iraqi ground troops to take back ground, the effectiveness of air power is limited.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are here to defeat Daesh,\u201d Air Force Col. Clarence Lukes Jr., commander of the 386th Air Expeditionary Wing, said in an interview. \u201cBut this has to have an Iraqi solution.\u201d\n\nKoscheski estimated that U.S. involvement in the war on ISIS will be a long-term endeavor, lasting for perhaps another five to seven years, he said.\n\n\u201cAmericans want a clean end and a ticker tape parade, and that\u2019s not going to happen here,\u201d Koscheski said. \u201cBut it\u2019s by no means hopeless.\u201d\n\nAfter nearly a year, the war against ISIS is at a stalemate. ISIS is no longer able to mass personnel or equipment to take new ground\u2014air power alone has stopped its advance. But the ability of air power to win the war against ISIS has hit its limit. It will now take an effective ground force to retake territory conquered by ISIS and to achieve ultimate victory.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no clear winner at this point,\u201d Lukes said. \u201cThere are still areas that are highly contested.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while to take back territory because we don\u2019t have boots on the ground to fight,\u201d a senior coalition Air Force officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to security concerns and restrictions on media communication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the Iraqis to take the initiative,\u201d he added.\n\nOne of the key victories for coalition air power was the battle for Kobani, Syria, in which U.S. warplanes\u2014principally B-1 supersonic bombers\u2014pummeled ISIS fighters with heavy bombing. Unlike other urban centers in the Iraq-Syria battle space, civilians had evacuated Kobani, allowing U.S. warplanes more latitude to inflict heavy damage. The resulting airstrikes were catastrophic for ISIS fighters.\n\n\u201cAir power saved Kobani,\u201d Koscheski said. \u201cBut we leveled it to save it. It was annihilated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe killed thousands,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was like human fodder.\u201d\n\nISIS no longer has freedom of movement and has changed its tactics to adapt to the threat of U.S. and coalition air power. Gone are the days of brazen ISIS fighters clad in all black, parading triumphantly through captured villages in Toyota Hiluxes while trailing their signature black flags.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re doing that now, they\u2019re dying,\u201d Koscheski said. \u201cThe Daesh that you see in a lot of news clips doesn\u2019t exist any more. Now they\u2019re cowering and running between buildings.\u201d\n\nA Just War\n\nThere is a humble lethality in the way the A-10 pilots talk about killing. They chuckle and eat ice cream for dessert as they tell stories about panic-stricken ISIS fighters accidentally running toward the distinctive sound of the A-10\u2019s 30-mm Gatling cannons, or of an ISIS fighter who did a swan dive to his death off a cliff while trying to escape an A-10 attack.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw that, I just radioed: \u2018He\u2019s dead,\u2019\u201d one pilot, an Air Force major, dryly explained.\n\n\u201cThey say they love death more than we love life,\u201d another pilot, a captain, said. \u201cBut they always flee when we attack. I\u2019ve never seen one not try to get away.\u201d\n\nThe pilots\u2019 eyes seem to focus on yours a half-beat longer than normal as they matter-of-factly describe strafing an enemy checkpoint, or killing ISIS fighters one by one as they attempt to escape doomed tanks and armored personnel carriers. Sometimes a pilot will lean back in his chair with eyes open wide, slowly shaking his head as he describes the carnage he has inflicted on the enemy. But there is no remorse, not even the hint of it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a bad dream or lost one ounce of sleep,\u201d one pilot, an Air Force major, said. \u201cWe face an evil enemy, and we fight them honorably.\u201d\n\nThe pilots say they enjoy their work, but it is the pleasure of executing a mission with precision and no mistakes. \u201cIt\u2019s personal, but in a professional way,\u201d one pilot explained. \u201cWe have a job to do. But ISIS is pure evil, and we have no problem killing them.\u201d\n\nAnd there is no questioning the justice of the war. U.S. pilots and their coalition partners say they are fighting in Iraq and Syria to prevent the \u201ccancer\u201d of ISIS from spreading.\n\n\u201cWe see the videos,\u201d an A-10 pilot said, speaking about the videos released online of ISIS militants beheading and immolating prisoners. \u201cAnd that takes away any hesitation to kill. The only thing that gives me pause is what happens if I have to eject.\u201d\n\nNo Plan B\n\nThe fate of a downed pilot over ISIS territory is one of the coalition\u2019s greatest concerns. U.S. pilots report the current surface-to-air threat over Iraq and Syria is markedly higher than over Afghanistan. A-10 pilots say AAA (anti-aircraft) fire is prevalent, with tracers sometimes coming close enough to be visible in daytime. And according to Koscheski, there is also a theater-wide threat of MANPADS (Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems, or shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles). No A-10s have yet suffered battle damage, although an Air Force F-16 came back from one mission with bullet holes, Koscheski said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real threat here, unlike in Afghanistan,\u201d an A-10 pilot said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few close calls. Do we respect the threat? Yes. Are we afraid of it? No.\u201d\n\nAt an undisclosed base in the region, U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 tilt rotor aircraft are deployed to support a Marine TRAP (Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel) unit. The MV-22 crews are on alert 24 hours a day to recover downed pilots and to respond to other crises, including an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.\n\n\u201cThose links between Benghazi are here,\u201d said Marine 1st Lt. Matt Gregory. \u201cBut the likelihood of an event like that is very small.\u201d\n\nSo far the Marine TRAP unit has responded to retrieve downed remotely piloted aircraft (the military\u2019s term for drones) but has not yet had to recover a pilot. \u201cThat\u2019s our Super Bowl,\u201d said Marine Capt. Steven Ritter, an MV-22 pilot.\n\nThe fate of 26-year-old Jordanian F-16 pilot Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh, whom ISIS burned alive and released a video of his execution online, has highlighted the life-or-death stakes for recovering downed U.S. and coalition airmen before they fall into enemy hands.\n\n\u201cIt was a game-changer,\u201d Koscheski said, speaking about the immolation video. \u201cIn Vietnam and in past wars, captured pilots could expect to be hurt or even tortured. But they weren\u2019t burned alive in a cage. There\u2019s no plan B here. You either save the guy or he goes down swinging.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of four U.S. Air Force A-10 pilots talk about their war against Daesh, which is what the U.S. military and its coalition partners call ISIS.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A group of four U.S. Air Force A-10 pilots talk about their war against Daesh, which is what the U.S. military and its coalition partners call ISIS.", "title": "How the US and Its Allies Are Fighting ISIS", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150914_WaronISIS_Peterson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-14T21:52:33+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OQtwQy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A group of four U.S. Air Force A-10 pilots talk about their war against Daesh, which is what the U.S. military and its coalition partners call ISIS.", "title": "How the US and Its Allies Are Fighting ISIS", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150914_WaronISIS_Peterson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-09-14T12:57:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T21:52:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ISIS, Daesh, Iraq, Syria"}, "article_summary": "U.S. pilots and their coalition partners say they are fighting in Iraq and Syria to prevent the \u201ccancer\u201d of ISIS from spreading.\nA-10 pilots say AAA (anti-aircraft) fire is prevalent, with tracers sometimes coming close enough to be visible in daytime.\nThe pilots say their mindset flying against ISIS is different from the one they had in Afghanistan, a theater in which most of these pilots have also flown in combat.\nOne of the key victories for coalition air power was the battle for Kobani, Syria, in which U.S. warplanes\u2014principally B-1 supersonic bombers\u2014pummeled ISIS fighters with heavy bombing.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a bad dream or lost one ounce of sleep,\u201d one pilot, an Air Force major, said."}
