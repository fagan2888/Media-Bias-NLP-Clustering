Ever since I\u2019ve returned, every Lannister I\u2019ve seen has been a miserable pain in my ass.\u201d \u2013 Jaime Lannister\n\nYesterday, a colleague of mine posted a piece comparing the ideology and politics \u2013 such as they are \u2013 of George R.R. Martin\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d with that of the modern day Republican Party. I\u2019d say that last night\u2019s episode of the HBO adaptation clearly focused on a much more organic, enduring, but equally \u2013 if not more \u2013 confounding unit of humanity: the family.\n\nThe Kingslayer quipped the above after taking a browbeating from Brienne of Tarth about not living up to his promise to unite the remaining members of the decimated Stark clan. Minutes earlier, his father had sought to saddle him with his heritage \u2014 that is, he threatened to send Jaime back to the Lannister\u2019s ancestral home of Casterly Rock to assume the role of patriarch. Jaime angrily rejected the notion of starting a family. Instead, he sought the solace of his sister who, in turn, rejected him. Jaime Lannister\u2019s frustration, however offhand, seemed to sum up everyone\u2019s underlying troubles last night.\n\nOn two separate occasions, his brother was forced to serve as a dumping ground for worthy gripes against his family. It is a clever and subtle note that, as Master of Coin, Tyrion is stuck accounting for the sins of the Lannisters. Unlike his brother, though, Tyrion appears to be ready to accept the familial responsibilities foisted onto him by his father. Begrudgingly, he intends to settle down with the unwilling Sansa Stark to continue the Lannister lineage. (As long as we\u2019re getting all symbolic-like, the forging of the two swords in the opening sequence can be seen not only as a metaphor for the degradation of the Stark line, but as a symbol that the Lannister ascendance is dependent on it.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Season 4 begins, the Lannisters and Starks struggle with their respective legacies", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones:\u201d Family is a burden", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As Season 4 begins, the Lannisters and Starks struggle with their respective legacies", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones:\u201d Family is a burden", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/07/family_unfair_game_of_thrones_premieres/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/game_of_thrones2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Season 4 begins, the Lannisters and Starks struggle with their respective legacies", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones:\u201d Family is a burden", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/game_of_thrones2.jpg", "creator": "@Neil_Salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Neil Drumming", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, a song of ice and fire, Family, Game of Thrones, HBO, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: a song of ice and fire, Family, Game of Thrones, HBO, TV, Entertainment News\u201cAre you sure we\u2019re not related?\nJaime Lannister\u2019s frustration, however offhand, seemed to sum up everyone\u2019s underlying troubles last night.\nMartin\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d with that of the modern day Republican Party.\nOn two separate occasions, his brother was forced to serve as a dumping ground for worthy gripes against his family.\nJaime angrily rejected the notion of starting a family."}
