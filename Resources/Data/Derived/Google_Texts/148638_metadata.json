She doesn't have all the jewelry and dresses because she's just helping. She finds out the elephants in the parade are very mistreated and helps one escape.\n\nHow did you come up with that topic?\n\nI went to Sri Lanka with my family last summer and got to see a parade on the last night. We could see the elephants had chains.\n\nWhat do you like about writing?\n\nThere's always a lot going on in my head. It's really to put my thoughts down on paper. I write in a personal journal. It's really nice to turn it into something that I can look back on.\n\nWhat do you like about Jarrow?\n\nI can learn about things visually. It's really helpful. I can see why an answer comes out the way it comes out.\n\nWhat's your advice for other writers?\n\nJust don't worry about what others are going to think of your writing. Write about whatever you want to. Don't let other people get in your way.\n\nWhat other activities do you enjoy?\n\nI have danced since I was 5. I do hip hop and jazz and some ballet. I take voice lessons and enjoy playing the guitar. I like to sing and perform a lot. I write music, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat's your dream job?\n\nI want to be an author and a singer and maybe be on a dance team.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_27807713/student-spotlight-anya-chavez-11-year-old-sixth", "modificationDate": "2015-03-28T22:40:03-0600", "sailthru.section": "Boulder Education & Schools", "endDate": "2025-03-28T21:31:16-0600", "description": "Anya Chavez, 11-year-old sixth-grader at Jarrow Montessori School\n\nAnya was the sixth-grade winner in the  StoryMakers state-wide competition for creative writing.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27807713:view"}, "startDate": "2015-03-28T22:39:04-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_27807713/student-spotlight-anya-chavez-11-year-old-sixth", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Anya Chavez, 11-year-old sixth-grader at Jarrow Montessori School\n\nAnya was the sixth-grade winner in the  StoryMakers state-wide competition for creative writing.", "title": "Student Spotlight: Anya Chavez, 11-year-old sixth-grader at Jarrow Montessori School"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Anya Chavez, 11-year-old sixth-grader at Jarrow Montessori School\n\nAnya was the sixth-grade winner in the  StoryMakers state-wide competition for creative writing.", "title": "Student Spotlight: Anya Chavez, 11-year-old sixth-grader at Jarrow Montessori School", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_27807713/student-spotlight-anya-chavez-11-year-old-sixth", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-28T22:39:04-0600", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "sailthru.title": "Student Spotlight: Anya Chavez, 11-year-old sixth-grader at Jarrow Montessori School", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "news_keywords": "news information  boulder county schools elementary middle high preps", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0328/20150328__29DCASPO~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-03-28T22:40:51-0600", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}}, "article_summary": "I wrote a thousand-word story about a girl living in Sri Lanka who is setting up for a parade.\nI went to Sri Lanka with my family last summer and got to see a parade on the last night.\nClick photo to enlarge \u00ab1\u00bbAnya Chavez, 11-year-old sixth-grader at Jarrow Montessori SchoolAnya was the sixth-grade winner in the StoryMakers state-wide competition for creative writing.\nThere's always a lot going on in my head.\nShe finds out the elephants in the parade are very mistreated and helps one escape."}
