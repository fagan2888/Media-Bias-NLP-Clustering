Bill de Blasio speaks to the backs of law enforcement at slain cop’s funeral

This was the scene outdoors Saturday as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed a throng at the funeral of slain NYPD officer Rafael Ramos:

Officers outside the church where the funeral was being held turned their backs to a video monitor showing de Blasio’s remarks, continuing a trend of law enforcement giving the beleaguered mayor the cold shoulder. De Blasio has come under intense criticism from police union officials for what they perceive as disparaging and dangerous treatment of law enforcement.

The New York Post summed up the overtly toxic relationship with this anecdote:

After the funeral, about 100 police officers, firefighters and others who had stood vigil for ­Ramos made their way to Teedee’s Tavern, about two blocks from the church.

A firefighter hopped up onto a table, a beer in one hand and a camera in the other, taking pictures of the packed bar.

“Here’s to Ramos! Here’s to the NYPD!” he shouted, to the cheers of those assembled.

“And f–k de Blasio!” he added, raising a raucous response from the crowd.

Still, some public individuals have tried to look beyond the present contentiousness. The leader of a national organization for Latino police called on anti-de Blasio officers Sunday to “rise above the rhetoric and be more professional,” Newsday reported, urging that the focus remain on honoring Ramos.

Additionally, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani offered his support to de Blasio “when it comes to the safety of this city and our police officers,” according to an anonymous politician quoted by the Post who witnessed an exchange between the two Saturday.
