Even though the prison is long gone, a surprising controversy lives on. As late as 1999, for example, \u201cCivil War News\u201d castigated Rock Island as \u201cthe Andersonville of the North,\u201d thereby linking it to the notorious prison camp in Georgia.\n\nThe charge is false, if not slanderous. While more than 30 percent of the prisoners at Andersonville died there, only 16 percent of the inmates died at Rock Island. That percentage can be qualified because of a smallpox epidemic introduced by some prisoners.\n\nSo what accounts for the persistent myth of cruel treatment at Rock Island? It\u2019s the result of a slow government response to the smallpox, rash comments by a prison official, the bias of a local newspaper editor and a few passages in the famed novel \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d\n\nOpened in July 1863 as a complex of 84 barracks, Rock Island was primitive at best, and many of the prisoners arrived in poor physical condition. By the end of February 1864, smallpox, pneumonia and diarrhea had claimed nearly 700 lives in the camp, guards as well as prisoners.\n\nThis is not to say that the prison superintendent, Adolphus Johnson, was indifferent to the crisis. He quaran\u00adtined infected prisoners and vaccinated the healthy ones. He constructed a hospital to care for those with chronic and infectious diseases, and by July the epidemic had passed.\n\nBut the rumors of mistreatment did not die, thanks to J.B. Danforth Jr., the editor of the Rock Island Argus, who published undocumented stories about the \u201cdeliberate\u201d murder of prisoners at the camp. Danforth claimed that prisoners were being starved to death, and he speculated that disease was rampant on the island. A steady drumbeat of articles throughout 1864 condemned the prison administrators as little more than war criminals.\n\nEven though Johnson mounted a vigorous defense, the rumors persisted. And in November, he gave momentum to the controversy by insinuating that Danforth was a traitor who should be incarcerated. The superintendent was quickly excoriated in the Argus and other newspapers.\n\nCircumstances on Rock Island changed in 1865. The war ended in April, the prison closed in July and the property was sold to the Army for the construction of an ordnance arsenal. The barracks were torn down and all that remained were the graves of 1,960 prisoners and 171 guards, all who were victims of disease.\n\nInterest in Rock Island faded after the war, and statistics revealed that mortality was far lower there than at all but one Union prison. More important, facts also revealed that the death rate at Rock Island was nowhere close to the horrendous losses at Andersonville.\n\nAlthough the myth of cruelty on Rock Island was dormant for several decades, it did not die altogether. It took only a few passages from Margaret Mitchell, the author of \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d to bring the myth back to life. It was in her blockbuster novel that Mitchell relayed the news that Ashley Wilkes was not dead, that he was in prison on Rock Island.\n\n\u201cIn their first joy,\u201d Mitchell wrote of the Wilkes family, \u201cthey could think of nothing except that he was alive. But when calmness began to return, they looked at one another and said \u2018Rock Island!\u2019 in the same voice they would have said \u2018In Hell!\u2019 \u201d\n\nMitchell goes on to repeat many of the rumors that had swirled around Rock Island during the war. \u201cAt no place were the conditions worse than at Rock Island,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFood was scanty, one blanket did for three men, and the ravages of smallpox, pneumonia and typhoid gave the place the name of a pesthouse. Three-fourths of all the men sent there never came out alive.\u201d\n\nIt was powerful prose, but poor history.\n\nThe passages on Rock Island constituted little more than two pages in a novel of over 1,000 pages, but they became conventional wisdom after the book was published in 1936. Certainly for those who believed that there was equal nobility in the service of Union and Confederate soldiers in the field of battle, so also apologists for the South argued that there was equal horror in the prison camps of the North and the South.\n\nAlthough historians have proved this argument false, the myth, like the island and the cemetery, lives on.\n\nNo one said that history was fair.\n\nTHE AUTHOR: TIMOTHY WALCH of Iowa City is a member of the Iowa Civil War Sesquicentennial Commission.
