Debbie Wasserman Schultz expanded on the Democrats\u2019 agenda regarding the Affordable Care Act, voter rights and the \u201ctransparent\u201d efforts of Republican Party to make inroads into minority communities.\n\n\u201cI talked about the importance of making sure that we not roll back all of the progress we\u2019ve been able to make over the past almost seven years under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, whether it\u2019s the 16 million Americans who benefited from access to quality, affordable healthcare that they have not previously had, to voting rights, which is obviously right in the wheelhouse of the NAACP,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to reiterate that we have to all stand and remain vigilant to ensure [voters are protected], whether its photo ID laws, or early voting hours, or weekend voting, or protecting the \u2018souls to the polls Sundays\u2019 [church-voter education effort].\u201d\n\nSchultz, a Florida Democrat representing parts of Broward and Miami\u2013Dade Counties, said the Republicans \u201care all in lockstep, led by their governors across the country,\u201d to try to derail progress made regarding voter ID.\n\nShultz, as a veteran legislator, is intimately aware that voter ID is a lightning-rod issue, especially in her home state, which requires photo identification to vote.\n\nAccording to the Florida Division of Elections, voters there will be asked to provide acceptable forms of identification; if voters there do not have an acceptable form of photo ID, they can still cast a provisional ballot. Pennsylvania is one of several states that do not require a photo ID at the polls.\n\nSchultz reiterated her belief that Republicans \u2014 especially Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 are still \u201ctrying to throw obstacles\u201d in the path of voters who would more likely vote Democrat.\n\nTo counter, the DNC is in the midst of a nationwide voter expansion program and working with organizations such as the NAACP and other allied groups, to help register voters and ensure they get to the polls.\n\nShultz took umbrage with the GOP presidential candidate slate in general \u2014 and with Walker in particular \u2014 for their positions on voter ID and what Shultz perceived as the party\u2019s less than authentic recent catering of the African\u2013American community.\n\n\u201cScott Walker announced [his presidential candidacy on Monday], and whether it\u2019s Scott Walker, or Rand Paul, or Jeb Bush, the Republicans are trying to make a show over their outreach to the African\u2013American community, and I stress [that voters remember] you are dealing with a party that ignored the African\u2013American and other minority communities for many, many years,\u201d Shultz said. \u201cNow, they\u2019re suddenly putting some window\u2013dressing around their record, but when you have a guy like Rand Paul who opposes both the Voting Rights Act and Civil Rights Act, a guy who says that we shouldn\u2019t be giving special rights to people based on behavior like folks in the LGBTQ community, you have to recognize what people say and what they do are two separate things, and that both matter.\u201d\n\nThe GOP has ramped up its outreach efforts both regionally and nationwide.\n\nThe Pennsylvania GOP recently appointed Ryan Sanders as its African\u2013American inclusion director, to lobbying minority voters, particularly in Philadelphia, on the merits of the Republican agenda. The Republican National Committee recently embarked on a \u201cCommitted to Community\u201d voter mobilization campaign, which is being promoted as a \u201cfirst\u2013of\u2013its\u2013kind collaboration between the RNC and a Black media outlet,\u201d Radio One.\n\nThe national GOP apparently took a page out of Obama\u2019s successful field team management playbook of connecting with the youth by partnering with a hip and trendy outlet.\n\nRNC Chairman Reince Priebus released a statement celebrating the pact.\n\n\u201cWe are on the move,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cAs chairman of the RNC we are engaging every voter, not taking any voter for granted, and not overlooking any opportunity to share our message. For too long, some have peddled the idea that only one party cares about communities of color. Not true. We have stepped up our ground game in communities of color.\n\n\u201cExpect to see more RNC staff in diverse communities, discussing our shared values and actively recruiting people from across the country,\u201d Priebus added. \u201cVoters will hear from us often and in Black media outlets like Radio One to share our message, mobilize new activists and ask for their vote.\u201d\n\nShultz acknowledged that GOP play was \u201csmart\u201d and somewhat effective, but said voters need to be mindful of the combination of policy, message, strategy and tactics when considering the outreach efforts of the GOP.\n\n\u201cRepublican policies haven\u2019t changed at all,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cBy way of example, just last week, at the same hour that the Confederate flag was coming down in South Carolina, the Republicans were trying to ensure and codify \u2014 beyond the president\u2019s executive policy on flag flying in national parks \u2014 they were trying to put it into law and say that Confederate flags could fly or be displayed in national parks. This is in the same hour.\n\n\u201cThere was so much backlash, because they got caught red-handed, that that entire interior appropriations bill was pulled from consideration,\u201d Shultz continued. \u201cThat\u2019s just one example of policy\u2026their strategy is not to win the majority of African\u2013American voters because they clearly recognize that won\u2019t happen; their strategy is to erode the percentage of the [African\u2013American] vote that the Democratic candidate for president gets. That is why, tactically, they are appointing and sending into African-American communities outreach people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "news,featured", "og": {"site_name": "The Philadelphia Tribune", "description": "Moments after delivering a keynote address at the NAACP national convention Monday at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Center City, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman and U.S. Rep.
