It operates under a consumer board-of-directors governance structure and functions under the supervision of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe Union County Health Foundation, which operates as allPOINTS Health Services and has FQHCs in Elk Point and Alcester, will expand into Yankton and was given $858,333 for the task. It will be called the allPOINTS: Yankton Clinic and will include a family medicine physician, a dentist and some mid-level nurses.\n\n\u201cThis is going to double the size of our organization,\u201d said Brad Bertrand, chief executive officer of allPOINTS Health Services. \u201cWhat this funding is going to do is get the facility in Yankton up and running. It will allow us to buy equipment, hire people and get network infrastructure in place.\u201d\n\nDr. Tom Stanage, executive director of Lewis and Clark Behavioral Health Services, along with other local medical officials, spearheaded the effort to get an FQHC in Yankton.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited,\u201d he told the Press & Dakotan Thursday. \u201c(Local entities) played the role of doing the planning grant and facilitating it. During that process, it was decided we\u2019d have a much better chance of getting an FQHC if we worked with an existing provider. The closest one was in Elk Point. It turned out to be the right decision, because we got the grant. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased.\n\n\u201c(The FQHC) will give primary health care to people who otherwise don\u2019t have access. It will provide service regardless of a person\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d\n\nThe clinic will be located on the third floor of the Avera Sacred Heart Hospital (ASHH) Professional Office Pavilion and Education Center, and allPOINTS now has 120 days to open the facility.\n\n\u201cWe have a design in place,\u201d said Pam Rezac, ASHH president and CEO. \u201cWe knew that, if it was approved, we would have to move very quickly. We will now have to prepare the site.\n\n\u201cWe also have to work on the coordination of care,\u201d she added. \u201cIt will be very important that the services of ASHH are fully cooperative with the FQHC.\u201d\n\nStanage said he also expects Lewis and Clark Behavioral Health to provide support services for the FQHC.\n\nIn 2011, Yankton County was designated as a medically underserved population by the HRSA. The designation was needed before the area would be eligible for a FQHC.\n\nThe Yankton City Commission, Yankton County Commission, Yankton Medical Clinic and Avera Sacred Heart Hospital wrote letters of support for the designation.\n\nSubsequently, a needs assessment for a FQHC was done in 2012.\n\nThe people targeted for services in Yankton County have incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. The assessment found that the county had 7,322 such individuals, 58 percent of whom either had no insurance or was on Medicaid.\n\nAccording to Sibelius, the two new health centers will help care for approximately 7,682 additional South Dakotans. South Dakota health centers served 55,948 patients last year, 36 percent of them uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to providing more South Dakotans with the quality patient-centered care they deserve,\u201d Sebelius said in a media release. \u201cSouth Dakota health centers are key partners in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and new health center sites will increase access to those who need it most.\u201d\n\nNationwide, 236 health center programs will receive approximately $150 million in grant awards to serve more than 1.25 million additional patients.\n\nYou can follow Nathan Johnson on Twitter at twitter.com/AnInlandVoyage.
