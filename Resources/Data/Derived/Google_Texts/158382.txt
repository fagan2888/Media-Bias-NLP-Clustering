After 50 years, a theme park based on "The Flintstones" animated series is closing its doors.

It looks like the Flintstones are going to have to start looking for new digs. After 50 years, Flintstones Bedrock City — a theme park and campground in South Dakota based on the beloved cartoon — is closing its doors after Labor Day weekend. (Video via Warner Bros., Flintstones Bedrock City)

The owner, Joe Speckels, is retiring and told the press, "It's been really great. I've enjoyed it, but I'm tired."

The site sits on 62 acres. That includes the theme park made to look like Bedrock, the campgrounds and a drive-in diner.

The park apparently sold for $1.5 million to a local hotel operator who says the campground portion will be staying open.

The theme park may not be closed forever, though. The new owners say they are going to negotiate with Warner Bros., so they can continue to use the characters and scenes from the show.
