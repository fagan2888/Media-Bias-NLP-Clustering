SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – A driver going to the Baystate Medical Center ended up in the ER after her car hit the wall near the entrance.

A 22News viewer used the ReportIt feature to send us the picture above of the car that hit the wall at the emergency room building.

Baystate Medical Center spokesman Keith O’Connor said the car was going very slowly, when instead of turning into the valet parking area, it went straight into the wall.

Security told O’Connor there was very little damage, but as a precaution, doctors at the ER checked out the driver.
