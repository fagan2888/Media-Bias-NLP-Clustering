The Supreme Court ruled against them. All three have been prominent advocates for doctor-assisted suicide, which advocates prefer to call aid-in dying.\n\nOne of the patients in the lawsuit, Eric Seiff, 81, is a former Manhattan assistant district attorney who is being treated for cancer.\n\nSeiff is not currently terminally ill, but the other two patients are. Sara Myers, 60, has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, and Steve Goldenberg, 55, has multiple HIV-related illnesses. Both told a news conference that they do not yet want to die but want to have the choice in the future.\n\nNurse and end-of life consultant Judith Schwarz, Charles Thornton, a Rochester, New York, neurologist, and non-profit End of Life Choices New York are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\n\nThe plaintiffs say in the lawsuit that the state's law against assisted suicide was never meant to apply to doctors helping mentally competent, terminally ill patients. They said helping such patients die was not assisted suicide but rather akin to withdrawing a patient from a ventilator.\n\nEven if the law was meant to prohibit doctor-assisted suicide, they said, the court should rule that enforcing it violates patients' due process and equal protection rights under the state Constitution.\n\nBesides Schneiderman, the lawsuit named the district attorneys of Westchester, Monroe, Saratoga, Bronx and New York counties, where the plaintiffs live or practice medicine.\n\nSchneiderman's spokeswoman, Elizabeth DeBold, declined to comment.\n\nOregon, Washington and Vermont are currently the only states with laws explicitly allowing doctor-assisted suicide, and California's legislature is considering a similar law. A New Mexico judge has ruled in favor of doctor-assisted suicide, though the ruling is being appealed.\n\nThe case is Myers et al v. Schneiderman et al, New York Supreme Court, New York County.\n\n(Reporting by Brendan Pierson; Editing by Ted Botha and Dan Grebler)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lawsuit, asks, court, allow, doctor, assisted, suicide, new, york", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A group of doctors and patients, some terminally ill, on Wednesday asked a New York court to rule that doctor-assisted suicide is not against state law.", "title": "Lawsuit Asks Court to Allow Doctor-Assisted Suicide In New York", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/lawsuit-asks-court-allow-doctor-assisted-suicide-new-york-320870", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/04/physician-assisted-suicide.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A group of doctors and patients, some terminally ill, on Wednesday asked a New York court to rule that doctor-assisted suicide is not against state law.", "title": "Lawsuit Asks Court to Allow Doctor-Assisted Suicide In New York", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/lawsuit-asks-court-allow-doctor-assisted-suicide-new-york-320870", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/04/physician-assisted-suicide.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/04/physician-assisted-suicide.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-04T18:22:43-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-04T18:25:11-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A group of doctors and patients, some terminally ill, on Wednesday asked a New York court to rule that doctor-assisted suicide is not against state law."}, "article_summary": "The case is Myers et al v.
