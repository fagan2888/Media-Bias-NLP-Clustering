The proportion of 16- to 17-year-olds in full-time education who also work has fallen from 37% to 18% in a decade.\n\nMilburn spoke out in an interview with the Observer as tens of thousands of people, including public sector workers such as teachers and nurses opposed to a below-inflation 1% pay offer from the government, protested in London, Glasgow and Belfast about pay and austerity on Saturday.\n\nThe TUC, which organised the protests under the slogan \u201cBritain Needs a Pay Rise\u201d, said that between 80,000 and 90,000 people took part in the London march.\n\nSpeaking on the eve of the publication of his final annual report on social mobility to ministers before the general election, Milburn demanded urgent action by the state and a change in direction by businesses.\n\nHe said that only a radical change would save a generation of Britons buffeted by an economic downturn and condemned by a fundamental change in the labour market that left them without hope of better lives.\n\nIn a strikingly downbeat intervention, Milburn said: \u201cIt is depressing. The current generation of young people are educated better and for longer than any previous one. But young people are losing out on jobs, earnings and housing.\n\n\u201cThis recession has been particularly hard on young people. The ratio of youth to adult unemployment rates was just over two to one in 1996, compared to just under three to one today. On any definition we are nowhere near the chancellor\u2019s objective of \u201cfull employment\u201d for young people. Young people are the losers in the recovery to date.\u201d\n\nThe median pay of a 22- to 29-year-old, \u00a39.73 an hour, was more than 10% lower today than it was in 2006, according to Milburn. The pay of 18- to 21-year-olds, \u00a36.73, is 8.8% lower. Both are at the same wage level as they were in 1998.\n\nThe proportion of 18- to 24-year-olds in work fell from 65% at the start of 2007 to 56% at the end of 2012 and has only now recovered to 60.8%, despite some consistent economic growth in the last two years.\n\nMilburn is expected to be damning in his report about the failure of all political parties to protect the young from the consequences of global changes, and that helping the young into meaningful careers and off benefits should be made a priority.\n\nMilburn said that he believed there had been a failure to provide many young people with the skills that could allow them to escape a life of poor pay.\n\nHe said: \u201cYouth unemployment is still higher than before the recession and by the time of the next election around half a million young people will still be without work, enough to fill Wembley stadium five times over.\n\n\u201cUrgent action is needed to prevent this generation of young people faring worse than their parents\u2019 generation. Social mobility relies on young people having better opportunities to progress. Investment in the skills and employment of young people today is money saved in social security and the costs of poverty tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAfter taking into account reductions in hours of work, which have decreased in the recession, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has highlighted that for those aged between 22 and 30, median earnings are 15% lower than before the recession, driven by a combination of lower hourly pay and fewer hours of work. This decrease is roughly twice the size as earnings decreases for the 30-59 age group.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "description": "Mobility tsar says Britain is on verge of being permanently divided between haves and have-nots as young miss out on recovery, writes Daniel Boffey", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Daniel Boffey", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Mobility tsar says Britain is on verge of being permanently divided between haves and have-nots as young miss out on recovery, writes Daniel Boffey", "title": "Under-30s being priced out of the UK, says social mobility tsar", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/18/under-30s-priced-out-of-uk-alan-milburn", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/18/1413668587877/Britain-needs-a-pay-rise--014.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=22a04bfce037b443a45081a68adadb46", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://society/2014/oct/18/under-30s-priced-out-of-uk-alan-milburn?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/18/under-30s-priced-out-of-uk-alan-milburn", "iphone": "gnmguardian://society/2014/oct/18/under-30s-priced-out-of-uk-alan-milburn?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/18/1413668587877/Britain-needs-a-pay-rise--014.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://society/2014/oct/18/under-30s-priced-out-of-uk-alan-milburn?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Young people,Social mobility,Youth unemployment,Unemployment,Society,Pay,Work & careers,Family finances,Money", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2014-10-19T08:12:19.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey", "section": "Society", "modified_time": "2014-10-19T08:12:19.000Z", "tag": "Young people,Social mobility,Youth unemployment,Unemployment,Society,Pay,Work & careers,Family finances,Money"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/18/1413668587877/Britain-needs-a-pay-rise--014.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=73947c4d77b0e5c76aec0330aeec76e1", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "Young people,Social mobility,Youth unemployment,Unemployment,Society,Pay,Work & careers,Family finances,Money"}, "article_summary": "\u201cUrgent action is needed to prevent this generation of young people faring worse than their parents\u2019 generation.\nBritain is on the verge of becoming permanently divided between tribes of haves and have-nots as the young increasingly miss out on the opportunities enjoyed by their parents\u2019 generation, the government\u2019s social mobility tsar claim.\nSocial mobility relies on young people having better opportunities to progress.\nThe proportion of 16- to 17-year-olds in full-time education who also work has fallen from 37% to 18% in a decade.\nThe current generation of young people are educated better and for longer than any previous one."}
