It also improves health care access for low-income students within Woodstock School District 200, she said.\n\n\u201cWe saw a lot of students were facing gaps in health care access who were being impacted academically. ... We want them to have an optimal learning environment,\u201d Tate said.\n\nDistrict officials applied in spring 2012 and later received an $86,654 federal grant to develop the health care clinic, a part of a school health center capital program included in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe clinic, converted from office space at Woodstock North, officially will open to high school students and parents at the start of the new school year in August.\n\nThe clinic will have its own entrance near the school\u2019s auditorium and also feature two exam rooms, a lab and an office for a nurse practitioner, said district spokeswoman Carol Smith.\n\nNurses at the high school could refer students they see during the day to the clinic for additional treatment.\n\nAs an example, a practitioner at the clinic would be able to prescribe medication to a student with an ear infection \u2013 something school nurses can\u2019t do, Smith said.\n\nOnce the clinic opens, school officials will assess student demands for the clinic with an eye toward expanding the facility to all district students.\n\n\u201cWe are opening it slowly with the high school students to work out the kinks,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe need to start slow.\u201d\n\nThe federal grant covers the district\u2019s bricks-and-mortar and equipment costs to create the clinic. The clinic\u2019s staff and other operational costs will be covered by the Community Health Partnership of Illinois, a Chicago-based agency that is working with District 200 on the new health care facility.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 Northwest Herald", "og": {"url": "http://www.nwherald.com/2015/02/25/health-clinic-for-woodstock-school-district-200-high-school-students-opens-in-august/ahw70d3/", "image": "http://www.nwherald.com/images/avatar-facebook.png", "site_name": "Northwest Herald", "description": "WOODSTOCK \u2013 A new clinic meant to provide additional health care services for all Woodstock high school students will open in August, nearly three years after school officials applied for a grant to create the clinic.", "title": "Health clinic for Woodstock School District 200 high school students opens in August"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nwherald", "image": "http://www.nwherald.com/images/avatar-twitter.png", "description": "WOODSTOCK \u2013 A new clinic meant to provide additional health care services for all Woodstock high school students will open in August, nearly three years after school officials applied for a grant to create the clinic.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Health clinic for Woodstock School District 200 high school students opens in August"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1071875123", "fb": {"pages": 13044672572}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "ca3dbaae-74c8-4d7c-bafd-5bd4266580c1"}}, "keywords": "#District 200, Woodstock", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The clinic, which will open at Woodstock North High School, can provide general health care services for high school students beyond what school nurses traditionally provide, said Lisa Tate, nursing and health services director.\nIt also improves health care access for low-income students within Woodstock School District 200, she said.\nWOODSTOCK \u2013 A new clinic meant to provide additional health care services for all Woodstock high school students will open in August, nearly three years after school officials applied for a grant to create the clinic.\n\u201cWe are opening it slowly with the high school students to work out the kinks,\u201d Smith said.\nOnce the clinic opens, school officials will assess student demands for the clinic with an eye toward expanding the facility to all district students."}
