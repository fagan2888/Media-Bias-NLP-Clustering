Last week, a spate of headlines made this point better than I could make it on my own.\n\nI was minding my business, mind you, surfing the Internet to check out the news and political sites and forums I customarily visit, and these news and column headlines, most from last week, some from a bit earlier and a few from this week, bombarded me. I wasn't looking for trouble. Nor was the satirical website The Onion one of the sites I visited. The world is upside down, inside out, sideways, crazy, nutso. Bad is good; up is down. Left is right; right is wrong. Evil is good; insanity is sanity. Abnormal is normal. Circles are squares. Hot is cold. Luke warm is red hot \u2014 among Republicans, anyway. Common sense is uncommon. The world is otherworldly. Dissent is \"hate.\" Diversity means conformity. The good guys are the bad guys; virtue is vice; sophistry is intellectualism; jerks are celebrated; debauchery is glorified; the holy is debauched. Let me share some of these headlines, which speak for themselves \u2014 loudly and depressingly.\n\n\u2014Shakespeare's Works \u2014 Too Hard, Too White.\n\n\u2014Obama Red-Faced: Iran Nuclear Stockpiles Grew 20 Percent in 18 months.\n\n\u2014Obamacare Dangerous to Our Health.\n\n\u2014Eye-Popping Premium Increases.\n\n\u2014Obama, Clinton Want To Enforce 'Correct' Thinking in America.\n\n\u2014High School Denies Pro-Life Club!\n\n\u2014Pentagon Officials Call Out Obama's 'Pathetic' ISIS Strategy.\n\n\u2014Shabazz Calls on Nation of Islam, New Black Panther 'Army' to Defend Black Communities Against Police Brutality.\n\n\u2014Obama: Climate Change Deniers Endangering National Security.\n\n\u2014Team Clinton Swarms Sunday Interview Shows, Minus Hillary.\n\n\u2014Antonin Scalia Is Unfit To Serve: A Justice Who Rejects Science and the Law for Religion Is of Unsound Mind.\n\n\u2014In L.A., Obama addresses Washington's Dysfunction: \"I Did Not Say I Would Fix It.\"\n\n\u2014Authorities: Gay Slur Carved Into Utah Man's Arm Was Staged.\n\n\u2014Justice Department: Transgender Students Can Use Bathrooms that Match Their Gender Identity.\n\n\u2014Political Correctness 101: Praising America, Virtues of Hard Work Dubbed 'Micro-Aggression' On Campuses.\n\n\u2014Video Shows U.S. Citizens Willing To Ban American Flag.\n\n\u2014Are Americans of Faith in Danger?\n\n\u2014Obama Administration Says Redskins Nickname Could Block Potential Stadium Deal.\n\n\u2014TV Land Drops \"Dukes of Hazzard\" Amid Confederate Flag Controversy.\n\n\u2014Gay Teacher Files Federal Discrimination Lawsuit Against Catholic School.\n\n\u2014Terrific: Attorney in Charge of Releasing Lois Lerner 'Lost' Emails Now in Charge of HRC's Emails.\n\n\u2014For Obama, Rainbow White House Was 'A Moment Worth Savoring.'\n\n\u2014Montana Polygamist Family Applies for Marriage License.\n\n\u201474 Children Executed by ISIS for 'Crimes' That Include Refusal To Fast, Report Says.\n\n\u2014New Undercover Footage Shows VA Officials Admitting of 'Unaccountability at Every Level.'\n\n\u2014Black Teacher Hits Handicapped White Child, Tells Him Black People Fought To Not 'Serve White People Like You.'\n\n\u2014Girl Scouts Raise $250K for Transgender Cause.\n\n\u2014Teen Leads Mob in Ransacking of Georgia Walmart.\n\n\u2014U.S. Debt Headed Toward Greek Levels.\n\n\u2014Obama Administration Invokes Executive Privilege on Benghazi Probe?\n\n\u2014United Church of Christ Anti-Israel Extremism.\n\n\u2014U.S. Troops in Afghanistan 'Feel Abandoned.'\n\n\u2014More than 42 Million Muslims 'Support ISIS.'\n\n\u201417 Shot Since Monday Morning in Baltimore.\n\n\u2014Baltimore Mayor Wants Park Named for Robert E.
