This audio has been edited; please see the editor's note at the end of the story.\n\nThe lactation room wasn\u2019t a room at all.\n\nIt was a corner of the lunch room in an old King County building in Seattle's Columbia City neighborhood.\n\nA shoji screen was set up for privacy, although cracks allowed people to see through. A vent blew in cold air.\n\nKaila Tang, a public health nurse for Seattle and King County, knew that she wouldn\u2019t be able to produce much milk if she pumped there. That\u2019s her job, after all \u2013 she helps new moms establish breastfeeding \u2013 and she knows that a cold, uncomfortable space can make it harder to express milk.\n\n\u201cThe vasculature shrinks; it constricts,\u201d Tang said. \u201cIt\u2019s not conducive to letdown or good milk flow. You want to be relaxed. Physiologically, it\u2019s not conducive to a good amount of milk coming out.\u201d\n\nHer supervisor offered her office, but Tang felt awkward. \u201cWhat employee would feel comfortable kicking their supervisor out of her office two or three times a day, 20 minutes at a time?\u201d she said.\n\nSo Tang started pumping at her desk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a large room with other nurses who do similar jobs \u2013 all of whom are female, although there are a couple of male coworkers in the area as well,\u201d Tang said.\n\n\u201cI whip out my breasts, hook up the pump,\u201d she said. \u201cIf people start to approach from behind, people say, \u2018She\u2019s pumping, she\u2019s pumping! Don\u2019t go there.\u2019 Or eventually, as they approach, they hear the pump.\u201d\n\nShe endures this, she said, because, \u201cthe most important thing is feeding my child breastmilk.\u201d\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, it included a provision that requires employers to provide lactation rooms for moms until their child is a year old. There are two exceptions: moms on salaries (known as exempt) and businesses with fewer than 50 employees.\n\nA lactation room cannot be a bathroom and must be \u201cshielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers.\u201d It does not have to be a permanent space if moms don\u2019t need it, but it must be available when they do. The Department of Labor recommends a lock.\n\n\u201cA shoji screen would seem to be inadequate,\u201d said Seattle attorney Jason Rittereiser of HKM Employment Attorneys. He said employers sometimes lose sight of the intention of the law.\n\n\u201cThe Legislature looked at evidence and data from various health organizations and they came to the conclusion that it\u2019s beneficial for mothers to breastfeed their children,\u201d Rittereiser said.\n\n\u201cMothers must consistently pump or feed on a schedule \u2013 that\u2019s going to conflict when people are at work, so they put in some protections so that mothers can continue to provide healthy food for their babies,\u201d he said.\n\nA pause for those unfamiliar with pumping: Pumping is the act of removing milk from a mother\u2019s breasts. For roughly 20 minutes, two to three times a day, working moms attach suction cups to their breasts. The pump then sucks out milk into bottles.\n\nMoms pump to take milk home to their babies for the next day. They also pump to encourage their milk ducts to produce more milk \u2013 if they stop, their bodies would likely respond by reducing output. Moms also pump for comfort, because it's painful when milk builds up.\n\nI'm a white woman with a college education and a professional licensure, and my privilege allows me to speak up about this.\n\nThere\u2019s something else to know about pumping: It requires a peaceful space. Try peeing in front of strangers \u2013 for most people, that's hard to do.\n\nWe recently asked moms to share photos of their lactation rooms with us (you can see those in the slideshow above). Some boasted suites with mini fridges, sinks and comfortable chairs. Others were less impressive \u2013 a waitress sent us a photo of a dirty bathroom. She pumps sitting on an open toilet, which she said she had to scrub clean of dried excrement.\n\nWe produced a lactation room slideshow last year as well. That story focused on KUOW\u2019s lactation room. At the time, it was a network room. It had a locking door, but it was narrow and dirty. Wires hung from the walls.\n\nCaryn Mathes, our CEO and general manager, had just come aboard and made it a priority to get a new lactation room. Caryn, Janice McKenna, our finance director, Dane Johnson, our operations director, and Arvid Hokanson, our assistant programming director, created an impressive space that includes a hospital-grade pump, mini fridge and amazing art work. (We are naming them here because we are so grateful to them.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy for our bosses to find a room to convert into a lactation room. KUOW is bursting at the seams. But they figured it out. Rittereiser said employers will often use lack of space as an excuse.\n\n\u201cAlways my reaction to those kinds of claims \u2013 \u2018Where else would we put them?\u2019 \u2013 is \u2018I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s burdensome on you to figure out,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nAt KUOW, a new room had an immediate effect on Isolde, who started producing nearly twice as much milk as she had in the network room.\n\nHealth Care Providers\n\nSix nurses and doctors in Seattle told us they pump in shower stalls and their cars. Some try to duck into patient rooms.\n\nAlthough hospitals have lactation rooms, the women said those rooms are reserved for patients or too far from where they work.\n\nOne mom told us she pumps in a locker room in the basement of another building at the University of Washington. A supervisor denied her request to bring in a mini fridge.\n\nAnother University of Washington doctor told us the nearest lactation room is 20 minutes away, so she pumps in her car or the bathroom. The tone of her email was furious.\n\nThis was a theme last year as well, when we received several photos from Swedish Medical Center anesthesiologists. Their lactation room was a shower stall with a plastic folding chair. Someone from the hospital\u2019s communication\u2019s office later suggested the women were lying, and when we said we had verified their employment, they said that the women were free to use lactation rooms across the hospital.\n\nSwedish has two employee-only lactation rooms at Swedish First Hill and one at each of its other hospitals.\n\nNo one in these situations considered suing their employer, although most of the women did approach someone at work about getting a better space. Most are happy at their jobs and too exhausted by parenting to push boundaries.\n\n\u201cA lot of moms think, \u2018I\u2019m tough, I\u2019m back at work. I\u2019ll make it work,\u2019\u201d Rittereiser said. \u201cThe other is, \u2018Do I have time to deal with this?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut it's unclear if the moms could pursue a case. The courts are currently sorting out whether women would be allowed to file civil suits against their employer. They may instead have to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor, which would then determine whether to take up their cause.\n\nInitiative\n\nMegan Lazovick in New Jersey was among a dozen moms who replied to our request for pump room photos.\n\nLazovick is the director of research at Edison Research, a small company that wouldn\u2019t have to comply with the federal statute. Around the time her first child was born, she poked around her company\u2019s old building to find a pump room.\n\n\u201cI knew there was this closet \u2013 a nice big storage room that for years had just been collecting dust and folders and objects that no one used,\u201d Lazovick said.\n\n\u201cInstead of just asking for a pumping room, I thought of a solution first: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s clean this out, it can also be a place to record voice-overs \u2026 and by the way, I\u2019m going to use it as a pumping room.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe found a mini fridge in the office and asked her coworkers if they wouldn\u2019t mind her using it for milk.\n\nPeople walking by can hear the whir of the pump, but Lazovick doesn\u2019t mind. \u201cI decided that I wasn\u2019t going to be embarrassed that I had to pump. I wasn\u2019t going to sneak away because I\u2019m not going to get the support I need if they don\u2019t know I\u2019m pumping.\u201d\n\nAs for nurse Kaila Tang, the irony of her situation is not lost on her. Part of her job is empowering clients to negotiate a lactation space at work.\n\nSince she came forward to discuss her situation, the King County\u2019s Department of Health told KUOW that it will examine better options for its Columbia City clinic building.\n\n\u201cIt helped that Kaila brought some issues forward,\u201d said TJ Cosgrove, division director of Community Health Services.\n\n\u201cThis is our work,\u201d Cosgrove said. \u201cWe are working with clients and community to elevate the importance of breastfeeding.\u201d\n\nWhile newer county health clinics have lactation rooms for staff, the Columbia City building has so little space, he said. But he said he doesn\u2019t want that to prevent them from figuring out a better solution for Tang.\n\nTang was initially hesitant to tell her story because she loves her job and respects her bosses. But knowing that other women are in this situation \u2013 including many of her clients \u2013 pushed her to speak up.\n\n\u201cI'm a white woman with a college education and a professional licensure, and my privilege allows me to speak up about this,\u201d she said. \u201cNot every working pumping mom enjoys the same protections.\u201d\n\nEditor's note 10/20/2015: In the original version of the audio posted above, online editor Isolde Raftery said King County is breaking the law by not offering a dedicated room for nurse Kaila Tang to pump. The county responded that offering a supervisor\u2019s office falls in line with the federal law. As such, we have removed that portion of the audio because we could not find case law saying if a supervisor\u2019s office counts as a lactation space.\n\nThe 2010 federal law says: \u201cEmployers are also required to provide a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public, which may be used by an employee to express breast milk.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "The lactation room wasn\u2019t a room at all.
