But sometimes, patients turn up with physical symptoms that stem from mental health problems.\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil/OPB\n\nThat, says Dr. Robin Henderson of the St. Charles Health System in Bend, is where psychologists come in.\n\nBut, there\u2019s a problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty scary when you walk into your medical professional\u2019s office and they say, \u2018You know I really think you ought to go see a therapist. Here\u2019s a number for someone.\u2019 You call them. And guess what? People don\u2019t follow up,\u201d Henderson says.\n\nShe says patients don\u2019t want the stigma of going to see a psychologist, so they procrastinate, they minimize their problem, and they get sicker.\n\nSo, instead of sending patients out to psychologists\u2019 offices, St. Charles has been running a pilot project to put psychologists into doctor offices.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sitting on the table, in comes your psychologist to sit next to you. It changes the stigma dynamic. Now we\u2019re saying: \u2018It\u2019s okay for my mind to be involved with my body. Because I\u2019m in my doctor\u2019s office.\u2019 \u201c\n\nTake the case of 17-year-old Tyson Engel.\n\nBack in the spring of 2011, he was snowboarding on Mt. Bachelor when he fell so hard, he cracked his helmet.\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil/OPB\n\nHis mom Jennifer Engel says she soon began to notice some pretty dramatic changes in his character.\n\n\u201cTyson talked about headaches for a while. He could not sleep at night and had difficulty regulating his activities. He was always on the run, not eating very much, not sleeping very much,\u201d Engel says.\n\nOver a period of several months, she took him to the ER five times. There was even a three-day hospital stay. But the symptoms weren\u2019t improving.\n\nThat\u2019s when she found the Mosaic Medical clinic, where the pediatrician and psychologist work together.\n\nTyson had a problem with impulse control. His mom says she\u2019d be taking him to an important appointment and he\u2019d suddenly run across the street to see a shiny new bike.\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil/OPB\n\nTyson\u2019s psychologist Sandra Marshall says she worked to identify the problem and to give him the tools to deal with it.\n\nShe was able to make suggestions to his parents about how they should talk with him.\n\n\u201cSometimes there would be too much talk. And they would talk and talk and talk and he would get frustrated, and too fast. And it was \u2018Okay, you guys have to stop talking too much.\u2019 And we have to have come up with: \u2018Is this the right time or the wrong time? Is this a big deal or a little deal? Do you need it now, or can you wait?\u2019 And that\u2019s all that was left. And then it gave him time and space, there wasn\u2019t so much language to process and then he could respond to that,\u201d Marshall says.\n\nTyson says those choices were clear enough that he could use them \u2014 as opposed to trying to recall some long, in-depth family conversation.\n\n\u201cI would want to go see a bike. I would think to myself: \u2018Is now the right time, is now the wrong time? How badly do I want to see the bike? Is it that important, is it not important?\u2019 And just by asking myself questions, I\u2019d get better at the certain situations I was into,\u201d Tyson says.\n\nTyson\u2019s case is complex.\n\nDr. Henderson says more common examples where a psychologist is helpful involve children who are getting stomach aches because they\u2019re being bullied, or the parents are getting a divorce.\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil/OPB\n\n\u201cThese are short, brief interventional strategies designed to help parents and the practitioners and the children themselves. Deal with the things that they\u2019re coming into a pediatrician\u2019s office for, that aren\u2019t necessarily treatable with an antibiotic,\u201d Henderson says.\n\nDr. Kristi Nix is the pediatrician that worked with Tyson\u2019s psychologist at the Mosaic Medical Clinic, she says, \u201cI\u2019m so thankful to have another perspective.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard I mean it\u2019s not satisfying as a physician to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with you. Get out of my office.\u2019 Right. That\u2019s not okay and it\u2019s not good healthcare.\u201d\n\nTyson\u2019s mom, Jennifer, says having Dr. Nix confer with a psychologist, worked wonders. \u201cI think it\u2019s huge because they both know Tyson personally, they know our children. They know the extended family at this point. We didn\u2019t fall through the cracks in any way.\u201d\n\nBut the idea of having a psychologist drop in to talk to a patient for 20 minutes, instead of setting up a schedule of weekly visits, is a substantial change.\n\nDr. Robin Henderson says St. Charles initially had problems hiring psychologists to do the job.\n\n\u201cSome of them, it\u2019s not worked for some of them. Initially, especially when we were first starting out, we had a couple of folks who just couldn\u2019t manage the model. It takes a different type of personality, and we find the folks coming right out of school, fresh, who\u2019ve been trained in health psychology models. You have to have that type of personality that wants to engage in team-based care. You know it in the interview,\u201d Henderson says.\n\nThe American Psychological Association is supportive of integrating psychologists into doctors offices. According to the APA website, research shows the strategy is effective in reducing depression.\n\nIn Tyson Engel\u2019s case, the family hasn\u2019t needed to return to the ER, or have him stay in a hospital. So that has saved money.\n\nOn a larger scale, Dr. Henderson says St. Charles looked at about two years of data from the Medicaid population visiting Mosaic.\n\n\u201cWe were only able to look at about 400 patients. And the average was a drop of about $860 over the course of a year in the patient\u2019s medical costs. Now that included a minor increase in their pharmacy costs, but even with that increase, the total medical spend was going down.\u201d\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil/OPB\n\nSt. Charles is doing a much longer study.\n\nBut meanwhile, Benjamin Miller at the University of Colorado School of Medicine says, going from a small project to broad adoption may not be easy \u2014 for several reasons. There needs to be a payment mechanism that recognizes the input of both the doctor and the psychologist; the electronic health records of doctor offices and psychologists offices also need to work together; and students of the two disciplines need to be taught to work together.\n\n\u201cYou know they are raised almost in this culture of indifference to the other providers. Where they are taught, you as a mental health provider are going out there and do mental health work. You as physical health provider are going to go out and do physical health work. Wherein do the two meet? It\u2019s not in training,\u201d Miller says.\n\nThe American Hospital Association wrote to President Barack Obama highlighting St. Charles\u2019 project this summer. The President had asked for help to raise awareness about dealing with mental health in the nation\u2019s communities.\n\nIntegrating Behavioral and Physical Health Care in the Real World", "article_metadata": {"author": "Kristian Foden-Vencil", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/series/vitalsigns/sometimes-its-all-in-your-head/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_300,q_90,w_400/pdlueibbl5iftqp9zxyu.jpg", "description": "One of the aims of the Affordable Care Act is to tear down the walls that separate doctors from psychologists, dentists from doctors and so on.", "title": "Sometimes It's All In Your Head"}, "twitter": {"description": "<p>One of the aims of the Affordable Care Act is to tear down the walls that separate doctors from psychologists, dentists from doctors and so on.</p>", "creator": "@OPB", "image": {"src": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_348,q_90,w_620/pdlueibbl5iftqp9zxyu.jpg"}, "title": "Not Feeling Well?
