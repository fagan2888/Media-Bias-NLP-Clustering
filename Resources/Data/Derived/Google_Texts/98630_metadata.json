A proposal being put forth in November would amend the state constitution to create a new healthcare authority called ColoradoCare \u2013 a statewide health cooperative guaranteeing health coverage for every family filing taxes in Colorado.\n\nSupporters of ColoradoCare have been quoted as saying \"it is going to make a huge difference in people's lives\" \u2013 to \"this shows you the power and strength of when people come together. Some critics, meanwhile, say this creates a \"Communist health system,\" while others believe it ranks among the worst ideas ever in government.\n\n\"It is a terrible idea,\" says Linda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Institute at Colorado-based Independence Institute. \"It's worse than ObamaCare because ObamaCare at least leaves the private sector to provide some competition.\"\n\nAccording to Gorman, ColoradoCare gets its hands on a stream of tax money in perpetuity.\n\n\"It's going to raise the state income tax to the highest in the nation,\" says Gorman. \"Another thing it does that's very bad is that it's in the initiative that it's going to control the amount of health spending; it's going to control the rate of growth.\"\n\nWhile some people might think that's a good thing, Gorman argues that giving a government entity total control on how much individuals spend on healthcare could mean people and treatments being denied.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/culture/2016/04/18/expert-little-positive-in-proposed-coloradocare", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5607040/stethoscope-cash.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "This November could decide the future of ObamaCare, while Colorado will determine whether to go with single-payer healthcare.", "title": "Expert: Little positive in proposed ColoradoCare"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5607040/stethoscope-cash.jpg", "title": "Expert: Little positive in proposed ColoradoCare", "description": "This November could decide the future of ObamaCare, while Colorado will determine whether to go with single-payer healthcare.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@onenewsnowcom"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "This November could decide the future of ObamaCare, while Colorado will determine whether to go with single-payer healthcare."}, "article_summary": "According to Gorman, ColoradoCare gets its hands on a stream of tax money in perpetuity.\n\"It's worse than ObamaCare because ObamaCare at least leaves the private sector to provide some competition.\"\n\"It's going to raise the state income tax to the highest in the nation,\" says Gorman.\n\"It is a terrible idea,\" says Linda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Institute at Colorado-based Independence Institute.\nThis November could decide the future of ObamaCare, while Colorado will determine whether to go with single-payer healthcare."}
