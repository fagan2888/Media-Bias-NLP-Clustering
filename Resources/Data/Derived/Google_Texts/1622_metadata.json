By 1966, that phrase would reach a more intellectual audience with publication of her path-breaking collection of essays, \u201cAgainst Interpretation.\u201d\n\nSontag, however, was not the only figure in 1965 to flip that phrase around. Tom Wolfe, in the introduction to his best-selling book \u201cThe Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby,\u201d had exclaimed: \u201cThe hell with Mondrian, whoever the hell he is \u2026 Yah! lower orders. The new sensibility \u2013 Baby baby baby where did our love go? \u2013 the new world, submerged so long, invisible, and now arising.\u201d\n\nWolfe and Sontag jointly staking out the territory of this new sensibility? Could a more unlikely pair be imagined? Wolfe was the newspaperman given to wearing a white suit, white spats and fedora; he was smart and cynical but capable of enthusiasm, especially if it went against the grain of the mavens of elite culture. His prose hit like a howitzer, full of capital letters and exclamation points. In contrast, Sontag was the emerging \u201cdark lady\u201d of American letters, decked out in black turtleneck and a torrent of dark hair. She was tall and commanding; there seemed to be nothing that she had not read. Her sentences, if not quite sensuous, were beguiling, full and subtle, with a fine eye for aphorism.\n\nWhich of the pair first came up with the phrase \u201cthe New Sensibility\u201d? Probably Sontag, because Wolfe may have been slyly poking fun at Sontag when he quoted the words \u201cBaby baby baby where did our love go?\u201d They were from the song \u201cWhere Did Our Love Go?,\u201d by the Motown Group the Supremes. It had been a No. 1 hit on the pop charts in August 1964. What\u2019s the connection?\n\nAlthough Wolfe might have appreciated the tune\u2019s contemporary rhythm and energy, the group singing it had been singled out by Sontag in her own article on the New Sensibility. While Sontag\u2019s roots were sunk deep in European modernism \u2013 and its most recent offshoots \u2013 she argued that elite American culture lacked a danceable beat. Why must everything be so heavy and brooding? Why must intellectuals crawl over every cultural expression like ants upon potato salad at a picnic? She famously announced that intellectuals and American culture needed to be liberated, to begin to enjoy the \u201csensuous surface of art without mucking about in it.\u201d In sum, she finished the opening essay of her book with the words: \u201cIn place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art.\u201d\n\nIn 1965, The Supremes were on her mind and record turntable. In a diary entry for November, she admitted to herself, \u201cMy biggest pleasure the last two years has come from pop music (The Beatles, Dionne Warwick, the Supremes).\u201d In her book \u201cAgainst Interpretation,\u201d in the essay \u201cOne Culture and the New Sensibility,\u201d the Supremes popped up anew. What was wrong with intellectuals, such as Sontag, kicking off their shoes and dancing to such lively music? The edifice of high modernism would not tremble or tumble too badly. Maybe some of its imposing doors might even come ajar.\n\nIndeed, as the essays in \u201cAgainst Interpretation\u201d indicated, the saturnine spirit of serious art existed nicely alongside the rhythms of the Supremes. Sontag, as a critic, craved both high and low art. But the films and plays, literature and art that attracted her were not quite popular. She was drawn to works that interrogated madness, bewitched with silence. She adored foreign films, cast in the Nouvelle Vague manner, that were often resistant to understanding, self-referential and anchored in the history of the medium. Her taste in fiction (present in her own novel \u201cThe Benefactor\u201d) was for prose without metaphor, a flat narrative voice, plots that were more dreamlike than logical.\n\nWolfe\u2019s admiration was for quite a different world of culture, one that Sontag had never experienced \u2013 nor sought out. While they might both dig rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, he wanted a culture of energy, bright lights and ha cha cha. He loved the garish and outsized, hence his attraction to Las Vegas. It had \u201cThe wheeps, beeps, freeps, electronic lulus, Boomerang Modern and Flash Gordon sunbursts.\u201d Hardly the type of expression associated with some of Sontag\u2019s heroes, such as Samuel Beckett or Simone Weil. Wolfe traveled the United States in search of grass-roots cultural expression. He found it in the unlikeliest of venues, at least as he presumed for a typical New York intellectual. He wrote knowingly, and sympathetically, about Junior Johnson, a race-car driver, \u201ca modern hero.\u201d He marveled at the craftsmanship and culture of auto detailers. He readily stooped to consider the instant celebrity of one Baby Jane Holzer, whose key attribute was tonsorial: \u201cHer hair rises up from her head in a huge hairy corona, a huge tan mane around a narrow face . . . all that hair flowing down over a coat made of \u2026 zebra!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The merging of high & low culture is old hat to us, but 50 years ago Sontag & Wolfe were breaking boundaries", "author": "George Cotkin", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The merging of high & low culture is old hat to us, but 50 years ago Sontag & Wolfe were breaking boundaries", "title": "The New Sensibility of Susan Sontag & Tom Wolfe: The \u201cdark lady\u201d and the man in white were an unlikely pair, but both were looking to liberate American culture", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/03/the_new_sensibility_of_susan_sontag_tom_wolfe_the_dark_lady_and_the_man_in_white_were_an_unlikely_pair_but_both_were_looking_to_liberate_american_culture/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/sontag_wolfe.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The merging of high & low culture is old hat to us, but 50 years ago Sontag & Wolfe were breaking boundaries", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/sontag_wolfe.jpg", "title": "The New Sensibility of Susan Sontag & Tom Wolfe: The \u201cdark lady\u201d and the man in white were an unlikely pair, but both were looking to liberate American culture", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The New Sensibility of Susan Sontag & Tom Wolfe: The \u201cdark lady\u201d and the man in white were an unlikely pair, but both were looking to liberate American culture", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Susan Sontag, the new sensibility, Tom Wolfe", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The new sensibility \u2013 Baby baby baby where did our love go?\nWhile Sontag\u2019s roots were sunk deep in European modernism \u2013 and its most recent offshoots \u2013 she argued that elite American culture lacked a danceable beat.\nTopics: Susan Sontag, the new sensibility, Tom Wolfe, Entertainment NewsIt was 50 years ago, in 1965, in Mademoiselle magazine, of all places, that Susan Sontag announced the existence of a \u201cNew Sensibility\u201d afoot in American culture.\nIn contrast, Sontag was the emerging \u201cdark lady\u201d of American letters, decked out in black turtleneck and a torrent of dark hair.\n\u2013 the new world, submerged so long, invisible, and now arising.\u201dWolfe and Sontag jointly staking out the territory of this new sensibility?"}
