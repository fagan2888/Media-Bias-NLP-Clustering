He named his son, Ted Cruz, as one of the anointed. Ted, he said, is one among the evangelical Christians who are anointed as \u201ckings\u201d to take control of all sectors of society and \u201cbring the spoils of war to the priests,\u201d in this way bringing about a prophesied \u201cgreat transfer of wealth\u201d from the \u201cwicked\u201d to righteous gentile believers.\n\nThis Dominionism, in its extreme form, would create a theocratic state based on \u201cbiblical law,\u201d and cast out the \u201cdeviants.\u201d Among the \u201cdeviants\u201d is the LGBT community, for example.\n\nIn the ranks of the \u201cwicked,\u201d of course, are Barack Obama and all his tainted followers. In his speech three years ago before the local Hood County, Texas, Tea Party, Rafael likened the US under Obama to Cuba under Castro. He warned of \u201cdeath panels\u201d under \u201cObamacare\u201d and of Obama confiscating \u201cour fortunes.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2013 government shutdown, in large part, engineered by Ted Cruz, Cruz was anointed by pro-religious war, antigay pastors. The US Constitution is based on the Old Testament, tenets not followed in an Obama nation condoning gay marriage and a secular nation, his anointers said.\n\nSeemingly Ted Cruz continues to sustain the laser-like focus of his traveling preacher, public speaker, father, whose fevered passion is said to have driven off Ted\u2019s mother decades ago. This same mission-bound intensity seems to rule Ted Cruz\u2019s life, taking precedence over all other endeavors, including any kind of social communion with those not sharing his mission. As a 2016 presidential candidate who has won primary caucuses, his personal ties are less open to the public, who know little about his evangelical ties.\n\nCruz\u2019s endorsements include Christian leaders across the country, many with controversial pasts. Among them are Mike Bickle, a preacher who has called Oprah Winfrey the \u201cforerunner of the Antichrist,\u201d and Bob Vander Plaats who sees same-sex marriage as Satanic. \u201cWith the support of Mike and many other people of faith, we will fight the good fight, finish the course and keep the faith,\u201d Cruz said on his official campaign website.\n\nThere is no reason to doubt the missionary zeal in Cruz\u2019s bid for the Republican nomination for president. But at the same time he is intelligent enough to not publically play the extremist note regarding his \u201canointment\u201d for the presidential role.\n\nPerhaps hearing the echo of Matthew 3:17 in the Bible, \u201cThis is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased,\u201d spoken at Jesus\u2019 baptism, Rafael Cruz often sees his own son\u2019s anointed mission to save humanity. Late last year, speaking on a syndicated radio show, Cruz\u2019s father recounted how God spoke to Ted Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi when the Cruz family sought guidance for the presidential race:\n\nMy son Ted and his family spent six months in prayer seeking God\u2019s will for this decision. But the day the final green light came on, the whole family was together. It was a Sunday. We were all at his church, First Baptist Church in Houston, including his senior staff. After the church service, we all gathered at the pastor\u2019s office. We were on our knees for two hours seeking God\u2019s will. At the end of that time, a word came through his wife, Heidi. And the word came, just saying, \u201cSeek God\u2019s face, not God\u2019s hand.\u201d And I\u2019ll tell you, it was as if there was a cloud of the holy spirit filling that place. Some of us were weeping, and Ted just looked up and said, \u201cLord, here am I, use me. I surrender to you, whatever you want.\u201d And he felt that was a green light to move forward.\n\nVetting of candidates for any office is poorly done by voters and most especially by the media. Even information inquiries on the internet by responsible voters often reap only agenda-bound data never revealing the motivations of its providers. In contrast, the media does offer a plethora of simple caricatures: for Trump, the hair; for Cruz, mocking comparisons seem to deny his real threat.\n\nIn today\u2019s polarized world, voters tend to have bias in either direction, confirmation bias guiding input of information, seeking or believing only data affirming their own beliefs. Such vetters reject sources because of real or imagined prejudices. For example, the left discards or disbelieves anything reported by Fox News, Breitbart, or WorldNetDaily. The right rejects with prejudice MSNBC, Huffington, or the New York Times.\n\nToo often, the result is that lies, misinformation, serious reporting and truth carry the same weight. Most are not truth-checked, and its acceptance depends on inborn bias.\n\nThe primary job of news media is to snag a rapt audience and keep them. Thus, the news media\u2019s goal is to make a profit, generally not to inform the public.\n\nSo the danger is that flawed candidates like Donald Trump or Ted Cruz could be nominated for president, and in the general election there is a pre-determined 31% social liberal bias and 31% socially conservative bias. Out of that proportion, perhaps 35% vote in midterm elections, maybe 55% in presidential elections.\n\nIf the prevailing numbers of those who vote are the most passionate, as are evangelical and anger-ridden voters, a Trump or a Cruz, depending on who gets the nomination, could prevail in the general election.\n\nTrump is a wild card. His policies would be unpredictable, perhaps fulfilling personal goals of self-aggrandizement and stature-building. He is an authoritarian who values, not coherent policies, but a Trump-centric world, favoring that which reflects his greatness.\n\nCruz is the perfect Machiavellian whose views seem fixed in concrete, but unlike the blustery Trump, his extremism is undercover. Though he professes principle, he will sacrifice them for a winning strategy. After all, he is the chosen one, one to fulfill a destiny to impose a dominion over a made-over fundamentalist world. Such justifies sacrificing others in shutting down the government, for example \u2014 all for his cause.\n\nGiven the right electoral advantage either could impose his vision on the modern world\u2013 one narcissistic, the other, dominion-bound. Take your pick.\n\nEven the fair-minded, ex-president, Jimmy Carter believes that the scarier choice is Cruz.\n\nHow many could be hurt by exposing the world to such foolhardy leadership \u2014 perhaps, 7 billion souls?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Nolan Chart", "description": "In the steamy summer of 2012, at the Irving, Texas, megachurch that helped elect Ted Cruz to the U.S. Senate, Rafael Cruz summoned followers to\u2026", "title": "Trump or Cruz? 7 billion affected.", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nolanchart.com/trump-or-cruz-7-billion-affected", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Election 2016", "tag": "theocracy", "published_time": "2016-03-14T22:37:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-15T01:16:37+00:00", "author": "https://www.nolanchart.com/author/ocjim"}, "fb": {"app_id": 380007855467375}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6b0\"", "article_summary": "He warned of \u201cdeath panels\u201d under \u201cObamacare\u201d and of Obama confiscating \u201cour fortunes.\u201dDuring the 2013 government shutdown, in large part, engineered by Ted Cruz, Cruz was anointed by pro-religious war, antigay pastors.\nIn the steamy summer of 2012, at the Irving, Texas, megachurch that helped elect Ted Cruz to the U.S. Senate, Rafael Cruz summoned followers to take dominion over leadership of our country.\nHe named his son, Ted Cruz, as one of the anointed.\nSeemingly Ted Cruz continues to sustain the laser-like focus of his traveling preacher, public speaker, father, whose fevered passion is said to have driven off Ted\u2019s mother decades ago.\nCruz is the perfect Machiavellian whose views seem fixed in concrete, but unlike the blustery Trump, his extremism is undercover."}
