From 2000 to 2012, both major parties\u2019 nominees received between 45 and 53 percent of the vote.\n\nHistorically, that\u2019s a narrow range, not seen since 1880-1892. It suggests something close to parity between two highly competitive parties.\n\nPolls for the 2016 race, however, suggest strikingly different results. One would be a nightmare for Republicans. The other would be a nightmare for Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThis column looks at the Republicans\u2019 nightmare (a later column will examine the Democrats\u2019 nightmare). In this scenario, the Democratic nominee is, as widely expected, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe assumption is that she encounters no significant turbulence in winning the nomination \u2014 a plausible extrapolation from current polling, which shows her miles ahead of any other Democrat.\n\nStraight-line extrapolations from current general election polling also look very good for her.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nAgainst various possible Republican opponents \u2014 in alphabetical order, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Paul Ryan \u2014 Clinton is averaging between 50 and 52 percent in the realclearpolitics.com averages of recent polls, while the Republicans are averaging between 38 and 42 percent.\n\nDue allowance should be made for the fact that none of these Republicans is well known nationally. It\u2019s reasonable to expect that a Republican nominee will run better if he puts on a competent campaign.\n\nBut Clinton is doing something in these polls that Democratic House candidates (and, to a lesser extent, Democratic Senate candidates) are having a hard time doing: running ahead of President Obama\u2019s job approval rating.\n\nThat rating currently stands at 44 percent, well below Clinton\u2019s 51 percent average in national polls.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nClinton runs ahead of Obama, though she too must be considered a supporter of the unpopular Obamacare. His current negative ratings on foreign policy don\u2019t seem to hurt her, perhaps because he was getting positive ratings on that during his first term, when she was secretary of State.\n\nIt seems that Clinton\u2019s standing reflects less on current judgments on Obama and more on rosy retrospective ratings of the presidency of Bill Clinton. Voters may not be eager for a third Obama term, but might like a third Clinton term.\n\nWhen you look at the relatively small number of statewide 2016 polls, you find that Clinton runs ahead of Republicans by double digits in the three electoral-vote-rich states of Florida (29 electoral votes), Ohio (18), and Pennsylvania (20), each of which voted only narrowly for Obama in 2012.\n\nOne reason for this might be that she is running stronger among older voters, since these states have relatively large elderly populations. These numbers suggest Clinton might carry these states by wider margins.\n\nThat would be a nightmare for Republicans if voters continue, as they have increasingly in recent elections, to vote straight tickets. That\u2019s because Republicans currently hold 17 House seats in Florida, 12 in Ohio, and 13 in Pennsylvania.\n\nMany of those Republicans might be in jeopardy if Clinton should turn out to lead down-ballot Democrats to victory. Democrats currently need to net only 17 seats for a House majority.\n\nIn addition, it seems likely that Clinton would run stronger than Obama in the Jacksonian belt stretching from West Virginia southwest to Bill Clinton\u2019s native Arkansas. That could also put in jeopardy some House seats that look pretty safe right now.\n\nThen there are the Senate contests. The 2016 lineup, with many incumbents elected in the heavily Republican year of 2010, has many plausible targets for Democrats. Even if Republicans win a Senate majority this year, they could lose it in 2016.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with Democratic analyst Brent Budowsky\u2019s suggestion that Hillary Clinton could win 45 states (Bill Clinton never won more than 32) to see the potential: a Democratic president, Democratic Senate, and Democratic House.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 hopes of repealing and replacing Obamacare would be permanently dashed. The left wing of the Democratic Party could push farther than it has dared under Obama.\n\nNone of this is inevitable, of course. Hillary Clinton could get roughed up in the primaries, and her record as secretary of State could be more a liability than an asset. The Republican nominee could easily run better than Republicans run now. Events could change attitudes.\n\nI think this scenario is unlikely. But it\u2019s one plausible extrapolation from current polling.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2014 THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nDISTRIBUTED BY CREATORS.COM\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans' hopes of repealing and replacing Obamacare would be permanently dashed.", "author": "Michael Barone", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Republicans' hopes of repealing and replacing Obamacare would be permanently dashed.", "title": "Here's Why Republicans Could Lose Miserably In The 2016 Elections", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obama_boehner_golf.jpg", "height": 281}, "updated_time": "2014-05-27T13:51:22-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/heres-republicans-will-lose-miserably-2016-elections/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans' hopes of repealing and replacing Obamacare would be permanently dashed.", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obama_boehner_golf.jpg", "title": "Here's Why Republicans Could Lose Miserably In The 2016 Elections", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-05-27T11:01:02-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2014-05-27T11:01:02-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T13:51:22-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "hillary clinton, republican party, politics, nation, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2727\"", "article_summary": "Advertisement \u2013 story continues belowThis column looks at the Republicans\u2019 nightmare (a later column will examine the Democrats\u2019 nightmare).\nThe Republican nominee could easily run better than Republicans run now.\nThat would be a nightmare for Republicans if voters continue, as they have increasingly in recent elections, to vote straight tickets.\nEven if Republicans win a Senate majority this year, they could lose it in 2016.\nMany of those Republicans might be in jeopardy if Clinton should turn out to lead down-ballot Democrats to victory."}
