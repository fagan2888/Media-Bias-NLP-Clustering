Blue Cross Blue Shield, the largest health insurance company offering plans in Wichita Falls, is letting its members who own grandmothered policies know that those plans will terminate at the end of the year due to the Affordable Care Act.





Last week, Financial Partners owner Kelly Fristoe says, Blue Cross sent out a letter to its members with grandmothered policies, plans put into place after March 2010 but prior to January 1, 2014, stating their plans will end starting next year.





Fristoe says grandmothered plans are not compliant with Obamacare and they must transition into a new plan that is.





He says they knew this was going to take place and that the state of Texas had added provisions that allowed grandmothered plans to go for one more year.





Fristoe says new plan options will be made available on Nov. 15.





"We will have plan information," he says.





In addition, Fristoe says, "We will have pricing information as to whether or not it's going to be proper for a person to go the health insurance marketplace to purchase that metallic-based plan or whether it's going to be to their benefit to just go straight to Blue Cross Blue Shield to purchase that plan."





Fristoe says it is very important for people to pay attention to this letter if they receive one and to reach out to their agent or Blue Cross if they have any questions.
