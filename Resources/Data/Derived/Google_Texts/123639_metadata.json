Harris was working as a confidential informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives at the time of the attack.\n\nHarris has never been arrested or charged in the attack, and defense attorneys are seeking more information about the work he did for the ATF and the cases he provided information on.\n\nProsecutors say they have given defense attorneys all of the information the ATF released to them.\n\nDefense attorneys called ATF Agent Brandy Spasaro, who handled Harris when he worked as a confidential informant. Spasaro received some details about Harris\u2019 work for the ATF, but declined to answer several questions that she said pertained to confidential information.\n\nHarris was recruited by the ATF after he was arrested by Denver police for possessing what appeared to be a small amount of crack cocaine. He continued to work as a confidential informant, completing a number of controlled purchases, until the October 2012 attacks.\n\nIn exchange for his work the ATF agree to speak to the Denver District Attorneys office on his behalf about the drug charge, Spasaro said. He was also paid about $3,000 for his work.\n\nAfter Harris spoke to police about the deaths at Fero\u2019s bar, the ATF gave Harris about $2,500 for temporary housing and relocation fees. Spasaro said Harris is no longer working as an ATF informant.\n\nSpasaro said there were at least five people Harris provided information about to the ATF. She could not discuss details of those cases or the information Harris provided.\n\nIn their motion seeking more information about Harris, defense attorneys listed three cases Harris was \u201cinvolved in.\u201d Those cases involved drug and weapons charges.\n\nAbout 200 motions have been filed in the case and attorneys are expected to argue several of them during hearings this week. Many of the filings address what evidence will be admitted at trial, including statements by four other men connected to the case.\n\nTwo other men charged in the case, brothers Joseph and Lynell Hill, have accepted plea agreements and have received lengthy sentences. Their statements contradict those made by Harris who told investigators Joseph Hill was the first person to start stabbing the victims.\n\nDefense attorneys are also challenging statements made by Lewis\u2019 former cellmate at the Denver jail. Lewis allegedly asked the cellmate to find and kill several witnesses in the case and provided him with a hand-drawn map of the crime scene.\n\nThe victims were the bar\u2019s owner, Young Suk Fero, 63, of Aurora; Daria M. Pohl, 21, of Denver; Kellene Fallon, 44, of Denver; Ross Richter, 29, of Overland Park, Kan.; and Tereasa Beesley, 45, of Denver.\n\nJordan Steffen: 303-954-1794, jsteffen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jsteffendp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Attorneys seeks details on informant in Denver bar attack that killed five", "title": "Attorneys seeks details on informant in Denver bar attack that killed five", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/11/attorneys-seeks-details-on-informant-in-denver-bar-attack-that-killed-five/", "image": {"width": 523, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140811__BN20140811_Z00_BNCD12LEWISp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140811__BN20140811_Z00_BNCD12LEWISp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-11T12:58:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:18:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3fae\"", "article_summary": "In their motion seeking more information about Harris, defense attorneys listed three cases Harris was \u201cinvolved in.\u201d Those cases involved drug and weapons charges.\nSpasaro received some details about Harris\u2019 work for the ATF, but declined to answer several questions that she said pertained to confidential information.\nDefense attorneys called ATF Agent Brandy Spasaro, who handled Harris when he worked as a confidential informant.\nShe could not discuss details of those cases or the information Harris provided.\nHarris was working as a confidential informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives at the time of the attack."}
