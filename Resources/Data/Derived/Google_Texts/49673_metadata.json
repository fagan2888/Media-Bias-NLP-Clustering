A 6 million dollar donation comes from the Irwin A. and Robert D. Goodman Foundation to renovate their softball and soccer fields into a sports complex.\n\nBob Goodman is remembered as one of the greatest local softball players back in the 40's and 50's. And his dream to build a sports complex in Madison is coming true.\n\n\"I love the game of softball. It's a part of me. I just love the interaction with the girls and the coaches,\" said Bridget Jost, Madison College pitcher.\n\nThe girls that play for the Madison College wolf pack are used to some applause, but today the clapping near the field didn't come from the stands. It came from a big white tent, that blends in with the skies. The announcement made inside that tent is not only a dream come true for the players but also Bob Goodman.\n\n\"While Bob Goodman was alive, one of his dreams was to build a sports complex for the city of Madison,\" said E.G. Schramka, Executive Director for the Goodman Foundation.\n\n\"It marks the largest financial contribution made to Madison College in its storied 103 year existence... for the benefit of the east side of Madison, and in turn, the entire Madison metropolitan area,\" said Dr. Jack E. Daniels, Madison College President.\n\nA renovated stadium for soccer and softball will benefit the college and the community.\n\n\"Hundreds of children and students will be served by the sports complex through games, camps and other activities -- similar to the Goodman Pool,\" said Schramka.\n\nMadison College will partner with Madison Metropolitan School District, the East Madison Community Center, and more.\n\nSome renovations include: turf batting cages, turf field, radiant heat in the clubhouse and dugouts, lights for nightplay, permanent stadium seating, concessions, locker rooms, bathrooms, and more.\n\nRenovation for the complex will start in spring of 2016, and will be completed in a few months.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Madison College received its largest donation ever.
