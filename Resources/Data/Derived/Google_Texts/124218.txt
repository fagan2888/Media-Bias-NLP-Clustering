The high temperature Monday is expected to be 58 degrees in Denver with wind gusts as high as 30 mph, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder.

“That’s very typical for February,” said Kyle Fredin, NWS meteorologist in Boulder.

The low Monday night isn’t expected to reach freezing, with the temperature dropping to 35.

A gradual warm-up will bring temperatures to 62 on Tuesday, 67 on Wednesday and 72 by Thursday, according to the NWS.
