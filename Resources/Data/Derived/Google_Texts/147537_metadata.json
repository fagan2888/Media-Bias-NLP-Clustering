Ultimately, the national goal is to reduce hospital-acquired conditions by 40% and readmissions by 20%.\n\nIn a joint statement, HANYS President Dennis Whalen and GNYHA President Kenneth Raske said, \u201cBy focusing on improving hospital culture and better engaging patients in their care, NYSPFP is enabling hospitals to achieve HHS\u2019 Triple Aim to improve the health of our communities and the patient care experience, while reducing health care costs. In pointing to NYSPFP\u2019s efforts, HHS recognizes the tremendous commitment, hard work, and accomplishments our hospitals have achieved through this collaboration to improve patient care.\u201d\n\nPartnership for Patients is a national patient safety initiative launched by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) under the Affordable Care Act. Selected in December 2011 by CMS to jointly lead this initiative in New York State, HANYS and GNYHA work with hospitals to focus on improving outcomes in key clinical areas, such as preventing infections and injuries from falls. Through its collaborative approach, NYSPFP provides member hospitals with technical assistance, training, education, and mechanisms to measure and evaluate their progress.
