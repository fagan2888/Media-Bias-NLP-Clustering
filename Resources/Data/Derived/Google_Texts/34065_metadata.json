Today: a look at studies of problems in how researchers report the results of clinical trials and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nPublished Trial Results Often Differ From Those Initially Posted\n\nDeborah Zarin, director of the database ClinicalTrials.gov at the National Library of Medicine, likes to say that her website is \u201ca window into the sausage factory\u201d\u2014a view that we usually don\u2019t get of how clinical trials work and how they don\u2019t.\n\nSix years ago, ClinicalTrials.gov was tasked by Congress to embark on a new experiment: In addition to trial registrations, many trial sponsors were required to deposit their results in the public database for anyone to access. At the congress, a group from Yale University School of Medicine explored how well the results posted on ClinicalTrials.gov match up with what\u2019s published. What they found was not particularly encouraging.\n\nJessica Becker, a medical student, described how she and her Yale colleagues\u2014Harlan Krumholz, Gal Ben-Josef, and Joseph Ross\u2014identified 96 trials published between July 2010 and June 2011, all of them with a ClinicalTrials.gov identification number. They focused on studies that appeared in high-profile journals. Almost three-quarters of the trials analyzed were funded by industry.\n\nAll but one trial had at least one discrepancy in how trial details, results, or side effects were reported.\n\nOne big question was whether the same primary endpoints and secondary endpoints appeared in both the final publication and the ClinicalTrials.gov results database. A primary endpoint represents the main goal of a study and the question or questions it was designed to answer. Secondary endpoints are often added to squeeze as much information as possible out of what\u2019s collected, but statistically they can be weaker because the trial wasn\u2019t created with them in mind. Primary endpoints in 14 trials appeared only on ClinicalTrials.gov, while primary endpoints from 10 others were only in the publication. The results described were also different in some cases: For 21% of the primary endpoints, what appeared in the journal wasn\u2019t exactly the outcome described on ClinicalTrials.gov, and in 6%, the Yale group suggested that this difference influenced how the results would be interpreted.\n\nFor secondary endpoints, the difference was even more dramatic: Of more than 2000 secondary endpoints listed across the trials, just 16% appeared the same way in both the public database and the published article along with the same results. Results for dozens of secondary endpoints were inconsistent. \u201cOur findings raise concerns about the accuracy of information in both places, leading us to wonder which to believe,\u201d Becker said.\n\nThe group hasn\u2019t probed why this is happening: There could be innocent errors on ClinicalTrials.gov or typos in publications. Or authors may promote \u201cmore favorable stuff\u201d in what\u2019s printed, she speculated.\n\n\u201cThere are many, many microdecisions\u201d that come with writing up a publication, Zarin says. The uncomfortable results presented by Becker are \u201cpart of what motivates the desire\u201d for anonymized information on individual patients, Zarin suggests\u2014exposing that might be the only way to reconcile the discrepancies. Zarin also speculates that researchers might add positive secondary endpoints after the study is completed\u2014a big no-no in the trials world\u2014to give it a rosier hue, and thus they don\u2019t appear on ClinicalTrials.gov when the study is first registered. Zarin is conducting her own analysis of the ClinicalTrials.gov results database, which now includes results from almost 10,000 trials. (150,000 trials are registered on the site.) She says she\u2019s reaching similar outcomes as the Yale group.\n\nOne question that the Yale team didn\u2019t explore was whether researchers had inputted their results on the site before submitting their paper\u2014something that would allow journal editors or reviewers to play detective and see whether the document they have matches up with what\u2019s in the database.\n\nPotential Conflicts Still Going Unreported\n\nClinical trial authors still aren\u2019t reporting their conflicts of interest, despite years of conversations and new policies encouraging them to do so. That\u2019s the bottom line of a study presented here at the International Congress on Peer Review and Biomedical Publication, where Kristine Rasmussen from the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Copenhagen presented a new study tackling this question.\n\nIn most countries, it might be tough to determine whether authors who don\u2019t disclose conflicts actually have them. But Denmark is unusual, because all Danish physicians are required by law to fill out forms if they collaborate with industry, and those forms are publicly available. (The United States is beginning to implement a similar rule as part of the Affordable Care Act.) The Danish system made it straightforward for Rasmussen and her Cochrane colleagues\u2014Jeppe Schroll, Peter G\u00f8tzsche, and Andreas Lundh\u2014to compare disclosures of industry associations in published papers with the forms filed by doctors.\n\nThey looked at journals that follow recommendations from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) and searched for trials that had at least one Danish physician author who did not work at a company. They selected 100 recent studies. About half the doctors had some financial conflict of interest with a drug company, though not necessarily the company sponsoring the published research, they found.\n\nAlthough most of the doctors disclosed relationships they had with the firm funding the published research, fewer than half shared relationships they had with industry competitors. And despite all the talk in recent years about conflicts, 16% who had a financial tie to a sponsor or drug manufacturer leading the study didn\u2019t report it. One example cited by Rasmussen: a physician who was an advisory board member and speaker for AstraZeneca, maker of the drug being covered by the paper, who declared he or she had no conflicts.\n\n\u201cI was actually very disappointed\u201d by this, says Vivienne Bachelet, editor-in-chief of the journal Medwave in Santiago, who was not involved in the study. In her country, she says, the \u201clevel of awareness is just nil\u201d about conflicts of interest. Medical societies in particular get substantial funding from drug companies but almost no one\u2014the societies themselves, drug regulators, or the individual doctors\u2014see this as something that should be disclosed, Bachelet says. \u201cIf they\u2019re not disclosing over there,\u201d in Denmark, \u201cwhat\u2019s to be expected in Chile?\u201d\n\nRasmussen noted that one issue might be vagueness in the ICMJE conflict of interest form: While it\u2019s specific about the expansive nature of conflicts that might arise, such as travel paid by a company or fees for expert testimony, it suggests that authors disclose only those that are \u201crelevant.\u201d Says Rasmussen, \u201cauthors are left to decide\u201d what falls into that category.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "news_authors": "Jennifer Couzin-Frankel", "description": "At peer-review conference, studies find problematic practices", "og": {"site_name": "Science | AAAS", "description": "At peer-review conference, studies find problematic practices", "title": "Of Conflicts and Clinical Trials: Researchers Report New Results", "url": "http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/09/conflicts-and-clinical-trials-researchers-report-new-results", "image": {"width": 1280, "secure_url": "https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/si-clincal%20trial.jpg?itok=u6RSXNCn", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/si-clincal%20trial.jpg?itok=u6RSXNCn", "height": 720}, "updated_time": "2016-01-12T18:48:55-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At peer-review conference, studies find problematic practices", "title": "Of Conflicts and Clinical Trials: Researchers Report New Results", "url": "http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/09/conflicts-and-clinical-trials-researchers-report-new-results", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/si-clincal%20trial.jpg?itok=u6RSXNCn", "height": 720}, "creator": {"identifier": "@NewsfromScience", "id": 17089636}, "site": {"identifier": "@newsfromscience", "id": 17089636}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, index, noodp", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"admins": 1400521805, "app_id": 1478542162442556}, "news_section": "ScienceInsider", "keywords": "science", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ScienceNOW", "published_time": "2013-09-10T15:34:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-12T18:48:55-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no", "news_key_words": "Scientific Community"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6c1\"", "article_summary": "Today: a look at studies of problems in how researchers report the results of clinical trials and potential conflicts of interest.\nZarin is conducting her own analysis of the ClinicalTrials.gov results database, which now includes results from almost 10,000 trials.\nOne big question was whether the same primary endpoints and secondary endpoints appeared in both the final publication and the ClinicalTrials.gov results database.\nAll but one trial had at least one discrepancy in how trial details, results, or side effects were reported.\nPrimary endpoints in 14 trials appeared only on ClinicalTrials.gov, while primary endpoints from 10 others were only in the publication."}
