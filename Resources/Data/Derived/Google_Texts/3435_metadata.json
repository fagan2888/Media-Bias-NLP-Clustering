Many people have had similar night encounters with who sounds like the same person.\n\nNot far from a school and where children play, there's a man roaming the streets after dark.\n\n\u201cI looked through my window, and it was a man I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d one woman said. \u201cHe asked me if the man of the house was available, and I told him, \u2018How can I help you?\u2019 and he said, \u201c\u2018My son\u2019s having an asthma attack.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also said he was her neighbor, but nobody around had ever seen him before. The mother of two told the mystery man she'd call 911, and that's when he became agitated.\n\n\u201cHe told me, \u2018Don\u2019t effing call the cops,\u2019 hit my door and took off,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the same night but a different front porch, Hunter Jones\u2019s mom didn't open her door.\n\n\u201cShe looked through the window and the guy was looking at her through there. They made eye contact, and she started freaking out,\u201d Jones said.\n\nThis time the man said he was a neighbor and that he needed help with his vehicle.\n\n\u201cHe said he needed jumper cables to jump his car,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAgain, nobody recognized him as a neighbor and there was no car anywhere in sight.\n\n\u201cWhen she went to file the police report, they said it matches the profile of a known sex offender they have in their database,\u201d Jones said.\n\nThe incident is eerily similar to others in the area, and people have taken to social media talking about their encounter with a strange man at their door. Another late night knock happened in nearby Del City, but if the man shows up at Jones\u2019s house again, he knows exactly what will happen.\n\n\u201cIf he came back, the police would definitely be called,\u201d he said.\n\nNicoma Park police say they've had a similar call, and the city of Choctaw says they've had at least two.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Neighbors are on alert after they say a strange man has been showing up on doorsteps at night in the Choctaw area.
