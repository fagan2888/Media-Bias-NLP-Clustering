Additional information sessions are scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Jan. 20 and Feb. 10 at the fire district headquarters at 1020 W. Algonquin Road.\n\nVan Dorpe said in his presentation the department needs a revenue boost because a federal court decision in 2015 forced the department to stop providing radio frequency fire alarms to commercial property in its district. Providing that service netted the department $407,000 at its peak in 2013.\n\n\"In a very real sense, the reason we're here today asking for what we're asking is because of this,\" Van Dorpe said. \"If I could make $400,000 reappear, we would be looking at other options.\"\n\nThe chief said the Affordable Care Act would require the district to provide health care to part-time employees at an estimated cost of $200,000.\n\nHe also cited a long-term decline in property values, a low consumer price index and rises in medical insurance and workers' compensation.\n\nVan Dorpe's presentation also said the department had reclassified and eliminated positions to try to make ends meet, but those measures would not be enough in the coming years.\n\nThe department is not currently setting aside any money to pay for the replacement of equipment, he said.\n\nThe fire district operates three fire stations and has 49 full-time and 15 to 21 part-time employees, Van Dorpe said.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 mySuburbanLife.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.mysuburbanlife.com/2016/01/07/algonquin-lake-in-the-hills-fire-district-makes-case-for-tax-increase-referendum/ausnx3z/", "image": "http://www.mysuburbanlife.com/images/avatar.png", "site_name": "mySuburbanLife.com", "title": "Algonquin-Lake in the Hills fire district makes case for tax increase referendum"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1092703993", "tout": {"article": {"id": "15e8557c-17b6-4181-b197-ecc9ef315197"}}, "keywords": "#Algonquin, algonquin, lake in the hills", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2034\"", "article_summary": "In all, it would raise about $900,000 to the department's tax revenue on top of the current projected revenue of about $8 million.\nThe fire district operates three fire stations and has 49 full-time and 15 to 21 part-time employees, Van Dorpe said.\n\"In a very real sense, the reason we're here today asking for what we're asking is because of this,\" Van Dorpe said.\nThat would increase the fire district's portion of that resident's tax bill by about 10 percent, based on tax rates from last year.\nThe tax would add about $61 to the tax bill for the owner of a $200,000 home who takes the homestead exemption."}
