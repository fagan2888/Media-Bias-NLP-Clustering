(Sonje Jessen/For the Reporter-Herald)\n\nBellvue has changed little over the years. It is located at the intersection of the road to Horsetooth Reservoir and the Rist Canyon Road (County Road 52E).\n\nAt the corner sits the old historic Flowers store, constructed in 1883 by Jacob Flowers.\n\nThe following year, a post office was added. It may have been built as a result of demand for a place to purchase groceries by the quarry workers in the valley now occupied by Horsetooth Reservoir.\n\nIn 1948, it was purchased by the Cache la Poudre Grange 456, and today, serves as a senior and event center.\n\nCivil War veteran Jacob Flowers was born in Pennsylvania and at one time lived along the Mississippi River where he owned several steamboats. Flowers arrived in Colorado in 1872 from Kansas searching for a place for a colony.\n\nBuilt in 1883, the Jacob Flowers store in Bellvue was the first mercantile business in Pleasant Valley. Demand by nearby quarry workers may have been the impetus for construction of the store. (Kenneth Jessen Collection)\n\nAfter traveling around the state, he picked Pleasant Valley as having the best potential for his project.\n\nFlowers returned to Kansas with flattering reports about Pleasant Valley. As a result, 25 families decided to head west, and some settled in Greeley (known as Union Colony at the time) while others traveled to Fort Collins. The idea for a colony apparently never materialized.\n\nFlowers purchased the Joseph Mason farm and laid out the town of Bellvue. He constructed a fine home made of locally quarried stone as well as the store \u2014 both are standing today. As the town's only merchant, he was affectionately known as \"Uncle Jake.\"\n\nFlowers is noted for the construction of the Flowers Road above the Cache la Poudre River in 1879.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLarimer County contracted him to construct a road between Buckhorn Creek, over Cameron Pass and down Michigan Creek on the west side of the Continental Divide. The idea was to serve the new mining industry in North Park.\n\nA stipulation in the contract was to build a road feasible by hauling a load of oats using a two-wheel cart. Flowers met the terms of the contract, but only by using a considerable amount of manpower. The road did not prove practical due to the rough terrain.\n\nPortions of Flower's pioneer road can be driven today, and the upper portion is a hiking trail.\n\nOne of Flowers' sons, Ben, took over operation of the store and became the first postmaster of Bellvue. The Flowers family also operated a nearby sawmill.\n\nIn recent years, money was raised to restore the old store by those that are named as part of the original grange or their descendants. The original floor was shored up, the bathroom made handicap accessible and the exterior mortar re-pointed.\n\nIn order to apply for designation on the National Register of Historic Places, the windows have to be replaced with ones similar to the originals. One of the two front windows now meets this criterion, and money is being raised for the other window.\n\nVolunteers and money could be used to finish the work on this old store. Call Judy Jackson at 970-482-5091.\n\nThe Flowers Store is located on the southwest corner of County Road 23 and County Road 52E (Rist Canyon Road).\n\nNot to be overlooked, on the north side of County Road 52E is the Flowers home, also built of stone. Built in 1880, it too is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nKenneth Jessen has been a Loveland resident since 1965. He is an author of 20 books and more than 1,600 articles.
