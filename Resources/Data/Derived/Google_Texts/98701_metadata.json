Gohmert spoke as part of the monthly event, \u201cConversations with Conservatives,\u201d hosted by the Heritage Foundation.\n\nAs a fervent opponent of marriage equality (and reason, logic, among other things), Gohmert believes these judges have simply been abusing their power and their interpretation of the law.\n\nMichele Bachmann was also there to share her views on marriage equality.\n\nRead more about their remarks below the jump.\u201cFor one omnipotent, omniscious, ubiquitous federal judge who is wise beyond his education to say \u2013 to make such a declaration about the law, I think, requires revisiting by each state and compliance with the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d Gohmert argued.\n\nAccording to Gohmert, these judges seem to share the attitude of \u201cbasically, we haven't seen any biological evidence to support marriage being between a man and a woman.\u201d Gohmert's advice for pro-equality judges? \u201cThey need some basic plumbing lessons.\u201d\n\nBecause of course: Marriage has little to do with love, and absolutely everything to do with which body parts go where.\n\n\n\n\n\nGohmert and Bachmann previously teamed up in a bizarre press conference in Egypt\n\nNot letting herself be outdone by Gohmert's strange \u201cplumbing\u201d references, Michele Bachmann took the opportunity to blame marriage equality on President Obama for refusing to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in courts, and then took a shot at Obamacare, simply because. \u201cThe legacy of Barack Obama will be of the establishment of lawlessness in the United States,\u201d argued Bachmann.\n\nBachmann also summoned the problems going on in Egypt by associating President Obama and the judges ruling in favor of marriage equality to the ousted Egyptian president, Mohammed Morsi. Bachmann argued President Obama and the pro-equality judges are acting just like Morsi, \u201cwho all of the sudden declared that his edicts were not appealable to a court.\u201d\n\nMorsi was ousted by the Egyptian armed forces last year, and is facing trial on charges of inciting murder. A very far off comparison to those fighting for the Constitutional rights of LGBT folks to be recognized.\n\nGohmert previously made comments regarding gay marriage after the Supreme Court's DOMA ruling last summer, stating marriage equality signals the collapse of civilization, as gay marriage goes against \u201cthe laws of nature and nature's God.\u201d\n\nNote to Gohmert: Gay marriage has been legal in Massachusetts since 2004, for almost an entire decade.
