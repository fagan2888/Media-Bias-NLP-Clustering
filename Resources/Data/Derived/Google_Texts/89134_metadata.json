These companies are scheduled to report earnings starting next week, and analysts expect to see top-line growth, but flat margins, as the companies continue testing new strategies to generate profit in a sector undergoing significant upheaval.\n\n\"We don't know if they're actually making money on certain segments of the business,\" Dustin Eggers, a principal at Decision Resources Group in Chicago, said of health insurers that are selling plans on Affordable Care Act exchanges. \"It's unknown. There are a lot of issues with that population,\" he pointed out. If any insurer can figure out how to reliably turn a profit and engage a population that has historically turned a blind eye to healthcare, \"it's a game changer,\" Eggers added.\n\nPhoto: David McNew/Getty Images\n\nBroadly speaking, the exchanges have helped insurers, said Jeffrey Loo, an equity analyst at S&P in New York. \"The ACA has been a net benefit for health insurers,\" he said. \"Membership has grown significantly for the managed healthcare industry.\"\n\nIn other, more specific ways, the exchanges have not helped. Profit margins for insurers have remained slim, Loo said.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see continued pressure on the exchange business,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a partner at PwC. He and other observers said that figuring out how to succeed on the exchanges remains one of the biggest issues insurers have to deal with.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported robust first-quarter earnings Tuesday of $1.81 per share, on revenues of $44.5 billion. But CEO Stephen Hemsley said in a call with investors that the company would exit all but \"a handful\" of exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act in 2017. The company has said it lost $720 million on those exchanges in 2015.\n\nIf UnitedHealth, the country's largest health insurer, is backing out of those marketplaces just three years after they were established, some in the industry are wondering how other insurers will figure out how to thrive on the exchanges, through which the White House estimates more than 12 million people bought insurance in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nAetna CEO Mark Bertolini has said the company is working with the government to improve business on Obamacare exchanges, even though he has questioned their profitability. Joseph Swedish, Anthem's CEO, has indicated the company would stick with the exchanges. But with United's exit, some analysts have suggested that both Aetna and Anthem will have to raise the price of premiums for plans they sell on the exchanges in order to ensure profitability, Reuters reported.\n\nAmid concerns about profits, these insurers are now trying to team up to improve economies of scale and cost-efficiency. In June, Aetna said it would acquire Humana for $34 billion; the next month, Anthem, the U.S.'s second-largest insurer by revenue, announced it had agreed to buy Cigna, the country's fifth-largest, for $48.4 billion.\n\n\"Healthcare markets are constantly changing \u2014 whether as the result of legislation or the imperative to meet the needs of consumers and providers,\" Swedish told a congressional committee in September, according to his prepared remarks. \"The goal of this transaction is to provide a better product ... that promotes affordability, increases accessibility, and enhances quality by focusing on innovation and collaboration.\"\n\nBoth deals still await approval from regulators, including a review by the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division. Analysts expect the deals to go through.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see regulatory intervention to halt any of those mergers,\" Eggers, the DRG analyst, said.\n\nAnthem (ANTM) is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings April 27 before markets open. Analysts' consensus is to see earnings of $3.34 per share, up from $3.09 the year before.\n\n\"They\u2019re making a profit\" on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, Loo said of Anthem.\n\nWhen Hartford, Connecticut-based Aetna (AET) reports before markets open April 28, analysts expect to see $2.22 in earnings per share, barely up from $2.20 the year prior. Loo attributed this to a combination of a \u201cstagnant membership growth rate\u201d and an uptick in cost trends.\n\nLouisville-based Humana Group (HUM), reporting May 4, is expected to produce earnings per share of $1.81 on $13.76 billion in revenues, down from $2.47 a year ago. When Cigna Health Group (CI), headquartered in Bloomfield, Connecticut, reports May 6, it is predicted to bring in $2.17 per share, compared to $2.04 per share a year ago on revenues of $9.47 billion.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "unitedhealth group, obamacare, affordable care act, cigna, anthem, humana, aetna, affordable care act exchanges, healthcare exchanges, aca exchanges, healthcare industry, insurers, obamacare exchange signup, how much is health insurance", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Earnings will likely reflect that Anthem, Aetna, Humana and Cigna are still figuring out how to thrive in an Obamacare world.", "title": "Healthcare Earnings: Anthem (ANTM), Aetna (AET), Humana (HUM), Cigna (CI) Still Figuring Out How To Profit Under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/healthcare-earnings-anthem-antm-aetna-aet-humana-hum-cigna-ci-still-figuring-out-how-2356762", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/04/20/image-96525183.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Earnings will likely reflect that Anthem, Aetna, Humana and Cigna are still figuring out how to thrive in an Obamacare world.", "title": "Healthcare Earnings: Anthem (ANTM), Aetna (AET), Humana (HUM), Cigna (CI) Still Figuring Out How To Profit Under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/healthcare-earnings-anthem-antm-aetna-aet-humana-hum-cigna-ci-still-figuring-out-how-2356762", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/04/20/image-96525183.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/04/20/image-96525183.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2016-04-20T16:28:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T17:36:09-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Earnings will likely reflect that Anthem, Aetna, Humana and Cigna are still figuring out how to thrive in an Obamacare world."}, "article_summary": "\"The ACA has been a net benefit for health insurers,\" he said.\n\"They\u2019re making a profit\" on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, Loo said of Anthem.\nWhen Cigna Health Group (CI), headquartered in Bloomfield, Connecticut, reports May 6, it is predicted to bring in $2.17 per share, compared to $2.04 per share a year ago on revenues of $9.47 billion.\nWhen Hartford, Connecticut-based Aetna (AET) reports before markets open April 28, analysts expect to see $2.22 in earnings per share, barely up from $2.20 the year prior.\nLouisville-based Humana Group (HUM), reporting May 4, is expected to produce earnings per share of $1.81 on $13.76 billion in revenues, down from $2.47 a year ago."}
