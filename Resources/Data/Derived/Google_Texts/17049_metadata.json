I\u2019m pro-choice! I\u2019m pro-same-sex-marriage! I\u2019m not a racist! I just want lower taxes, and smaller government, and less government regulation of business. I\u2019m fiscally conservative, and socially liberal.\u201d\n\nHow many liberals and progressives have heard this? It\u2019s ridiculously common. Hell, even David Koch of the Koch Brothers has said, \u201cI\u2019m a conservative on economic matters and I\u2019m a social liberal.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s wrong. W-R-O-N-G Wrong.\n\nYou can\u2019t separate fiscal issues from social issues. They\u2019re deeply intertwined. They affect each other. Economic issues often are social issues. And conservative fiscal policies do enormous social harm. That\u2019s true even for the mildest, most generous version of \u201cfiscal conservatism\u201d \u2014 low taxes, small government, reduced regulation, a free market. These policies perpetuate human rights abuses. They make life harder for people who already have hard lives. Even if the people supporting these policies don\u2019t intend this, the policies are racist, sexist, classist (obviously), ableist, homophobic, transphobic, and otherwise socially retrograde. In many ways, they do more harm than so-called \u201csocial policies\u201d that are supposedly separate from economic ones. Here are seven reasons that \u201cfiscally conservative, socially liberal\u201d is nonsense.\n\n1: Poverty, and the cycle of poverty.This is the big one. Poverty is a social issue. The cycle of poverty \u2014 the ways that poverty itself makes it harder to get out of poverty, the ways that poverty can be a permanent trap lasting for generations \u2014 is a social issue, and a human rights issue.\n\nIf you\u2019re poor, there\u2019s about a two in three chance that you\u2019re going to stay poor for at least a year, about a two in three chance that if you do pull out of poverty you\u2019ll be poor again within five years \u2014 and about a two in three chance that your children are going to be poor. Among other things: Being poor makes it much harder to get education or job training that would help you get higher-paying work. Even if you can afford job training or it\u2019s available for free \u2014 if you have more than one job, or if your work is menial and exhausting, or if both of those are true (often the case if you\u2019re poor), there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t have the time or energy to get that training, or to look for higher-paying work. Being poor typically means you can\u2019t afford to lose your job \u2014 which means you can\u2019t afford to unionize, or otherwise push back against your wages and working conditions. It means that a temporary crisis \u2014 sickness or injury, job loss, death in the family \u2014 can destroy your life: you have no cushion, nobody you know has a cushion, a month or two without income and you\u2019re totally screwed. If you do lose your job, or if you\u2019re disabled, the labyrinthine bureaucracy of unemployment and disability benefits is exhausting: if you do manage to navigate it, it can deplete your ability to do much of anything else to improve your life \u2014 and if you can\u2019t navigate it, that\u2019s very likely going to tank your life.\n\nAlso, ironically, being poor is expensive. You can\u2019t buy high-quality items that last longer and are a bargain in the long run. You can\u2019t buy in bulk. You sure as hell can\u2019t buy a house: depending on where you live, monthly mortgage payments might be lower than the rent you\u2019re paying, but you can\u2019t afford a down payment, and chances are a bank won\u2019t give you a mortgage anyway. You can\u2019t afford the time or money to take care of your health \u2014 which means you\u2019re more likely to get sick, which is expensive. If you don\u2019t have a bank account (which many poor people don\u2019t), you have to pay high fees at check-cashing joints. If you run into a temporary cash crisis, you have to borrow from price-gouging payday-advance joints. If your car breaks down and you can\u2019t afford to repair or replace it, it can mean unemployment. If you can\u2019t afford a car at all, you\u2019re severely limited in what jobs you can take in the first place \u2014 a limitation that\u2019s even more severe when public transportation is wildly inadequate. If you\u2019re poor, you may have to move a lot \u2014 and that\u2019s expensive. These aren\u2019t universally true for all poor people \u2014 but way too many of them are true, for way too many people.\n\nSecond chances, once considered a hallmark of American culture and identity,have become a luxury. One small mistake \u2014 or no mistake at all, simply the mistake of being born poor \u2014 can trap you there forever.\n\nPlus, being poor doesn\u2019t just mean you\u2019re likely to stay poor. It means that if you have children, they\u2019re more likely to stay poor. It means you\u2019re less able to give your children the things they need to flourish \u2014 both in easily-measurable tangibles like good nutrition, and less-easily-measurable qualities like a sense of stability. The effect of poverty on children \u2014 literally on their brains, on their ability to literally function \u2014 is not subtle, and it lasts into adulthood. Poverty\u2019s effect on adults is appalling enough. Its effect on children is an outrage.\n\nAnd in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, poverty \u2014 including the cycle of poverty and the effect of poverty on children \u2014 disproportionately affects African Americans, Hispanics, other people of color, women, trans people, disabled people, and other marginalized groups.\n\nSo what does this have to do with fiscal policy? Well, duh. Poverty is 1perpetuated or alleviated, worsened or improved, by fiscal policy. That\u2019s not the only thing affecting poverty, but it\u2019s one of the biggest things. To list just a few of the most obvious examples of very direct influence: Tax policy. Minimum wage. Funding of public schools and universities. Unionization rights. Banking and lending laws. Labor laws. Funding of public transportation. Public health care. Unemployment benefits. Disability benefits. Welfare policy. Public assistance that doesn\u2019t penalize people for having savings. Child care. Having a functioning infrastructure, having economic policies that support labor, having a tax system that doesn\u2019t steal from the poor to give to the rich, having a social safety net \u2014 a real safety net, not one that just barely keeps people from starving to death but one that actually lets people get on their feet and function \u2014 makes a difference. When these systems are working, and are working well, it\u2019s easier for people to get out of poverty. When they\u2019re not, it\u2019s difficult to impossible. And I haven\u2019t even gotten into the fiscal policy of so-called \u201cfree\u201d trade, and all the ways it feeds poverty both in the U.S. and around the world. (I\u2019ll get to that in a bit.)\n\nFiscal policy affects poverty. And in the United States, \u201cfiscally conservative\u201d means supporting fiscal policies that perpetuate poverty. \u201cFiscally conservative\u201d means slashing support systems that help the poor, lowering taxes for the rich, cutting corners for big business, and screwing labor \u2014 policies that both worsen poverty and make it even more of an inescapable trap.\n\n2: Domestic violence, workplace harassment, and other abuse. See above, re: cycle of poverty. If someone is being beaten by their partner, harassed or assaulted at work, abused by their parents \u2014 and if they\u2019re poor, and if there\u2019s fuck-all for a social safety net \u2014 it\u2019s a hell of a lot harder for them to leave. What\u2019s more, the stress of poverty itself \u2014 especially inescapable, entrapped poverty \u2014 contributes to violence and abuse.\n\nAnd you know who gets disproportionately targeted with domestic violence and workplace harassment? Women. Especially women of color. And LGBT folks \u2014 especially trans women of color, and LGBT kids and teenagers. Do you care about racist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynist violence? Then quit undercutting the social safety net. A solid safety net \u2014 a safety net that isn\u2019t made of tissue paper, and that doesn\u2019t require the people in it to constantly scramble just to stay there, much less to climb out \u2014 isn\u2019t going to magically eliminate this violence and harassment. But it sure makes it easier for people to escape it.\n\n3: Disenfranchisement. There\u2019s a cycle that in some ways is even uglier than the cycle of poverty \u2014 because it blocks people from changing the policies that keep the cycle of poverty going. I\u2019m talking about the cycle of disenfranchisement.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the myriad ways that the super-rich control the political process \u2014 and in controlling the political process, both make themselves richer and give themselves even more control over the political process. Purging voter rolls. Cutting polling place hours. Cutting back on early voting \u2014 especially in poor districts. Voter ID laws. Roadblocks to voter registration \u2014 noticeably aimed at people likely to vote progressive. Questionable-at-best voter fraud detection software, which \u2014 by some wild coincidence \u2014 tends to flag names that are common among minorities. Eliminating Election Day registration. Restricting voter registration drives. Gerrymandering \u2014 creating voting districts with the purpose of skewing elections in your favor.\n\nVoter suppression is a real thing in the United States. And these policies are set in place by the super-rich \u2014 or, to be more precise, by the government officials who are buddies with the super-rich and are beholden to them. These policies are not set in place to reduce voter fraud: voter fraud is extremely rarein the U.S., to the point of being almost non-existent. The policies are set in place to make voting harder for people who would vote conservative plutocrats out of office. If you\u2019re skeptical about whether this is actually that deliberate, whether these policies really are written by plutocratic villains cackling over how they took even more power from the already disempowered \u2014 remember Pennsylvania Republican House Leader Mike Turzai, who actually said, in words, \u201cVoter ID, which is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done.\u201d Remember former Florida Republican chairman Jim Greer, who actually said, in words, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to cut down on early voting because early voting is not good for us.\u201d Remember the now-former North Carolina Republican official Don Yelton, who actually said, in words, that voter restrictions including voter ID were \u201cgoing to kick Democrats in the butt.\u201d Remember the Texas Republican attorney general and candidate for governor Greg Abbott, who actually said, in words, that \u201ctheir redistricting decisions were designed to increase the Republican Party\u2019s electoral prospects at the expense of the Democrats.\u201d Remember Doug Preisse, Republican chair of Franklin County (Ohio\u2019s second-largest county) who actually said (well, wrote), in words, that Ohio Republicans were pushing hard to limit early voting because \u201cI guess I really actually feel we shouldn\u2019t contort the voting process to accommodate the urban \u2014 read African-American \u2014 voter-turnout machine.\u201d (And no, the \u201cread African-American\u201d clarification isn\u2019t mine \u2014 it\u2019s his.) Remember\u2026 oh, you get the idea. Disenfranchisement is not some accidental side effect of Republican-sponsored voting restrictions. Disenfranchisement is the entirely intentional point.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's a popular refrain among \"centrists.\" The truth is that social and fiscal issues are inextricably bound", "title": "7 ideas completely lost on people who are \u201cfiscally conservative but socially liberal\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It's a popular refrain among \"centrists.\" The truth is that social and fiscal issues are inextricably bound", "title": "7 ideas completely lost on people who are \u201cfiscally conservative but socially liberal\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/22/7_ideas_completely_lost_on_people_who_are_fiscally_conservative_but_socially_liberal_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/hannity_oreilly_kelly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's a popular refrain among \"centrists.\" The truth is that social and fiscal issues are inextricably bound", "title": "7 ideas completely lost on people who are \u201cfiscally conservative but socially liberal\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/hannity_oreilly_kelly.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Greta Christina", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, David Koch, Koch Brothers, Poverty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca445\"", "article_summary": "In many ways, they do more harm than so-called \u201csocial policies\u201d that are supposedly separate from economic ones.\nIf you\u2019re poor, you may have to move a lot \u2014 and that\u2019s expensive.\nHere are seven reasons that \u201cfiscally conservative, socially liberal\u201d is nonsense.\nHell, even David Koch of the Koch Brothers has said, \u201cI\u2019m a conservative on economic matters and I\u2019m a social liberal.\u201dAnd it\u2019s wrong.\nI\u2019m fiscally conservative, and socially liberal.\u201dHow many liberals and progressives have heard this?"}
