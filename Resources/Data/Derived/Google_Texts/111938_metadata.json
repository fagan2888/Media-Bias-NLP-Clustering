It\u2019s also a good time to spotlight the top-quality movies that will vie for Oscars and be released in theaters and on DVD/VOD in weeks to come.\n\nBelle (***1/2) A mind-boggling story based on fact about a biracial female being raised in a White aristocratic home in 18th Century England. Actress extraordinaire Gugu Mbatha-Raw lights up the screen in a very romantic and surprisingly socially relevant tale. Lavish production elements. Nice acting all around. Strong writing by Misan Sagay. Smart direction by British director Amma Asante.\n\nBeyond the Lights (***) This ode to chanteuses fighting personal demons (Rihana-types) is the brainchild of writer/director Gina Prince-Bythewood, who made the most romantic film of the year. A wayward pop/hip hop singer (Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Belle) is rescued by a stoic, virile cop (Nate Parker). A sweet, modern love story set in the soul-eating, kinetic music industry. Well written, directed and acted.\n\nBirdman (****) It\u2019s not like Michael Keaton\u2019s career was kaput, but it seems like he raised himself from the dead with this invigorating performance. Mexican director/writer Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu gave Keaton a plum role as a has-been actor and ex-super hero trying to make it big on Broadway. The line between reality and fantasy is blurred. Excellent acting from all involved including Ed Norton and Naomi Watts.\n\nBoyhood (****) Shooting a film over the course of 12 years takes patience and imagination. Writer/director Richard Linklater had that in abundance as he followed the life of a small boy into young adulthood. Patricia Arquette as the stalwart mom is superb and Ethan Hawke as the bungling dad is pretty good too.\n\nDear White People (***) The narrative follows the plight of four Black students at an almost all-White Ivy League school. Biting satire plays havoc with race relations. Credit filmmaker Justin Simien with a brilliant view of a complex subject and for equating Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Django with Birth of a Nation and Gone With the Wind. Bravo.\n\nGrand Budapest Hotel (***1/2) Wes Anderson\u2019s quirky films (The Royal Tenenbaums) have been an acquired taste only a few could love until this whimsical story about a snowy mountaintop hotel in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka. To hell with conventional storytelling, just throw in a confusing plotline, a bazillion cameos and wait for the dust to settle. Sweet ensemble acting. Tony Revolori, as the quirky bellboy Zero Moustafa, steals the movie.\n\nSt. Vincent (***1/2) \u2013 Something about saying grouch and eccentric and Bill Murray seems redundant. Murray is a Brooklyn neighbor who babysits the vulnerable kid next door. His idea of teaching the boy how to be a man involves betting on the horses, drinking in bars and beating up the class bully. Cool. Nicely directed by Theodore Melfi. Melissa McCarthy, Naomi Watts and Terrence Howard chew up the scenery in the year\u2019s best comedy.\n\nSelma (****) It\u2019s as if David Oyelowo was born to play Martin Luther King. Same nose, skin tone and cadence. Carmen Ejogo as Coretta is perfectly cast, too. Smartly directed by Ava DuVernay, who steps out of the shadows of small indie filmmaking to create an Oscar-caliber, historical film that depicts the bravery of a civil rights activist and a fiery reverend who out-smarted LBJ and got the Voting Rights Bill passed. Inspiring.\n\nStarred Up (***/12) A violent British adolescent (Jack O\u2019Connell, Unbroken) gets sent to a tough prison where his dad (Ben Mendolsohn) is a career jailbird. This brutal film makes Oz look like Sesame Street. Stark realism is so gruesome you can\u2019t look at the screen. Director David Mackenzie gets under the grimy skin of prison life in a way that will make you never one want to get arrested.\n\nWhiplash (***1/2) Who knew band practice could be equated with emotional abuse? Young actor Miles Teller plays a very ambitious drum student at a prestigious music school who is tormented by an instructor (J.K Simmons), who is more sadistic than Satan. Damien Chazelle\u2019s script takes you places you didn\u2019t dream you\u2019d go and his direction doesn\u2019t give you a way out. You\u2019ll stay until the best man wins.\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nAnnie\n\nCesar Chavez\n\nCuban Fire\n\nThe Drop\n\nForce Majeure\n\nGet On Up\n\nI Am Ali\n\nIda\n\nLe Weekend\n\nMaleficent\n\nNightcrawler\n\nOmar\n\nRide Along\n\nSalt of the Earth\n\nA Stranger Among Men\n\nThink Like a Man Too\n\nUnbroken\n\nOverrated\n\nBabadook (Repulsive protagonists handcuff this inventive horror movie.)\n\n(Repulsive protagonists handcuff this inventive horror movie.)
