The initiative includes billboards, social media and digital, radio and movie theater advertising, said Christy Rasmussen, a commission spokeswoman.\n\nThree billboard images feature a girl walking across a small waterfall, anglers in a lake and a family around a lakeside campfire.\n\nGame and Parks also is running a separate campaign along the Front Range of Colorado to promote outdoor recreation in western Nebraska, especially at Lake McConaughy and reservoirs in the southwest corner of the state.\n\n\u201cVisitation from Colorado is important to the economic vitality of western Nebraska,\u2019\u2019 Rasmussen said.\n\nThe McConaughy campaign includes the website golakemac.com, a video, digital ads and Pandora radio advertising.\n\nGame and Parks traditionally runs its own marketing campaigns to meet its specific needs and doesn\u2019t piggyback directly on Tourism Commission branding. The \u201cTime Well Spent\u201d campaign taps research that indicates creating memories outdoors resonates with many people, Rasmussen said.\n\nThe two campaigns \u2014 developed with the help of Swanson Russell marketing firm in Lincoln and Omaha \u2014 come out of an agency marketing budget of less than $200,000. Game and Parks officials declined to specify how much was spent developing the campaigns.\n\nGame and Parks contracted with Swanson Russell this spring for marketing help on an as-needed basis.\n\nThe commission is predominately funded by user fees.\n\nContact the writer: 402-444-1127, david.hendee@owh.com", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "LINCOLN \u2014 The Nebraska Tourism Commission isn\u2019t the only state agency targeting potential tourists.", "title": "Nebraska Game and Parks has separate ad campaigns as big as all outdoors", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/nebraska-game-and-parks-has-separate-ad-campaigns-as-big/article_b2a7bec2-eebe-11e3-af88-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/1d/f1de5fce-eebe-11e3-98be-001a4bcf6878/5393dbe250091.image.jpg?resize=1024%2C475", "height": 475}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "description": "LINCOLN \u2014 The Nebraska Tourism Commission isn\u2019t the only state agency targeting potential tourists."}, "article_summary": "The State Game and Parks Commission has a new \u201cTime Well Spent\u2019\u2019 campaign aimed at encouraging Nebraskans to create unforgettable memories and opportunities at state parks and recreation areas.\n\u201cVisitation from Colorado is important to the economic vitality of western Nebraska,\u2019\u2019 Rasmussen said.\nGame and Parks traditionally runs its own marketing campaigns to meet its specific needs and doesn\u2019t piggyback directly on Tourism Commission branding.\nLINCOLN \u2014 The Nebraska Tourism Commission isn\u2019t the only state agency targeting potential tourists.\nThe \u201cTime Well Spent\u201d campaign taps research that indicates creating memories outdoors resonates with many people, Rasmussen said."}
