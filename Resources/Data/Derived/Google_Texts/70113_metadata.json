The document, which appears to be no more legally binding than, say, a politician\u2019s campaign promises, nevertheless prompted a barrage of reactions from those who watched Trump\u2019s half-hour long announcement.\n\nRelated: Trump Offers Bush Some \u2018Friendly\u2019 Campaign Advice\n\nOne take?

Here\u2019s Why the GOP Should Be Worried,\u201d warned Fortune.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Trump Signed the GOP Loyalty Pledge\n\nOf course, there\u2019s always the possibility that this won\u2019t mean much at all in the end. Though he has shown more staying power than most, the prevailing political wisdom is still that Trump\u2019s campaign will eventually run out of gas, loyalty pledge or not, making whether he promises to stick with the GOP immaterial in the end.\n\n\u201cI ultimately don't think it matters much, although he might get something of a polling bump up from his presently strong numbers depending on how much coverage there is,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics.\n\n\u201cHis candidacy still feels very much like a bubble, but strange things do happen. Practically speaking, he can still run as an independent if he wants to. Politicians change their minds all the time -- and, yes, Trump is a politician now. One becomes that when campaigning for and leading in the polls for the highest elected office in the world.\u201d\n\nFor the time being, at least, Trump is officially a committed Republican, which takes the third-party issue off the table for the September 16 Republican debate. And he\u2019s promising to play the role of GOP soldier to the hilt.\n\nRelated: Trump Rips Bush for Speaking Speaking Spanish; Bush Calls Trump a \u2018Germophobe\u2019\n\n\u201cI will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands,\u201d Trump said Thursday afternoon, in a press conference broadcast on most major news stations across the country and covered obsessively by both traditional print and online media. \u201cWe will go out and fight hard, and we will win. We will win,\u201d he said.\n\nOne interesting element of Trump\u2019s presentation on Thursday was his apparent admission that he \u2013 the worldly New Yorker who relentlessly belittles other politician\u2019s deal-making skills while insisting his own are practically superhuman \u2013 got out-negotiated by the Wisconsin-raised Priebus.\n\n\u201cI got nothing,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cThe question was, what did I get for signing the pledge? Absolutely nothing, other than the assurance that I would be treated fairly. And I\u2019ve seen that over the last two months, where they really have been very fair.\u201d\n\nTrump, who had the podium to himself -- Priebus having departed Trump Tower where the pledge was signed in Trump\u2019s offices -- took a short batch of non-threatening questions after his announcement, brushing off some and diving in to others. The candidate, who has gained much of his support from people deeply concerned about illegal immigration, drew loud cheers from some in the audience when he repeated a theme that has been the subject of an ongoing tiff between him and fellow candidate Jeb Bush.\n\nRelated: As CNN Changes Debate Rules, Which Candidates Are Left Out in the Cold?\n\n\u201cI think that when you get right down to it, we're a nation that speaks English and I think while we are in this nation we should be speaking English,\u201d he said to rising cheers. \u201cWhether people like it or not, that's how we assimilate.\u201d\n\nIt remains just how well Trump himself will assimilate into a Republican Party whose language he has in large part refused to adopt.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump on Thursday pledged his allegiance to the Republican Party, scrawling his name across the pledge in the same thick black magic marker that he uses to pen nastygrams to reporters who offend him.
