The state House is also moving to preserve its sanctions against Tehran regardless of the agreement\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cCertainly, there are several members of Congress both in the House and the Senate who are opposed to this deal so I think it would reinforce or embolden their votes when they see resolutions like this emanating from their state legislatures,\u201d Republican state Rep. Tim Kelly, the author of the first resolution, told The Daily Signal.\n\nKelly\u2019s resolution details skepticisms of the accord and outlines Michigan\u2019s intention to continue to prohibit companies in the state from doing business with Iran.\n\nHe said because the deal is not a U.S. treaty, Michigan is enabled under the 10th Amendment to continue its 2012 sanctions that divest state pension funds from businesses with ties to Tehran and block those companies from receiving government contracts.\n\n\u201cHere in Michigan we view this as an awful deal for America \u2026 This resolution adds to the crescendo of the people opposed to this deal,\u201d Kelly said, pointing to recent polls finding the majority of Americans want Congress to reject the accord.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Andy Schor introduced the second resolution, which claims the current deal does not block a path to a nuclear weapon and urges Congress to press for a new agreement that accomplishes this goal.\n\nBoth resolutions contend the accord leaves Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure largely intact and argue its allowance for continued research and development on advanced centrifuges\u2014machines that enrich uranium used in nuclear bombs\u2014could spur an arms race in the Middle East.\n\nThey also address concerns of cheating, noting while the agreement places limits on Tehran\u2019s nuclear material and requires nuclear site inspections, Iran\u2019s history of deception challenges the international community\u2019s ability to ensure cooperation.\n\nFurther, both resolutions note the estimated $150 billion in frozen assets that would be released under the accord coupled with additional sanctions relief would provide Tehran with more funding for \u201cmilitary buildup and state sponsorship of terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on ways to support our allies in this region, and this deal only further alienates them while helping Iran grow stronger, creating fear and an arms race in one of the most volatile parts of the world,\u201d Kelly said in a statement.\n\nSteve Bucci, director of The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies, said while the resolutions would not change Iran\u2019s behavior or the White House\u2019s trajectory, their passage would mark a \u201csharp stick in the eye\u201d to the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cA resolution like this and the possibility of continued sanctions sends a very loud, clear public message to the White House and Washington, D.C., that what you\u2019ve done, we don\u2019t consider it right and we don\u2019t think our beliefs or our concerns have really been addressed, therefore we\u2019re going to oppose this,\u201d Bucci said.\n\nKelly agreed pressure from across the country likely would not change President Obama\u2019s mind, but remained hopeful toward the impact of the resolutions.\n\n\u201cAny time that we can from all corners of the country or globe resonate and showcase what a bad deal this is, the better,\u201d Kelly said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A state lawmaker has introduced a resolution.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A state lawmaker has introduced a resolution.", "title": "Michigan Could Keep Iran Sanctions Even if Congress Doesn't", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150821_MichiganIran_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-21T17:22:26+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1UY5eYL"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A state lawmaker has introduced a resolution.", "title": "Michigan Could Keep Iran Sanctions Even if Congress Doesn't", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150821_MichiganIran_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-08-21T16:39:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-21T17:22:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iran deal, Michigan, Tim Kelly, Andy Schor, Michigan legislature"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f4b\"", "article_summary": "As Congress spends its August recess deliberating the Iran deal, Michigan has introduced two resolutions this week urging U.S. legislators to oppose the accord.\nThe state House is also moving to preserve its sanctions against Tehran regardless of the agreement\u2019s fate.\nKelly\u2019s resolution details skepticisms of the accord and outlines Michigan\u2019s intention to continue to prohibit companies in the state from doing business with Iran.\nKelly agreed pressure from across the country likely would not change President Obama\u2019s mind, but remained hopeful toward the impact of the resolutions.\n\u201cHere in Michigan we view this as an awful deal for America \u2026 This resolution adds to the crescendo of the people opposed to this deal,\u201d Kelly said, pointing to recent polls finding the majority of Americans want Congress to reject the accord."}
