CareSource, a nonprofit, Dayton-based health insurer, will hold a hiring event Tuesday to recruit registered nurses from noon to 8 p.m. at the Dayton Marriott, 1414 South Patterson Blvd.

Due in large part to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, CareSource has experienced rapid unprecedented growth through the new health insurance marketplace and the expansion of Medicaid, the company said in a news release.

The company serves more than 1.3 million consumers in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky and anticipates a total workforce of 2,000 by the end of 2014.
