Reports coming out of Liberia sound more like the plot of a George A. Romero zombie movie, but the Nimba County community is in a state a fear and panic all the same. Local media outlets claim that two female Ebola patients in their 40s and 60s who passed away as a result of the deadly virus that has ravaged West African countries have risen from the dead.

According to the World Health Organization’s most recent data, just over 2,900 people have died in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia due to the Ebola outbreak. As of Thursday, the number of people killed by Ebola in these three West African countries was said to be at least 2,917. If Friday’s reports out of Nimba County are to be believed, that total may have been knocked back down to 2,915.

Liberia is home to over half of the total death toll attributed to Ebola, and more than 1,700 new cases have been reported in the past 21 days. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the first in West Africa, is the largest in history. By the end of January, the CDC expects an estimated 1.4 million cases of deadly Ebola.

The incubation period between the time of infection and initial symptoms of Ebola is two to 21 days. Although the virus is transmitted from wild animals to people, nearly all of the cases tied to the 2014 Ebola outbreak are due to human-to-human transmission. There is currently no cure for Ebola, but two potential candidate vaccines are undergoing evaluation.
