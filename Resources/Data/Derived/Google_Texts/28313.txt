PITTSBURGH â€” Western Pennsylvania's largest 911 dispatch center has its own emergency: It's infested with bed bugs.

Allegheny County Emergency Services officials announced the infestation Friday at the agency's call center in Pittsburgh.

Emergency Services Chief Alvin Henderson says several states have seen an uptick in bed bugs.

The discovery doesn't mean workers are sleeping on the job. On the contrary, Henderson says the bugs tend to be carried into workplaces from infested homes, hitching rides in backpacks, clothing and even books.

That's why employees have been given information on how to combat and deal with the bugs at home.

The irritating bugs don't carry diseases but can cause anxiety, itchiness and insomnia.

The building's management has contacted a pest controller.
