NEW YORKâ€”New York's annual West Indian Day Parade is on the march, with politics in the air and a child's death on marchers' minds.

Big crowds and a cheerful atmosphere greeted the parade's start Monday in Brooklyn. But the deadly shooting of a 1-year-old Brooklyn boy in his stroller loomed over the festivities.

City comptroller and mayoral candidate John Liu (loo) asked for a moment of silence. Several other mayoral contenders also mentioned Sunday's shooting.

Besides celebrating Caribbean culture, the parade is one of the biggest public events remaining before the Sept. 10 primaries for mayor, comptroller and other city offices.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg is marching, as are all the major candidates seeking to succeed him. So are Democratic comptroller hopefuls Scott Stringer and former Gov. Eliot Spitzer.
