At the time, the Sarasota market was in a real estate recession and physicians were reorganizing under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cNone of them were looking for commercial loans,\u201d Perron says, and in fact were looking to deleverage.\n\nSunTrust's attorney, Andrew Froman of Fisher & Phillips in Tampa, Fla., declined to comment on the case.\n\nFranco joined SunTrust Investment Services in November 2011 and was dismissed in December 2013, according to the complaint.\n\nDual Employment: Kindling for Disputes\n\nThe dispute speaks to a broader industry issue that will become more prevalent as banks hire people who are dual employees of both the bank and the bank\u2019s broker-dealer arm, a situation made possible with the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, says Perron. The legislation drew a line between traditional banking and investment banking activities, prohibiting them from taking place within the same institution.\n\nPerron contends that dual employment is kindling for future disputes as \"it causes conflict between what dual employees are supposed to be doing for a client on the banking side versus the investment side,\" he says. \"These inherent conflicts are going to become more concerning as the laws may not be keeping up with protecting the consumer.\"\n\nWith the fall of the Glass-Steagall wall, these disputes will only grow, according to Perron, an adjunct professor of banking and financial law at Western Michigan University's Cooley Law School.\n\nHigh Ranking\n\nIn his lawsuit against SunTrust Investment Services, Franco argues that even though selling commercial loans were outside the manual for production goals, he nevertheless secured a number of loans, several of which were in the pipeline when he was terminated. The lawsuit also says he was one of their top advisors, ranked 19 out of 52 people, at the time of his dismissal.\n\n\u201cHaving that kind of success and success throughout his time there in production did not make him a good candidate for termination,\u201d Perron says.\n\nThe FINRA arbitration panel agreed, ordering SunTrust Investment Services to pay him $100,000 for wrongful termination. The panel also found that the statement on his U5 regarding his failure to meet bank performance standards was defamatory and recommended that the statement be expunged.\n\nIn December 2015, less than one month after winning the FINRA arbitration award from SunTrust's brokerage unit, Franco filed a lawsuit against SunTrust Bank, seeking compensation for lost wages and damaging his reputation.\n\nBlackballed from Industry\n\nThe lawsuit blasts SunTrust Bank for \"placing slanderous statements about Franco into the business community\" and blames the bank for causing the statements to be published to Franco's form U5.\n\nAs a result, Franco has not been able to find employment in the banking and financial services industry, it claims. The lawsuit notes that a job offer extended by Wells Fargo soon after Franco was terminated was later rescinded due to the information on his form U5.\n\nFranco also lost his book of business because he was \"blackballed from the industry\" and no longer has the same professional value to a new employer as he did when he was dismissed in December 2013, the lawsuit contends.\n\n\"It will take years for plaintiff to rebuild his client base and that is only if another bank or firm hires him without a book of business,\" Perron writes in the complaint.\n\nThe bank, he says, \"put this false information out there\" and therefore \"should contribute and reimburse him for his losses.\"\n\nRead More:", "article_metadata": {"displaytag": "Compliance", "sailthru.author": "Margarida Correia", "description": "The lawsuit stems from the conflicting demands placed on advisors who are expected to cross-sell banking products.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-02-27T11:08:24-05:00", "og": {"url": "http://www.bankinvestmentconsultant.com/news/advisor-sues-suntrust-for-defamation", "site_name": "Bank Investment Consultant", "type": "article", "description": "The lawsuit stems from the conflicting demands placed on advisors who are expected to cross-sell banking products.", "title": "Advisor Sues SunTrust for Defamation"}, "twitter": {"title": "Advisor Sues SunTrust for Defamation", "description": "The lawsuit stems from the conflicting demands placed on advisors who are expected to cross-sell banking products.", "card": "summary", "site": "@BIConline"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-27T11:08:24-05:00", "fb": {"app_id": "michael.wurster@sourcemedia.com"}, "sailthru.title": "Advisor Sues SunTrust for Defamation", "keywords": "Compliance, Law and regulation, Bank channel, Marc Franco, SunTrust Investment Services, Andre Perron, SunTrust Bank, Andrew Froman", "featured": 0, "sponsored": 0, "contentprefix": "Article", "gptAdUnitPath": "/16059533/BankInvestmentConsultant/Article", "storyId": "00000153-9a21-d62d-addb-bbb946b30000", "sailthru.tags": "Law and regulation, Compliance, Admin and reference, IAG, Bank channel", "sailthru.description": "The lawsuit stems from the conflicting demands placed on advisors who are expected to cross-sell banking products.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Compliance, Law and regulation, Bank channel, Marc Franco, SunTrust Investment Services, Andre Perron, SunTrust Bank, Andrew Froman"}, "article_summary": "Marc Franco worked for SunTrust Investment Services as an advisor in in the medical and legal specialty group in Sarasota, Fla.\nThe FINRA arbitration panel agreed, ordering SunTrust Investment Services to pay him $100,000 for wrongful termination.\nFranco joined SunTrust Investment Services in November 2011 and was dismissed in December 2013, according to the complaint.\nThe legislation drew a line between traditional banking and investment banking activities, prohibiting them from taking place within the same institution.\n\u201cNone of them were looking for commercial loans,\u201d Perron says, and in fact were looking to deleverage."}
