Ted Cruz and former Obama green jobs czar Van Jones to tout Cruz as a \u201cbrilliant\u201d carrier of the conservative banner \u2013 and slam Jones as a fraud hiding behind a shield of respectability.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a communist revolutionary, Van Jones,\u201d Beck said on his show Friday after playing a clip of the Cruz-Jones confrontation. \u201cThis is one of the most dangerous men in America.\u201d\n\nIn the \u201cCrossfire\u201d segment, Jones demanded that Cruz, a Texas Republican, apologize to the Republican Party for the government shutdown in Washington, but Cruz turned the tables with an attack on Obamacare \u2014 and the havoc its wreaking on the country\u2019s economy.\n\nAfter applauding Cruz, Beck and producer Steve \u201cStu\u201d Burguiere on Friday ran down part of Jones\u2019 history. After his forced resignation from the White House feather-bed job of \u201cgreen jobs czar\u201d \u2013 the job was so meaningless the title seems to have left when Jones did \u2013 he moved to even more meaningless stints. He joined the liberal-to-leftist Center for American Progress, then served as an adjunct professor post at Princeton, and now has a gig as a regular on CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire.\u201d\n\nEach step in Jones\u2019 post White House career was a laundering process, Beck said, meant to distract the public from remembering who Jones really is. While Jones was once an avowed communist revolutionary, he\u2019s no longer open about it \u2014 pursuing the same goals through more deceptive means.\n\nAnd Jones admitted as much about his tactics as recently as 2005, during an interview with the alternative Oakland paper the East Bay Express, headlined \u201cThe New Face of Environmentalism\u201d:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll work with anybody, I\u2019ll fight anybody if it will push our issues forward. \u2026 I\u2019m willing to forgo the cheap satisfaction of the radical pose for the deep satisfaction of radical ends.\u201d\n\n(He\u2019s also not above a cheap rhyme, but put that aside.)\n\nIt\u2019s the next paragraph of the story that\u2019s telling:.\n\nHis new philosophy emphasizes effectiveness, which he believes is inextricably tied to unity. He still considers himself a revolutionary, just a more effective one, who has realized that the progressive left\u2019s insistence on remaining a counterculture destroys its potential as a political movement. \u201cOne of my big heroes is Malcolm X, not because I agree with Malcolm, but because he wasn\u2019t afraid to change in public,\u201d he said.\n\nThe left will try to make fun of Beck \u2014 \u201ccommunist revolutionary\u201d sounds so dated, so McCarthy-esque \u2014 but he\u2019s only repeating the points that Jones has made about himself, in a rare moment of honesty with a decidedly sympathetic interviewer.\n\nJones is willing to drop the cheap satisfaction off the radical pose for the deep satisfaction tailored suits and healthy bank accounts \u2013 all paid for by the very society he\u2019s actually committed to destroying for everyone else.\n\nHe\u2019s living the high life, he\u2019s on TV every night, and he\u2019s making a mint at that \u201cforgoing\u201d business.\n\n\u201cVan Jones is a communist revolutionary,\u201d Beck said. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant man, extraordinarily dangerous.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also a fraud.\n\nCheck out Beck reviewing Jones\u2019 history here:\n\n[poll id=\u201d123\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Glenn Beck played up the Thursday night \u201cCrossfire\u201d showdown between Sen.
