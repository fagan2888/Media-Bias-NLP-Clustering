An increasing number of restaurants are opting for a dining experience based on sample portions over traditional a la carte menus. Spiaggia restaurant in Chicago, which has one Michelin star and is trying for its second, is taking part in the trend. Tony Mantuano, the Chef-Partner of the Chicago establishment, says there are benefits to this form of dining: it can give chefs the opportunity to improve their skills, and prevent ingredients from going to waste. Acadia restaurant, another Chicago eatery, credits the tasting menu format for its second star. \"With a tasting menu you really get that expression of the chef,\" said Ryan McCaskey, a chef and the owner of Acadia. \"People like Michelin... they want to see that expression.\"\n\nTransitions are happening in the realm of health care.

According to Former Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins, employment and bank branches could be slashed by 20 percent to 50 percent. \u201cI have no doubt that the financial industry will face a series of Uber moments,\" Jenkins said, referring to the car-hailing app's shake-up of the taxi industry.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Business/Economy", "description": "Some of us have proven ourselves in the culinary world, others are just happy not to burn the house down.
