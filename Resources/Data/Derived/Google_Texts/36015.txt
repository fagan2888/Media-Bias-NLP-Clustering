ASPEN — Officials in Aspen are considering a plan to allow wealthy donors to put their names on buildings and programs to help ease the budget crisis for public schools.

Supporters say they could raise as much as $15 million toward an endowment.

The Aspen Education Foundation says gifts of $1 million or more could have the opportunity to do some kind of naming.

According to the Aspen Daily News (http://tinyurl.com/zaq7pqt), critics are worried that the district might be embarrassed by some contributors and they would have to be checked out.
