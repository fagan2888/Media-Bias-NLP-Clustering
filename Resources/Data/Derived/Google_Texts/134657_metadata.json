Another user noted that complaining about interns is \"part of the process.\"\n\nIf we had to guess, it sounds like a lot of posts come from young staffers, whose own experiences as interns are still fresh in their minds.\n\nOne problem that interns frequently face is inexperience with security procedures. This can cause major delays in the morning, when more senior Congressional staffers are held up by confused interns who take multiple trips through the metal detector.\n\nInterns attendence at key hearings is a long-standing tradition on Capitol Hill, but showing deference to more senior staffers is an even more long-standing tradition. This staffer was irked that interns took up all the seats during an important hearing on Obamacare.\n\nCloakroom creator Ted Henderson is a former staffer of Rep. Dale Kildee, and he created the app so that Congressional staffers would have a place to anonymously converse, according to Roll Call.\n\nMultiple high-profile staffers recently lost their jobs due to poor decisions of social media, including Rep. Steve Stivers' chief of staff, Adam Kuhn, who resigned after a porn star tweeted an explicit photograph of him, and Rep. Steve Fincher's communications director, Elizabeth Lauten, who resigned after posting a scathing Facebook status about Obama's two daughters.\n\nHenderson promises Cloakroom is a safe space.\n\n\u201cCloakroom is completely disconnected from your real identity,\u201d Henderson said. Contributors even can activate a nuclear option, which permanently deletes all posts they have ever authored.\n\nNearly every day, new gossip about interns pours into the anonymous discussion, and the interns are watching. Interestingly enough, most have the necessary email credentials to gain access the discussion.\n\nIf you're working or interning and using Cloakroom on Capitol Hill this summer, send Business Insider what you're seeing!
