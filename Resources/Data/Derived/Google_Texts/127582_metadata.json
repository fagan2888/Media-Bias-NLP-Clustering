The President of the United States, Washington\u2019s Republican and Democrat ruling elites, the majority of media outlets that support big government, believe the \u201cmiddle class\u201d is a state-manufactured institution; that the fuel that preserves and expands it is higher, redistributive taxes.\n\nThe reason for the perpetuation of this discredited superstition is that the U.S. economy, under the Bush and Obama administrations, is geared to prop-up the welfare state at the expense of economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. now ranks not first, not second, not third, but 12th among developed nations in terms of business startup activities,\u201d writes Jim Clifton, chairman and CEO of the Gallup polling organization. \u201cWe are behind in starting new firms per capita, and this is our single most serious economic problem. Yet it seems like a secret. You never see it mentioned in the media, nor hear from a politician that, for the first time in 35 years, American business deaths now outnumber business births.\u201d\n\nThat bears repeating: \u201cFor the first time in 35 years, American business deaths now outnumber business births.\u201d\n\nWhile 400,000 new businesses were created in America last year, 470,000 went belly up. This is what Keynesian economists call a \u201csluggish recovery.\u201d\n\nSince its collapse in the Soviet Union, and its abandonment by China\u2019s ruling oligarchs, socialist doctrine has been taking it in the shorts. But it has been enjoying something of a Renaissance here in America. The mainstream media has repackaged it as the \u201cnew populism.\u201d\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton campaigned for Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley last October, she told supporters, \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody tell you that, you know, it\u2019s corporations and businesses that create jobs.\u201d\n\nWhen conservatives attacked Hillary for her demonstrably stupid statement, PolitiFact.com rushed to her and the new populism\u2019s rescue.\n\n\u201cClinton aides later said she meant to\u2026 [attack] tax breaks for corporations.\u201d That is clearly not what she said \u2013 a blatant PolitiLie.\n\nHillary was simply positioning herself in relation to her potential presidential primary rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who said, \u201cThere is nobody in this country that got rich on their own. Nobody. You built a factory out there \u2013 good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved goods to market on roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn\u2019t have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory\u2026 Now look. You build a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea \u2013 God bless! Keep a hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.\u201d\n\nObama, Hillary and Warren\u2019s understanding of the \u201csocial contract\u201d is identical to 17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes. In Hobbs\u2019 book Leviathan, we agree to surrender our \u201cright to all things\u201d to an all-powerful sovereign or government (the builders of roads and schools). That\u2019s because the natural state of man, Hobbes believed, was evil and only an all-powerful state could prevent chaos and bloodshed.\n\nIt never dawned on Hobbes that giving the state total power could lead to unparalleled chaos, terror and bloodshed.\n\nIn his book The Conflict Between Two Worlds (1939), William Montgomery McGovern referred to Hobbes as \u201cthe prophet of a system which was to be carried out nearly three centuries later by Mussolini and Hitler.\u201d\n\nSoviet political theorist Nikolai Bukharin, later murdered by Joseph Stalin, said, \u201cThe state more and more becomes a direct exploiter, organizing and directing production as a collective capitalist\u2026 It is a New Leviathan, before which the fantasy of Thomas Hobbes seems a child\u2019s play.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cNew Leviathan\u201d went bankrupt and evaporated into the ether on New Year\u2019s Day 1991.\n\nWith more than seventeen trillion dollars in debt, with more business failures than successes, with government programs (like Obamacare) confiscating more of the average Americans\u2019 shrinking income, it\u2019s difficult to put a positive spin on the current state of our crumbling union.\n\n\u201cRightful liberty,\u201d said Thomas Jefferson \u201cis unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add \u2018within the limits of the law\u2019 because law is often but the tyrant\u2019s will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual.\u201d\n\nYou see, America was founded on the ideas of John Locke, whose Natural Rights philosophy is the moral counter to the monstrous totalitarianism espoused by Hobbes.\n\nLocke said, \u201cAll mankind\u2026 being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions.\u201d\n\nJefferson paraphrased Locke on behalf of individual liberty, turning it into high art:\n\n\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\u201d\n\nUnder the \u201cnew populism\u201d of Obama, Hillary and Warren (Leviathan), there is diminishing liberty, prosperity and happiness. And our union will continue to crumble until the American people, as Jefferson said, \u201ccan prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like Abraham Lincoln said in his 1862 State of the Union address. \u201cWe shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In his State of the Union address, President Obama will propose taxing the rich to help the poor.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Stephen Z.
