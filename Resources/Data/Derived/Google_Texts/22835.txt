Bow approves full-day kindergarten starting next year



Residents approved a warrant article to implement full-day kindergarten at Bow Elementary School by a margin of 68 votes, despite the measure not having the endorsement of the school board or the budget committee.

..

The petition warrant article asked the district to raise and appropriate $359,036 to make kindergarten classes full-day, to be paid for with tax dollars. The average estimated tax impact for a home in Bow valued at $250,000 is $85.13 annually.

..

In 2014, the district charged a kindergarten committee with investigating the viability of full-day kindergarten and making a recommendation back to the board. The committee was in favor of switching to full-day for the 2015-16 school year.

..

Danielle Albushies, a parent who served on the committee, told the crowd that 76 percent of children enrolled in kindergarten nationwide are in school all day. Forty-one percent of New Hampshire’s kindergarteners attend full-day programs in districts including Hanover, Hopkinton, Boscawen and Penacook.

..

“You can see with these numbers, which have increased over time, that it’s becoming the norm, rather than the exception,” Albushies said, adding that Canterbury, Belmont, Plainfield, Cornish and Mont Vernon have recently approved implementing full-day kindergarten.

..

Kelly Wood, a Bow kindergarten teacher who also served on the committee, said the district’s current half-day program of two hours and 35 minutes “presents scheduling challenges” for teachers.



“Many curriculums are written around a full day, so teachers have to decide which components are the most essential to implement,” she said. Wood also said the longer school day would create a more relaxed environment and improve communication between the school and families.

..

“For the community, it means improving the quality of our school and attracting young families,” Wood said. “In addition, early intervention may pay off in the long run by reducing the need for more costly services later on.”

..

School Board Chairman Robert Louf said implementing full-day kindergarten is a “multifaceted issue.”



“It’s very tough to boil it down to down to just yes or no,” Louf said. “I do support the program and everything that we’ve seen that is relative to the program. It’s that second piece, at cost to the district, that makes me very nervous.”

..

Jared Bland said full-day kindergarten represented “the future for Bow.”



“Do you guys really want to be satisfied with the status quo and with ‘good enough,’ or should we be striving for more?” he asked. “I don’t think this is something that we can’t afford. I think this is something that we need to afford.”

..

Don Berube said he was “definitely not for this” warrant article, especially because it did not have the backing of the school board.



“I don’t want to pay for people’s day care,” Berube said. “I don’t see where the extra instruction makes (the children) that much more of a student in the following year after kindergarten.”

..

Linda Jordan, who has seven grandchildren in Bow public schools, said she had “watched the struggles” associated with the current half-day program, especially with dropping children off at school only to have to pick them up less than three hours later, often requiring their parents to leave work.

..

“It’s a great inconvenience for very little amount of money, to be able to help our children get a better start,” Jordan said.



Margaret Welch, who lives on Bow Center Road, said the town of Bow has “tremendous decisions” before it at this time, like the potential $5 million public safety complex, making full-day kindergarten a lower priority.

..

“We have more than enough to consider, and I’m afraid that I don’t support this at this time,” she said.



Residents voted via paper ballot and the measure passed 197 to 129.
