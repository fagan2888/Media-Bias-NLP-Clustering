Presidential immunity can be lifted with a vote in favor by at least two-thirds of the 158-member Congress.\n\nThat vote will be closely watched after the Guatemalan Supreme Court on Tuesday approved a request by Guatemala's attorney general to impeach the president.\n\nIf Congress votes to lift his immunity, the Supreme Court then turns the matter to prosecutors, who would then able to bring charges against him in court.\n\nPerez, a 64-year-old retired general, survived an earlier attempt this month to strip his immunity, when that motion drew only 88 votes, short of the two-thirds needed.\n\nPerez is accused of participating in a customs scam, known as La Linea, whereby importers avoided paying customs duties in exchange for bribes. He has denied the allegations and said that he will not resign.
