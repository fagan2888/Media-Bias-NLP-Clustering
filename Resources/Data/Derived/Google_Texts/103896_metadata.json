Michael Bennet this year?\n\nWe know the feeling. But, as the candidates signaled last night, it looks like we\u2019ll have to wait.\n\nSeven of the 13 Republicans seeking that party\u2019s Senate nomination gathered for their first forum in that race. Yet, when it came to what differentiates each from the others on last night\u2019s stage at the University of Denver, it was tough to tell.\n\nAt this point in the race, it\u2019s really a game of first impressions and get-to-know-ya. The candidates, many of whom are virtually unknown, are introducing themselves to the electorate rather than drawing sharp contrasts.\n\nAfter their cursory \u201cHi-my-name-is X-and-I\u2019m-a-Y-from-Z,\u201d most in the pack took aim at Bennet, casting Colorado\u2019s Senior Senator and the former chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee as an Obama drone and partisan extremist who has made America unsafe in a dangerous world. Indeed, hammering Bennet was the MO of the evening \u2013 a way to toss red meat into the crowd in hopes that the Republican DU students and local activists in attendance would remember a morsel or two about who each was and why he or she would be the party\u2019s best pick to eject Bennet from office.\n\nThe issues were general, Obama-era GOP standbys: Scrapping the Affordable Care Act, defending the Second Amendment, defeating terrorists, killing Common Core, cutting taxes and denouncing abortion rights.\n\nOn a stage before a packed crowd of students and older folks were Colorado Springs businessman Robert Blaha, computer programmer Charlie Ehler, Aurora County Commissioner Ryan Frazier, El Paso County commissioners Darryl Glenn and Peg Littleton, former state Rep. Jon Keyser and current state Sen. Tim Neville.\n\nAt one point, Frazier jokingly thanked the moderator for putting \u201cthe two black guys with bald heads\u201d next to each other. He was seated beside Glenn who, like Frazier, meets that description.\n\nThe forum largely revolved more around a general sense of who would help keep America safest than what each candidate would do specifically for Colorado in the U.S. Senate. Keyser, the youngest-looking of the bunch who dressed in a dark blazer, button-up and no tie, spoke early in the night about his many \u201ccapture-kill\u201d missions in the special forces when he kicked down doors \u201chunting terrorists.\u201d Bennet\u2019s Senate vote on the Iran nuclear-arms deal was personal for Keyser, he said, because Iranian-backed insurgents killed his friends in Iraq and Afghanistan. When a question about the country\u2019s debt came up, he quickly spun it into a national security issue.\n\n\u201cWe need to elect a United States senator who has been to war\u201d because people who have been to war know it\u2019s a last resort, Keyser said.\n\nOthers tried to strike the delicate balance between sounding strong on national defense without coming off like a war monger.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be the world\u2019s policeman, but we have to be a deterrent to evil in this world,\u201d said Frazier, a former Navy intelligence analyst.\n\nLittleton said she\u2019d only engage militarily if America\u2019s vital interests were at stake. Neville spun a question about national security into a point about illegal immigration, saying he\u2019d fight to secure the border and deport immigrants engaged in criminal activity.\n\n\u201cThis is a foreign policy, national security election,\u201d added Glenn, who emphasized that he was the only retired military officer on last night\u2019s stage, having served on a team dealing with military base closures. \u201cNo one else can say that.\u201d\n\nBlaha \u2014 who, sporting a sweater over a collared shirt, was the only man on the stage not in a suit jacket \u2014 cast himself as the outsider and non-politician in the race. On the topic of national security, he rattled off a little jingle. \u201cInstead of jeered,\u201d he told the audience, he\u2019d strive to create a country where \u201cwe\u2019re feared, revered and we\u2019re cheered.\u201d\n\nOut in the crowd, Blaha\u2019s family members made up a block of orange, wearing matching shirts with the words \u201cSucceed or leave\u201d on the back, a nod to Blaha\u2019s pledge that if he couldn\u2019t meet his campaign promises to cut the deficit, secure the border and implement meaningful tax reform after one term, he\u2019d give up his seat and return to Colorado Springs from Washington. He calls that pledge his \u201cproduct guarantee.\u201d\n\nAt times, the forum seemed like a contest about who loves guns the most. Littleton said she has to remember to take her firearm out of the car when visiting military bases around El Paso County.\n\n\u201cI own 43 guns. That\u2019s no big deal,\u201d said Ehler, adding he knows people who own thousands.\n\nDuring their two hours on stage, the seven Republicans seemed at times to take more swipes at Bernie Sanders than Hillary Clinton. After a question about student loan debt, Neville and Littleton both attacked the Democratic Socialists\u2019s plan for free college tuition.\n\nIf anything, the night was a way for the candidates to get their mugs out in front of voters and media and try to connect early with a Republican electorate that will be bombarded with mail, TV ads and media from many more candidates than they\u2019re used to in a U.S. Senate primary in Colorado.\n\nThis election is already unusual by the state\u2019s own standards. With so many candidates in the race \u2014 13 in all \u2014 the field looks likely to split in half and run in two directions by the time voters cast their ballots in the June primary. One half will go through the GOP caucus-assembly process, while the other half will try to gather enough petitions to put their names directly on the ballot.\n\nRelated: Why this U.S. Senate race is so unusual in Colorado\n\nThat point wasn\u2019t lost on two of the candidates, Littleton and Neville, who threw some shade at their opponents going the petition-route by implying that technique is a scheme to bypass the caucus system and buy their way onto the ballot.\n\nThen, as so often happens in Colorado, the conversation turned to pot.\n\nLittleton said as a county commissioner she sees a problem with narcotics officers having to keep pot plants alive as evidence until illegal growers are convicted. \u201cSo here we found ourself as a county growing marijuana,\u201d she said.\n\nKeyser noted how he didn\u2019t vote for Amendment 64, but he knows legalizing cannabis in Colorado is widely popular across plenty of demographics. He said the government should focus on making sure kids don\u2019t get their hands on pot and on fixing the banking system so the industry isn\u2019t a cash business in a shadow economy.\n\nNeville said he trusts Colorado voters even though he doesn\u2019t personally agree with legalized weed. \u201cColorado needs to control this experiment. We need to make sure we safeguard our children,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a business that is supposedly a legitimate business now. Let\u2019s treat it accordingly.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to pot, Glenn said Washington needs to clear up the conflict between federal and state laws.\n\nBlaha, for his part, said Colorado\u2019s decision to legalize recreational marijuana was \u201ca little misguided.\u201d But, he noted, even misguided ideas are protected by the 10th Amendment \u2014 states\u2019 rights.\n\nFor Frazier, the people of Colorado have spoken on marijuana, and his job as a U.S. Senator would be to fight to make sure every Colorado business is treated fairly under the law.\n\nPerhaps the most folksy of the group, Ehler, a mustachioed, straight-talker in boots and a cowboy hat, framed Colorado\u2019s decision to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana as a punch in the nose to the federal government.\n\n\u201cI like that nullification idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we ought to do it more often. Hey, federal government, sod off. Just go away. We don\u2019t want you here, and if you try to enforce your laws, we\u2019ll throw you in jail. I love that idea. Hope you do, too.\u201d\n\nCandidates going throughout he caucus system will come out of the state convention by April, where each will need 30 percent to stay viable. Those who petition on the ballot directly will join the others for a primary election June 28th.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "DENVER \u2014 Eager to understand what sets candidates apart in the crowded field of GOP contenders vying to unseat U.S. Sen.
