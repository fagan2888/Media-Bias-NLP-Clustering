Critics pile on, citing it as an example of President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cfailed\u201d foreign policy, calling for Obama to \u201cdo something\u201d \u2014 confront Moscow, punish it for its reckless behavior, reassert leadership. But what would that something be?\n\nAcross the political spectrum, there are calls for a more muscular U.S. approach in Syria. Some are talking of proxy battles, while others are calling it a new Cold War and declaring a need to act tough to restore American credibility. But before the U.S. tumbles into something, it\u2019s worth taking a step back and asking what Russian President Vladimir Putin aims to get out of this, and whether, if measured by his own goals, this brazen military intervention will work. I think the answer is no \u2013 which should guide how the U.S. should respond.\n\nRelated: 14 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To Syria\n\nLet\u2019s start with Putin\u2019s stated objective for his intervention in Syria: fighting ISIS. This claim is preposterous. Few Russian strikes are taking place in Islamic State-controlled territory; the air campaign is focused on the opposition that is primarily fighting Assad. This is consistent with Putin\u2019s inverted logic of the conflict, which \u2014 as he stated at his UN General Assembly speech last week \u2014 is as follows: Assad not only has a right to stay in power, but he in fact is the key to solving the ISIS problem. Unlike the United States and most of the rest of the world, who see the Syrian leader as a driver of the conflict, Putin asserts that Assad is the solution\n\nRussia\u2019s motivation is simple: to protect Assad. Putin believes he is defending a basic principle against \u201coutside intervention\u201d that seeks to bring down an allied government\u2014as he\u2019s angrily watched happen over the last 15 years in Serbia, Iraq, Libya and Ukraine. And Russia\u2019s military role in the Syrian conflict is hardly new. They\u2019ve been there from the beginning as one of Assad\u2019s only allies and chief weapons suppliers. Russian personnel have been on the ground throughout.\n\nSeen this way, Putin\u2019s moves are driven primarily out of fear and weakness, not confidence and strength. He sees his only ally left in the region on the ropes and therefore Russia had to come to his defense. Russia wants to maintain the only military outpost it has in the region, anchored by a key naval facility in Tartus.\n\nRelated: Is Putin Preparing to Use Russian Ground Troops in Syria?\n\nNow that Russia has decided to go all-in to back Assad, it will have to be there for the long haul. It may enjoy some tactical battlefield successes. But defeats and mistakes are just as likely (or, as shown by Russian missiles landing in Iran, perhaps more likely). And for Russia to maintain its position it will require a continuing supply of resources and higher costs, which will prove harder to sustain over time.\n\nPutin also wants to use the military intervention in Syria to change the subject from some of his troubles at home, particularly the situation in Ukraine and Russia\u2019s economic tailspin. This seems to have worked in the short term. But like Ukraine, as the Syria intervention grinds on\u2014and especially if Russian casualties mount\u2014it\u2019s very likely the Russian public will quickly sour on the intervention.\n\nAnd finally, there\u2019s the view that Putin\u2019s actions are an effort to maintain geostrategic relevance. At the very least, Putin wants to ensure Russia remains a player in the region. But some claim that Putin has his eyes on a bigger prize: by stepping in where the U.S. has refused, Russia is trying to fill a leadership vacuum.\n\nRelated: Putin Claims Russia Is Cleaning Up Obama\u2019s Mess in Syria\n\nPutin\u2019s open alliance with Iran, Hezbollah, and Assad only isolates Russia in the region, though. He is going after the very Syrian opposition that countries like Saudi Arabia and Turkey have expended tremendous resources in trying to supply. And he\u2019s found himself even further isolated in the world.\n\nWhen you add this all up, it is very hard to see how Putin\u2019s intervention in Syria is going to end well for Russia\u2019s position in the Middle East, or anywhere. Moreover, it seems likely that this will boomerang back on Russia by making it an even more enticing target of Sunni extremists.\n\nSo what should the United States do about it? First, it should continue to condemn and isolate Russia; this should include exploring new economic sanctions. Second, it should increase support for the moderate Syrian opposition. Although the U.S.equip and train program as originally designed has floundered, there are other ways it can provide direct military support to the opposition\u2014as it has with the Kurds in Iraq\u2014which press reports suggest the administration is considering.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Syria Strategy: \u2018Scrambling\u2019 and \u2018Desperate\u2019 as Putin Takes Charge\n\nThird, the U.S. and its European partners need to maintain unity, especially in our collective commitment to NATO Allies like Turkey. One could envision Putin trying to drive a wedge in the Transatlantic Alliance by provoking a crisis with Turkey\u2014a prospect he may be testing with recent airspace violations\u2014probing whether we would come to its defense. And fourth, theU.S. and its coalition partners need to press the fight againstISIS, making clear that Russia\u2019s escalation is not causing us to back off.\n\nWhile Russia\u2019s escalation only makes Syria worse, the U.S.needs to avoid a knee-jerk reaction and instead practice strategic patience. Although many foreign policy pundits seem to be fixing for a fight with Putin, we need to remember that even his own stated goals are unachievable. Like in Ukraine, Putin has gotten himself into a situation that he doesn\u2019t know how to get out of\u2014and will only prove costly.\n\nPutin is no great strategist. He doesn\u2019t play chess, he plays checkers. However remote, the only silver lining that could potentially emerge is now that Putin has gotten himself in too deep. Once the costs become too high, that he will have to sue for peace, and in that process he may be willing to use his leverage to get Assad out. This is one area where President Obama\u2019s patience can be a great asset, because the answer here is not for Obama to be more like Putin", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With each Russian escalatory step in Syria, the situation only seems to get worse.", "title": "Why Obama Should Let Putin Misfire in Syria", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/09/Why-Obama-Should-Let-Putin-Misfire-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09282015_Obama_Putin_Toast.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/09/Why-Obama-Should-Let-Putin-Misfire-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09282015_Obama_Putin_Toast.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With each Russian escalatory step in Syria, the situation only seems to get worse.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Like in Ukraine, Putin has gotten himself into a situation that he doesn\u2019t know how to get out of\u2014and will only prove costly.\nRelated: 14 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To SyriaLet\u2019s start with Putin\u2019s stated objective for his intervention in Syria: fighting ISIS.\nBut like Ukraine, as the Syria intervention grinds on\u2014and especially if Russian casualties mount\u2014it\u2019s very likely the Russian public will quickly sour on the intervention.\nAnd Russia\u2019s military role in the Syrian conflict is hardly new.\nPutin also wants to use the military intervention in Syria to change the subject from some of his troubles at home, particularly the situation in Ukraine and Russia\u2019s economic tailspin."}
