( Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer )\n\nGrowing up longeing horses, holding a long lead rope while a horse circled for exercise and training, gave Kara Lubin a model for letting kids horse around as they warm up to workout academically.\n\n\"Longeing helps horses to calm down and pay attention,\" she said.\n\nLubin wondered if making time and space for kids to walk, skip, or run laps \u2014 minus the halter and lead rope \u2014 would help them settle down to study.\n\nIn 1992, in the midst of medal hoopla related to the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, the then young special education teacher in her second year in the California public school system launched her 100 Mile Club.\n\nThe initiative gave her students an opportunity in class to kick up their heels with the goal of logging 100 miles over the school year to earn a medal.\n\nIt worked, body and mind.\n\nToday, the Norco, Calif.-based 100 Mile Club reports more than 100,000 participants in more than 1,000 schools registered in all 50 states, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Japan, Lubin said.\n\nThat track record, along with successful 100 Mile Club participation in half of St. Vrain Valley School District elementary schools last school year, prompted The Colorado Health Foundation this school year to award the district $1.4 million to rollout the program in all 31 elementary schools.\n\nMiles to 'the moon and back'\n\nDuring the 2014/2015 school year, 1,878 students across 15 elementary schools voluntarily participated and logged 107,405.3 miles in the supervised program on school grounds either before or after school.\n\n\"The number of miles students ran last year equals running around the Earth more than four times,\" Paige Jennings, the district's physical activity grant coordinator/physical education coordinator, said. \"This year, our district goal is to run to the moon and back, like that saying, 'I love you to the moon and back.\"\n\nAt its closest orbit, the moon is 225,623 miles from Earth.\n\nBut with more than 3,000 kids already signed up for the club and that number expected to grow into October, students may reach it, Jennings said.\n\nKara Lubin, the founder of the 100 Mile Club, meets with staff before speaking at Flagstaff Academy on Sept. 1. (Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer)\n\nIn the meantime, new foundation funding supports implementing the 100 Mile Club at all of the elementary schools for the next two years to boost the chances of kids getting daily moderate to vigorous physical activity.\n\nThis grant also underwrites programs to give kids more movement breaks during the school day and subsidizes the club's annual $10 joiner fee for any student who qualifies for free or reduced lunch.\n\nStudies show that in addition to improving physical, emotional and social health, that physical activity improves cognitive functions such as memory, concentration, alertness, motivation, attention and processing speed, Jennings said.\n\nShe added that other studies credit regular daily moderate to vigorous physical activity for reducing behavior and discipline problems by increasing on-task time and improving impulse control and decision making.\n\nLubin, 47, would add that the 100 Mile Club teaches life skills such as setting a goal and responsibly working toward it; doing your best and encouraging those participating alongside you; and practicing integrity by turning in a stick (some schools give kids a plastic stick to keep track of each lap) found on the field instead of claiming it as your own.\n\n\"And once you finish 100 miles, you can kind of be a coach,\" she said. \"... This club can make a difference, especially for our students who sometimes struggle to be successful at school.\"\n\nThe fun factor\n\nBut the kids participating in 100 Mile Club don't care so much about all those benefits.\n\nWhen Lubin visited several SVVSD elementary schools in late August as part of the program's kickoff, she stepped before students wearing a sporty warmup outfit and a tie-dye scarf around her head and then mesmerized them with her spiel.\n\n\"I believe, boys and girls, that the 100 Mile Club is a journey with your classmates, with yourselves, and most importantly with yourself,\" she said.\n\nLubin knows it's a big ask.\n\n\"Kids know it's going to take a long time to do this. Just think developmentally about children at elementary school ages. Think about how long they think it takes for Christmas to come,\" she said.\n\nDevyn Nabarrete, 9, celebrates logging 100 miles in the 100 Mile Club on April 21, when she was in third grade at Black Rock Elementary School in Erie. (Courtesy photo)\n\nBut at Black Rock Elementary School in Erie last year, about 40 percent of the 700 students participated last year, Kathy O'Donnell, Black Rock's principal, said.\n\nAt the start of the last school year, when 100 Mile Club was brand new in the district, Devyn Nabarrete, a 9-year-old Black Rock fourth-grader, fretted.\n\nBy April, she celebrated her 100-mile mark with a ritual the club encourages \u2014 running through a tunnel of other cheering club members.\n\n\"The best part is that you get to walk and talk with your friends,\" she said.\n\nWyatt Ball, 7, a second-grader at the same school, said that he hesitated to join when a friend had to bail out of the club due to a broken leg.\n\n\"So, I went there with no friends. But then friends started to join,\" Ball said.\n\nO'Donnell echoed one of Lubin's lines in support of the program: \"For some kids, they don't know what success feels like anywhere, and this program can be everywhere with every kid and with any ability level.\"\n\nBefore Lubin dismissed the students and left Black Rock's gym, she smiled and shouted,\n\n\"Have a great year. I know that we are going to be shipping a lot of medals back here!\"\n\nPam Mellskog can be reached at p.mellskog@gmail.com or 303-746-0942.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/longmont-schools/ci_28879296/100-mile-club-keeps-st-vrain-valley-elementary", "modificationDate": "2015-09-27T10:58:28-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0925/20150925__27TCCLIF~3_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Pam Mellskog \n  For the Times-Call", "description": "Growing up longeing horses, holding a long lead rope while a horse circled for exercise and training, gave Kara Lubin a model for letting kids horse around as they warm up to workout academically.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28879296:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-27T10:48:32-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/longmont-schools/ci_28879296/100-mile-club-keeps-st-vrain-valley-elementary", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0925/20150925__27TCCLIF~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Growing up longeing horses, holding a long lead rope while a horse circled for exercise and training, gave Kara Lubin a model for letting kids horse around as they warm up to workout academically.", "title": "100 Mile Club keeps St. Vrain Valley elementary students moving forward -- physically and academically"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Growing up longeing horses, holding a long lead rope while a horse circled for exercise and training, gave Kara Lubin a model for letting kids horse around as they warm up to workout academically.", "title": "100 Mile Club keeps St. Vrain Valley elementary students moving forward -- physically and academically", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/longmont-schools/ci_28879296/100-mile-club-keeps-st-vrain-valley-elementary", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0925/20150925__27TCCLIF~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-27T10:48:32-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-09-25T17:02:45-0600", "sailthru.title": "100 Mile Club keeps St. Vrain Valley elementary students moving forward -- physically and academically", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Schools", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Pam MellskogFor", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0925/20150925__27TCCLIF~3.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-09-27T10:59:45-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall schools education St Vrain Valley Boulder Valley"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e14\"", "article_summary": "Kara Lubin, the founder of the 100 Mile Club, meets with staff before speaking at Flagstaff Academy on Sept. 1.\n\"I believe, boys and girls, that the 100 Mile Club is a journey with your classmates, with yourselves, and most importantly with yourself,\" she said.\nThe fun factorBut the kids participating in 100 Mile Club don't care so much about all those benefits.\nDevyn Nabarrete, 9, celebrates logging 100 miles in the 100 Mile Club on April 21, when she was in third grade at Black Rock Elementary School in Erie.\nAt the start of the last school year, when 100 Mile Club was brand new in the district, Devyn Nabarrete, a 9-year-old Black Rock fourth-grader, fretted."}
