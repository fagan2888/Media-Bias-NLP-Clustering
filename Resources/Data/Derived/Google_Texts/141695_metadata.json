So far, more than 4.2 million consumers have enrolled and at least a million more are expected to sign up for coverage in March.\n\n\n\nWe spoke with several people to find out how the affordable health care has changed their lives \u2014 for better or worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nView gallery .

I've paid out of pocket to visit the dentist but I put off a procedure I need because it's over $500. I'm generally a pretty healthy person, so I don't really ever have a need to go to the doctor, but I haven't had a well-woman exam in years, which I need to do ASAP. I don\u2019t have the funds to pay out of pocket.\n\n\n\nI didn't end up enrolling because I was frustrated by the quotes I received. I don't make very much money, primarily being a student and server, so I was sure there would be options available that were affordable. That was the whole point and what the plan's name was based on \u2014 affordability.\n\n\n\nI did qualify for some tax-based subsidies, about $60 a month. But in order to get a plan worth having (meaning I'm not paying out of pocket to meet some gargantuan deductible), I would have been paying over $300 a month to begin with and that amount of savings wasn't much of a help.\n\n\n\nI know it's irresponsible to not have health insurance, and it's been on my list to budget for forever since I stopped working for companies that provided it for me. Aside from having the convenience of health insurance for routine checkups or procedures, it makes me very nervous not having any major medical coverage, in case something serious or catastrophic should happen. I'm well aware of the plethora of stories out there about people who were financially ruined by one medical issue.\n\n\n\nI've heard of some people having success stories, but personally I'm extremely disappointed. Considering all the havoc and big to-do that's been made about people losing their existing coverage, and people not being able to keep the programs they want, I expected there to be more of a benefit to this new act.\n\n\n\n\n\nView gallery .

He\u2019s 59 years old. He wound up disabled and not able to go back to work. We were able to get COBRA insurance for both of us, which cost us almost $1,000 a month. He has to be disabled for at least two years before he qualifies for Medicaid and because I\u2019m not yet 65, I don\u2019t qualify for Medicare.\n\n\n\nHalf his tongue was removed, the floor of his mouth was removed, and he still can\u2019t eat solid food or speak well. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be able to go back to work, so I started withdrawing my Social Security benefits early. I took family medical leave from my job as a human resource manager at a nursing home when he got sick, but I had to retire early in March because of the intensive care he needed.\n\n\n\nI heard about Obamacare in October 2013 and I tried to get on the website to see what we qualified for. They had so many issues with Healthcare.gov that I couldn\u2019t get on for a couple of months, but I was able to get a hold of an agent who helped me enroll on Feb. 1.\n\n\n\nWe got a good plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, and we went from paying almost $1,000 a month to now $521 for both of us. For us, it was a godsend. He was able to keep all his same doctors and get all the care he needs.\n\n\n\nCOBRA would have run out after 18 months and if they hadn\u2019t come up with this Affordable Care Act, he very well could have been denied insurance anywhere else. Your life can change so dramatically over one diagnosis.\n\n\n\nLarry Schuler, 50\n\nSt. Joseph, Mich.\n\n\n\n\u201cI sold my business because of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\n\nI opened my restaurant, Schu\u2019s Grill & Bar, in 1990. There\u2019s no question that the new health law has impacted not only my current business but future projects, too, to the point where I sold my restaurant in January and I\u2019m in the final stages of moving on. I won\u2019t be working in a brick-and-mortar business and putting people to work. I\u2019ve chosen to go into consulting for myself and the ACA was one of the reasons, though not the only reason.\n\n\n\nDuring our busy season, we are well over the 50 full-time employee threshold, which meant we had to offer private health insurance under the new law. As a small-business owner, I don\u2019t have a chief financial officer and the paperwork required would have added probably another 20 hours per month to my accounting staff. We didn\u2019t have the dollars to put into those additional labor hours.\n\n\n\nIt would have actually cost me all the profit I generated from the restaurant. Profit is not a dirty word. It\u2019s important to survive.\n\n\n\nBefore the ACA, we already offered private insurance to our employees and we paid 50% of their policies, which would have cost us $150 a month per worker. But we hired a lot of young professionals who were 27 or 28 years old and they would opt out of medical insurance because they said they didn\u2019t need it. That\u2019s the irony.\n\n\n\nYes, they extended the deadline for small-business owners to comply with the ACA until 2016. They bought more time, but unless there\u2019s an evolution in the policy, it\u2019s still unacceptable. I\u2019m disappointed. I\u2019m disappointed in the Obama leadership but I\u2019m more disappointed in the real problem, which is that Americans don\u2019t really take the time to study and understand what\u2019s really happening in politics. We\u2019re the ones that voted him into office.\n\n\n\n\n\nView gallery .

With the Affordable Care Act, now I\u2019m able to be covered for the problems I was having with my neck and I don\u2019t have to worry about being discriminated against like I was before by insurers.\n\n\n\nComparing my private health plan to the ACA plan on the health care exchange was like night and day. All of my costs are less. I qualified for a $510 tax subsidy for me and my wife and what would have been a $1,000 policy is now $568 per month for us. It\u2019s a considerably better plan than what we had before, with a lower deductible, lower copayment and lower prescription drug costs. We get to keep the same doctors we\u2019ve always had.\n\n\n\nIt took two months before I was able to actually get to a point where I could pick a plan on the website, but I knew from the beginning that I qualified for a subsidy so I was very motivated to keep trying. And when I was answering the questions on the site, I didn\u2019t have to talk about my physical ailments at all.\n\n\n\nNow, with my insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, I\u2019ve had troubles setting up an account so I can pay the premium, but that\u2019s a different story. They weren\u2019t prepared for all the people who were signing up, and it took until March to get my account set up.\n\n\n\nNothing is going to be perfect, but people are being helped by this and I think it\u2019s a good thing. I look forward to seeing improvements.\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more information about signing up for health coverage under the ACA, check out these websites for more information, or send us an email here.\n\n\n\nFor individuals:\n\n\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s page on health care reform\n\nKFF\u2019s Health plan subsidy calculator\n\n\n\nFor business owners:\n\n\n\nThe Small Business Association\n\nHealthcare.gov FAQ for large business owners\n\nInsurance\n\nInvesting Education", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "From Yahoo Finance: Change isn't always easy.", "original-source": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-obamacare-has-changed-my-life-%E2%80%94-for-better-and-for-worse-150209891.html", "og": {"site_name": "Yahoo Finance", "description": "Change isn't always easy.", "title": "How Obamacare has changed my life \u2014\u00a0for better and for worse", "url": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-obamacare-has-changed-my-life-%e2%80%94-for-better-and-for-worse-150209891.html", "image": "http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/Z2FvmTfFTxrLd9CRfafNkg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@f118a216-cda2-38f7-9759-2cb8027ca258_FULL.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Change isn't always easy.", "title": "How Obamacare has changed my life \u2014\u00a0for better and for worse", "image": {"src": "http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/Z2FvmTfFTxrLd9CRfafNkg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@f118a216-cda2-38f7-9759-2cb8027ca258_FULL.jpg", "identifier": "http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/Z2FvmTfFTxrLd9CRfafNkg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@f118a216-cda2-38f7-9759-2cb8027ca258_FULL.jpg"}, "site": "@YahooFinance", "dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 90376669494}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://l.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/presentation/images/icons/win8-tile-1484740.png", "application-name": "How Obamacare has changed my life \u2014\u00a0for better and for worse", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/yahoofinance"}, "theme-color": "#400090"}, "article_summary": "We spoke with several people to find out how the affordable health care has changed their lives \u2014 for better or worse.\nComparing my private health plan to the ACA plan on the health care exchange was like night and day.\nFor individuals:The Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s page on health care reformKFF\u2019s Health plan subsidy calculatorFor business owners:The Small Business AssociationHealthcare.gov FAQ for large business ownersInsuranceInvesting Education\nI know it's irresponsible to not have health insurance, and it's been on my list to budget for forever since I stopped working for companies that provided it for me.\nAside from having the convenience of health insurance for routine checkups or procedures, it makes me very nervous not having any major medical coverage, in case something serious or catastrophic should happen."}
