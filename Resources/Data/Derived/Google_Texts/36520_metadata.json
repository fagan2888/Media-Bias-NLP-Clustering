But perhaps it would be better to ask for what we need. We have been given so much in this country that it almost seems ungrateful to ask for more. But all of us\u2014at all times\u2014need more of what is good. And this year, I hope that all of us continue to live in what I consider the spirit of Christmas: a courageous humility.\n\nIt took courage for God to humble Himself. He came down from heaven and became a man\u2014a child in a manger. He did this while knowing that one day He would have to lay down His life for us. He would have to give up His only Son. At first, this might seem like a sad story. But we are to \u201crejoice in the Lord always.\u201d Christmas is a day of celebration. And it is only through grace and prayer that we come to realize: what a gift He\u2019s given us\u2014what a profound act of love.\n\nAnd so we rejoice. This year, may we continue the spirit of Christmas by facing our flaws fearlessly and by giving back boldly. May we recognize that our way is not the only way\u2014it is not even the right way. It is God\u2019s way we seek. May we cherish all the gifts we have been given\u2014especially the men and women of our armed forces, the people who keep us safe. And may we remember that it takes courage to put others first. It is courageous to do the right thing.\n\nMay we remember, and be brave\u2014and be glad.\n\nRepublican Paul Ryan is Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.
