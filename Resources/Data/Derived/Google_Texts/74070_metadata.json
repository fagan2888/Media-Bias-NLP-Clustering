(Rex C Curry/For The Washington Post)\n\nIn this anti-President Obama, anti-Obamacare state, Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is banking on one thing to get her reelected in November: her clout.\n\nEverywhere she goes, Landrieu reminds voters that she has it \u2014 the clout to \u201cdeliver for Louisiana,\u201d the clout to take on Obama and get the Keystone XL oil pipeline built. After nearly two decades in Washington, Landrieu is the new chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which is no small thing for a poor state that pins its economic future to the booming oil and gas industry.\n\nLandrieu has been taking her panel\u2019s work on the road \u2014 a campaign that brought her here to Many, the seat of rural Sabine Parish, where Obama won just 22 percent of the vote in 2012.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gavel we don\u2019t often get,\u201d she told constituents assembled for a committee \u201cfield hearing\u201d in Many this month. \u201cI\u2019ve got it now, and it\u2019s really important for me to be able to wield it on behalf of communities like this.\u201d\n\nAt a throw-the-bums-out time of disgust with Washington, and in a state that is increasingly hostile terrain for Democrats, Landrieu considers her seniority the key to her survival. Why, she asks Louisianans again and again, would you trade the energy committee chairman for a rookie?\n\nView Graphic Election Lab: See our current forecast for every congressional race in 2014\n\nRepublicans say the answer is simple: Landrieu is wrong about important issues, such as her support for the unpopular health-care law, and too often votes in lock step with liberal Democrats. Her main opponent, Rep. Bill Cassidy (R), argues that Louisiana voters care more about policy than about pork.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got seniority, but she\u2019s using it for the president, not for our people,\u201d Cassidy, a medical doctor and opponent of the Affordable Care Act, said in an interview. \u201cGood policy is good politics, and bad policy is bad politics \u2014 and I am on the right side of the policies that matter to the folks in our state.\u201d\n\nIn her first extensive national interview of the campaign, Landrieu told The Washington Post that she hopes voters conclude this: \u201cWashington is broken, but Mary Landrieu\u2019s record isn\u2019t. Washington might not work together well, but Mary Landrieu\u2019s been able to deliver.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they look at me and they say, \u2018You know, she\u2019s an exception,\u2019\u00ad \u201d Landrieu added. \u201cI think people see in me a fighter that never quits, never gives up, always puts the state first. May not agree with me on every one of my positions, but I think they think, \u2018Gee, Louisiana does have this clout now. . . . Why would we walk away from that?\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Landrieu is scheduled to lead Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz on a tour of Louisiana\u2019s energy industry. They will begin in New Orleans with a hearing on petroleum infrastructure and continue by helicopter with visits to Port Fourchon, one of the nation\u2019s biggest supply ports for deep-water drilling, and the Port of Iberia, which produces offshore platforms.\n\nLandrieu has always had tough races but has consistently found ways to prevail. It does not hurt that she is the scrappy daughter in a Louisiana political dynasty: Her father, Moon Landrieu, is a former New Orleans mayor, while her brother, Mitch Landrieu, is the city\u2019s current one.\n\nThis year\u2019s race, however, may be her toughest, with Obama\u2019s favorability rating hovering around 40 percent. Louisiana\u2019s election rules (there are no party primaries) mean she will have to win more than 50 percent of the vote on a crowded November ballot to avoid a December run-off, probably against Cassidy.\n\nThe Louisiana campaign, which may determine which party controls the Senate, is a test case for whether embattled Democrats in Republican-leaning states can frame their reelection bids around local issues and keep them from becoming referendums on the president.\n\nIn North Carolina, Sen. Kay Hagan (D) has focused on the unpopular state legislature, in which her Republican opponent, Thom Tillis, serves as speaker of the House. In Arkansas, Sen. Mark Pryor (D) aired a television ad saying the Bible is his \u201cNorth Star.\u201d\n\nAnd in Alaska, Sen. Mark \u00adBegich (D) has been touting his work on local economic development projects. In his latest ad, he rides a snowmobile across the frozen Arctic Ocean to show where oil drilling will soon begin as a result of the permits he secured.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a stark difference between the way we see these races and the way Republicans in general see these races, as referenda on the president and the national political environment,\u201d said Matt Canter, deputy executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cWe truly see them as choices between the two people on the ballot, and the contrast varies dramatically from state to state.\u201d\n\nLandrieu\u2019s advocacy of domestic drilling has won her plaudits from business leaders who say they would otherwise back Republicans. The oil and gas sector has given her campaign $547,286 this cycle \u2014 more than to any other senator except John Cornyn (R-Tex.), according to an analysis of campaign finance data by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nMark Miller, president of Louisiana-based Merlin Oil & Gas, is a Republican and has donated to many GOP campaigns over the years. But he\u2019s backing Landrieu.\n\n\u201cWith her seniority, she is able to steer the energy agenda under the current administration and protect the oil and gas interests for our business,\u201d Miller said. \u201cShe\u2019s gone to bat for us for years. It would leave a huge vacuum if we had to start over again.\u201d\n\nBut Cassidy questions her effectiveness on energy issues. \u201cWe can have a trophy: Senator Landrieu\u2019s from Louisiana, and she\u2019s chair of the energy committee,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t even get a vote on the Keystone pipeline?\u201d\n\nOne of Landrieu\u2019s television ads this spring stars shipbuilder Boysie Bollinger, a longtime GOP fundraiser and activist. As Bollinger walks through his shipyard in a hard hat, he says into the camera, \u201cLouisiana can\u2019t afford to lose Mary Landrieu,\u201d adding that her energy committee post \u201cmeans more boats, more jobs and more oil and gas. She does big things for Louisiana.\u201d\n\nBollinger Shipyards, which employs 3,000 people in Lockport, has been a big beneficiary of Landrieu\u2019s largesse. Last fall, she helped secure a $250 million federal contract for Bollinger to rebuild Coast Guard cutters.\n\nThe question for Landrieu is whether regular voters will make the same calculation as industry executives. In 2010, then-Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D), running a tough reelection race in Arkansas, aired ads touting her clout as chairman of the Agriculture Committee. But they had little effect. Republican John Boozman beat her by 21 percentage points.\n\n\u201cIf they just keep with the message, \u2018I\u2019m powerful, I\u2019m powerful,\u2019 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to win,\u201d said Robert Mann, a Louisiana State University professor who writes a state politics blog. \u201cIf this is a referendum on Mary Landrieu\u2019s almost 20 years in Washington, I think she loses the race.\u201d\n\nRoger Villere, the state Republican Party chairman, said of Landrieu\u2019s strategy, \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing: Consistently voters are saying, \u2018We want new people.\u2019 . . . She\u2019s going all out on her experience. It\u2019s a contrarian view.\u201d\n\nLandrieu\u2019s advisers argue otherwise. They say she has a well-established reputation of fighting on Louisiana\u2019s behalf \u2014 most prominently to direct federal disaster aid in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. And they say their research shows that the oil and gas industry is so central to people\u2019s economic security here that once everyday voters inclined to turn out Landrieu are reminded of what she has done and could do for the state, they\u2019ll think twice.\n\nThat\u2019s why Landrieu is traveling the state showing the power of her post. Earlier this month, she brought Jeh Johnson, the new secretary of homeland security, to Monroe and Bossier City, both conservative parts of this state, to showcase the cybersecurity industry she has helped to flourish.\n\nIf Republicans have their way, Louisiana voters will determine Landrieu\u2019s fate based on one particular part of her record: her 2010 vote for the Affordable Care Act. The law colloquially known as Obamacare is deeply unpopular here, and conservative groups have been hammering her on the airwaves over it.\n\nIn her interview with The Post, Landrieu defended her vote and called the law \u201ca good step forward\u201d but added: \u201cI\u2019m working to improve it.\u201d\n\nFor Landrieu, the politics of Obama and the health-care law are tricky. To win, she needs to increase turnout among black voters in New Orleans who widely admire Obama. But she also has to show independence from the president to win over white voters elsewhere.\n\nWhen Landrieu visited Many, she did not mention the health-care law. \u201cWe\u2019re here to talk about the future,\u201d she said, ticking through the goodies she hopes to bring to the region. She noted with pride, \u201cI\u2019ve been an appropriator since I was 23 years old.\u201d\n\nA local official pressed Landrieu about renewing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s 50-year federal license for the huge Toledo Bend reservoir built for hydroelectric projects. Sure enough, three days later, the senator\u2019s office issued a news release: \u201cLandrieu pushes 50-year license for Toledo Bend at FERC nomination hearing.\u201d\n\nAt Landrieu\u2019s event, Gerald Long, a Republican state senator who represents this area and is weighing a future run for governor, congratulated her for her chairmanship and asked the audience to applaud.\n\nLong, a descendant of legendary former governor and senator Huey Long, understands the power of pork. He also forecasts its limits. \u201cMary won\u2019t lose this race,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut the president will lose it for her.\u201d\n\nSo it was that on March 20, when Obama\u2019s health secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, came to New Orleans to promote sign-ups on the federal health exchange, Landrieu was out of town. She spent the day 200 miles away in Lake Charles, addressing the annual meeting of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Louisiana, Sen.
