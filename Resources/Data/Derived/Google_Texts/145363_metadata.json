We had everything we needed to push back on Obamacare, to push back on Obama's illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nBut in the end, Nehlen says, Ryan let him down.\n\nNehlen serves as senior vice president of operations in Lake Geneva for Neptune Benson, a company that leads the industry in water filtration and disinfection technologies.\n\nNehlen also runs his own small business, Blue Skies Global LLC.\n\nSince 2013, Nehlen has served as an advisory board member for Operation Homefront, a Wisconsin nonprofit organization with a strong record of bringing direct financial assistance to the families of active duty service members, according to his website.\n\nTwo Democrats and a Libertarian also have announced they will challenge Ryan.\n\nRyan A. Solen of Mount Pleasant said he is an information security analyst at SC Johnson and Son in Racine. He said he was a medical service corps officer in the Army, attaining the rank of captain during his eight years, leaving the service in 2012.\n\nTom Breu of Janesville, also a Democrat, has been in the running for months.\n\nJason Lebeck, a Janesville Libertarian, said in a news release he wants to restore the national government to its constitutionally mandated role as defender of citizens' rights.\n\nThe partisan primary election is Aug. 9. The general election is Nov. 8.\n\nIt will be an uphill climb to unseat Ryan, who first was elected in 1998.\n\nAs speaker of the House, Ryan is the Republican Convention chairman and could oversee a tumultuous nominating process if none of the three remaining Republican candidates \u2014 Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich \u2014 arrives at the convention with enough delegates to secure the nomination.\n\nFew in the Republican Party establishment are supporting Trump's unconventional candidacy and believe there could be an open convention. Rules for delegates are different for each state, but in most instances, delegates are free to vote for whomever they choose after one or two ballots without a nominee gaining a majority vote.\n\nIn that case, there's been an increasingly vocal call to draft Ryan as the Republican presidential nominee. Ryan ran four years ago as Mitt Romney's running mate in their failed bid.\n\nRyan repeatedly has said he is not interested in the Republican nomination, but his supporters point out that he protested similarly before eventually agreeing to run for the House speakership.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 440, "identifier": "http://www.gazettextra.com/storyimage/JG/20160407/WC/160409830/EP/1/1/EP-160409830.jpg", "height": 440}}, "twitter": {"description": "The latest news from Walworth County Today.", "title": "Ryan gains primary challenger", "url": "http://www.walworthcountytoday.com/20160407/ryan_gains_primary_challenger", "image": "http://www.gazettextra.com/storyimage/JG/20160407/WC/160409830/EP/1/1/EP-160409830.jpg", "site": "@walcotoday", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Ryan gains primary challengerNehlenRyanDELAVAN \u2014 Paul Nehlen, a self-proclaimed former Paul Ryan supporter, will challenge the incumbent congressman for the Republican nomination for the 1st Congressional District seat.\n\u201cI worked behind the scenes for Paul Ryan, and that's where this (motivation to run) all came from,\u201d Nehlen told the website.\n\u201cI did what it was that Paul Ryan was looking for, which was getting everybody out to vote so that we had the House and the Senate.\nNehlen said that he had worked hard for Ryan but has become increasingly frustrated with his agenda.\nIn that case, there's been an increasingly vocal call to draft Ryan as the Republican presidential nominee."}
