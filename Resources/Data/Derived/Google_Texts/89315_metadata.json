He has appeared on Spanish radio, where he talks about being aware of the need for check-ups, especially when it comes to screenings dealing with the colon, thyroid, bladder and hemorrhoids.\n\nHe wants patients to know they can take care of varicose vein issues right in his office at Precision Surgery at 5310 W. Thunderbird Road.\n\nHe said, \u201cVaricose veins are treatable and most are covered by insurance.\u201d\n\nAs a member of the Arizona Latin Medical Association, Serrano stays in touch with other Latino physicians.\n\n\u201cSo, now they know me,\u201d he said, referring to patients in the Hispanic community. \u201cThey feel comfortable. I speak the language, not just over the phone.\u201d\n\nBeing comfortable with a physician makes it easier to get a diagnosis. And Serrano believes he manages that situation very well.\n\n\u201cOlder people, Mama, I call them, just a sign of courtesy. Older gentlemen, I call them Papa,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a transplant 20 years ago from New York, Serrano confessed he \u201cwasn\u2019t enthralled with Spanish\u201d until he was a third-year medical student.\n\n\u201cThat was a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI would go here and there\u201d and he eventually learned it was \u201ca big deal\u201d to know Spanish.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a huge help to me,\u201d he said.\n\nSerrano ticked off the statistics, saying his Hispanic patient population is now at 40 percent. At one point, his English-speaking colleagues were referring patients. Now, he gets referrals from the ALMA. And, he said, patient referral works very well. He considers it an honor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no greater flattery,\u201d he said. \u201cThey really trust me to send their friends. Also, hospital staff, trusting you and knowing your skills; surgery can go wrong in the wrong hands.\u201d\n\nHe speaks at physicians\u2019 offices three times a month, and has recently begun advertising in ValPak, a free ads-only flier that reaches households throughout the Valley.\n\nHe works alone at Precision Surgery, and said he is happy to be solo, \u201cuntil they let the hammer down and force me to join a group.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u201d is his word for the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as ObamaCare.\n\nSerrano wants to reach out to the Hispanic community and let members of that segment of the West Valley know he is a physician who can talk with them in their own language, and understand their needs.\n\nSerrano is aware of the numbers. With 17 percent of the U.S. population being Hispanic, he wants to increase the percentage of Hispanic physicians, which stands at just 5 percent.\n\n\u201cThat translates to 2,000 patients per doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m representing that 5 percent being in the community.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a preceptor, which means medical students come to his office and go to counsultations with him.\n\n\u201cThey get one on one with me, experience surgery,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for me to give back. I make sure they walk away with something. Knowledge is power.\u201d\n\nHe is attempting to gain more Hispanic students. He was hoping that a June 12 varicose vein lecture he was presenting at the Arizona College of Osteopathic Medicine would be an inspiration to students in attendance. He encourages students who want to stay in Arizona to learn Spanish.\n\nAt his office, Serrano employs four individuals, three of whom speak fluent Spanish. He can be reached at 602-547-3300.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Glendalestar.com", "description": "Dr. Johnny Serrano said he just wants the Latino community know he\u2019s available.
