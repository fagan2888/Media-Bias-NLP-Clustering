Both did well in American public schools. And both were given at least temporary protection from deportation under the Obama administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy, which applies to some undocumented immigrants who arrived before they were 16.\n\nThen their paths diverged dramatically \u2014 mainly because of where they live.\n\nSanchez grew up in California, where tuition and financial aid policies encourage undocumented students to enroll at public colleges and help them afford it. She\u2019s now a freshman psychology major at UCLA and gets substantial state aid for her tuition and other costs.\n\nDelgadillo\u2019s family settled in Georgia, which has some of the most restrictive rules in the nation for undocumented students, even banning them from attending some public universities. She has delayed starting college for two years and now hopes that a private, out-of-state school will accept her and provide her scholarships.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Being undocumented in Georgia is a totally different experience than being undocumented in California,\u201d Delgadillo said. \u201cI do wish I was in California.\u201d\n\nRelated: In one country, immigration is seen not as a burden, but as an economic gain\n\nPolitical dysfunction has deadlocked a national DREAM Act that would, among other things, make federal loans available to some undocumented students and make it easier for states to charge them lower in-state tuition at public universities and colleges. But an increasing number of states have already extended those benefits, and even added scholarship support.\n\nThe contrast among them, however, illustrates the fractured national picture \u2014 and difficult personal dilemmas \u2014 facing undocumented immigrants who aspire to go to college.\n\nSome state legislatures and university governing boards continue to be roiled by questions of whether longtime resident undocumented immigrants should be charged sharply discounted in-state tuition rates, or, like out-of-staters and international students, pay double or three times as much. Several lawsuits on the matter are in state courts. In February, the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the higher tuition when it ruled that the higher-education governing board could not be sued by immigrant advocates.\n\nDebate also continues over whether the undocumented, with or without DACA status, should be eligible for state financial aid. That\u2019s important because no undocumented students can get federal Pell Grants or, without a national DREAM Act, federal subsidized loans.\n\nRelated: Tangled process of applying for financial aid deepens college affordability crisis\n\nOpponents of such aid say it might encourage more illegal immigration, and that public resources are limited.\n\nGiving funds to undocumented students \u201cwould be taking money away from everyone else,\u201d \u2014 David Wood, Missouri legislator\n\nMissouri, for example, has placed restrictions on tuition discounts and aid to undocumented students at state universities and colleges. In the fall, the state legislature overrode a gubernatorial veto and passed a law forbidding even immigrants with DACA protection from getting scholarships toward community college tuition.\n\nGiving the funds to undocumented students \u201cwould be taking money away from everyone else,\u201d Missouri State Rep. David Wood, a Republican who is chairman of the legislature\u2019s Joint Committee on Education, said. \u201cMy vote was to take care of those who had legal status in the state of Missouri first.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for such aid contend it makes no sense to put educational barriers in the way of people who came to the United States as children, and that undocumented immigrants can help the nation meet its goals of increasing the proportion of the population with degrees \u2014 goals toward which the nation is falling behind.\n\nRelated: Candidate\u2019s comment reopens controversy over whether college is worth the cost\n\nMany policymakers seem to agree. The recent trend has been for more states to adopt so-called \u201ctuition equity\u201d allowing the undocumented to pay the in-state rates, according to the National Immigration Law Center, a pro-immigrant organization. All or some public colleges in 21 states offer such equity, a survey by the center found.\n\nAt least six states \u2014 California and Texas being the largest \u2014 provide some financial aid to undocumented students who meet various criteria. Some public universities in others, such as Hawaii, Illinois and Minnesota, offer aid that\u2019s paid for by private sources. In states without explicit policies, some colleges quietly create their own \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d rules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a more positive trend,\u201d said Tanya Broder, staff attorney at the immigration law center.\n\nMore than 75 percent of foreign-born residents live in states with tuition equity across the board or at some major campuses, Broder said.\n\nWhile solid national statistics are not available on the impact on this, she said it appears that significantly more undocumented students are studying at state universities than just a few years ago. In California, for example, university officials estimate that 1,100 undocumented students study at the two most coveted campuses, UCLA and UC Berkeley \u2014 four times as many as were enrolled before they qualified for state financial aid beginning in 2012.\n\nRelated: Visiting a country where it\u2019s almost impossible to default on college debt\n\nJust the hope of being able to afford to go to college may help reduce high school dropout rates and create high school climates where \u201cthe expectation is that everyone is at least thinking\u201d about applying to colleges, said Broder.\n\nBut restrictions seem firmly in place in some states, particularly in the Southeast.\n\nGeorgia bans the enrollment of any undocumented students at its top five campuses, including the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech, and charges them higher out-of-state rates at its other campuses \u2014 even if they\u2019ve lived there for the period of time required of other residents.\n\nAt Georgia Southern University, that means $9,222 for tuition this year, compared to $2,613 for people recognized as in-state residents. Immigrant students lost their court challenge to this rule.\n\nIn the Atlanta area, an organization called the Freedom University offers undocumented young people college-level classes along with SAT prep, college counseling and financial support.\n\nThe program is unaccredited, meaning that the credits can\u2019t be transferred or used toward a degree. But many of its students go on to attend private colleges, often in other states, that offer financial aid, said Laura Emiko Soltis, executive director of Freedom University.\n\nThe result, she said: a \u201cbrain drain\u201d out of Georgia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a loss for our state,\u201d said Delgadillo. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me how [state leaders] are OK with so many students going out of state and then contributing to other states.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s precisely the reason six state senators have given for sponsoring a bill, introduced in January, that would reverse Georgia\u2019s restrictions on undocumented immigrants.\n\nWhen Delgadillo graduated from high school in 2014, she said, she was priced out of public colleges and even a private one in Georgia that offered some aid, but not enough. Her father who works on road construction and her homemaker mother don\u2019t have the money to pay for her tuition. So she\u2019s been taking classes and getting counseling at Freedom University, working at an ice cream store, and applying to out-of-state private colleges. She hopes to major in communications and media studies.\n\nMany private colleges and universities will admit and award aid to undocumented students. But some categorize them as international students, which means there can be significantly less aid available compared to what U.S. citizens may receive, according to a survey by the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\nMeanwhile at UCLA, Sanchez has benefitted greatly from financial aid. Without such help, the UCLA freshman from Los Angeles said she probably would have gone to a community college or worked for a while to save money since her parents \u2014 her father is a janitor and her mother is out of work \u2014 can\u2019t afford to help much.\n\nShe said she wishes students nationwide could get similar support.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve worked hard and are doing all the right things,\u201d she said. \u201cBut solely for the lack of documents, they are not able to afford their education.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.
