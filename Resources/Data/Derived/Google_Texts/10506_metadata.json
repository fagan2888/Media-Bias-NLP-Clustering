Pastor Sims and Dwayne Black, pastor of The Sanctuary Church in Fort Lauderdale were also arrested and charged on Nov. 2.\n\nCities enacting the bans say they are concerned about food handling issues and a lack of restrooms among other public safety issues.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re really honest, their real purpose for enacting such laws is to make the homeless population either go away or make the population less visible,\u201d said Michael Stoops, director of Community Organizing for the National Coalition for the Homeless. The organization advocates, litigates and lobbies for rights of America\u2019s homeless population, which is increasing every year.\n\nAccording to its October 2014 report, \u201cShare No More: The Criminalization of Efforts to Feed People in Need,\u201d authored by Mr. Stoops, 83 percent (19 of 25) cities surveyed by the United States Conference of Mayors in 2013, reported a rise in the number of emergency food requests from 2012.\n\nNinety-one percent reported an increase in persons requesting food assistance for the first time, and 80 percent reported an increase in frequency of visit to food pantries and emergency kitchens each month.\n\nSeventy-eight percent reported they\u2019ve had to reduce the number of times people could visit food pantries each month, and 66 percent of the cities have had to turn people away due to a lack of resources.\n\nThe number one cause of homelessness in America is the lack of affordable housing that\u2019s affecting homeless, middle class and working class alike, followed by the lack of health insurance, being remedied somewhat by the Affordable Care Act, and either underemployment or unemployment, Mr. Stoops, told the Final Call.\n\n\u201cI think the American people all at once are going to have to say we can\u2019t have so much poverty in this country, and homelessness is probably the most extreme form of poverty,\u201d he said.\n\nSince Mr. Abbot and Pastors Sims and Black were arrested Nov. 2, Mr. Stoops said he\u2019s receiving calls and emails from people concerned they\u2019ll be arrested if they share food with the homeless. Working and middle class people want to help but not at the risk of going to jail or being fined, and that\u2019s the bad effect of the anti-food sharing law, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that we can win those lawsuits, and that will send a message to cities around the country. If you do this, then you\u2019re going to be sued and it will hurt them in their own pocketbook,\u201d he told The Final Call.\n\nHe noted he\u2019s never seen a city adopt so many laws over such a short period of time and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for people to fight the criminalization of the homeless and particularly the ordinances coming out of Florida.\n\nUp until this controversy, Mr. Stoops said, he would have cited Fort Lauderdale as a good example of cities that outreach to the poor, because it has good programs and shelters helping the homeless. However, complaints to the city council from tourists and regular businesses about the homeless and poor increased.\n\n\u201cI think the real war that\u2019s going on is between downtown America, whether it\u2019s Los Angeles or Fort Lauderdale or Washington, D.C. There\u2019s a polarization happening between the interests of economic development and tourism versus agencies serving the homeless and homeless people themselves, and cities just want to drive the homeless out of the downtown area,\u201d Mr. Stoops said.\n\nThe results of hiding the homeless could be deadly, activists say. Without adequate nutrition, according to \u201cShare No More,\u201d people may suffer extreme medical problems, which include anemia, dental problems, gastric ulcers, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, acute and chronic infectious diseases, and diabetes.\n\n\u201cGeneral Jeff,\u201d who advocates for men, women and children who either live, congregate or wander within Skid Row\u2014the 52-block area of downtown Los Angeles considered the \u201chomeless capitol of America\u201d\u2014 labeled the food sharing bans and restrictions anti-human evolution.\n\n\u201cIt perplexes the mind to hear of coordinated methods to \u2018legally\u2019 deny a person from merely helping someone whom is less fortunate than they are. Just as it was once \u2018legal\u2019 to own slaves in this country, it cannot (and should not) be tolerated by anyone for a law to be created which deems it illegal to assist another human being,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Pastor Sims and Dwayne Black, pastor of The Sanctuary Church in Fort Lauderdale were also arrested and charged on Nov. 2.\nThe Final Call | National NewsFight on homeless feeding ban continuesBy Charlene Muhammad -National Correspondent- | Last updated: Jan 16, 2015 - 4:05:17 PMWhat's your opinion on this article?\n(FinalCall.com) - The fight to feed America\u2019s homeless is escalating, leaving charitable individuals and groups wondering what will happen to the poor and hungry?\nThe organization advocates, litigates and lobbies for rights of America\u2019s homeless population, which is increasing every year.\nHowever, complaints to the city council from tourists and regular businesses about the homeless and poor increased."}
