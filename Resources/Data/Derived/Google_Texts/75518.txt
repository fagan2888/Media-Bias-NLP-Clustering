Which Political Party Is Most Obsessed With Sex?

The White House press secretary has some thoughts on the matter.

While discussing the Obama administration’s stance on LGBT issues Tuesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest pointed the finger at Republicans.

Earnest was asked about a recent Wall Street Journal column that criticized the administration’s pro-transgender policies and accused the White House of starting a culture war, ostensibly to improve liberal voter turnout in November. Earnest said the article also noted that Democrats somehow appeared to be obsessed with sex.

That assertion couldn’t be further from the truth, the press secretary told reporters.

“I thought it was a rather amusing observation on their part because it’s Republicans who have, for example, passed this HB2 law in North Carolina. It’s Republicans in the Congress that have created a special congressional committee to take a look at Planned Parenthood. It’s Republicans who have sued the administration over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, including as it relates to women being able to get access to their birth control. So it’s a curious observation by the Wall Street Journal that I don’t think stands up to a lot of scrutiny.”
