10. Texas

Nearly half of Texas households, 49.8 percent, lack a cash cushion that can keep them at the poverty level for three months in the event they lost their income, according to the Corporation for Enterprise Development, (CFED). Also, 12.8 percent are unbanked, meaning that they don't have either a checking or savings account. Another 27.2 percent are "underbanked," meaning that they may have a bank account but also use wallet-busting alternative banking methods like payday lenders. As a point of reference, 8.2 percent of households nationally are unbanked and 20.1 are underbanked.
