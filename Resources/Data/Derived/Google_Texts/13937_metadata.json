I just was frustrated.\u201d \u201cMr. McConnell could have suspended consideration of confirmations for all presidential appointees, except for those who are essential to national security, until the president rescinded his unconstitutional executive action on amnesty.\u201d \u201cThis would have been a constitutionally appropriate response to the overreach of the executive branch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have transformed the political environment, greatly encouraged Republican donors and grass-roots activists, and positioned us to refuse to confirm replacements for any Supreme Court openings that might occur during the remainder of the Obama administration.\u201d \u201cNot trying to repeal Obamacare, not defunding Planned Parenthood, not trying to stop illegal immigration\u2026 That is what Republicans ran on and once they were elected they did not follow up with their promises.\u201d\n\nThe governor of Lousiana, Bobby Jindal, has also called for Mitchell to resign. \u201cHere\u2019s what I say in response to Speaker Boehner stepping down: Mitch McConnell, it is now your turn,\u201d Jindal told a cheering audience at the conservative Values Voter Summit on Friday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A senior Republican official is urging Kentucky Sen.
