While the central bank isn\u2019t expected to move on interest rates, investors are looking for clues about the timing of the first U.S. rate hike in almost a decade.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s all the data the Fed uses to make an interest-rate decision\n\nThe more immediate worry is cash-strapped Greece, which must repay about \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.68 billion) in loans to the International Monetary Fund at the end of the month. Creditors have balked at providing more assistance without an agreement on economic reforms, meaning the government could run out of cash to pay both its creditors and the pensions owed ordinary Greeks.\n\nThe euro fell early Tuesday after Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis told a German newspaper that he doesn\u2019t intend to present a new list of reform measures at a meeting of European Union finance ministers \u2014 known as the Eurogroup \u2014 on Thursday.\n\nThe currency later pared those losses after a Treasury spokeswoman said U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew had urged Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to make a \u201cserious move to reach a pragmatic compromise\u201d in a call Tuesday.\n\nThe talks between Greece and its creditors appear to have collapsed during the past few days, said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cThere appears to be no willingness from either to find a solution,\u201d he said.\n\nShould Greece default on its debts, it could leave the eurozone.\n\nRead: Will a Grexit cause the most predictable crash in history?\n\nThe euro EURUSD, +0.1793% weakened to $1.1241, from at $1.1279 late Monday in New York, but was up from a session low of $1.1205.\n\nThe dollar traded at USDJPY, -0.42% \u00a5123.36, off its session highs but little changed from its levels late Monday in New York.\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.22% a measure of the dollar\u2019s strength against a basket of six currencies, was up 0.2% to 94.9990, around its level from Friday afternoon in New York.\n\nThe pound strengthened against the dollar after U.K.\u2019s inflation report showed inflation rose 0.1% in May from the same period a year earlier. While the headline number met the market\u2019s expectations, the details of the report, including producer prices, core consumer prices \u2014 which excludes volatile food and energy prices \u2014 and the house price index were all weaker than expected. The pound GBPUSD, +0.0953% traded at $1.5646, from $1.5598 late Monday in New York.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The dollar trades higher against the euro Tuesday as investors reassess the odds that Greece might default on its debt.", "creator": "@jsadinolfi", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DL663_varouf_ZG_20150511024436.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Hiroyuki Kachi", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Markets", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "The dollar trades higher against the euro Tuesday as investors reassess the odds that Greece might default on its debt.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-higher-against-yen-after-bojs-kuroda-backtracks-2015-06-16", "author": "Joseph Adinolfi, Hiroyuki Kachi", "parsely-title": "Dollar rises against euro ahead of Fed statement", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-16T15:39:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Markets", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The dollar trades higher against the euro Tuesday as investors reassess the odds that Greece might default on its debt.", "title": "Dollar rises against euro ahead of Fed statement", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-higher-against-yen-after-bojs-kuroda-backtracks-2015-06-16", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DL663_varouf_ZG_20150511024436.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DL663_varouf_ZG_20150511024436.jpg"}, "article.id": "9F53A320-13EA-11E5-BB38-92D8AE503437", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe5253\"", "article_summary": "The dollar traded at USDJPY, -0.42% \u00a5123.36, off its session highs but little changed from its levels late Monday in New York.\nBut the U.S. currency weakened against the yen ahead of Wednesday\u2019s updated monetary policy statement and press conference from the Federal Reserve.\nThe dollar traded higher against the euro Tuesday as an unnerving breakdown in talks between Greece and its creditors caused investors to reassess the odds the highly indebted country might default on its debt.\nThe euro EURUSD, +0.1793% weakened to $1.1241, from at $1.1279 late Monday in New York, but was up from a session low of $1.1205.\nThe pound strengthened against the dollar after U.K.\u2019s inflation report showed inflation rose 0.1% in May from the same period a year earlier."}
