No one in the truck was injured.\n\nTroopers are investigating the cause of the accident. It is believed that the SUV was passing the truck and the SUV driver didn\u2019t see the stalled car until it was too late, Reid said.\n\nThe state patrol said on Twitter that two lanes of the westbound interstate were still closed at 11 a.m.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "One killed, three injured in I-70 crash as car stalls", "title": "One killed, three injured in I-70 crash as car stalls", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/25/one-killed-three-injured-in-i-70-crash-as-car-stalls/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-25T09:28:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-25T09:28:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9f1\"", "article_summary": "The driver of the SUV was also injured in the crash and taken to a hospital, Reid said.\nIt is believed that the SUV was passing the truck and the SUV driver didn\u2019t see the stalled car until it was too late, Reid said.\nTwo other people who were in the car were taken to a hospital for treatments of injuries.\nOne person was killed and three others were seriously injured early Saturday morning after an SUV slammed into the back of a car that stalled on Interstate 70 near Morrison, triggering a three-vehicle pile up.\nThe state patrol said on Twitter that two lanes of the westbound interstate were still closed at 11 a.m.Kirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell"}
