If you know the name Kara Sundlun, you probably associate it with an especially sunny form of T.V. journalism. She co-hosts the show, Better Connecticut, and as the name suggests, it's about 98% dedicated to positive experiences.

Kara's own life has been more problematic. She grew up aware that her biological father was a man who refused to raise her or even have contact with her.

Meanwhile, her mother struggled through a series of jobs, a bad marriage, a broken engagement, and other setbacks while trying to give her daughter some semblance of stability.

Then came the news that her father, the man who abandoned her from birth, was now governor of Rhode Island. Kara pressed her cause with him, and their reunion took its first awkward steps in front of the press. Hear the rest of the story on today's show.
