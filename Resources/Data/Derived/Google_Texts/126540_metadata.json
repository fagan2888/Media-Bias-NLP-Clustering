Until we have that functionality, we are putting in place a manual review process wherever possible and expect hearings to begin soon,\" said the agency.\n\n\"In the meantime, CMS is reaching out to these consumers to provide assistance so they can successfully complete their application without the need to complete the appeals process.\"\n\nCMS did not confirm the number of appeals reported by the Post but said those filed are \"largely related to earlier technology problems that have since been fixed.\"\n\nA CMS spokesman declined to say how soon hearings might start. But analysts said a system would have to be in place before March 31, the end of the Obamacare open enrollment period for obtaining health coverage this year.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, is intended to extend private health coverage to the uninsured by selling private plans at subsidized rates through new marketplaces. The law also calls on states to expand Medicaid coverage for the poor.\n\nHealthCare.gov, the Web portal for a federal marketplace that spans 36 states, crashed soon after its October launch, blocking access to some while saddling others with inaccurate enrollment files. Four months later, CMS is still scrambling to complete back-end systems that would allow the federal marketplace to pay government subsidies to insurers on behalf of low-income beneficiaries.\n\nRepublicans in Congress pounced on news of the appeals problem as fresh evidence that the healthcare law's individual mandate should be delayed. The mandate requires most Americans to be enrolled in health coverage by March 31 or pay a penalty.\n\n\"Over four months after launch, the administration still does not have its act together. They appear to be incapable of addressing Obamacare's failures, unfairly leaving Americans on the hook,\" said Joe Pitts, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee.\n\n(Reporting
