But with proper training, you, too, can become a financial success story \u2014 even in retirement. In other words, financial success can mean simply getting rid of debt, becoming financially stable and able to help our families and save money for emergencies.\n\nBlackEnterprise.com reports that a \u201cdebt-burdened retirement may feel inevitable\u201d for African Americans \u2014 especially since a Demos study says 42 percent of our households are using credit cards for basic living expenses.\n\nSubscribe to AARP\u2019s Free Money Newsletter >>\n\nHere are five tips from BlackEnterprise.com writer Stacey Tisdale for people concerned about debt as they approach retirement age:\n\n1. Come up with a debt reduction plan by sitting down with a financial planner or debt reduction counselor you trust. There are banks and community-based organizations that can help you with this.\n\n2. If you\u2019re saddled with credit card debt, \u201cconsolidate your debt to a lower interest rate card\u201d or \u201cget a better rate through a personal loan from a bank or a credit union.\u201d\n\n3. Consider putting in a few more years at your job with a goal of reducing debt.\n\n4. Think about a possible part-time job to eliminate debt or phase into retirement.\n\n5. Avoid using money from your retirement savings to pay off debt. This may cause tax consequences that could increase the financial burden. Here again is where a good financial adviser can help.\n\nIt\u2019s not too late. There is still hope for your financial success.\n\nAARP helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for and equips Americans 50 and older to live their best lives.
