Charles E. Grassley thinks he\u2019s pretty good at using Twitter.\n\nIf u are a \"follower\" and u paid for my breakfast at VillageInn CedarFalls let me know do I can thank you Waiter told me when askd for chk \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) January 26, 2015\n\nThough the Iowa Republican believes there is certainly room for improvement.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion, watching how my colleagues tweet, that I don\u2019t do enough of it, even though I probably have a better reputation than they have, so I need to do more,\u201d Grassley said in a recent interview with CQ Roll Call when asked about @chuckgrassley.\n\nGrassley, who has almost 83,000 followers, takes pride in handling his own accounts, as opposed to giving the reins to staff. He's as frank on Twitter as he is in person.\n\nThx to Cong King for opportunity to address Freedom Summit. Except for having to fill up multiple bird feeders I watched summit on CSPAN \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) January 24, 2015\n\nConstituents askd why i am not outraged at PresO attack on supreme court independence. Bcause Am ppl r not stupid as this x prof of con law \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) April 7, 2012\n\nThanks to NewsMaxTV for running the history of Queen Elizabeth Jan 10. It's nice to c history there when\"History\" runs\"curse of oak island \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) January 10, 2015\n\nHistory. No history. Axe man Timber Nothing historical. Back to FOX. Sigh. Suggest name to change channel name \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) March 19, 2012\n\nFor example, on April 7, 2012, Grassley created a social media firestorm when he called President Barack Obama stupid. He tweeted the following in response to 44\u2019s comment disbelieving the Supreme Court would invalidate the Affordable Care Act:Grassley said he tweets \u201cwhatever comes to mind,\u201d which has included his outrage that the History Channel programing doesn\u2019t cover much history anymore. (It\u2019s mostly reality shows about pawnshops or lumberjacks these days.)\u201cIt\u2019s irritating,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cEvery time a commercial comes on Fox or MSNBC, I go to the History Channel, and it\u2019s a pawnshop or it\u2019s the ax man, or something like that, it\u2019s not history.\"\n\nA few of his other favorite Twitter subjects? He regularly reports on University of Northern Iowa basketball and his town hall meetings.\n\nUNI men bb ovr Missouri St 32/20 half \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) January 18, 2015\n\n\u201cJust in case you wonder if I do it myself or not, obviously I don\u2019t have staff with me at the basketball games at University of Northern Iowa,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cAnd I tweeted myself when I said we hit a deer and it was assumed dead.\u201d\n\nThat was one of his more famous tweets, coming in October 2012 about the untimely demise of an animal that a car he was riding in had struck.\n\nFred and I hit a deer on hiway 136 south of Dyersville. After I pulled fender rubbing on tire we continued to farm. Assume deer dead \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) October 26, 2012\n\nFred driving me. He said Tues b4 new yr day he hit deer. Don't hv to assume anything. He told deer dead I wasn't w him that nite \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) January 9, 2015\n\nFrom the looks of things, woodland creatures better watch their backs in 2015, too.(District aide Fred Schuster reportedly sent another ill-fated roadway hazard into the great beyond on Dec. 30., though Grassley wasn\u2019t along for that ride.)\n\nThe octogenarian lawmaker also mentioned that he is now on Instagram (about time ) and is looking for followers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Never one for false modesty, Sen.
