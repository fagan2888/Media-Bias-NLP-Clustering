It looked like there were hundreds, rather than thousands.\"\n\nReporting from Paris, NPR's Peter Kenyon says that other activists have found creative ways around the gathering ban. One group lined up thousands of pairs of shoes at Place de la R\u00e9publique.\n\nAnother group is creating a \"human chain\" to call for meaningful action to reduce fossil fuel emissions. Peter filed this report for our Newscast unit:\n\n\n\n\"At an artists' workshop on the outskirts of Paris, organizer David Solnit says besides hampering public events, police are using the state of emergency invoked after this month's terror attacks to target environmentalists \"'There's people being stopped on the street, I mean, we're basically in an authoritarian police state,' he said. \"And the French government is particularly targeting activists. \"With the climate conference set to begin, France's interior minister says some two dozen green activists are under house arrest.\"\n\n\n\nAlong with leaders from nearly 200 countries, President Obama is flying to Paris to attend the conference, which is expected to produce a landmark international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to curb climate change.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "French police fired tear gas to break up a group of activists defying a ban on mass demonstrations in Paris on Sunday.
