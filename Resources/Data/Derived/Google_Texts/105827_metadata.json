Looking after an elderly parent with dementia takes huge amounts of time, energy and emotional stress. Many carers will have no choice but to give up work unless they get better public services.\u201d\n\nThere are approximately 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK with the number expected to hit a million within the next 10 years (Getty)\n\nAlthough the issue of improving access to childcare is recognised as a factor in helping people stay in jobs, or return to work, the same cannot be said when it comes to helping with the burden of elderly relatives, campaigners say.\n\n\u201cThe Government has recognised the need to improve parents\u2019 access to childcare to maintain economic recovery. But sidelining social care for a rapidly growing population of vulnerable older people also poses serious risks to the economy,\u201d Mr McNamara said.\n\n\u201cLocal authority budgets are at breaking point, economic growth is slowing and a massive wave of cuts in public service is imminent. We want the Government to end the crisis in social care and provide a vital lifeline for working families caring for elderly relatives.\u201d\n\nThis comes after mounting concern in recent months over the future of social care. In February, David Sparks, the chairman of the Local Government Association (LGA), said: \u201cAdult social care funding is in crisis\u201d and the system is \u201cbuckling under the strain of inadequate funding\u201d. And in March, Richard Hawkes, chairman of the Care and Support Alliance, said the \u201ccare system is on its knees\u201d, with hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people cut out of the system.\n\nAlthough the Tory manifesto pledged to \u201cincrease support for full-time unpaid carers\u201d, it did not give explicit details of how it would achieve this. Significantly, it did not say that social care budgets would be protected from cuts. Details of wider government cuts planned for the next four years \u2013 which amount to at least \u00a350bn \u2013 have yet to be announced.\n\n'Six of the greatest challenges facing humanity': Which deserves \u00a310m in prize money?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 show all 'Six of the greatest challenges facing humanity': Which deserves \u00a310m in prize money?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/6 Dementia: How can we help people with dementia live independently for longer? \"It is estimated that 135 million people worldwide will have dementia by 2050, which will mean a greater personal and financial cost to society. With no existing cure, there is a need to find ways to support a person\u2019s dignity, physical and emotional wellbeing. The challenge is to develop intelligent, affordable integrated technologies that revolutionise care for people with dementia, enabling them to live independent lives.\" - Longitude Prize 2014\n\n2/6 Paralysis: How can we restore movement to those with paralysis? \"In the UK, a person is paralysed every eight hours. Paralysis can emerge from a number of different injuries, conditions and disorders and the effects can be devastating. Every day can be demanding when mobility, bowel control, sexual function and respiration are lost or impaired. The challenge is to invent a solution that gives paralysed people close to the same freedom of movement that most of us enjoy.\" - Longitude Prize 2014\n\n3/6 Water: How can we ensure everyone can have access to safe and clean water? \"Water is becoming an increasingly scarce resource. 44 per cent of the world\u2019s population and 28 per cent of the world\u2019s agriculture are in regions of the world where water is scarce. The challenge is to alleviate the growing pressure on the planet\u2019s fresh water by creating a cheap, environmentally sustainable desalination technology.\" - Longitude Prize 2014\n\n4/6 Food: How can we ensure everyone has nutritious, sustainable food? \"One in eight people worldwide do not get enough food to live a healthy and fulfilled life. With a growing population and limited resources, providing everybody with nutritious, sustainable food is one of the biggest global problems ever faced. The challenge is to invent the next big food innovation, helping to ensure a future where everyone has enough nutritious, affordable and environmentally sustainable food.\" - Longitude Prize 2014\n\n5/6 Antibiotics: How can we prevent the rise of resistance to antibiotics? \"The development of antibiotics has added an average of 20 years to our life. Yet the rise of antimicrobial resistance is threatening to make them ineffective. This poses a significant future risk as common infections become untreatable. The challenge is to create a cost-effective, accurate, rapid, and easy-to-use test for bacterial infections that will allow health professionals worldwide to administer the right antibiotics at the right time.\" - Longitude Prize 2014\n\n6/6 Flight: How can we fly without damaging the environment? \"If aircraft carbon emissions continue to rise they could contribute up to 15 per cent of global warming from human activities within 50 years. This needs to be addressed in order to slow down climate change and its detrimental effects on the planet. The challenge is to design and build an aeroplane that is as close to zero-carbon as possible and capable of flying from London to Edinburgh, at comparable speed to today\u2019s aircraft.\" - Longitude Prize 2014\n\nEven under the cuts that have already been made, local councils face a shortfall of more than \u00a35bn \u2013 \u00a31.9bn of which is in adult social care \u2013 by the end of 2015-16, according to the LGA. About half a million older and disabled people who would have received care in 2009 are no longer entitled to it, researchers at the London School of Economics have reported. An estimated 50,000 carers were forced to give up their jobs last year because of caring responsibilities, with some 290,000 people having to balance looking after relatives with work commitments, according to the Centre of Economic and Business Research.\n\nIn a statement, a Department of Health spokesperson said: \u201cWe want to make sure those with dementia, their families and carers, get the help they need. That\u2019s why we\u2019re transforming the way people pay for care, capping the amount they have to pay and providing more financial help, as well as raising awareness of the condition like never before.\n\n\u201cOur Care Act and \u00a35.3bn Better Care Fund \u2013 the biggest ever national programme to join up health and social care \u2013 will focus resources on helping people to live independently for as long as possible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tens of thousands of people who juggle work with looking after ageing relatives could be forced into unemployment if care for the elderly is subjected to further cuts by the Government, campaigners have warned.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The Independent", "description": "Tens of thousands of people who juggle work with looking after ageing relatives could be forced into unemployment if care for the elderly is subjected to further cuts by the Government, campaigners have warned.", "title": "Tens of thousands who work and care for relatives could end up unemployed under further cuts", "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/tens-of-thousands-who-work-and-look-after-relatives-could-be-forced-into-unemployment-under-further-10255739.html", "image": "http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/05/16/20/22-Elderly-Care-AFP.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-17T00:47:35+01:00", "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/tens-of-thousands-who-work-and-look-after-relatives-could-be-forced-into-unemployment-under-further-10255739.html", "description": "Tens of thousands of people who juggle work with looking after ageing relatives could be forced into unemployment if care for the elderly is subjected to further cuts by the Government, campaigners have warned.", "site": "@independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tens of thousands who work and look after relatives could be forced into unemployment under further cuts to care, campaigners warn"}, "drupal_parsely_version": "0.1", "fb": {"admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "keywords": ", Home News, UK, News", "article": {"video_count": 0, "published_time": "2015-05-16T22:46:38+01:00", "section": "Home News", "embed_count": 0, "author_name": "Jonathan Owen", "word_count": 716, "content_type": "story", "internal_link_count": 5, "image_count": 1, "subsection": "Frontpage", "modified_time": "2015-05-17T00:47:35+01:00", "external_link_count": 0}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2115\"", "article_summary": "But sidelining social care for a rapidly growing population of vulnerable older people also poses serious risks to the economy,\u201d Mr McNamara said.\n\u201cOur Care Act and \u00a35.3bn Better Care Fund \u2013 the biggest ever national programme to join up health and social care \u2013 will focus resources on helping people to live independently for as long as possible.\u201d\nTens of thousands of people who juggle work with looking after ageing relatives could be forced into unemployment if care for the elderly is subjected to further cuts by the Government, campaigners have warned.\nSignificantly, it did not say that social care budgets would be protected from cuts.\nWe want the Government to end the crisis in social care and provide a vital lifeline for working families caring for elderly relatives.\u201dThis comes after mounting concern in recent months over the future of social care."}
