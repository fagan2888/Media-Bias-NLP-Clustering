Arnold Schwarzenegger, have agreed to stay in their seats until Gov. Jerry Brown (D) names replacements. It\u2019s possible Brown may ask one or both to serve again.\n\nRoss, an African-American appointed by the California Senate, was the only minority on the board. Many experts expect the Senate, now led by the first Latino in more than a century, to appoint another minority.\n\nDylan Roby, director of Health Economics and Evaluation Research at UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, predicted the Senate will appoint a Latino.\n\n\u201cGiven California\u2019s high Latino population and the trouble that Covered California had reaching Latinos last year (the Covered California enrollees did not reflect the demographics of the state when it came to Latino enrollment), I would expect a Latino/a to be named to that seat,\u201d Roby said in an e-mail.\n\nSenate Seat Up First\n\nBecause Kennedy and Belsh\u00e9 agreed to stay on the job while Brown decides what to do, Ross\u2019 vacant seat will probably be the first to be filled.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s 2010 law establishing the first state-run exchange under the Affordable Care Act calls for the Senate and Assembly to appoint one director apiece, the governor appoints two and the fifth seat is automatically occupied by the secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency.\n\nKevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles), installed last month as Senate President Pro Tempore, will play a major role in picking and ushering in the Senate\u2019s choice.\n\nAnthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, hopes de Le\u00f3n and Brown choose people with philosophical outlooks similar to those on the board now.\n\n\u201cWe hope that new appointees continue the consensus that California should lead in improving the health care system,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI think the first board was clear that California doesn\u2019t just want to implement the new law, it wants to lead in achieving the goals of the ACA.\u201d\n\nWright suggested Brown and de Le\u00f3n might consider \u201cpeople with some knowledge and background around IT (information technology) or marketing. Those are both areas where Covered California has had to put a lot of focus,\u201d Wright said.\n\n\u201cThe authorizing law has strong conflict-of-interest language to prevent board members from being active parts of the health care industry,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWhile that has limited the potential pool of board members, it\u2019s an important protection.\u201d\n\nAs a result of a bill signed into law last year, qualifications to serve on Covered California\u2019s board were broadened to include experience with IT, insurance marketing and enrollment in poor and minority communities.\n\nRep.-elect Norma Torres (D-Calif.), who authored SB 972 as a state senator, told the Associated Press: \u201cWith three board seats open, the governor and [state] Senate now have an opportunity to implement SB 972 in the way it was intended: by appointing a new majority to the board that is more representative of California\u2019s population, particularly those who need insurance.\u201d\n\nHandicapping Possible Appointees\n\nWhile consumer advocates and industry experts are hesitant to name names, a few specific individuals did rise to the surface as possible candidates.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to sit back and look at all five seats and fill specific gaps in expertise or experience, but the state Senate and governor are probably unlikely to actively coordinate the selection of up to three new members,\u201d Roby said. \u201cLast year, there was a call for more diversity on the board, as well as a call for an information technology expert. However, when you are thinking about the short-list of people who may be suitable, you are trying to figure out if they have conflicts of interest, are willing to do it and would represent the Covered California membership well, you can\u2019t necessarily select people because they have a very specific skill that may have been necessary last year.\u201d\n\nRoby mentioned three possible candidates.\n\n\u201cHoward Kahn, who is retiring from LA Care this month might be a good person to consider or perhaps another retired former leader of an insurance carrier in California or elsewhere,\u201d Roby said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s difficult to find someone with that insurance carrier experience who doesn\u2019t have a conflict of interest, having an academic health economist who has followed insurance markets very closely might be a good compromise,\u201d Roby said.\n\n\u201cGerald Kominski at UCLA (director of UCLA Center for Health Policy Research) Will Dow (Professor of Health Economics at UC-Berkeley, and an expert on risk adjustment and behavioral economics) would both be phenomenal, analytic voices to add to the Exchange board,\u201d Roby said.\n\nNew Fiscal Reality\n\nWhoever occupies the five Covered California directors\u2019 chairs will be facing a new set of fiscal guidelines. The ACA called for federal funding for the first four years but state exchanges are supposed to become self-sufficient thereafter. In California\u2019s case, that means starting last week, Covered California will be paying its own bills with state money.\n\n\u201cThat new reality should probably be part of the discussion when new appointments to the board are considered,\u201d Wright said", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Three of Covered California's five directors could be leaving, setting the stage for a leadership shift that could have significant influence on the country's first and largest state health insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Three of Covered California\u2019s five directors could be leaving, setting the stage for a leadership shift that could have significant influence on the country\u2019s first and largest state he\u2026", "title": "Covered California Board About To Get Makeover", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/covered-california-board-about-to-get-makeover/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-01-05T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-05T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3bce\"", "article_summary": "New Fiscal RealityWhoever occupies the five Covered California directors\u2019 chairs will be facing a new set of fiscal guidelines.\nIn California\u2019s case, that means starting last week, Covered California will be paying its own bills with state money.\nRoss, an African-American appointed by the California Senate, was the only minority on the board.\nThree of the five Covered California Board of Directors seats are about to get newly appointed occupants in a shift that could have significant influence on the future of the four-year-old health insurance exchange.\nThose are both areas where Covered California has had to put a lot of focus,\u201d Wright said."}
