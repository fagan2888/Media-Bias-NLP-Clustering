Chaudhry, the president of the federation. \u201cIt would allow doctors to see more patients than ever before, if they want to.\u201d\n\nThe proposal could increase access to doctors by people in underserved areas. It could also allow people with complex illnesses or rare diseases to more easily consult experts at places like the Mayo Clinic using telemedicine technologies, which connect a patient in one location with doctors in another.\n\nSixteen senators \u2014 10 Republicans and six Democrats \u2014 commended state officials and endorsed the idea in a recent letter.\n\nUnder the proposed compact, doctors who meet certain standards could sidestep a longstanding requirement that they apply for licenses state by state. But it would preserve the authority of each state to regulate the practice of medicine within its borders.\n\nDoctors would still have to comply with the laws and rules of each state in which they chose to practice. By definition, the compact says, \u201cthe practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter,\u201d regardless of where the doctor may be.\n\nA compact is essentially a contract among states that approve and adopt it as part of state law. The compact on medical licensure would be administered and enforced by an interstate commission.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWorking through the commission, a doctor licensed in one state could seek an \u201cexpedited license\u201d from one or more additional states. To be eligible, a doctor would have to be certified in a medical specialty and have no history of being disciplined, penalized or punished by a court, a medical licensing agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration. (About three-fourths of doctors have been certified as specialists.) Moreover, the compact says, a doctor could not obtain an expedited license if the doctor was \u201cunder active investigation by a licensing agency or law enforcement authority in any state, federal or foreign jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nAs part of the compact, states would agree to share information on doctors who had been disciplined or were under investigation. The commission would serve as a clearinghouse. If a license is revoked or suspended in a doctor\u2019s home state, then all licenses issued to the doctor by other states participating in the compact could be automatically revoked or suspended.\n\nThe proposal comes as more doctors and hospitals are exploring the use of telemedicine.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic, in Minnesota, for example, has established links with more than two dozen hospitals and health systems including: Dartmouth-Hitchcock in New Hampshire; NorthShore University HealthSystem in the suburbs of Chicago; Baptist Health Care in Pensacola, Fla.; and ThedaCare in Wisconsin.\n\nMayo experts, working with local doctors, help evaluate patients and make treatment recommendations. Robots allow stroke experts to observe and examine patients hundreds of miles away.\n\n\u201cCross-border licensure is a strategic imperative as we move forward in this brave new world,\u201d said Kathleen M. Harrington, who is in charge of government relations at Mayo.\n\nInterstate compacts have been used since the nation\u2019s early years. More than 200 are in effect today. Initially they were used to settle boundary disputes. Many allocate water rights among states. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was created by an interstate compact, as was the transit agency that runs subways in the Washington area. Other compacts govern use of the Great Lakes, the supervision of juvenile offenders and enforcement of state tax laws.\n\nMari E. Robinson, executive director of the Texas Medical Board, said her agency had voted to support the compact and would share its views with the State Legislature.\n\n\u201cThe compact would make it easier for physicians to get a license to practice in multiple states and would strengthen public protection because it would help states share disciplinary information that they cannot share now,\u201d Ms. Robinson said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Jon V. Thomas, a member of the Minnesota Board of Medical Practice, said the compact would bring licensure up to date for the 21st century, accommodating the rapid growth of telemedicine technology without any loss of state authority.\n\nFrom time to time, members of Congress have suggested a larger federal role in the licensing and regulation of doctors.\n\nBut Dr. Thomas said, \u201cA federal solution for a problem that can be solved by the states would be wasteful, cumbersome and inefficient.\u201d\n\nBlake T. Maresh, executive director of the Washington State Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery, said the criteria for an expedited license would be higher in some ways than the current licensing standards. For example, he said, states generally do not require that doctors be certified in a medical specialty.\n\nThe Obama administration is promoting the use of telemedicine and has provided several hundred thousand dollars in grants to the federation to increase cooperation among states in licensing doctors.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140629205806, "twitter":
