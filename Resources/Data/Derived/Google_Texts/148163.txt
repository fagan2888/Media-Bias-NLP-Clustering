Old TV (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Some years ago, after I was thrown out of preschool for insider-trading, I had a real epiphany.

I did “a complete 180” and turned my once sordid life around to become a super-conservative dude and even a poster child for the late-blooming innocent — still pretty naive about what makes life “tick” and whatever those proverbial birds and bees have to teach.

Quite a while back, before my TV was repossessed (defaulting on alimony payments can do that to a guy), I remember — “babe in the woods” that I was and still am — having to resist the urge to leave the room in embarrassment when Ozzie and Harriet appeared in jammies — in their living room — and I still recall wincing once when Ricky said “gosh darn it.”

Fast forward to summer 2015 — after 17 or so years, I just got my old TV out of hock. Now, after two nights of what network and cable stations call “adult programming” — I’d choose “septic tank sludge” — my eyes have popped, my eardrums have melted and my disbelief has escalated as I’ve heard and seen stuff that would drive Masters and Johnson into a convent and seminary — not together, I hope.

What on Earth has happened to our once pure — somewhat, at least — and precious culture and standards that sap/crap and licentiously loose lips have been allowed to dump such sewage?

I’m so distraught at this steady deterioration that I’m actually a bit unsteady — I mean “physically,” not “emotionally,” but you can decide that for yourselves, I guess — and have had to put training wheels back onto my bike.

But there’s hope. Some of the nicest people I could ever hope to know — Cathy, Mary, Vicki, Marilynn, Lynn, Gary and Bruce — have come to the rescue and are bringing new meaning and happiness into my life this week.

Will you please come to “SHOWTIME” to thank them?
