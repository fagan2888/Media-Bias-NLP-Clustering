Photo courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nJessie Gardner was promoted to director of her Internet marketing company based in San Diego when instead of feeling \u201ccompletely full and happy and excited,\u201d she felt empty. By investing all her time and effort into what she believed to be the definition of success \u2014 a title atop the corporate ladder \u2014 she\u2019d found she disconnected from her \u201cdeepest passions and love.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018There\u2019s something else that\u2019s not being filled within me,\u2019\u201d Gardner told Medical Daily. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten the alternative sources of adventure, passion, romance, and creativity.\u201d\n\nGardner\u2019s co-worker Marisa Shirley felt a similar disconnect, so the two worked together to figure out what would have made them aware of this emptiness sooner; what would have prompted them to see their success at work wasn\u2019t enough to make them truly happy? After spending what seemed like a million nights coming up with a million ideas, they landed on positive disruptions.\n\n\u201cA positive disruption wakes you up,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Hey soul, I forgot about you there.\u2019 The disruptions enable people to fill in the blank of what success is supposed to look like to them.\u201d\n\nMore Americans Hate Their Job\n\nGardner and Shirley are but two examples of the increasing number of Americans who feel disconnected and disengaged from their work. According to a recent Gallup poll, 70 percent of employees in the United States hate their job. Studies have shown job dissatisfaction increases stroke risk, with overnight jobs and long hours in particular causing heavier drinking.\n\nIn 2012, French researchers found job \u201cfulfillment and frustration plays a central role in the improvement or reduction of well-being at work.\u201d Something as simple as your boss\u2019s management style can influence productivity and motivation. And for women who hold positions of authority, a 2014 study found they\u2019re likely to show signs of depression as they work harder to compete with their male counterparts. Men, on the other hand, have fewer symptoms of depression when they have this same authority.\n\n\u201cThe formula is clear,\u201d Shawn Achor, positive psychologist and author of Before Happiness and The Happiness Advantage, said, \u201cwork harder, then you'll be successful, then you'll be happier.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, this worked; now, maybe not. Success, Achor says, is a moving target, and as soon as the brain perceives success \u2014 from a good grade to a good job \u2014 this idea of success changes. Achor refers to this as \u201cthe goalpost of success.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf happiness is on the other side of success, your brain never gets there,\u201d he said.\n\nHappiness as an Advantage\n\nWhat then if we flipped the formula? What if instead of trusting our success to make us happy, we started trusting our happiness to make us successful? In other words, we use happiness to our advantage.\n\n\u201cIf you can raise somebody\u2019s level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which [means] your brain at positive performs significantly better than it does at negative, neutral, or stressed,\u201d Achor explained. \u201cYour intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise.\u201d\n\nIn his research, Achor has found a positive brain is 31 percent more productive than a negative, neutral, or stressed brain; employees are 37 percent better at sales; doctors are 10 percent faster and more accurate in their diagnoses. More importantly, he\u2019s found evidence flipping the success formula works \u2014 and it improves several markers of a person\u2019s life, from their job to their relationships. From this happy place, both job and overall life satisfaction are possible, Achor wrote for Psychology Today.\n\nSo instead of people cultivating a place for themselves on the corporate ladder for more success, it seems better to cultivate happiness instead. That's not to say hard work is pointless, or hard workers won\u2019t reap rewards for their effort. Working toward a goal does give us purpose \u2014 but it\u2019s important to balance this purpose with what makes us happy off the clock.\n\nIdeas, of course, vary person to person, even from back then to now. In 1938, as we recently learned, security, knowledge, and religion were considered the most important attributes for happiness, while good humor, leisure, and security edged their way to the top in 2014. Something that might be able to make a person\u2019s personal idea of happiness more clear: a positive disruption.\n\nWake Up to Happiness\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise Gardner and Shirley founded HeySoul: a subscription box service that packs trinket items with powerful messages into a tiny box, with each item adhering to the box\u2019s theme. Right now there are eight \u201cthemes of life that makes us come alive, but that we easily forget to nurture\u201d: love, adventure, creativity, purpose, calm, gratitude, mind + body + soul, and joy.\n\nThe purpose box is Gardner's favorite; it \u201creally hones in on getting in touch with the impact we are all here to make in the world.\u201d Inside is a purpose key from The Giving Keys, flying wish paper, a dry erase marker, and a copy of 5: Where will you be five years from today? by Dan Zadra.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the experience,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cIt\u2019s always amazing how symbolic experiences are for some people.\u201d\n\nA look inside HeySoul's Purpose box. Jessie Gardner\n\nTake the wish paper, an exercise designed to enable people to let their limitations \u201cfly.\u201d People write down what they need to let go of in order to bring as much positivity, and energy, and focus as they can. Then, they shape the paper into a tube, light a match to it, and watch it float away. Gardner says this \u201cmimics within yourself you can let anything go.\u201d\n\nGardner and Shirley pack curate each box among themselves. Since they both still work full-time in the marketing industry, they'll host packing parties, which includes them and a couple of friends, to fill orders. To date, HeySoul has a handful of monthly subscribers (the service launched in 2014) and it's something Gardner and Shirley hope to one day take beyond digital.\n\n\"The boxes have so much ability to facilitate personal growth experiences,\" Gardner said.\n\nShort of ordering a HeySoul box, how else can people reconnect to what makes them happy? Achor recommends maintaining a gratitude journal to track at least three things you\u2019re grateful for each day (though you don\u2019t have to keep an actual journal). In just six months, this practice alone can raise personal rate of success, he added.\n\nExercise and meditation are two additional ways we can reconnect and refocus our brain and behavior on the positive, not the negative.\n\n\u201cIf you reverse the formula, you can turn happiness into a success advantage, raising every business and educational outcome,\u201d Achor said. \u201cStart by doing one of these habits. And once and for all, stop yourself and others from saying, \u2018I'll be happy when...\u2019 That formula is broken. But there is a better one: happiness leads to greater success.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "redefining, success, power, happiness, has, over, corporate, ladder", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Happiness leads to greater success, not the other way around, some positive psychologists say.", "title": "Is Happiness The New Secret To Success?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/redefining-success-power-happiness-has-over-corporate-ladder-333504", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/15/happiness.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Happiness leads to greater success, not the other way around, some positive psychologists say.", "title": "Is Happiness The New Secret To Success?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/redefining-success-power-happiness-has-over-corporate-ladder-333504", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/15/happiness.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/15/happiness.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-05-15T12:30:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-15T12:30:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Happiness leads to greater success, not the other way around, some positive psychologists say."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc098\"", "article_summary": "So instead of people cultivating a place for themselves on the corporate ladder for more success, it seems better to cultivate happiness instead.\n\u201cThe formula is clear,\u201d Shawn Achor, positive psychologist and author of Before Happiness and The Happiness Advantage, said, \u201cwork harder, then you'll be successful, then you'll be happier.\u201dTraditionally, this worked; now, maybe not.\n\u201cIf you reverse the formula, you can turn happiness into a success advantage, raising every business and educational outcome,\u201d Achor said.\nWhat if instead of trusting our success to make us happy, we started trusting our happiness to make us successful?\nAchor refers to this as \u201cthe goalpost of success.\u201d\u201cIf happiness is on the other side of success, your brain never gets there,\u201d he said."}
