CGI\u2019s $46.2-million contract to create a diabetes registry for eHealth was terminated last year by the Canadian government, according to the Canadian Press.\n\nCGI apparently missed several deadlines and the registry was ultimately left unfinished.\n\nSun News also pointed to an auditor general report that found conflicts of interest for IT procurement in general within the eHealth program.\n\n\u201c\u2026we believe the use of consultants was significantly more costly to the province than had this work been completed by departmental staff,\u201d CBC noted from the AG report.\n\n\u201cThen there was the gun registry,\u201d Lilley said in his Sun News report. \u201cCGI was hired to make sure that the then Liberal government\u2019s gun control program was efficient and high tech.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never worked the way it should have \u2013 was it bad programming or bad government decisions? The truth is we don\u2019t know, we just got stuck with the bill,\u201d he continued.\n\nWatch Lilly\u2019s full report for Sun News about the history of other contracts CGI has held:\n\nObama said Monday in a Rose Garden press conference, \u201cnobody is madder than me about the fact that the website isn\u2019t working as well as it should, which means it\u2019s going to get fixed.\u201d\n\nCGI Federal also issued a statement Monday that said it was working with the government and other contractors \u201caround the clock\u201d to fix the system.\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 2, "twitter": {"description": "The prime contractor to build the Obamacare exchange, which has been riddled with glitches and became the\u00a0laughing stock of many, appears to have had a poor track record for other projects in recent years, according to reports.
