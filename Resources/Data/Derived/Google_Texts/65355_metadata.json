Tommy Thompson told local ABC news reporters that police arrived at the home around 3:20 a.m. Police have identified the suspect as 30-year-old William Thomas Mackey.\n\nThe 77-year-old homeowner told police that this was the second night in a row that his home had been burglarized. Police are investigating whether or not the incidents are related, the local station reported.\n\nSEE ALSO: Gun-toting grandma, 72, shoots at intruder, saves wheelchair-bound husband\n\nThe homeowner said someone had broken into his house the day before and he was awakened Friday night by an intruder.\n\nHe said he realized the intruder was not a family member and, fearing for his life, got his shotgun and fired one shot at the suspect who was struck and fell to the ground.\n\nThe house, located near 43rd Avenue and Bethany Home Road in Phoenix, is not known to be a safe area.\n\nA neighbor, Sandi Corbin, told local ABC news reporters that she had been robbed six times.\n\nAnother neighbor, Jeffrey Gabriel, was at the scene when Mr. Mackey\u2019s father arrived to take the suspect\u2019s pick-up truck away.\n\n\u201cMy attitude is it happened, I feel bad for the family that lost him. I feel bad for my neighbor because he\u2019s got to live with himself but was protecting his stuff. I can\u2019t judge him for that,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said.\n\nMr. Thompson said police are still investigating if the two burglaries at the home were related and said that the scene and interview with the homeowner were consistent with self-defense. The case will go to the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s office for review.\n\nH/T: Hotair", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Phoenix homeowner shot and killed an intruder Friday morning after dealing with another attempted burglary the day before.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Phoenix homeowner shot and killed an intruder Friday morning after dealing with another attempted burglary the day before.", "title": "Ariz. man shoots, kills intruder after two days of attempted burglaries", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/18/ariz-man-shoots-kills-intruder-after-two-days-atte/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/08/handgun-ap.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/08/handgun-ap.jpg", "description": "A Phoenix homeowner shot and killed an intruder Friday morning after dealing with another attempted burglary the day before.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ariz. man shoots, kills intruder after two days of attempted burglarie"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, William Thomas Mackey, Tommy Thompson, Abc News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebf8\"", "article_summary": "A Phoenix homeowner shot and killed an intruder Friday morning after dealing with another attempted burglary the day before.\nThe 77-year-old homeowner told police that this was the second night in a row that his home had been burglarized.\nTommy Thompson told local ABC news reporters that police arrived at the home around 3:20 a.m. Police have identified the suspect as 30-year-old William Thomas Mackey.\nA neighbor, Sandi Corbin, told local ABC news reporters that she had been robbed six times.\nSEE ALSO: Gun-toting grandma, 72, shoots at intruder, saves wheelchair-bound husbandThe homeowner said someone had broken into his house the day before and he was awakened Friday night by an intruder."}
