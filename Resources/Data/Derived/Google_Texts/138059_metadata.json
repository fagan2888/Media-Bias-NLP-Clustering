The Central Cambria School District is now faced with a serious dilemma- how they will deal with a teacher\u2019s absence when a regular teacher cannot work and when a substitute teacher is close to exceeding their 30 hour threshold.\n\nLisa Urbassik, a 7th grade Language Arts teacher at the school district is worried about how the Obamacare rule will affect students.\n\n-\u201cThey\u2019re (substitute teachers) going to have a limited number of days that they can work in each district. If you get a teacher that has to maybe be out sick for a whole week for some reason, then how are you going to have one sub in to cover that class, how are you going to have any sort of continuity for the students?\u201d Urbassik told WTAJ-PA.\n\nHer heart goes out to the children, \u201cYou have to feel bad for the districts and the kids because the districts are the ones that need the subs and the kids are the ones that are going to get hurt and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all here for.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another piece of the puzzle that makes it tougher and tougher to finish the puzzle,\u201d Dr. Vincent Dileo, Superintendent of the Central Cambria School District said of the cumbersome Obamacare rule.\n\nJoe Klezek, a long-term substitute teacher in the district, said that substitute teachers rely on substitute teaching to gain experience and eventually get hired on as permanent teachers. The Obamacare rule will end this learning experience for them, he said. He shared, \u201cPretty much all teachers had to pay their dues at some point.\u201d\n\nThe school employs a system called \u201cAESOP\u201d to ensure that substitute teachers do not exceed 30 hours a week. Substitute teachers have not been a problem for them in past years, they said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Though school has yet to start, the troubles are already beginning for one Pennsylvania school district that is experiencing difficulties with staffing substitute teachers due to harsh regulations imp", "title": "Pennsylvania Substitute Teachers Hit by Obamacare Hour Cuts", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/pennsylvania-substitute-teachers-hit-by-obamacare-hour-cuts/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "description": "Though school has yet to start, the troubles are already beginning for one Pennsylvania school distr", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "title": "Pennsylvania Substitute Teachers Hit by Obamacare Hour Cuts"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Joe Klezek, a long-term substitute teacher in the district, said that substitute teachers rely on substitute teaching to gain experience and eventually get hired on as permanent teachers.\nObamacare mandates that substitute teachers cannot work more than 30 hours per week at the same district without being offered healthcare benefits.\nSubstitute teachers have not been a problem for them in past years, they said.\n-\u201cThey\u2019re (substitute teachers) going to have a limited number of days that they can work in each district.\nBY:Though school has yet to start, the troubles are already beginning for one Pennsylvania school district that is experiencing difficulties with staffing substitute teachers due to harsh regulations imposed by Obamacare."}
