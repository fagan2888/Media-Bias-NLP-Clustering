And yet, despite strong bipartisan support, we are concerned that gridlock in Washington and unrelated disputes over the Affordable Care Act could prevent an extension of the program. As parents, grandparents and former legislators, we believe that partisan politics should never stand between our kids and quality health care.\n\nWe may be from different political parties, but both of us have dedicated our careers to supporting the health of children and their families. This shared commitment inspired us to work together in the late 1990s to help create CHIP to address the needs of the two million children whose families make too much money to be covered by Medicaid, but cannot afford private insurance.\n\nThe resulting program, a compromise between Republicans and Democrats, disburses money to the states but gives them flexibility to tailor how they provide coverage to meet the needs of their own children and families. Some expanded Medicaid; others created separate programs. As a result, the number of uninsured children in America has dropped by half. Children miss less school because of illness or injury, and we\u2019ve seen a significant decline in childhood mortality.\n\nToday, state governments continue to rely on the program to meet crucial health and budget priorities. It\u2019s not surprising that every single governor who responded to a 2014 survey \u2014 39 in all \u2014 supported saving CHIP.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf course, the American health care landscape has changed significantly since CHIP started. Under the Affordable Care Act, many families with children are now receiving financial help to enroll in private health coverage through the new health insurance marketplace. But while it is possible that private, family-wide policies offered by employers and marketplaces may one day render CHIP unnecessary, for now substantial gaps still exist \u2014 and too many children can still fall through them.\n\nOne specific provision of the Affordable Care Act, often called the \u201cfamily glitch,\u201d has been interpreted to prevent many families from receiving subsidized health coverage in the new marketplace if one parent is offered \u201caffordable coverage\u201d through his or her job. In this case, \u201caffordable\u201d is defined as less than roughly 9.5 percent of household income for that parent to sign up alone \u2014 even though the actual cost of available family coverage is far higher. For families affected by this glitch, CHIP may be the only affordable option for making sure their children are covered.\n\nWe already know what happens when CHIP is no longer an option for families. According to a recent report from the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, as many as 14,000 children in Arizona lost their health insurance after 2010, when it became the only state to drop CHIP.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to see the same thing happen across the country. If CHIP is not reauthorized, more families will be hit with higher costs. As many as two million children could lose coverage altogether. Millions more will have fewer health care benefits and much higher out-of-pocket costs, threatening access to needed health services. And because families without adequate insurance often miss out on preventive care and instead receive more expensive treatment in hospital emergency rooms, all of us will be likely to end up paying part of the bill.\n\nWhile reauthorization is not due until the end of September, Congress needs to act now. With more than four-fifths of state legislatures adjourning by the end of June, lack of action and clarity from Washington by then will make budgeting and planning virtually impossible.\n\nReauthorizing CHIP for the next four years would cost about $10 billion \u2014 an investment in our children that will pay off for decades to come. This is an opportunity to send a message that Washington is still capable of making common-sense progress for American families.\n\nAs 2015 unfolds, we know Congress will continue to debate the future of health care reform. We most likely won\u2019t see eye to eye about some of the more contentious questions. But one thing everyone should be able to agree on is that our most vulnerable children shouldn\u2019t be caught in the crossfire.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s about our kids and our nation\u2019s future.
