ObamaCare) after its passage without approval from Congress. Turley may also sue the president over his recent executive order granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants.\n\nWriting for National Review, conservative commentators Dennis Saffran and Eamon Moynihan said they support the aim of both lawsuits, but they questioned the choice of the liberal Turley to lead the fight. While they concede that Turley is a talented attorney, they note that he is also well known for being one of the legal elite\u2019s most vocal and ardent supporters of legalized polygamy \u2013 a position with which they\u2019d rather not see the GOP associated.\n\nTurley is perhaps best known for having successfully sued to decriminalize polygamy in Utah, where fringe Mormon sects had long flouted state law banning the practice by holding church ceremonies and cohabitating, without seeking legal recognition from the government.\n\nTurley represented the stars of the TV reality show \u201cSister Wives\u201d in challenging Utah\u2019s anti-polygamy statute, which banned cohabitation among multiple consensual sex partners. He drew the ire of homosexual activists by hitching his clients\u2019 cause to the so-called \u201cmarriage equality\u201d bandwagon that has seen dozens of states\u2019 definitions of marriage redefined by judicial fiat to include same-sex couples.\n\nTurley argued that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s 2003 Lawrence v. Texas decision overturning anti-sodomy laws across the nation guaranteed Americans the right \u201cto live your life according to your own values and faith,\u201d even if that means \u201cmarrying\u201d more than one person.\n\n\u201cWhile widely disliked, if not despised, polygamy is just one form among the many types of plural relationships in our society,\u201d Turley wrote in a New York Times op-ed. \u201cIt is widely accepted that a person can have multiple partners and have children with such partners. But the minute that person expresses a spiritual commitment and \u2018cohabits\u2019 with those partners, it is considered a crime.\u201d\n\nTurley condemned gay activists for remaining \u201csilent or outright hostile to demands from polygamists for the same protections provided to [homosexuals],\u201d but conceded that their avoidance of the issue \u201cmight be strategic.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome view the effort to decriminalize polygamy as a threat to the recognition of same-sex marriages or gay rights generally,\u201d Turley wrote. \u201cAfter all, many who opposed the decriminalization of homosexual relations used polygamy as the culmination of a parade of horribles. In his dissent in Lawrence, Justice Antonin Scalia said the case would mean the legalization of \u2018bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest, prostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality and obscenity.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cJustice Scalia is right in one respect,\u201d conceded Turley. \u201cHomosexuals and polygamists do have a common interest: the right to be left alone as consenting adults. Otherwise he\u2019s dead wrong. There is no spectrum of private consensual relations \u2014 there is just a right of privacy that protects all people so long as they do not harm others.\u201d\n\nBoth Saffran and Moynihan, however, argue that polygamy does cause harm \u2013 to society at large, and to people drawn into the lifestyle.\n\n\u201cPolygamy, sadly, is an old experiment that has been tried in many places and at many times,\u201d the two men wrote. \u201cThe arguments against it are manifest.\u201d\n\nClick \"like\" if you want to defend true marriage.\n\n\u201cAllowing some men to obtain many wives, while others are unable to find a wife at all, is a surefire recipe for violence and discord,\u201d wrote Saffran and Moynihan. They note that wherever polygamy is practiced, war and violence are the norm while economic development remains stagnant, as in fundamentalist Islamic nations and the countries of West Africa.\n\n\u201cMore fundamentally, polygamy is intrinsically inegalitarian,\u201d the authors asserted. \u201cIt means many wives for some men and none for others. It also means that earlier, and typically older, wives are less valued. Especially in the Islamic world, these older wives often find themselves on the path to involuntary divorce, as younger women are brought in to replace them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs with so many liberal causes, the Left here talks the language of equality,\u201d wrote Saffran and Moynihan. \u201cBut somehow some powerless group always gets left out: fatherless children, mentally ill homeless people, crime victims, disfavored ethnic groups like Asian-Americans, discarded women in polygamous harems.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven all of this, should the Republican party \u2014 the natural defender of the traditional family \u2014 be engaging a lawyer who ardently champions this radical and destructive \u2018rights\u2019 claim?\u201d the authors asked. \u201cAfter all, the platform of the Republican party that nominated Abraham Lincoln condemned polygamy and slavery as the \u2018twin relics of barbarism.\u2019\u201d\n\nSaffran and Moynihan said that their greatest worry was that Boehner\u2019s allegiance with Turley would \u201cgo a long way toward mainstreaming [Turley\u2019s] views.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile few liberals now openly share these views, the GOP action sends a clear signal that they\u2019re no big deal \u2014 that even John Boehner is cool with them,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat self-respecting liberal Democrat wants to seem less cool than John Boehner?\u201d the authors add.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "The Republicans have hired Jonathan Turley, the lawyer for the stars of 'Sister Wives', to sue Obama over the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "GOP under fire for hiring pro-polygamy lawyer to challenge Obama admin", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/JohnBoehner.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/gop-under-fire-for-hiring-pro-polygamy-lawyer-to-challenge-obama-admin", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "The Republicans have hired Jonathan Turley, the lawyer for the stars of 'Sister Wives', to sue Obama over the Affordable Care Act."}, "description": "The Republicans have hired Jonathan Turley, the lawyer for the stars of 'Sister Wives', to sue Obama over the Affordable Care Act.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf24b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhile widely disliked, if not despised, polygamy is just one form among the many types of plural relationships in our society,\u201d Turley wrote in a New York Times op-ed.\nNewsMarriage, Politics - U.S.Two conservative commentators are questioning Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner\u2019s commitment to true marriage after he announced the hiring of a pro-polygamy lawyer to sue the Obama administration over its handling of ObamaCare.\nTurley may also sue the president over his recent executive order granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants.\n\u201cAllowing some men to obtain many wives, while others are unable to find a wife at all, is a surefire recipe for violence and discord,\u201d wrote Saffran and Moynihan.\nWriting for National Review, conservative commentators Dennis Saffran and Eamon Moynihan said they support the aim of both lawsuits, but they questioned the choice of the liberal Turley to lead the fight."}
