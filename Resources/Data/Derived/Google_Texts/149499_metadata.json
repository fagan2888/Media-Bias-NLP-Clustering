But instead of reintroducing himself to voters \u2014 important in a state where politics isn\u2019t the end all, be all \u2014 Udall focused on his opponent Cory Gardner\u2019s views on birth control and abortion.\n\nIn a recent interview, the former senator addressed his campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been criticized for not running a campaign that defended my brand and presented me as the authentic Coloradan I am, and I\u2019ve certainly thought a lot about that,\u201d Udall said.\n\n\u201cThe rationale was that by showing that Congressman Gardner had extreme positions on women\u2019s reproductive rights, people would see his other extreme positions. It didn\u2019t happen with those swing voters. So sometimes, late at night, I think perhaps it would\u2019ve been worthwhile running more ads extolling my successes and who I am, and how well I match up with the state.\u201d\n\nExactly. In fact, Gardner\u2019s campaign says the Udall ad that did well with its focus groups featured mountains, streams and Udall in a pair of blue jeans talking about \u201cwhat\u2019s in here\u201d as he tapped his heart. (Of course at the time, the Gardner campaign didn\u2019t mention that and just hammered the ad.)\n\nUdall lost to Gardner by 1.9 percentage points and now is a visiting fellow at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. He recently sat down with the university\u2019s The Gate.\n\nIn the interview, Udall lauded the type of campaign Gardner ran, explained why he voted against the war and his efforts on national security and said he was surprised to receive fewer votes in the red and rural counties than Democratic Senate candidate Michael Bennet did in 2010 \u201cbecause I\u2019m Colorado through and through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just thought in the end that Coloradans would see me as someone who reflected their Libertarian, pro-environment, fiscally responsible point of view,\u201d Udall said. \u201cBut there was a pent-up desire on the part of people in those counties and in the Republican Party to send a strong message to the president, and I was the way to do it.\u201d\n\nHe failed to mention that voters viewed Bennet\u2019s opponent, Ken Buck, as a flawed candidate who imploded in October while Gardner seemed to be the one catching the breaks in 2014.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cory Gardner,Ken Buck,Mark Udall,Michael Bennet,University of Chicago,University of Chicago Institute of Politics.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Former Sen.
