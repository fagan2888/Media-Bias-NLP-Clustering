Despite all the troubling job market trends you\u2019ve likely heard about and the nagging uncertainties you may still harbor as you begin your college career \u2014 at least after that hangover wears off \u2014 the degree you\u2019ve just started working toward will be worth around $300,000, according to researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nRelated: How Extended Unemployment Myths Hurt Millions of Jobless Americans\n\n\u201cTuition costs have been rising considerably faster than inflation, student debt is mounting, wages for college graduates have been falling, and recent college graduates have been struggling to find good jobs,\u201d Jaison R. Abel and Richard Deitz wrote in a four-part blog series last week. Despite those trends, though, they found that \u201cthe value of a bachelor\u2019s degree for the average graduate has held near its all-time high of about $300,000 for more than a decade.\u201d\n\nThe economists got to that figure by estimating the \u201caverage\u201d benefits and costs of a college degree, using the wages a college graduate can expect to earn over a lifetime of work and comparing that with the average tuition and fees paid by undergraduates and the estimated wages the students would have earned with only a high school diploma.\n\nMeasured another way, the economists say it takes about 10 years to recoup the costs of a bachelor\u2019s degree, a historically low level down from close to 25 years in the late 1970s and early \u201880s. \u201cSo despite the challenges facing today\u2019s college graduates,\u201d they write, \u201cthe value of a college degree has remained near its all-time high, while the time required to recoup the costs of the degree has remained near its all-time low.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Job Market\u2019s Hot Streak Is Over\u2026\n\nThat value still exists despite the rising cost of tuition, the dramatically increased levels of student debt and a depressing trendline in wages for college grads \u2014 but it\u2019s primarily because wages for high school grads have fallen, too. As the authors put it: \u201cthe value of a college degree has remained high over the past decade in large part because of the declining fortunes of those without one. Thus, while the challenges recent graduates have faced in finding a good job might mean that that a college degree will not be as lucrative as it once was, having one is likely to remain better than the alternative.\u201d\n\nEven so, the researchers find that college isn\u2019t necessarily a good financial investment for everyone. Based on the data, they find that \u201cperhaps a quarter of those who earn a bachelor\u2019s degree pay the costs to attend school but reap little, if any, economic benefit.\u201d On top of that, the job market for college grads has still not completely recovered. \u201cAll in all, while finding a job has become easier for recent college graduates over the past few years, finding a good job has not, and doing so is likely to remain a challenge for some time to come,\u201d the economists write.\n\nThe cost-benefit analysis for a college degree also shifts considerably when students take five or six years to get their diplomas instead of just four. \u201cIn addition to giving up one or two years of college-level earnings while in school, students miss out on a year or two of experience and the extra push that gives their wages over their working life,\u201d the economists explain. \u201cAll in all, an extra year of staying in school costs more than $85,000, and for those who take two extra years to finish, it costs about $174,000.\u201d\n\nSo, Class of 2018, get back to those books.\n\nTop Read from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Listen up, Class of 2018.
