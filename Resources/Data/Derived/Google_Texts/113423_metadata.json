But move off the coast, and the situation is quite different.\n\n\u201cThe Inland Empire and Sacramento Delta areas are growing at a sub-par rate,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile the East Bay and San Joaquin Valley as well as smaller rural counties in the north and east are showing little to negative growth.\u201d\n\nNickelsburg said traditional economic engines in inland areas, such as residential construction, manufacturing and government services, were not moving in a positive enough direction to provide \u201ceven a modicum of recovery in much of the state.\u201d\n\nHe noted that there are some bright spots, including the new medical school at UC Riverside, which \u201cwill begin to generate higher-education jobs as well as a cluster of health care-related jobs.\u201d\n\nOverall, the forecast calls for total employment growth of 2.4 percent this year, 1.5 percent next year and 2 percent in 2015. Unemployment is expected to continue falling for the rest of the year and hover around 8.2 percent in 2014.\n\nNationally, Senior Economist David Shulman wrote in his report that the U.S. economy was continuing to grow, in spite of \u201cself-inflicted wounds\u201d caused by the 16-day partial government shutdown and botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cAlthough real growth in the current quarter will likely be a modest 1.8 percent, we forecast that by the second quarter of next year, real GDP growth will be on a sustained 3 percent growth path,\u201d Shulman wrote.\n\nHe said the economy should add about 200,000 jobs per month, dropping the unemployment rate to about 6 percent by the end of 2015.\n\n\u201cAs long as the federal government does no harm, admittedly a dangerous assumption, the economy will be spurred by strength in housing and cars combined with an uptick in business spending and an end to the dramatic drop in federal purchases,\u201d Shulman wrote.\n\n\u201cPolicy interest rates will stay low throughout 2014, but with inflation rising to a bit above 2 percent, we expect that the zero interest rate policy of the Fed will come to an end in the spring of 2015.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While California overall has made a strong recovery from the national recession, that recovery has been sharply divided between thriving coastal areas and inland areas, which are still struggling to regain jobs, according to the year\u2019s final UC", "title": "California recovery split between coastal haves, inland have-nots", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/business/20131205/california-recovery-split-between-coastal-haves-inland-have-nots", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "California recovery split between coastal haves, inland have-nots"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "While California overall has made a strong recovery from the national recession, that recovery has been sharply divided between thriving coastal areas and inland areas, which are still struggling to regain jobs, according to the year\u2019s final UC", "title": "California recovery split between coastal haves, inland have-nots", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/business/20131205/california-recovery-split-between-coastal-haves-inland-have-nots", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews.png?052016"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "California,Economy, Economy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "California,Economy, Economy"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e48\"", "article_summary": "Senior Economist Jerry Nickelsburg wrote in his report on California that the gap between coastal and inland areas has continued to widen in recent months, with employment actually declining inland over the past year.\nWhile California overall has made a strong recovery from the national recession, that recovery has been sharply divided between thriving coastal areas and inland areas, which are still struggling to regain jobs, according to the year\u2019s final UCLA Anderson Forecast released Thursday.\n\u201cIndeed, Silicon Valley over the past 12 months generated payroll employment at twice the U.S. rate.\nHe said the economy should add about 200,000 jobs per month, dropping the unemployment rate to about 6 percent by the end of 2015.\n\u201cAlong the coast from Marin to San Diego, including a sliver of Los Angeles County known as Westside/Silicon Beach, California employment gains are outpacing the U.S.,\u201d Nickelsburg noted."}
