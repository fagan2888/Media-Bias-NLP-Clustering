Militants can be seen in the footage building the rocket launcher beneath a blue tent outside of the hotel.\n\nAdditional aerial satellite imagery released in the report shows that at least one rocket launcher was erected in a U.N.-operated elementary school for girls in Beit Lahiya.\n\nOther rocket launchers were shown to have been set-up at UNRWA\u2019s Shahada Al-Manar elementary school for boys, from which at least 11 mortars were fired on Aug. 2, according to satellite imagery.\n\nAnother rocket launching site was discovered at an UNRWA distribution center and health center in Gaza, according to video showing Hamas terrorists firing the rockets form the facility, which is located in a residential neighborhood.\n\nMultiple other images show scores of rocket launchers and combat posts placed in densely populated areas throughout Gaza in what the IDF refers to as a \u201cterror fortress.\u201d\n\nHamas also has been discovered to have fired rockets from inside the El\u2019 Ahzar Islamic College in Gaza, as well as the Abu Nur School, according to IDF military footage included in the report\n\n\u201cAnother one, another one from the school, launching from the school,\u201d an IDF soldier can be heard saying in the footage. \u201cI see the rocket launcher. Three more rocket[s] launched.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like the rocket launchers are inside the school,\u201d adds another soldier.\n\nHamas additionally stored rocket stockpiles and established military headquarters at mosques.\n\nSeveral of these mosques and civilian homes located nearby were used to conceal the entrances to Hamas\u2019 sophisticated network of underground tunnels, many of which have been destroyed by the IDF in the past weeks.\n\nOn July 30, Hamas began firing rockets from a Red Cross ambulance station, according to the report.\n\nRocket launchers also were found to have been strategically placed around the Wafa Hospital in Gaza.\n\nIDF footage also shows Hamas militants using an ambulance as a getaway vehicle after firing rockets from a house.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Intel: Hamas fired rockets from U.N. schools, Red Cross stations, playgrounds, hospitals", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A declassified intelligence report released by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) this week showed Hamas terrorists have been firing rockets at Israel from heavily populated civilian areas, including ch", "title": "Report Details Hamas\u2019 Responsibility for Destruction of Gaza Strip", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/report-details-hamas-responsibility-for-destruction-of-gaza-strip/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rockets-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A declassified intelligence report released by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) this week showed Ham", "title": "Report Details Hamas\u2019 Responsibility for Destruction of Gaza Strip", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rockets-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@Kredo0", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5c86\"", "article_summary": "The IDF maintained that Hamas is chiefly responsible for the destruction of civilian areas in the Gaza Strip.\nIDF footage also shows Hamas militants using an ambulance as a getaway vehicle after firing rockets from a house.\nRocket launchers also were found to have been strategically placed around the Wafa Hospital in Gaza.\nOn July 30, Hamas began firing rockets from a Red Cross ambulance station, according to the report.\n\u201cHamas\u2019 tactics flagrantly violate international law and the most basic moral precepts,\u201d the IDF stated in the report."}
