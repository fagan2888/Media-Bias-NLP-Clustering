Field trips to the Tennessee governor’s executive residence have resumed, offering students a history lesson and hands-on tour.

First Lady Crissy Haslam hosted 40 students from Springfield this week on a vist that included a chance for students to work in the garden and learn about sustainability and healthy meal preparation from Tennessee Residence Chef Stephen Ward.

The three-story home was completed in 1931 and became the governor’s home in 1949. Nine governors and their families have lived there.

Tours of the mansion, at 882 Curtiswood Lane South, must be scheduled at least two weeks in advance. For more information visit www.tn.gov/firstlady.

Free public tours — advanced registrations required — are available on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.
