While the sur\u00advey found sub\u00adstan\u00adtial con\u00adver\u00adgence between whites and minor\u00adit\u00adies on some fronts, it also un\u00adder\u00adscored the con\u00adsist\u00adent tend\u00adency of minor\u00adit\u00adies to sup\u00adport a more act\u00adiv\u00adist role for Wash\u00ading\u00adton than many whites now prefer.\n\nThe gap was starkest on health care. Both whites and non\u00adwhites were du\u00adbi\u00adous of Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan threats to shut down the fed\u00ader\u00adal gov\u00adern\u00adment, or de\u00adfault on the na\u00adtion\u00adal debt, if Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama does not agree to delay or de\u00adfund his health re\u00adform plan. But minor\u00adit\u00adies were es\u00adpe\u00adcially res\u00adist\u00adant. While 33 per\u00adcent of whites said Con\u00adgress should with\u00adhold fund\u00ading if Obama won\u2019t shelve the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act, only 16 per\u00adcent of minor\u00adit\u00adies agreed. And while whites di\u00advided re\u00adl\u00adat\u00adively closely on wheth\u00ader Con\u00adgress should raise the debt lim\u00adit only if Obama con\u00adcedes on health care \u2014 36 per\u00adcent said yes and 48 per\u00adcent said no \u2014 non\u00adwhites stam\u00adpeded against the idea by ex\u00adactly 3-to-1. Minor\u00adit\u00adies were also far more likely than whites (53 per\u00adcent to 33 per\u00adcent) to say they would blame Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans if a shut\u00addown oc\u00adcurs.\n\nThe con\u00adtrast was even lar\u00adger on the un\u00adder\u00adly\u00ading is\u00adsue of the health care law it\u00adself. A 51 per\u00adcent ma\u00adjor\u00adity of whites agreed that \u201cCon\u00adgress should re\u00adpeal the pro\u00adgram to ex\u00adpand cov\u00ader\u00adage be\u00adcause the gov\u00adern\u00adment can\u2019t af\u00adford it at a time of large budget de\u00adfi\u00adcits,\u201d while only 43 per\u00adcent said \u201cCon\u00adgress should keep the pro\u00adgram to ex\u00adpand cov\u00ader\u00adage be\u00adcause it\u2019s im\u00adport\u00adant to re\u00adduce the num\u00adber of Amer\u00adic\u00adans without health in\u00adsur\u00adance.\u201d Minor\u00adit\u00adies, by com\u00adpar\u00adis\u00adon, broke 2-to-1 in fa\u00advor of the health care law: 62 per\u00adcent said it was more im\u00adport\u00adant to ex\u00adpand cov\u00ader\u00adage, while only 31 per\u00adcent backed re\u00adpeal.\n\nAll of this re\u00adin\u00adforces poll res\u00adults from Ju\u00adly in which only 27 per\u00adcent of whites, but ex\u00adactly twice as large a share of minor\u00adit\u00adies (54 per\u00adcent), said the law would be\u00adne\u00adfit \u201cpeople like you and your fam\u00adily.\u201d In that sur\u00advey, just 16 per\u00adcent of minor\u00adit\u00adies urged the law\u2019s re\u00adpeal, com\u00adpared with 44 per\u00adcent of whites. As The Wash\u00ading\u00adton Post\u2018s Greg Sar\u00adgent noted this week, oth\u00ader polls have re\u00adcor\u00added a sim\u00adil\u00adar dis\u00adpar\u00adity. These at\u00adti\u00adtudes re\u00adflect the un\u00adder\u00adly\u00ading real\u00adity that Afric\u00adan-Amer\u00adic\u00adans and His\u00adpan\u00adics were nearly twice and three times re\u00adspect\u00adively as likely as whites to lack health in\u00adsur\u00adance, as the Census Bur\u00adeau re\u00adpor\u00adted earli\u00ader this month.\n\nOn gun vi\u00adol\u00adence, the United Tech\u00adno\u00adlo\u00adgies/Na\u00adtion\u00adal Journ\u00adal Con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Con\u00adnec\u00adtion Poll found broad pub\u00adlic sup\u00adport that tran\u00adscen\u00added ra\u00adcial, and in most cases par\u00adtis\u00adan, lines for an all-of-the-above ap\u00adproach that in\u00adcluded ideas tra\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adally favored by both the Left and the Right. Ma\u00adjor\u00adit\u00adies of those sur\u00adveyed said each of six ap\u00adproaches tested \u201cwould have a ser\u00adi\u00adous im\u00adpact in re\u00addu\u00adcing mass shoot\u00adings.\u201d\n\nBut minor\u00adit\u00adies em\u00adbraced all of the ideas even more em\u00adphat\u00adic\u00adally than whites, with the gap es\u00adpe\u00adcially pro\u00adnounced on ini\u00adti\u00adat\u00adives top\u00adping the pri\u00ador\u00adity list for gun-con\u00adtrol ad\u00advoc\u00adates. While whites split fairly closely on wheth\u00ader ban\u00adning as\u00adsault weapons could ser\u00adi\u00adously re\u00adduce mass shoot\u00adings (53 per\u00adcent said yes, while 45 per\u00adcent said no), minor\u00adit\u00adies were un\u00adequi\u00advoc\u00adal: 68 per\u00adcent thought a ban would help, while only 29 per\u00adcent dis\u00adagreed. Just 47 per\u00adcent of whites, com\u00adpared with 67 per\u00adcent of non\u00adwhites, thought that lim\u00adit\u00ading the size of am\u00admuni\u00adtion clips would help. (While half of whites thought such lim\u00adits would not have much im\u00adpact, only one-third of minor\u00adit\u00adies agreed.) There was broad\u00ader agree\u00adment on the value of \u201cback\u00adground checks for all leg\u00adal gun trans\u00adfers, in\u00adclud\u00ading those between private in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adals,\u201d but minor\u00adit\u00adies were par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly en\u00adthu\u00adsi\u00adast\u00adic: Fully 84 per\u00adcent of them said it would have an im\u00adpact, while 72 per\u00adcent of whites agreed.\n\nThis ra\u00adcial gap per\u00adsisted, but only with\u00adin single di\u00adgits on ap\u00adproaches to gun vi\u00adol\u00adence mostly pro\u00admoted by con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives: minor\u00adit\u00adies were slightly more likely than whites to con\u00adsider it pos\u00adsible to re\u00adduce mass shoot\u00adings through more men\u00adtal-health ser\u00advices, tough\u00ader en\u00adforce\u00adment of ex\u00adist\u00ading gun laws, and more armed guards at schools and oth\u00ader pub\u00adlic places. Asked what would do the most to re\u00adduce mass shoot\u00adings, a plur\u00adal\u00adity of minor\u00adit\u00adies picked back\u00adground checks, fol\u00adlowed by bet\u00adter men\u00adtal health ser\u00advices, and then a tie between the as\u00adsault-weapon ban and more armed guards. Whites ranked as their pref\u00ader\u00adences more men\u00adtal health ser\u00advices, back\u00adground checks, more armed guards, and tough\u00ader en\u00adforce\u00adment of ex\u00adist\u00ading gun laws.\n\nOth\u00ader fis\u00adsures mat\u00adter too in shap\u00ading at\u00adti\u00adtudes to\u00adward gun vi\u00adol\u00adence: As the sur\u00advey re\u00adaf\u00adfirmed, wo\u00admen are con\u00adsist\u00adently more likely to sup\u00adport gun-con\u00adtrol meas\u00adures than men. But the ra\u00adcial con\u00adtrasts in at\u00adti\u00adtudes loom as an even more power\u00adful force in Amer\u00adic\u00adan polit\u00adics \u2014 es\u00adpe\u00adcially after an elec\u00adtion in which sup\u00adport from four-fifths of minor\u00adity voters al\u00adlowed Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama to tri\u00adumph des\u00adpite los\u00ading white voters by fully 20 per\u00adcent\u00adage points, a much wider de\u00adfi\u00adcit than any pre\u00advi\u00adous win\u00adning can\u00addid\u00adate.\n\nThe poll, con\u00adduc\u00adted by Prin\u00adceton Sur\u00advey Re\u00adsearch As\u00adso\u00adci\u00adates In\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtion\u00adal from Sept. 19-22, in\u00adter\u00adviewed 1,003 adults over land\u00adline and cell phones.
