Under India\u2019s patent laws, if a product is not available at an affordable price, local companies may apply for a compulsory license to reproduce these products at a lower price.\n\nIn India, Nexavar costs $69,000 for a full year of treatment; that\u2019s 41 times more than India\u2019s annual per capita income.\n\nIf Nexavar cost 41 times the per capita income of the United States, it would cost $1.6 million\u2013yes, million\u2013for a full year of treatment.\n\nThe Indian pharmaceutical company Natco Pharma Ltd was granted the license to reproduce the drug in India in 2012. They have managed to make it available at a 97% discounted rate; it now costs only $177 instead of $69,000.\n\n\u201cWe did not develop this medicine for Indians\u2026we developed it for western patients who can afford it,\u201d said Dekkers in the December interview. He says that this is \u201cessentially theft.\u201d\n\nNo, Mr. Dekkers: What your company is doing is essentially theft; it\u2019s highway robbery.\n\nBayer is appealing the ruling in court, saying it needs the revenue to fund research for new drugs. Yet they refuse to provide the costs of research and development for Nexavar\u2013some of which was offset by subsidies from the United States government.\n\nOne would think that if the cost of Bayer\u2019s investment actually justified what appears to be an astronomical sense of greed, Bayer wouldn\u2019t have an issue with transparency, and publicize the costs, to prove their point as to why this pricey pill needs to remain so pricey.\n\nBut, they don\u2019t.\n\nDekkers\u2019 comments reflect not only a disregard for the poor of India, but also a dismissal of the poor here in the Western world who can\u2019t afford the costly drug.\n\nWhile there certainly are some \u201cWesterners who can afford it,\u201d there are millions upon millions who can\u2019t.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, for example, the National Health Service (NHS) is unable to offer Nexavar because it costs around \u00a33,000 GBP\u2013that\u2019s $5, 187 USD\u2013a month. There is no generic equivalent.\n\nIn the United States, Nexavar costs about $96,000 for a full year of treatment. Insurance picks up the majority of the tab, so Bayer has ever so kindly ensured that insured patients have only a $100 monthly co-pay.\n\nYet with some 55 million people uninsured prior to Obamacare and projections estimating there will still be at least\u2013at minimum\u201330 million or more uninsured after, Dekker\u2019s callous comments about the poor of India should send a chill down your spine.\n\nLike the United Kingdom, the United States has no generic version available. Bayer has exclusive rights and patents to it so there\u2019s no way a generic could become available without Bayer\u2019s consent, which obviously wouldn\u2019t be given.\n\nBayer does have a patient assistance program in the United States. A similar patient assistance program was developed in India in 2008; it obviously provided little to no assistance because despite its advent, only 2% of the patient population was able to obtain Nexavar.\n\nIf it can be reproduced so cheaply in India\u2013while Natco is still pulling what is reported to be a 30% profit margin and Bayer is still being a paid a mandatory 6% royalties\u2013why then, can it not be done here?\n\nBecause big pharma is all about the Benjamins, baby.\n\nSources: Forbes, thinkprogress.org, BBC\n\nApril Dawn (@scarlettsinatra)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://thesource.com/2014/01/26/big-pharma-ceo-cancer-drug-is-only-for-westerners-who-can-afford-it/", "site_name": "The Source", "image": "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/How-to-Get-Free-Prescription-Drugs-Low-Cost-Prescription-Medication.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Big Pharma CEO:  Cancer Drug is Only For Westerners Who Can Afford It"}, "article": {"tag": "d.r.u.g.s.", "published_time": "2014-01-26", "modified_time": "2014-03-15", "author": "http://thesource.com/author/aprilricchuito/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Big Pharma CEO: Cancer Drug is Only For Westerners Who Can Afford ItBig Pharma CEO: Cancer Drug is Only For Westerners Who Can Afford ItYour favorite rapper\u2019s bankroll has nothing on big pharma.\nIn India, Nexavar costs $69,000 for a full year of treatment; that\u2019s 41 times more than India\u2019s annual per capita income.\nIn the United States, Nexavar costs about $96,000 for a full year of treatment.\nLike the United Kingdom, the United States has no generic version available.\nThe Indian pharmaceutical company Natco Pharma Ltd was granted the license to reproduce the drug in India in 2012."}
