The summit invited what WhiteHouse.gov calls "160 of this country's finest national and local leaders aged 18-35" to discuss Obamacare with White House and administration staff.

A White House youth summit advised young people that they need to enroll in Obamacare in case they break their arm at a "YOLO party."

"Maybe you just had the YOLO party of your life and you stood up on the table that night and the table collapsed beneath you and you fell down and you broke your arm," panelist Anton Gunn, the 2008 political director for President Obama's primary campaign in South Carolina, said, according to an article in Red Alert Politics. "Well, a broken limb can cost you $7,500 if you don't have health insurance."

"It protects you from major out-of-pocket costs if something goes wrong, if you get sick or maybe if you party a little too hard," he continued.
