But how can you stop them if you don\u2019t know they\u2019re inside?\n\nThis is one of the key questions facing private companies and government agencies as hackers evade detection in computer systems around the world.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCyber criminals can easily avoid discovery for weeks or months while harvesting valuable data from a compromised computer network.\n\nThe task of finding \u2014 let alone expelling \u2014 unauthorized users is a major challenge that often catches companies off guard.\n\n\u201cNinety-nine percent of the time when we\u2019re deployed into a network, we find something bad that is already taking place,\u201d said Jasper Graham, a former technical director with the National Security Agency who is now a senior vice president at the cybersecurity software firm Darktrace.\n\n\u201cOnce, we got deployed into a bank [as a preventive measure]. Within about a week, after all our models were built, we noticed some really strange behavior happening on their servers,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt turns out that there was a whole bitcoin operation being run out of the bank.\u201d\n\nThe cybersecurity consulting world is replete with similar stories, underscoring the ease with which hackers can break into corporate networks and hide there.\n\nOften, companies do not realize they have been hacked until they receive an alert from the FBI, private researchers or even the hackers themselves.\n\nIn 2013, hackers went unnoticed in Target\u2019s network for several weeks and stole 40 million credit card numbers despite reported warnings from anti-hacking software.\n\nLast year, a data breach at JPMorgan that affected 76 million households went unnoticed for two months before the company realized it was hit.\n\nThe hack of Sony Pictures provides the clearest example: According to reports, it is possible the studio\u2019s networks were compromised for more than a year before hackers revealed their presence on Nov. 24.\n\nWith typical flourish, the intruders flashed a disturbing image on Sony employees\u2019 computer screens, one of the first signs there had been a break-in.\n\nBen Johnson, chief security strategist with cyber firm Bit9 + Carbon Black, said the problem lies partially in understaffed and overwhelmed IT departments around the country.\n\n\u201cEven advanced IT teams still have humans investigating upwards of 30 or 50 alerts a day, and that is after they\u2019ve weeded out millions of other potentially harmful events through automated means,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThreat hunting, risk hunting, is so rare because teams are just swamped.\u201d\n\nSecurity researcher and consultant Matthew Harmon agreed, estimating that a big company might generate hundreds of thousands if not millions of pages of system logs for administrators to weed through on a regular basis.\n\n\u201cWe are grossly outmanned and grossly underfunded,\u201d said Harmon, a principal consultant with IT Risk Limited. \u201cThe job of defenders is far more difficult than the job of attackers.\u201d\n\nCompanies are beginning to wise up to the threat posed by cyber criminals as hacks litter the headlines.\n\nBut the recent spate of attacks exposes the rudimentary nature of the cybersecurity systems that many firms currently use as protection.\n\nMost involve scanning for known pieces of malicious code, the so-called signature-based approach by which software blocks known viruses.\n\nThe problem is, hacking evolves much more quickly than most software used to fight it.\n\n\u201cWe know now that [signature-based] systems are clearly ineffective,\u201d said Tim Ryan, managing director with risk consulting firm Kroll \u2014 a former supervisory special agent with the FBI.\n\n\u201cThe virus writers deploy their software knowing full well that anything they deploy will be scanned by anti-virus programs. So they obscure the signature to make it look like it\u2019s something else.\u201d\n\nThe problem arguably gets worse once a hacker is inside the network and can obtain valid user credentials to break in again and again disguised as company personnel.\n\nAs a result, the image of a hacker as a thief crossing a fence vastly understates the problem, experts said.\n\n\u201cHackers are like burglars, but worse,\u201d said Nicholas Oldham, a former federal prosecutor who now counsels cyber clients at King & Spalding.\n\n\u201cThey put their gloves on, they put their dark clothes on, and they use their tools to get inside the network, but unlike traditional burglars they might be able to steal digital loot without anyone even knowing the loot is gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople ask: Why didn\u2019t the company catch the hackers sooner? But they often don\u2019t appreciate that the person hacking is taking every defensive measure possible not to get caught. It\u2019s sometimes amazing that companies are able to catch them as quickly as they do.\u201d\n\n\u2014This post was updated at 9:11 a.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Cyber criminals can easily avoid discovery for weeks or months.", "description": "Cyber criminals can easily avoid discovery for weeks or months.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Elise Viebeck", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Cyber criminals can easily avoid discovery for weeks or months.", "title": "Cyberattackers: The invisible enemy", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/234380-cyberattackers-the-invisible-enemy", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/hacker_gettyimages.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/234380-cyberattackers-the-invisible-enemy", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-02T19:01-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Meghashyam Mali", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-02T19:01:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/234380-cyberattackers-the-invisible-enemy", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Cyber criminals can easily avoid discovery for weeks or months.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cyberattackers: The invisible enemy"}, "dcterms.title": "Cyberattackers: The invisible enemy"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcacb9\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTCyber criminals can easily avoid discovery for weeks or months while harvesting valuable data from a compromised computer network.\nThis is one of the key questions facing private companies and government agencies as hackers evade detection in computer systems around the world.\nThe task of finding \u2014 let alone expelling \u2014 unauthorized users is a major challenge that often catches companies off guard.\nIt\u2019s sometimes amazing that companies are able to catch them as quickly as they do.\u201d\u2014This post was updated at 9:11 a.m.\nBut they often don\u2019t appreciate that the person hacking is taking every defensive measure possible not to get caught."}
