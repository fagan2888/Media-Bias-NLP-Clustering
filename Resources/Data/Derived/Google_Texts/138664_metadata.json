Here it is, the ICD 10.\n\nThe new International Classification for Disease (ICD), the implementation of which started with October 1st, comes as a much-needed revision of the ICD 9, standing as the reference medical coding and billing system since 1978. The efforts to redefine the ICD have been ongoing for years.\n\nNow, they have been sent out to healthcare providers and insurance companies across the U.S. The ICD 10 is a peculiar new coding system that leaves many wary of its implementation, albeit the noticeable benefits it brings about.\n\nMedical providers are swamped in implementing the newly designed codes, the number of which increased considerably. Insurance companies complain of a similar situation. Patients worry about their medical bills going higher, as well as an exponential increase in the time needed until they receive medical care or are able to submit their insurance claims.\n\nTo unwind for a while, consider a few of the new codes that must be filled accordingly by medical practitioners and insurers alike. We now have a specific code that pinpoints a \u2018burn due to water skis on fire\u2019. This is code V91.07XA. We also have the code Z63.1 which, scribbled in one\u2019s medical record designated \u2018problems in the relationship with in-laws\u2019.\n\nBack to more serious concerns, the ICD 10, albeit in its first few days of implementation, is causing havoc for many healthcare providers across the U.S. The ICD 10 requires a strict, very specific and lengthy coding procedure that needs to reflect the billing purposes as well. There are over 140,000 new codes included in the ICD 10, of which codes that identify injuries or diseases represent 70,000. Many are asking if the change was necessary.\n\nAccording to the Health Information Management officials, the timing couldn\u2019t be better. Since 1978, a number of new diseases and new treatments have been left uncoded. As such, the ICD 10 is nothing but a helpful tool to ease the workload once everyone gets on board and accustomed to the new coding and billing system.\n\nAccording to Chris Miles, the senior VP of Aon Hewitt health group:\n\n\u201cTransferring to the new medical claim codes will allow key industry stakeholders to better track and manage diseases, measure the quality of care and evaluate patient outcomes \u2013 all of which support the shift toward value-based payment plans\u201d.\n\nHowever, Doctor Halee Fischer-Wright, who is the president and CEO of the Medical Group Management Association worries that the implementation of the ICD 10 has caught many unprepared. The results of one survey indicates that over 20 percent of medical offices aren\u2019t informed about the updates in view of billing purposes.\n\nThis could turn into serious added pressure on patients\u2019 insurance claims. Private insurance companies are also unaccustomed to the ICD 10. When processing patients\u2019 claims, all paperwork must coincide with that from the healthcare provider.\n\nCurrently, insurance companies such as Humana, UnitedHealth Group, Cigna, Aetna or Anthem have reported extra expenditures in view of alignment with the new medical coding and billing system.\n\nPhoto Credits: Flickr", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the introduction of Obamacare in 2014, it was announced that a new medical coding and billing system will be duly set in place.
