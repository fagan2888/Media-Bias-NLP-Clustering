Scalise, the No. 3 House Republican, doesn't have any declared opponents, and he won't face voters in his deeply conservative district for another nine-plus months. Still, Scalise's campaign launched a radio ad hyping his role fighting Obamacare.\u201d More here: http://politico.pro/1PfcQHb\n\nFIRST IN SCORE \u2014 Burr brings in $817,000: North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr raised $817,000 in the fourth quarter, a drop from the last quarter, when he brought in $1.3 million, according to Burr\u2019s campaign. He ended the year with $5.3 million in cash on hand. Overall, Burr did well in 2015, even though he\u2019s not known for his fundraising prowess. He\u2019s picked up three Democratic challengers, though, including former state Rep. Deborah Ross, who just got the backing of EMILY\u2019s List. Ross hasn\u2019t released her fundraising totals yet.\n\nFOUR MORE YEARS? \u2014 Walker fundraising email hints at 2018 reelection run: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker indicated he would run for reelection in 2018 in a fundraising email on Monday. \"Our re-election campaign may seem like a long way off but the other side is already gearing up for a bruising battle,\" Walker wrote. Walker, whose approval ratings sank in his state as he ran for president, has already won three governor's races: his initial victory in 2010, a 2012 recall, and his 2014 reelection. While the email is far from an official declaration, it's the strongest hint yet Walker may run for a third term. The message sought help retiring the federal campaign debt Walker accumulated during his presidential run.

His primary opponent, Alan Grayson, hasn't released numbers yet. http://bit.ly/1OEYQRa\n\nRUNNING WITH SANDERS \u2014 Down-ballot Democrats warn against Bernie at the top of the ticket: Some Democrats have started highlighting Bernie Sanders' socialist beliefs as he continues to ride high in the polls, warning \"that he would be an electoral disaster who would frighten swing voters and send Democrats in tight congressional and governor\u2019s races to defeat,\" The New York Times' Jonathan Martin reports. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be helpful outside Vermont, Massachusetts, Berkeley, Palo Alto and Ann Arbor,\u201d Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) said. \u201cI can tell you, as somebody who ran the Democratic Governors Association, that candidates in purple states would face serious problems with him on top of the ticket,\u201d Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware added. http://nyti.ms/1OvCLa7\n\n** A message from Sinclair Broadcast Group: Sinclair Broadcast Group, the largest and most diversified television broadcasting company in the country today, delivers not only TV, the primary medium for reaching potential voters, but also targetable digital (mobile, video, email, social media and native) ad solutions.

Sinclair, busy - Making Political Ads Work! **\n\nPRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ \u2014 \"Palin scores moment in Trump's spotlight,\" by POLITICO's Ben Schreckinger: \"Sarah Palin\u2019s Tuesday endorsement of Donald Trump was a big get \u2014 for Sarah Palin. Conservative observers questioned just how many votes the endorsement, teased with great fanfare by Trump\u2019s campaign, would move. But it undoubtedly generated buzz and thrust the former Alaska governor in the national spotlight at a time when her star power has been on the wane.\" And Palin has positioned herself to benefit from it. \"Just as her endorsement became public on Tuesday, she updated her Facebook page with a new cover photo promoting Sarah PAC. The group is currently accepting donations.\" http://politi.co/1OvjG7X\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe hole in Bernie Sanders\u2019 Iowa strategy,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti in Underwood, Iowa: \u201cBernie Sanders\u2019 Iowa rise is powered in part by the college towns where he\u2019s killing it in the progressive communities clustered around some of state\u2019s biggest universities. But that won\u2019t be enough for him to carry Iowa in the Feb. 1 caucuses, which explains why the senator who describes himself as a Democratic socialist spent Tuesday in some of the most conservative territory in the state. His goal was simple: to shore up support in rural western Iowa amid concerns that statewide polls are masking a potential geographical vulnerability.\u201d http://politi.co/1OEC1NI\n\n\u2014 \"Ted Cruz finds eager religious audience in moderate New Hampshire,\" by POLITICO's Katie Glueck in Plymouth, N.H.: Ted Cruz is going heavy on the Bible verses as he campaigns here. \"He isn\u2019t roaring like a preacher here the way he does in Iowa and South Carolina, but the religious rhetoric is virtually the same\u2014and it plays well with a small but increasingly committed group of Christian conservative voters who appreciate the emphasis on faith, or at a minimum aren\u2019t bothered by it.\" http://politi.co/1NjSvJg\n\n\u2014 \u201cUnorthodox playbook is aiding GOP candidate John Kasich,\u201d by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Reid J. Epstein in Lebanon, N.H.: Could John Kasich take second place \u2014 or even win \u2014 in New Hampshire? Kasich has come in second to Donald Trump in each of five public polls in the past month by appealing to the opposite of the kind of voters who back Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not sugarcoating anything, but I\u2019m not walking in there as the prince of darkness,\u201d Kasich told The Journal. \u201cI\u2019d rather be the prince of light, the prince of hope.\u201d Asked by a voter on Tuesday about how he would go about deporting illegal immigrants, Kasich was blunt. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t, OK?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not practical and we\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1SvBUdj\n\nIN MEMORIAM \u2014 Young Carson volunteer dies after car crash: A volunteer on Ben Carson's campaign succumbed to injuries sustained in a car accident on an icy Iowa road earlier Tuesday,\" POLITICO's Kyle Cheney and David Cohen report. \"The volunteer, 25-year-old Braden Joplin, died late Tuesday afternoon at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Three others in the Carson van were injured in the Interstate 80 crash near Atlantic, Iowa. According to Carson's campaign, they were all treated at a nearby Iowa hospital and released.\" http://politi.co/1JgqQhl\n\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cIn hindsight, a few of the thoughts I shared, while well-intended, may have come across as more motherly than what they would expect from their state representative.\u201d \u2014 GOP state Rep. Mary Dye of Washington State, who asked a group of high school students on Monday whether they \u201cwere virgins and suggested one was not,\u201d The Seattle Times reports. http://bit.ly/20bEwhI\n\n** A message from Sinclair Broadcast Group: The race for influence in the 2016 election cycle is gaining speed.
