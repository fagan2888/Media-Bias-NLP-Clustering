(Nichole Stevens Photo)</p>\n\nBy Nichole Stevens\n\nFried Liver Attack, Two Knights Defense and Poisoned Pawn Variation. Just a short list of many strategies used when playing chess.\n\nWhether these terms are new to you or you\u2019re a seasoned chess player, you\u2019re invited to \u201cChess in the Park\u201d at Krutch Park, said Michael Moore, its founder. The first of soon-to-be-more gatherings kicked off Saturday from 9 a.m.-2 p.m. and attracted a crowd.\n\nMoore said the game promotes memory retention, cognitive skills and forward-thinking habits. He enjoys playing for mental benefits and socialization.\n\nThe idea for Chess in the Park stemmed from the success of Saint Luke\u2019s Episcopal Church on South Chestnut Street in East Knox County.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to have a camp that would attract youngsters,\u201d said Rev. James Anderson, Rector for the church.\n\nThe church worked with Moore to provide a three-week-long camp in July for local children to come together in a safe place and socialize while sharpening mental skills and having fun. Anderson said the church liked Moore\u2019s suggestion for a chess camp because it offered an alternative to sports-related camps. The camp had about 30 kids playing the game, Anderson said.\n\nAfter seeing the success of the camp, Moore contacted the city\u2019s Office of Special Events to coordinate Chess in the Park as a way to invite the public to play.\n\nHe likened chess to riding a bike.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about memorization and repeat,\u201d Moore said. \u201c[The player\u2019s] mind gets used to certain movements on the board.\u201d\n\nAfter taking a hiatus from the game, Moore said he decided to pick it back up by playing online, but it\u2019s not the same as playing with others in person.\n\n\u201cIf you play against the computer, there\u2019s no margin for error,\u201d said Moore. \u201cPlaying people, like in the park, there are emotions that go into it. Instead of just moving pieces, now it\u2019s moving pieces that have a purpose.\u201d\n\nThere is a variety of different strategies and styles each player brings to game, he said. Some players are quick and aggressive, while others can be slow and methodical.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many good players in Knoxville,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of his ultimate goals for hosting Chess in the Park is for the city to invest in permanent chess tables in the park. Moore has traveled for matches, and mentioned a recent trip to Raleigh, N.C., where the matches were held at parks with fixed tables.\n\nHe and Anderson have a simple goal: to get more people in the community involved in one of the oldest games in history.", "article_metadata": {"title": "First \u00e2\u0080\u0098Chess in the Park' attracts crowd to Krutch Park", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/first-chess-in-the-park-attracts-crowd-to-krutch-park-ep-599101750-354313441.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/chesspic2_7785132_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 427}, "type": "article", "description": "Public turns out for first 'Chess in the Park' gathering at Krutch Park Saturday.
