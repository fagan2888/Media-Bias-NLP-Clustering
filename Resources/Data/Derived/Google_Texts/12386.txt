On Tuesday, Google released its annual "Zeitgeist" lists, running down the top search terms in the U.S. this past year. These end-of-year lists offer a raw peek at what's really on Americans' minds when they sit down in front of Google's nonjudgmental search bar.

The results are not pretty.

The most Googled question beginning with "What is" was...

"What is twerking?"

The most Googled person was...

Miley Cyrus

The most Googled song was..

"Harlem Shake"

The most Googled annual event was..

Black Friday

The Instagram video above was taken at a Walmart in Johnson City, Tenn. this Black Friday.

The most Googled college or university was...

The University of Phoenix

The online university does not, in fact, have its own football team. It did however buy the naming rights to the Arizona Cardinals' stadium.

This is America, unfiltered.
