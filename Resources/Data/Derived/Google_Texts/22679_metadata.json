Mitt Romney (R-MA), the 2012 Republican nominee, will enter into the already crowded field for the GOP\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIngraham argued such sentiments show a lack in the so-called GOP establishment recognizing the message of the grassroots and others in this current election cycle.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows I like Mitt Romney and I mean he\u2019s a wonderful person, a wonderful man \u2013 a good man,\u201d Ingraham said. \u201cBut we have to have now at this point conclude he was not the best campaigner. And yet today in the face of all of this polling, in all of the clear message from independents and GOP grassroots that the establishment has failed, we want a new path forward. We want something a little more nationalist when it comes to economics, a little more prudent when it comes to foreign policy, a little fairer when it comes to trade policy.\u201d\n\nShe went on to accuse National Review of \u201cpropping up\u201d the GOP establishment and later attack the publication\u2019s senior editor Ramesh Ponnuru.\n\n\u201cWhat the establishment is doing is looking for a way to go backward,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis piece about Mitt Romney today in National Review \u2013 National Review, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to National Review, but this is not the publication of William F. Buckley. This is the publication that is propping up the establishment all too often.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to say even yesterday on this show, our pal Bill Kristol, he\u2019s actually done recently some pretty fair analysis of where we are in the Republican field and they\u2019ve written some good pieces over there at The Weekly Standard,\u201d Ingraham added later in the segment. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly not in a frothy frenzy like they are over at National Review like they are about Trump. I mean, they are so worried about Trump over there at National Review. Someone should check on Ramesh Ponnuru \u2013 I\u2019m worried. Ramesh likes Jeb. A lot of these guys over there just like Jeb.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ingraham Rips Nat\u2019l Review for Pro-GOPe Tone Deafness: \u2018Not the Publication of William F.
