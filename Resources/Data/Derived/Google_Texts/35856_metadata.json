Megabus is a subsidiary of Coach USA, based in Paramus, New Jersey.\n\nIn October, at least a dozen people suffered injuries ranging from cuts to broken bones when a Megabus traveling on the same route flipped on its side. The driver had lost control while trying to avoid the site of another crash.\n\n(Reporting by Laila Kearney; editing by Ellen Wulfhorst and G Crosse)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "More than two dozen people were injured on Saturday when a commercial passenger bus traveling to Atlanta from Chicago crashed in Indiana, officials said.", "title": "Megabus rollover in Indiana injures at least 28", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, USA, INDIANA, MEGABUS", "sailthru.title": "Megabus rollover in Indiana injures at least 28", "keywords": "US,USA,INDIANA,MEGABUS,Indiana,United States,General News,Ground Accidents / Collisions,Disasters / Accidents,Highways and Rail Tracks (TRBC),Illinois,Georgia", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;USA;INDIANA;MEGABUS;Indiana;United States;General News;Ground Accidents / Collisions;Disasters / Accidents;Highways and Rail Tracks (TRBC);Illinois;Georgia", "WT.cg_n": "World", "DCSext.ContentID_domesticNews": "USKBN0JY0KY20141220", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "domesticNews", "sailthru.date": "2014-12-20T19:15:37+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "domesticNews;Travel;Inspiration;everything;treasuryMarkets;Shell;Verizon;Amtrak;yahoo3;VerizonMap;echoActivityStream;Boston;Suntrust_SmallBiz;AllianzInvestments;HSBC_US;TDAmeritrade;FedExSMB;Goldman;everythingButHugin;SprintNow;AXAinsurance;OutloudFeed;Allianz;JPMorgan;CFA;sapawarenesstech;sapawarenesslife;jpGambaroPeople;nyse;MastercardTravel;sprintxpert2;statestreetetf;samsung;asia;Pfizersafe;cfaglobal;merrilledge;nonegative;airline;PrudentialInvestments;MLGZero;PorscheCayenne;ubs;MLedge;BNY;citgroup;Intel;BNYForesight;PFG;TCS_IN;ABG_IN", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Megabus+rollover+in+Indiana+injures+at+least+28", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKBN0JY0KY20141220", "WT.cg_s": "U.S", "description": "More than two dozen people were injured on Saturday when a commercial passenger bus traveling to Atlanta from Chicago crashed in Indiana, officials said.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "sailthru.description": "More than two dozen people were injured on Saturday when a commercial passenger bus traveling to Atlanta from Chicago crashed in Indiana, officials said.", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Editorial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/us/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-domesticNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "More than two dozen people were injured on Saturday when a commercial passenger bus traveling to Atlanta from Chicago crashed in Indiana, officials said.", "title": "Megabus rollover in Indiana injures at least 28", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-indiana-megabus-idUSKBN0JY0KY20141220", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,USA,INDIANA,MEGABUS,Indiana,United States,General News,Ground Accidents / Collisions,Disasters / Accidents,Highways and Rail Tracks (TRBC),Illinois,Georgia", "published_time": "2014-12-20T19:15:37+0000", "modified_time": "2014-12-20T19:15:37+0000", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Sat Dec 20 19:15:37 UTC 2014", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "article_summary": "Megabus spokesman Sean Hughes said the company would be providing assistance to all customers involved.\nThe double-decker Megabus with some 70 passengers aboard slid off of Interstate 65 in southern Indiana at about 5:30 a.m. EST and rolled over, Indiana State Police spokesman Clifton Elston said.\nIn October, at least a dozen people suffered injuries ranging from cuts to broken bones when a Megabus traveling on the same route flipped on its side.\nMore than two dozen people were injured on Saturday when a commercial passenger bus traveling to Atlanta from Chicago crashed in Indiana, officials said.\nOne other passenger was taken to a separate hospital with more serious injuries, but they were not life threatening, Elston said."}
