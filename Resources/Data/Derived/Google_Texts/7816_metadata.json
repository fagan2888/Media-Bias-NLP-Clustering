It was a place dedicated to getting aspiring business owners out of their pajamas and away from their home computers and into a professional office setting with lots of networking and educational opportunities.\n\nThe whole co-working idea was new to Shreveport/Bossier City, and Cohab was in an unenviable position of having to explain what they were before they could interest people in what they did. The bulk of the explaining fell to John Grindley, Cohab\u2019s first \u2013 and to date \u2013 only executive director.\n\nFor those of you who do not know John, you need to. John is as close to lightning in a bottle that you would ever want to be around. He fairly crackles with intensity and when he talks about Cohab, the depth of his belief in the power of entrepreneurism to change both the economy and society as a whole is apparent. John\u2019s co-working career was a life change from anything he had ever done. John grew up in Bossier City, went to college at University of Louisiana at Monroe, and armed with a degree in mass communications, became a production assistant for David Letterman on The Late Show. He left the intensity of the Big Apple for the West Coast and a career in music videos and commercial production in Los Angeles. In 2005, John was called back to Shreveport to work with an organization planning downtown\u2019s newest venue, a small, independent art house theater that would come to be known as Robinson Film Center.\n\nIt was during his time at RFC that John came to know the mountains that civic support and vision could move. This knowledge would serve him well as he transitioned to another challenge \u2013 bringing a shared workspace to downtown to fuel the rise of the creative class that all regions need to survive and thrive. As John gathered partners and talked up the idea, Cohab\u2019s pieces began to fall into place. An impressive board of directors was assembled, funding was pledged on both sides of the river, a building was located; desks went in.\n\nJohn and his dad built movable walls on the cheap to save money and those walls became part of Cohab\u2019s signature thrifty style that though short on expensive furnishings was long on free coffee and creative partnerships. Magic started happening relatively quickly. The entrepreneurial aspirants who inhabited shared desks and traded newly-minted business cards became real business owners that grew, expanded and moved out of Cohab, part of the original plan.\n\nTwin Engine Labs graduated, Mollie Corbett Photography, iArchitecture, Red River Brewing Company and others found their mojo with the help of Cohab. It was validation of the co-working concept, which over time, had morphed to add programs to help startup companies figure out their products and market, and prevent costly mistakes that could lead to early failure.\n\nFor seven years, John was there as a mentor, friend, collaborator, traffic cop, fundraiser and chief explainer \u2014 a wearer of many hats. Through his tenure, he has continued to believe that entrepreneurship is a precious commodity that should continue to be fostered.\n\n\u201cI believe that through entrepreneurship we can change lives,\u201d John told me. \u201cWe can solve social and economic issues, and continue to change the landscape of North Louisiana.\u201d\n\nA couple of weeks ago, John alerted the Cohab board that a wonderful job opportunity had come his way and told them it was the appropriate time to launch another life adventure. Board members were uniformly happy and proud of John, proud of Cohab, proud of what will be.\n\nWe are pleased that John is staying in the region, will continue to care \u2013 forcefully \u2013 about Cohab, and will never stop working to encourage small startups. Meanwhile, the board will work with the great staff he helped assemble to move Cohab to the next exciting phase. We encourage you to be a part of it.\n\nLiz Swain is executive director of Shreveport\u2019s Downtown Development Authority.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/opinion/2016/04/08/life-change-thank-john-grindley/82806988/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "In 2010, a completely new concept opened in downtown Shreveport called Cohab.
