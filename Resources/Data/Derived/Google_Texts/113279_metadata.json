Just as Texas refused to set up an ACA exchange, it refused to expand Medicaid as part of the ACA.\n\nBut the truth is that even if Texas formally expanded ACA Medicaid, these waiver funds are needed to care for those who would still not be covered.\n\nHospitals in Texas that serve Medicaid clients and the uninsured have used these funds to expand care even as the state refused.\n\nThis amounts to about $17.5 billion for the state\u2019s hospitals between 2011 and 2016. Another part of the waiver funding \u2014 $11.4 billion in the same period \u2014 has been used as incentives for providers to improve heath care quality and costs.\n\nTexas has until Sept. 30 to apply for renewal of the program. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services then has six months for its initial reply. The federal government has signaled that it will take the state\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid into consideration.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s irritation is understandable. Texas leads the nation in the number of uninsured residents. The state has ostensibly offered alternatives to Medicaid expansion \u2014 block grants, for instance \u2014 but these simply don\u2019t address the need, the experts say. The state, we are certain, knows such proposals are non-starters. The message to Texas\u2019 poor is essentially \u2014 and quite literally in the absence of meaningful coverage \u2014 drop dead.\n\nSo, a question logically follows: If the state doesn\u2019t care enough about its uninsured, why should the federal government? Well, precisely because the state doesn\u2019t act to address the issue, and the hospitals that have been receiving these funds have used the waiver program to pick up some of the slack and to improve health care quality and costs. We are asking the federal government to be the adult in the room here.\n\nPeople who might not otherwise have gotten care received it. Rural hospitals might close without the funds derived from the federal waiver.\n\nTexas should have embraced the Affordable Care Act, set up a state exchange and expanded Medicaid. But foolishly, state lawmakers have failed to take action that would help the state\u2019s poor.\n\nThe Legislature can remedy this, but it recently finished up with its session for the biennium without doing so. The Legislature should remedy its failings on ACA as soon as it can.\n\nIn the interim, the federal government should save Texans from Texas.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "The federal government evidenced its concern for the uninsured in Texas by setting up an Affordable Care Act exchange for them to gain coverage when the state refused to establish one on its own.
