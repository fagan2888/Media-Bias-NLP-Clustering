The role for the institute is to help the company figure out what it would take to convince elders that the \"exercise\" program is worth sticking to.\n\n\"We're looking to understand their perceptions so we can shorten the education time for people before they understand it's worth using a Juvent,\" says Peter Simonson, president of Regenerative Technologies Corp., a Palm Beach company that has licensed patents for the device. \"We know that in one to three weeks, they get it. But we're trying to shorten that time.\"\n\nSo the institute, in partnership with the Evalyn Sadlier Jones branch of the YMCA \u2014 that's the one in Palmer Ranch \u2014 is asking testers 50 and over to commit to trying out the gizmo. Users will be asked to drop by one of two sites and use the Juvent \u2014 this means basically standing on it for 20 minutes while it emits a subtle vibration \u2014 three times a week for five weeks. The 15-session total can be spread over a longer time to accommodate holidays or trips, said Stacy Prouty, chief operations officer for the institute.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" she said. \"But you might want to bring a book.\"\n\nThe study began Nov. 6 and will continue for 10 weeks. Participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires about the experience and their results.\n\n\"We want your feedback and honest opinion,\" Prouty told a roomful of potential testers this week. \"We're not here to endorse any products. You're not going to be pitched a product.\"\n\nBut when it was Simonson's turn to talk, the information session started to feel more like a sophisticated sales event. He impressed his listeners with a PowerPoint about the the importance of impact to get cellular fluids moving in our skeletons.\n\nAmerican bodies \u2014 especially older ones \u2014 are starved for impact, Simonson said.\n\n\"We sit in the office all day; we sit in a car; and when we walk, we wear these padded shoes,\" he told the audience.\n\nThen Simonson moved from the science of bone health to the claims of his product, including testimonials about better mobility, balance and freedom from pain. To drive his point home, he introduced some real people behind the testimonials, including his own mother.\n\n\"You'll see a lot of vibration machines out there,\" he said. \"Most of them are dumb shakers. There's a fine line between effective and dangerous.\"\n\nThere's also a fine line between assisting private companies in market research and selling their products for them, institute CEO Tom Essleman observed after the session. He wants to be careful about this as the foundation grows, he said, and plans to convene an advisory board to vet potential research projects.\n\nBut the audience at the Juvent introduction, while intrigued by the health claims, did not appear to be a bunch of easy marks. They asked cogent questions about the product's warranty and price.\n\nThe warranty is for two years, and the price is $3,500 \u2014 \"about the price of a good mattress,\" Simonson said.\n\nThat would have to be a really, really good mattress.\n\nFor information about becoming a Juvent tester, you can call 365-4243 or email juvent@institutefortheages.org.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22d0\"", "article_summary": "That would have to be a really, really good mattress.\nThis time around, the product \u2014 Juvent, one of those vibration machines believed to build bone health by applying low-intensity force when you stand on them \u2014 has been on the market for some time.\nThen Simonson moved from the science of bone health to the claims of his product, including testimonials about better mobility, balance and freedom from pain.\n\"We want your feedback and honest opinion,\" Prouty told a roomful of potential testers this week.\nThe warranty is for two years, and the price is $3,500 \u2014 \"about the price of a good mattress,\" Simonson said."}
