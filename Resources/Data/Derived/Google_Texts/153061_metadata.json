To drill it down even further, we even have problems that warrant attention above and beyond nonstop Republican House attempts to disable Obamacare, either through legislation or lawsuit. And though it\u2019s been hard to put faith in an unbiased justice system of late, I have decided to share our own Jason Easley\u2019s optimism, located in his piece \u201cFederal Court Ruling That Obamacare Subsidies Are Illegal Expected To Be Overturned.\u201d\n\nThe Great Recession. Remember that? Although it\u2019s been nearly six years since the catastrophic burst of the housing bubble and the subsequent stock market crash of late 2008, and though many experts tell us the worst was over in June 2009, most Americans aren\u2019t feeling recovered. For a host of reasons including, but not limited to, sluggish job growth, stagnant wages, high levels of personal debt and underwater mortgages, the middle and working classes are struggling. And although the Big Banks would like very much for us to collectively forget their culpability in this mess, playing the persecuted victim card as often as possible (see U.S. venture capitalist Thomas Perkins\u2019 letter to The Wall Street Journal, likening the \u201crising tide of hatred of the successful 1 percent\u201d to the persecution of the Jews during Nazi Germany), their Jedi Mind Tricks have been only marginally successful.\n\nEarly this week, The New York Times columnist Joe Nocera brought the issue of the Great Recession back to collective consciousness with his piece, \u201cDid Dodd-Frank Work?\u201d In it, he observes, \u201cThere are many aspects of the law on which Democrats and Republicans disagree. But there is one area in which the two sides are largely in agreement: \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 is still with us.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think we need to be financial experts to comprehend that not much has altered with our precarious system. While Bank of America, et al may be out of the subprime mortgage business, and the stock market has come back in a big way since the collapse of 2008, it\u2019s tough not to feel that the financial system\u2019s rebound continues to come at our expense \u2013 without us enjoying similar progress.\n\nIt also seems hard to believe that if a major institution once again found itself in dire straits, Uncle Sam wouldn\u2019t ride to the rescue. The more things change, the more they stay the same after all and anyone left with the impression that the health and well-being Corporate America comes second to that of human citizens just hasn\u2019t been paying attention.\n\nMoving beyond common sense intuition to actual legislative fact, Nocera points out that, \u201cIn one part of Dodd-Frank, the banks are required to write \u2018living wills,\u2019 laying out how they could wind down without causing a financial catastrophe. Although they are now on their third round of living wills, the documents are thousands of pages, and the government hasn\u2019t yet told them whether the second round of living wills, filed a year or so ago, passed muster.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t pass up the opportunity to point out another obvious corporate vs. citizen double standard. Though there are cities in America where it is essentially illegal to be poor and homeless, you can count on one finger how many bankers went to jail over derailing the global economy. And anyone who has undergone a personal bankruptcy proceeding can attest to the dehumanizing, humiliating scrutiny of medical bills, student loan amounts and income. It can take up to a dozen years before any entity will issue an individual credit again. Yet despite the disproportionate bluster, the nation\u2019s banks operate as though they didn\u2019t come to Washington with collective hats in hand little more than a leap year ago. And apparently they are not being held accountable to ensure it never happens again.\n\nWhat we are left with, in the words of Nocera, is this: \u201cthe ultimate problem: We have no way of knowing whether \u2018too big to fail\u2019 still exists until we have another crisis. Let\u2019s just hope we don\u2019t have to find out anytime soon.\u201d\n\nYeah, that doesn\u2019t work. We must demand better of our lawmakers and regulators.
