Steve Southerland picked a side Monday and endorsed Republican candidate Neal Dunn, who is running for Southerland\u2019s old CD2 seat in the Florida Panhandle.\n\n\u201cI have examined the field thoroughly and feel strongly that Neal Dunn is the best conservative Republican candidate and is the only candidate I have endorsed for this race,\u201d Sutherland said. \u201cHe and his wife, Leah, are conservative Christians with a long family history of military service and sacrifice.\u201d\n\nThe former congressman said the move was \u201cnot just another former congressman endorsing a candidate,\u201d and that Dunn, who entered the race in July, \u201cknows first hand the failures of Obamacare and is the candidate most capable of repealing and replacing that broken system with one that is patient centered and market based.\u201d\n\nIn accepting the endorsement, the Panama City urological surgeon said he shared Southerland\u2019s \u201csentiments about North and Northwest Florida and just how important it is for our district to be well represented in Washington by strong conservative leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what it takes to make our community healthier and our economy stronger, and the need to repeal and replace Obamacare and for businesses to thrive and grow,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, I pledge, if elected, to help restore America\u2019s faith in Congress.\u201d\n\nSoutherland\u2019s endorsement adds to a list of current and former lawmakers who have thrown their support behind Dunn, including former Florida House Speakers Allan Bense and Will Weatherford as well as former Senate President Don Gaetz. Dunn also picked up endorsements from Republican State Representatives Dennis Baxley, Jay Trumbull and Elizabeth Porter in early October.\n\nMary Thomas, Dunn\u2019s opponent in the Republican primary, was quick to deride Southerland\u2019s support through a campaign spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise political insiders and lobbyists are supporting Neal Dunn, he is one of them,\u201d said Lisa Morrison. \u201cAfter all Dunn lobbied for the expansion of Obamacare in Florida and donated to Democrats. That\u2019s what insiders do.\u201d\n\nThomas, who also entered the race in July, hasn\u2019t garnered as many flashy endorsements as Dunn. Currently, the Tallahassee lawyer is sporting endorsements from Republican Reps. Charlie Stone, Jimmie Smith and Mike Hill, as well as State Attorney Jeff Siegmeister.\n\nDunn leads in fundraising, too. From July through September, he was able to raise more than $500,000, and finished the quarter with $458,728 on hand. Through the same date, Thomas raised just over $203,000 and still has $160,000 on hand.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Former U.S. Rep.
