They also happen to be naturally gluten-free and can sub in for wheat flour in pretty much everything. (Like pancakes.) The gluten-free market is booming in the west, and teff is showing up more and more in health-food shops and specialty markets, write Claire Provost and Elissa Jobson. But they suggest we haven't seen anything yet. (An earlier post at the Oregonian also predicts teff will be a hot commodity in 2014.)\n\nThe grain has long been a nutritional staple in Ethiopia, mostly in its injera bread. (Think \"earthy flavor with a slight hazelnut taste,\" says StyleCaster.) And while it now accounts for 20% of the nation's agriculture, the government wants to double production by 2015. Of course, this raises the same kinds of ethical concerns that have plagued quinoa in South America: Ethiopia suffers from widespread malnutrition, and \"careful planning is needed to make sure that business and export interests are not put ahead of domestic consumers and small farmers,\" says a post at SOS Children's Villages. \"Otherwise, any teff boom could come at the expense of the poorest Ethiopians.\" (In other nutrition news, read how soda's caramel coloring might pose a danger.)\n\n", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "Will Ancient Grain Teff Be the Next Super Food?", "image": "http://img2-azcdn.newser.com/image/966107-0-20140125102321.jpeg?width=300&height=300", "description": "Ethiopian staple seems to have the potential"}, "description": "Get ready to hear a lot about an ancient grain from Ethiopia called teff, reports the   Guardian  , which suggests it's poised to take the place once held by quinoa as king of the \"super grains.\"...
