The hospital itself has outdated infrastructure and lack of space for expansion, hospital leaders said. In addition, Thompson noted, there is much duplication \u2014 two emergency departments, two radiology departments, and duplicate laboratories. In addition, the hospital often must transport patients between the two campuses.\n\nLast year, the hospital opened its Orthopaedic Center on its Silverdale campus, and a medical center on Bainbridge is scheduled to open this fall. Hospital leaders said population and local industry have been shifting away from Bremerton to other areas of the Kitsap and Olympic peninsulas.\n\nSome Bremerton leaders don\u2019t seem happy about the loss of an inpatient hospital in that city, according to the Kitsap Sun. Bremerton is a larger city, but statistically, households in Silverdale are more affluent.\n\nHarrison\u2019s Bremerton hospital seems busy enough: Friday night around 7 p.m., the \u201cwait time\u201d ticker listed a 146-minute wait for its emergency room in Bremerton, with \u201cno wait\u201d at its ER in Silverdale.\n\nOver the next few months, Harrison leaders say they\u2019ll seek reactions from various key constituencies, including the City of Bremerton, community and business leaders, residents, medical staff and employees. They plan to announce a final master facility plan in October.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "Harrison Medical Center is considering closing its inpatient hospital services in Bremerton and moving them to nearby Silverdale, officials from Harrison and Franciscan Health System announced Friday.
