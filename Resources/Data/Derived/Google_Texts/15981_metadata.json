That\u2019s understandable, but focusing on the Democrats\u2019 failures will not lead the Republicans to success. Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) understands this, and he is busy trying to articulate the Republican vision for America. Unfortunately, while the senator\u2019s fans may view him as a champion of free enterprise, Lee\u2019s vision isn\u2019t fundamentally different from the president\u2019s.\n\nWe know what President Obama\u2019s vision is. America is a welfare state in which wealth and prosperity don\u2019t come from free individuals working hard to improve their lives and be happy. They come from society. \u201cNo single person can train all the math and science teachers,\u201d or \u201cbuild the roads and networks and research labs,\u201d said the president in his second inaugural address. Instead, \u201cwe must do these things together, as one nation and one people.\u201d\n\nThis is the vision of \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that.\u201d Everyone built it. And if everyone built it \u2014 if \u201cone nation and one people\u201d are responsible for it \u2014 then why should you get to keep it? We know the left\u2019s answer: you shouldn\u2019t. Hence, businessmen, the wealthy \u2014 the hated \u201c1 percent\u201d \u2014 are castigated for their wealth, taxed to the hilt, and called upon to \u201cgive back.\u201d\n\nIt is the vision of Obamacare. When the government is making medical and insurance decisions for \u201cone nation and one people,\u201d why would your desire to keep your own policy matter?\n\nFor the president and his allies, the essence of America is not individualism, but a mushy form of collectivism. Did you get good grades and major in something marketable? Did you work hard for that year-end bonus? Did you risk everything to build a successful business? You didn\u2019t earn that! You are not ultimately responsible for your success, \u201cwe\u201d are. And as \u201cour\u201d agent, the government\u2019s job is to spread the fruits of your labors throughout society in the form of taxes, subsidies, and entitlements.\n\nSo what is Sen. Lee\u2019s vision? A ringing endorsement of the American spirit of independence and productivity? Hardly.\n\n\u201cThe United States did not formally launch our war on poverty in 1964, but in 1776,\u201d the senator said at a recent Heritage Foundation poverty forum. Since then it \u201chas waged the most successful war on poverty in the history of the world\u201d by becoming the wealthiest nation on earth.\n\nReally? American colonists fought the most powerful nation on earth as a precursor to a mid-20th century welfare program? Would it be too much to expect a simple \u201cyou did build that\u201d from a senator put in office by the Tea Party? Apparently so.\n\n\u201cFor all America\u2019s reputation for individualism and competition, our nation has from the beginning been built on a foundation of community and cooperation.\u201d Our political system is distinctive, according to Lee, not because it recognizes that we are independent individuals, but because it assumes that we are all dependent on one another. \u201cFreedom means \u2018we\u2019re all in this together.\u2019 The conservative vision for America is not an Ayn Rand novel. It\u2019s a Norman Rockwell painting, or a Frank Capra movie: a nation \u2018of plain, ordinary kindness, and a little looking out for the other fellow, too.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn short, the essence of America is \u2026 togetherness?", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Yaron Brook and Steve Simpson", "description": "Mike Lee's solidaristic conservatism isn't so different from Barack Obama.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "With Obamacare in shambles and President Obama proposing his newest one-year plan to fix it, Republicans are experiencing a moment of schadenfreude.
