But it is significant because of Highmark's dominance in Western Pennsylvania and on the federal health insurance marketplace here.\n\nHighmark spokesman Aaron Billger blamed rising prices in 2015 on the growing cost of medical services. Health care inflation was tame in recent years but is projected to accelerate as more people gain coverage and the economy recovers from the recession.\n\n\u201cThe cost of providing care is the biggest impact on premiums,\u201d Billger said. \u201cAs health care continues to evolve, so does the cost of providing it.\u201d\n\nThe end of its contract with hospital giant UPMC has forced some of the cost increases and plan changes. The Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer has to revamp its individual and commercial products for 2015 to reflect reduced in-network access to many UPMC hospitals in Pittsburgh.\n\nThough its Medicare Advantage plans aren't affected by UPMC's contract termination, Highmark chose to give seniors a low-cost option for next year that excludes UPMC and many other smaller health systems in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nSimilarly, Highmark is giving individual and group customers a broad range of premium prices. Because the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to offer robust minimum benefits, one of the few ways to lower costs is to reduce access to hospitals and doctors.\n\nDetails provided\n\nInsurers across the country are increasingly limiting networks. Management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. last year found that 70 percent of plans sold in 20 large urban markets used these so-called narrow networks.\n\nDetails of Highmark's new products were released Wednesday by the insurer as companies are making decisions about employee health plans for next year and as individuals prepare for open enrollment.\n\nBillger said he could not provide examples of price increases because the insurer's rates have not been approved by regulators.\n\nPremiums for plans sold on the federal exchange in Pennsylvania won't be released until later this month. But insurance costs paid by individuals and employers across the nation are rising.\n\nRates are expected to be higher on state-run exchanges and on Healthcare.gov when open enrollment starts Nov. 15. Among the 27 states and the District of Columbia that have released data on premiums, the average increase will be 7.5 percent, according to an analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\nAnnual price increases for employers have moderated, but health plan rates are expected to begin rising quickly again in coming years. The average premium for a family was $16,834 this year, up 3 percent from last year, according to Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nEconomists at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services last month predicted that health care spending in the United States will rise by an average of 6.1 percent a year from 2016 to 2023.\n\nInsurance carriers such as Highmark and others are responding to rising costs by limiting in-network access to hospital systems where they can negotiate the best prices. Limited networks have enabled insurers to offer subscribers options to reduce premiums.\n\nFor example, Highmark is rolling out a new product, Community Blue HMO, for employer groups that will offer its lowest rates but includes only providers in the 29-county Western Pennsylvania region. It excludes UPMC.\n\n\u201cOur customers asked for it,\u201d said Robin Bugni, vice president of product management and development for Highmark.\n\nIt's also giving seniors low-cost choices. In addition to its broad network plans for seniors, Security Blue and Freedom Blue, Highmark will begin selling a Medicare Advantage plan in Western Pennsylvania called Community Blue Medicare HMO that comes with a $0 premium option.\n\nHighmark is the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans in Western Pennsylvania with about 150,000 members.\n\nOptions for Medicare\n\nUnder Medicare Advantage, an alternative to traditional Medicare, the federal government contracts with private insurance companies to administer Medicare benefits to seniors.\n\nThe private plans are especially popular in Pittsburgh. According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research organization, 62 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in Allegheny County are enrolled in the private plans. By comparison, 30 percent of beneficiaries nationwide are.\n\nIn exchange for zero premium, however, Community Blue Medicare HMO members will have in-network access only to select community hospitals in a 23-county region of Western Pennsylvania. In Allegheny County, for instance, seniors can access only the Allegheny Health Network hospitals, Ohio Valley General in McKees Rocks and Heritage Valley-Sewickley. All hospitals in Westmoreland and Butler are out-of-network in the HMO plan.\n\n\u201cOur goal in creating a Community Blue product for seniors is to provide choices for those seeking high-quality, lower-cost coverage,\u201d said Barbara Gray, Highmark's senior vice president of senior markets.\n\nIn previous years, the broad-network Security Blue and Freedom Blue had $0 premium plans, but those are no longer offered, Billger said.\n\nOpen enrollment for Medicare Advantage plans starts Oct. 15.\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
