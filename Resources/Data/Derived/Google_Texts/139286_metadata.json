Specifically:\n\n38% were considered \"x-small,\" meaning they included 10% or less of providers in the rating area;\n\n38% were considered \"small,\" meaning they included 10% to 25% or less of providers in the rating area;\n\n19% were considered \"medium,\" meaning they included 25% to 40% of providers in the rating area; and\n\n6% were considered \"large,\" meaning they included 40% to 60% of providers in the rating area.\n\nNo provider networks offered through the California exchange were considered by researchers to be \"x-large,\" meaning they included 60% or more of providers in the rating area.\n\nThe size of provider networks differed by health plan type. For example, 91% of HMO networks in California were narrow, compared with 33% of PPO networks (Polsky/Weiner, RWJF study, August 2015).\n\nRecommendations\n\nDan Polsky -- lead researcher and executive director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania -- said that consumers do not have a clear method for determining whether a network is narrow before enrolling in a plan. Polsky recommended a labeling system for health plans similar to that for T-shirt sizes, from \"x-small\" to \"x-large.\"\n\nHe said, \"We need a good way to communicate this information to consumers so they can make an informed decision at the point of purchase for a health plan,\" adding, \"Narrow networks in my opinion aren't necessarily bad things, but they are being poorly implemented.\"\n\nThe researchers also said better exchange network data are needed so that:\n\nConsumers can determine whether lower-priced, narrow network policies are a good deal for them; and\n\nRegulators can ensure sufficient access to providers.\n\nKathy Hempstead, director of health coverage issues at RWJF, said, \"Network composition is a major way in which insurance companies can attempt to control costs in the marketplace, and for consumers there is often a tradeoff between access and price\" (Los Angeles Times, 8/25).", "article_metadata": {"description": "A study released by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation finds that three-fourths of provider networks in plans sold through Covered California cover 25% or fewer physicians in a given area.
