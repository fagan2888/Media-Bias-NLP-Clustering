Steve Scalise (R-LA), refused to rule out impeaching President Obama on Sunday, telling Fox News that the president has acted unilaterally and illegally, exceeding his constitutional authority.\n\n\u201cUltimately, what we want to do is see the president follow his own laws,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cHe took an oath to follow the law of the land. The Supreme Court unanimously said 12 times the president overreached and did things he doesn\u2019t have the authority to do,\u201d he added, referring to Court rulings finding that Obama overstepped his executive authority.\n\nScalise explained that House Republicans are \u201cgoing to continue to be a check and balance against this administration,\u201d but would not say whether the chamber would consider impeaching Obama:\n\nCHRIS WALLACE (HOST): Impeachment is off the table? SCALISE: The White House wants to talk about impeachment and they\u2019re trying to fund raise off that, too. WALLACE: I\u2019m asking you, sir. SCALISE: The White House will do anything they can to change the topic away from the president\u2019s failed agenda. People paying higher costs for food, for well health care, for gas at the pump. The president isn\u2019t softballing the problems. We\u2019re going to try to solve problems for everyday people. I would like to see the president engaged in that, too, that\u2019s his job, but he wants to change the topic, talk about things like that.\n\nDemocrats have been raising millions of dollars since some conservative Republicans \u2014 most prominently Sarah Palin \u2014 floated the prospect of impeachment. On Friday, Dan Pfeiffer, a top White House aide, even brought up the possibility, telling reporters, \u201cIt would be foolish to discount the possibility that the Republicans would consider going down that path.\u201d House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has continuously ruled out the idea, though he is suing the administration for allegedly exceeding its authority in delaying a provision of the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Scalise dodged the question three times.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Scalise dodged the question three times.", "title": "Top House Republican Won\u2019t Rule Out Impeaching Obama", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/home/2014/07/27/3464590/top-house-republican-wont-rule-out-impeaching-obama/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Steve-Scalise.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scalise dodged the question three times.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Steve-Scalise-321x214.jpg", "title": "Top House Republican Won\u2019t Rule Out Impeaching Obama", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-home", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Steve-Scalise.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Steve-Scalise.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-27T09:26:20+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Home Page Top House Republican Won\u2019t Rule Out Impeaching Obama CREDIT: AP House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA)The newly elected House Majority Whip, Rep.
