Riffing off a speech by Wyoming junior Senator John Barrasso which called Obamacare \u201cunaffordable,\u201d the Nobel Prize winning economist points out that the law seems to be lowering health costs and points out that insurance premiums will be lower than the Congressional Budget Office had originally predicted. \u201cBut Mr. Barrasso\u2019s remarks were actually interesting, although not in the way he intended,\u201d Krugman writes:\n\nMy guess, in other words, was that Mr. Barrasso was inadvertently illustrating the widening \u201cwonk gap\u201d \u2014 the G.O.P.\u2019s near-complete lack of expertise on anything substantive. Health care is the most prominent example, but the dumbing down extends across the spectrum, from budget issues to national security to poll analysis. Remember, Mitt Romney and much of his party went into Election Day expecting victory\u2026.\n\nBut that was then. Modern conservatism has become a sort of cult, very much given to conspiracy theorizing when confronted with inconvenient facts. Liberal policies were supposed to cause hyperinflation, so low measured inflation must reflect statistical fraud; the threat of climate change implies the need for public action, so global warming must be a gigantic scientific hoax. Oh, and Mitt Romney would have won if only he had been a real conservative.\n\nIt\u2019s all kind of funny, in a way. Unfortunately, however, this runaway cult controls the House, which gives it immense destructive power \u2014 the power, for example, to wreak havoc on the economy by refusing to raise the debt ceiling. And it\u2019s disturbing to realize that this power rests in the hands of men who, thanks to the wonk gap, quite literally have no idea what they\u2019re doing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New York Times columnist assails proud ignorance on the right", "title": "Krugman: Conservatism is now \u201ca sort of cult\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The New York Times columnist assails proud ignorance on the right", "title": "Krugman: Conservatism is now \u201ca sort of cult\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/09/krugman_conservatism_is_now_a_sort_of_cult/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/paul_krugman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The New York Times columnist assails proud ignorance on the right", "title": "Krugman: Conservatism is now \u201ca sort of cult\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/paul_krugman.jpg", "creator": "@alexhalperin", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alex Halperin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aca, healthcare, Krugman, Media, New York Times, Obamacare, Paul Krugman, U.S. Economy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17c1\"", "article_summary": "New York Times columnist Paul Krugman went on the attack this morning.\nModern conservatism has become a sort of cult, very much given to conspiracy theorizing when confronted with inconvenient facts.\nOh, and Mitt Romney would have won if only he had been a real conservative.\nRemember, Mitt Romney and much of his party went into Election Day expecting victory\u2026.\nUnfortunately, however, this runaway cult controls the House, which gives it immense destructive power \u2014 the power, for example, to wreak havoc on the economy by refusing to raise the debt ceiling."}
