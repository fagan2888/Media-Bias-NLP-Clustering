A change was needed.\n\nThe Mystics fired Lacey at season\u2019s end and went out and hired a reliable coach in Mike Thibault. He had been coaching in the WNBA since 2003, receiving coach of the year honors three different times and making two WNBA Finals appearances.\n\nThibault\u2019s plan was simple: Expand the talent on the roster, and change the mindset of the organization.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple of things that needed change,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cFirst, how they went about their work every day. Second, there were three or four players that would be considered a third best player on a good team. We had to turn it into a situation where the team had some good players, but not enough of them, and that had to change.\u201d\n\nEntering Thursday\u2019s game at Indiana, things have changed. The Mystics, at 6-3, are among the better teams in Eastern Conference in the early portion of the season. Thibault, after only two-plus years, became the most successful coach in franchise history when the Mystics defeated the Chicago Sky on Sunday for his 39th victory.\n\nThibault made an immediate turnaround with the organization upon his arrival, trading the seventh overall pick in 2013 WNBA Draft to New York for center Kia Vaughn. In addition, Washington received the No. 19 overall pick in the draft after trading Jasmine Thomas to Atlanta. The Mystics had gathered the Nos. 4, 17, and 19 picks in the 2013 draft, in which they drafted Tayler Hill, Nadirah McKenith, and Emma Meesseman.\n\nAs a former NBA scout, Thibault has the upper-hand when it comes to scouting players, whether it be the draft or free agency. Meesseman was Washington\u2019s No. 19 overall pick in the 2013 draft, and has emerged as one of its best players.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s one of the best 10 players in the league right now,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cShe\u2019s been way more aggressive this year offensively.\u201d\n\nThibault does more than simply look at the physical structure and ability of players. There\u2019s a formula to his evaluation of players.\n\n\u201cThe one question is, \u2018How well do they learn?\u2019\u201d Thibault said. \u201cI spend a lot of time going to practices just as much as games. I think you learn a lot about players in practices. How quickly do they pick things up? Can they make adjustments to coaching and are they coachable in general? That was a big part of it.\u201d\n\nAfter a 17-17 season in 2013 \u2014 including a loss in the Eastern Conference semifinals \u2014 the following year\u2019s draft proved to be even more exhilarating for Washington. Using the No. 6 pick, the Mystics selected UConn standout center Stefanie Dolson. Thibault saw a coachable and reliable rebounder in Dolson. In return, the newly-drafted Dolson saw an opportunity to play a part in the Mystics\u2019 turnaround.\n\n\u201cLast year when I talked to Coach,\u201d Dolson said, \u201che talked about building this program up. Not from the ground up, but adding new pieces to it. From last year to this year, we\u2019ve made a big jump. It\u2019s just our competitive nature as a team.\u201d\n\nAs Dolson played her part, she became surrounded by experienced players. In 2013, the Mystics signed point guard Ivory Latta. This past offseason, Washington traded for 34-year-old Kara Lawson. These two acquisitions brought leadership to a young core, although Thibault also sought out their offensive abilities.\n\n\u201cWe needed 3-point shooting, so we traded for Kara,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cIn [2013] free agency, we went out and got Ivory because she brought energy and three point shooting.\u201d\n\nOnce the 3-point threats were added, Thibault had already corralled a young and talented frontcourt. With that being said, Lawson believes there\u2019s more to the team than just the roster.\n\n\u201cWe have balance and depth, and our skills complement one another,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cBut the number one thing that Mike does is he picks people with good character. People that are about the team. If you look around, we don\u2019t have a star on our team. We try to instantiate the positives of each other on the court so we know each other\u2019s strengths.\u201d\n\nLawson played for Thibault on the Connecticut Sun from 2010 to 2012. She understood his methodology coming into Washington. Lawson knows her role is more than just 3-point shooting for Thibault.\n\n\u201cCommunication is what I try to bring to the team,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cNo matter how old you are, communication is very important to the game.\u201d\n\nWith Lawson\u2019s leadership, the Mystics finished 16-18 in 2014, with another early exit from the playoffs in the Eastern Conference semifinals. With their current start to the 2015 season, things are different.\n\n\u201cThis team has found its confidence,\u201d Dolson said repeatedly.\n\nNow, it\u2019s only a matter of whether or not that confidence can get Washington the WNBA championship it has long desired.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thibault became the team's most successful coach over the weekend when he won his 39th game, and in two-plus seasons has turned the Mystics from cellar-dweller into an Eastern Conference contender.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Thibault became the team\u2019s most successful coach over the weekend when he won his 39th game, and in two-plus seasons has turned the Mystics from cellar-dweller into an Eastern Conference contender.", "title": "In three quick seasons, Mike Thibault\u2019s magic has turned Mystics around", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/2/mike-thibault-has-turned-around-mystics/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/05/22/ap77105021047.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/05/22/ap77105021047.jpg", "description": "Thibault became the team's most successful coach over the weekend when he won his 39th game, and in two-plus seasons has turned the Mystics from cellar-dweller into an Eastern Conference contender.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "In three quick seasons, Mike Thibault\u2019s magic has turned Mystics"}, "Author": "Andrew Walsh", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Washington, Tayler Hill"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a35\"", "article_summary": "The Mystics fired Lacey at season\u2019s end and went out and hired a reliable coach in Mike Thibault.\n\u201cLast year when I talked to Coach,\u201d Dolson said, \u201che talked about building this program up.\n\u201cCommunication is what I try to bring to the team,\u201d Lawson said.\nJust two years ago, the Washington Mystics weren\u2019t a particularly impressive team, finished with a league-worst 5-29 record and winning a combined 11 games in two seasons under coach Trudi Lacey.\nThe Mystics, at 6-3, are among the better teams in Eastern Conference in the early portion of the season."}
