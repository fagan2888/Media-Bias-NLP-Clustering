The inside lane of Interstate 75 North was blocked for more than an hour in Pasco County on Saturday evening when a car ran into a concrete median wall, the Florida Highway Patrol said.

A 2008 Mazda 323 driven by Logan W. Guess, 31, of Dade City was headed north on I-75 near mile marker 285 when Guess fell asleep, FHP said. As the car traveled into the inside lane, Guess woke up and overcorrected the vehicle, running into the concrete median in a construction zone. The car came to rest on the barrier wall, blocking traffic.

Guess was not injured, FHP said.
