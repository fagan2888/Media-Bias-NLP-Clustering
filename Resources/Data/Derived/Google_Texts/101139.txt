A Littleton Park and Ride station is open again after a bomb squad detonated what was called in as a suspicious package.

Littleton Commander Mike Eyman, said police were called to the Littleton Park and Ride station on Mineral Avenue at about 7 p.m.

The station was closed while police checked out the suspicious package — a briefcase secured to a bicycle with wires.

Arapahoe County Sheriffs Department’s bomb squad decided to detonate the briefcase, as a precaution, but found it was just a man’s personal belongings.

Commander Eyman said police were able to return some of the belongings to the man who is currently without a home.

The parking lot was cleared and reopened shortly before 9 p.m.
