Walls is now suing his former employer over the emotional distress he suffers after going under anesthesia and waking up from this operation wearing pink women\u2019s underwear.\n\n\"When the plaintiff recovered from the effects of the anesthesia administered by defendants, he awoke to realize that while he was unconscious pink women's underwear had been placed on his body,\" Walls\u2019s attorney Gary Nitsche explains in a lawsuit filed with the New Castle County Superior Court. \"When the plaintiff initially presented for his colonoscopy he had not been wearing pink women's underwear and at no time did the plaintiff voluntarily, knowingly or intentionally place the pink women's underwear upon himself.\"\n\nThe lawsuit does not explain the intent behind dressing Walls in pink lingerie other than to harass or embarrass him. When asked to comment on the suit this past Wednesday, Jennifer Anderson, surgery director at Delaware Surgery Center, told DelawareOnline, \"We just found out about this yesterday afternoon.\" Nitsche claimed that his client should be rewarded compensation after suffering mental anguish, lost wages, and loss of earning capacity due to \u201csevere emotion stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe defendant's extreme and outrageous conduct went beyond all possible bounds of decency,\u201d Nitsche said in the suit. He also went on to say Walls\u2019s colleagues at the surgery center, \u201cfailed to maintain proper policies and procedures for the care of patients with respect to not engaging in extreme and outrageous conduct.\u201d Although Walls was an employee of Delaware Surgery Center when he underwent the procedure, it is unclear when he left the center and if he did so under his own volition.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "colonoscopy, surgery, pink, women's, underwear", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Delaware man who underwent a colonoscopy back in October 2012 said he woke up wearing pink women's underwear after his operation.", "title": "Man Sues Doctors After Waking Up Wearing Pink Women's Underwear", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-sues-hospital-severe-emotional-stress-waking-surgery-pink-womens-underwear-307351", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/17/pink-womens-underwear.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Delaware man who underwent a colonoscopy back in October 2012 said he woke up wearing pink women's underwear after his operation.", "title": "Man Sues Doctors After Waking Up Wearing Pink Women's Underwear", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-sues-hospital-severe-emotional-stress-waking-surgery-pink-womens-underwear-307351", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/17/pink-womens-underwear.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/17/pink-womens-underwear.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-17T13:06:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-17T13:06:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Delaware man who underwent a colonoscopy back in October 2012 said he woke up wearing pink women's underwear after his operation."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bb8\"", "article_summary": "\"When the plaintiff initially presented for his colonoscopy he had not been wearing pink women's underwear and at no time did the plaintiff voluntarily, knowingly or intentionally place the pink women's underwear upon himself.\"\nWalls is now suing his former employer over the emotional distress he suffers after going under anesthesia and waking up from this operation wearing pink women\u2019s underwear.\nWhen asked to comment on the suit this past Wednesday, Jennifer Anderson, surgery director at Delaware Surgery Center, told DelawareOnline, \"We just found out about this yesterday afternoon.\"\nWhen Andrew Walls, an employee of Delaware Surgery Center, found out he would have to undergo a colonoscopy back in October 2012 he decided the medical center he worked for was his best option.\nThe lawsuit does not explain the intent behind dressing Walls in pink lingerie other than to harass or embarrass him."}
