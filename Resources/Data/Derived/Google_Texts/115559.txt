Taxpayers earning less might not be immune. If, for instance, this year you sell a home that appreciated a lot in value, you’ll pay the higher capital-gains taxes on net profit that exceeds $500,000 for couples and $250,000 for individuals. (The new 3.8 percent tax applies only to profits above those limits.) And if you expect dividends to be as high this year as last, you might be disappointed. Anticipating higher tax rates, many companies paid out more than usual in dividends in 2012. “The dividends that go out this year won’t be nearly as great,” says Brad Hall, a certified public accountant and a managing director at Hall & Co., an accounting firm in Irvine, Calif.
