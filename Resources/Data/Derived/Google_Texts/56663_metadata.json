It funds only neutral materials \u2013 safe rubber playground surfaces. The criteria used to select grant recipients is completely neutral, other than the blanket exclusion of churches, including factors such as: (1) a description of the need for the project, (2) description of how the rubber material will be contained or supported, and (3) the poverty level of citizens in the surrounding area.\u201d\n\nADF Senior Counsel David Cortman said no \u201cstate can define religious neutrality as treating religious organizations worse than everyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the primary issue that the Supreme Court will address. In this case, the state should not have excluded this preschool from the recycled-tire program simply because a church operates the school,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s safety is just as important on church-daycare playgrounds as it is on other daycare playgrounds,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Erik Stanley. \u201cMissouri and every state should understand that the U.S. Constitution prohibits religious hostility, which is what Missouri exhibited when it denied Trinity Lutheran\u2019s scrap tire grant application. This case has huge implications for state constitutional provisions across the nation that treat religious Americans and organizations as inferiors solely because of their religious identity.\u201d\n\nTrinity Lutheran Church Learning Center in Columbia sought to participate in the 2012 Playground Scrap Tire Surface Material Grant Program.\n\nThe center wanted to remove and replace a large portion of the pea gravel surfacing on its playgrounds with a safer, recycled, pour-in-place rubberized product.\n\nThe Missouri Department of Natural Resources disqualified the learning center solely because Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Missouri, Inc., operates it. It cited a state constitutional limit on providing state assistance to churches.\n\n\u201cThe Evidence Bible\u201d is now available and includes, besides the King James version, dozens of articles expanding answers to questions such as why is there suffering, explanations about what Muslims believe and scientific facts written millennia before man discovered them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The subject of a lawsuit that started in Missouri and now is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court is scrap tires used for playgrounds.
