Our security team will be enforcing this policy.\n\nWe understand why people are attracted to war bonnets. They have a magnificent aesthetic. But their spiritual, cultural and aesthetic significance cannot be separated.\n\nBass Coast Festival takes place on indigenous land and we respect the dignity of aboriginal people. We have consulted with aboriginal people in British Columbia on this issue and we feel our policy aligns with their views and wishes regarding the subject. Their opinion is what matters to us.\n\nRELATED: Hipster Headdresses at Coachella: Yep, It Happened\n\nContacted by MTV News, Bass Coast communications director Paul Brooks said, \"We\u2019ve been working with some of these bands [of Aboriginal people] and they expressed that they would like to see this policy in place. We decided to take a stand on this issue.\"\n\nWe're pretty sure the announcement will please A Tribe Called Red, the popular Native DJ trio that will be playing the main stage of Bass Coast on August 2. In the past, ATCR has asked those attending their shows to \"please stop\" wearing headdresses and facepaint.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You won't see any morons in headdresses at the Bass Coast Festival.
