For months, Trump has been saying that he would remain neutral in brokering a dialogue between Israelis and the Palestinians, drawing criticism from his Republican rivals, and even, in muted form, from Hillary Clinton in her own speech to AIPAC on Monday. But when you scratch the surface of what Trump has said about Israel\u2014on the campaign trail and during the AIPAC speech\u2014there is nothing new or fresh about it. Trump has blamed Palestinians for the state of conflict in Israel and the West Bank, and stigmatized Islam repeatedly. He has offered nothing in the way of creative policies or new strategies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt all fits with the typical Trumpian pattern. He has blasted certain tax breaks for the wealthy, earning himself positive headlines, and then gone on to propose the most regressive tax cut of any of the Republican candidates. He has stated that people shouldn\u2019t die in the streets from a lack of health care, and then gone on to propose abolishing Obamacare and replacing it with, er, nobody knows.\n\nMost of Trump\u2019s speech on Monday was filled with typical AIPAC boilerplate: bashing Iran, castigating the Iran deal, scolding the United Nations. (Trump got some applause for several of these lines, although the crowd appeared to laugh at him when he bragged about how much time he had spent studying the Iran deal.) He even called for moving the American embassy to Jerusalem, something that several candidates have proposed, but no American president\u2014Democrat or Republican\u2014has ever dared to actually do. (The embassy is currently in Tel Aviv.) When it came to peace negotiations between the two sides, Trump put the onus on the Palestinians, even seeming to go beyond where the hawkish crowd was willing to go when he called for \u201cconfronting\u201d Palestinian behavior.\n\nThere was a moment on Monday, before the speech, when it seemed as if Trump might depart from, yes, typical pandering for more than a split second. After being asked at a press conference whether Israel was one of the countries that he thought could pay their own way and didn\u2019t require foreign aid (a classic Trump theme), the candidate replied, \u201cThere are many countries that can pay, and they can pay big-league.\u201d Whatever that meant\u2014and who really knows?\u2014Trump, later in the day, returned to the issue, saying Israel helps us \u201cgreatly.\u201d The hour or two of uncertainty was over.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Isaac Chotiner", "description": "\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to pander to you about Israel,\u201d Donald Trump said during a surprisingly stilted speech to AIPAC Monday night. \u201cI came here to speak ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to pander to you about Israel,\u201d Donald Trump said during a surprisingly stilted speech to AIPAC Monday night. \u201cI came here to speak ...", "title": "Trump Says He Won\u2019t Pander to AIPAC Before Pandering to AIPAC, Of Course", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/21/donald_trump_panders_to_aipac.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/21/donald_trump_panders_to_aipac/516871092-republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to pander to you about Israel,\u201d Donald Trump said during a surprisingly stilted speech to AIPAC Monday night. \u201cI came here to speak ...", "title": "Trump Says He Won\u2019t Pander to AIPAC Before Pandering to AIPAC, Of Course", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/21/donald_trump_panders_to_aipac.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/21/donald_trump_panders_to_aipac/516871092-republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-21T19:34:57Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Trump Says He Won\u2019t Pander to AIPAC Before Pandering to AIPAC, Of Course", "sailthru.headline": "Trump Says He Won\u2019t Pander to AIPAC Before Pandering to AIPAC, Of Course", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Trump Says He Won\\u2019t Pander to AIPAC Before Pandering to AIPAC, Of Course\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/21/donald_trump_panders_to_aipac.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/21/donald_trump_panders_to_aipac/516871092-republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"227160321011\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2016-03-21T19:34:57Z\",\n  \"section\": \"briefing\",\n  \"author\": \"Isaac Chotiner\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"donald trump\",\n    \"gop primary 2016\"\n  ]\n}", "fb-share": "The crowd appeared to laugh at him when he bragged about how much time he had spent studying the Iran deal.", "tw-line": "Trump says he won't pander to AIPAC before pandering to AIPAC.", "keywords": "donald trump, trump aipac, aipac speech, trump jews, hillary clinton aipac, trump israel, trump jerusalem, trump iran deal", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.tags": "donald trump, trump aipac, aipac speech, trump jews, hillary clinton aipac, trump israel, trump jerusalem, trump iran deal", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.description": "\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to pander to you about Israel,\u201d Donald Trump said during a surprisingly stilted speech to AIPAC Monday night. \u201cI came here to speak ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/21/donald_trump_panders_to_aipac/516871092-republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Alex Wong/Getty Images\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to pander to you about Israel,\u201d Donald Trump said during a surprisingly stilted speech to AIPAC Monday night.\nMost of Trump\u2019s speech on Monday was filled with typical AIPAC boilerplate: bashing Iran, castigating the Iran deal, scolding the United Nations.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that, on the subject of Israel and the Palestinians, Trump has combined both a critique of political pandering and actual political pandering.\nThere was a moment on Monday, before the speech, when it seemed as if Trump might depart from, yes, typical pandering for more than a split second.\nTrump has blamed Palestinians for the state of conflict in Israel and the West Bank, and stigmatized Islam repeatedly."}
