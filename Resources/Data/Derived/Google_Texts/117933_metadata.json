After all, the law is not only working as intended, but in some of the most crucial metrics \u2014 premium levels, federal budget costs \u2014 it is working considerably better than projected. Yet public approval has remained mediocre. The president settled on the fact that there are people benefiting from the law and they don\u2019t even know it. There\u2019s no card that says Obamacare.\n\nBut there is another possible explanation. The law\u2019s critics have consistently presented a much louder and more certain attack, and its supporters a more cautious and muted defense, and this has remained the case even though, on virtually every point, the critics have been wrong and the supporters right.\n\nHere is a small example of a dynamic that has repeated itself innumerable times in the five years since the Affordable Care Act passed. Every year, conservatives have proclaimed that premiums on the Obamacare exchanges would skyrocket to unaffordable levels, setting off a death spiral of fleeing consumers that would ultimately bring about the law\u2019s demise. Starting in 2013, the year the exchanges went online, critics predicted \u201cdouble-digit premium increases.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen, but critics of the law insisted that insurers were simply offering low teaser rates to attract customers. In 2014, rates would skyrocket. That also didn\u2019t happen. But in 2015, critics insisted, no seriously, this time there really would be gigantic spikes in premiums. In every case, the wave of scare stories was based on a handful of anecdotes \u2014 one insurance company here, a handful of firms there, rather than assessing the entire market. \"Health insurers are proposing to raise Obamacare rates more than in the past \u2014 some by more than 70 percent \u2014 now that they are finally equipped with all the information they need to price those plans,\" blared the lead in a story earlier this month in the Washington Examiner.\n\n\n\nYesterday, the Kaiser Family Foundation surveyed projected premiums in 11 major cities. The average benchmark premium is expected to rise 4.4 percent next year. That is a bit more than the historically low growth of recent years, but it is still quite low by historical standards. (It\u2019s half the rate of premium increases in the individual market in the years before Obamacare.) And it\u2019s nowhere near the shocking, skyrocketing figures that conservatives had confidently bandied about.\n\nYet Republicans have simply gone on repeating their previous claims as though they were true. \u201cMany of the proposed increases are eye-poppingly huge,\u201d cried Republican representative Peter Roskam. \u201cThe creation of an almost trillion-dollar federal government subsidy program has done little to mask the impact of Obamacare\u2019s biggest failure \u2014 skyrocketing premiums,\u201d said Republican Senator Orrin Hatch. There is apparently no cost whatsoever for Republicans repeating false claims about Obamacare. Every failed prediction of doom has simply been repeated anyway, until a new prediction of doom can be offered.\n\nIt is entirely possible that the same echo-chamber effect helped persuade the news media to treat the latest Obamacare lawsuit with far more seriousness than it deserved. As several legal analysts have explained, the merits of the lawsuit are simply open and shut. To win the lawsuit, opponents must prove that Congress unambiguously wrote the law to deny tax credits to federal exchanges \u2014 a conclusion that not only is not unambiguously true, it\u2019s clearly wrong and was actively disbelieved by everybody involved with the law, in both parties, until the a handful of right-wing lawyers concocted the theory after the fact. Why would the court take this lawsuit seriously, when it had already passed up on a chance to strike down Obamacare?\n\nThe King plaintiffs in the new #Obamacare Sup Ct case will win 7-2 (RBG and SS dissenting). You heard it here first. @CatoInstitute \u2014 Ilya Shapiro (@ishapiro) November 13, 2014\n\nThere was a chance, sure, because you never know. But the conservative movement created a sense of momentum and seriousness by treating the lawsuit not only as a possible long-shot attack on the law but a fait accompli. Just the other day, Paul Ryan, in a New York Times interview, invoked the lawsuit as if his side had already prevailed:\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of the end of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in an interview. \u201cThe key is to get into 2017,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the court ruling is so devastating to him. It will expose this law, and make it certain that Congress will be rewriting this law fully once he\u2019s gone.\u201d ... \u201cI think they cut corners trying to get this bill into law,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThose chickens are coming home to roost.\u201d If the court rules against Mr. Obama, he added, \u201cI think it\u2019s a huge blow to his efforts to create a legacy.\u201d\n\nIt turns out to be yet another confident prediction of doom that didn\u2019t happen. And now, if Ryan wants to pursue his dream of snatching insurance away from millions of people who are too sick or poor to afford it on their own, he\u2019ll have to win an election and pass a law.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "\u201cThis is the beginning of the end of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Paul Ryan yesterday.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "\u201cThis is the beginning of the end of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Paul Ryan yesterday.", "title": "Another Obamacare Doomsday Scenario Does Not Happen", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/another-obamacare-doom-scenario-does-not-happen.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/science/2015/06/25/25-barack-obama-white-house.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cThis is the beginning of the end of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Paul Ryan yesterday.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/science/2015/06/25/25-barack-obama-white-house.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Another Obamacare Doom Scenario Does Not Happen", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, obamacare, supreme court, barack obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,obamacare,supreme court,barack obama", "published_time": "2015-06-25T17:19:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, obamacare, supreme court, barack obama", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fc4\"", "article_summary": "It is entirely possible that the same echo-chamber effect helped persuade the news media to treat the latest Obamacare lawsuit with far more seriousness than it deserved.\nEvery failed prediction of doom has simply been repeated anyway, until a new prediction of doom can be offered.\nWhy would the court take this lawsuit seriously, when it had already passed up on a chance to strike down Obamacare?\nThe King plaintiffs in the new #Obamacare Sup Ct case will win 7-2 (RBG and SS dissenting).\nThe president settled on the fact that there are people benefiting from the law and they don\u2019t even know it."}
