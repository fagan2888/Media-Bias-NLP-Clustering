Throughout the month of November, we’re soliciting readers’ help to definitively answer an age-old question: Who is the actual worst character on television? We reviewed your submissions, did our own research, and came up with a list of 32 characters across four different categories, who’ll go head to head over the next four weeks until one of them is crowned as the most despicable, unlikeable, flat-out awful (fictional) person on the small screen.

See the bracket in its entirety here.

The Case for Jamm (Parks and Recreation)

NBC Why this character is the actual worst: An orthodontist by trade and a lover of satin bowling jackets by nature, Jeremy Jamm is best known as Leslie Knope’s loyal opposition on the Pawnee City Council. In that capacity, he is effectively an agent of chaos: He tries to defeat Leslie’s (usually extremely sensible) initiatives simply to keep progress from coming to Pawnee. You could look at him as a ridiculous rendering of the Tea Party caucus, or of Congress itself, or really of anyone who sees “compromise” as a kind of surrender: Stupidly obstinate and reflexively arrogant, he is a one-man proponent of the theory of Jamm Exceptionalism. Which is another way of saying that Jeremy Jamm is pretty much a distillation of everything that is currently wrong with the American political system. Worst moment/s: Any time he uses the phrase “you just got Jammed.” Worst trait/s: His weird, and mostly unexplained, obsession with defeating Leslie—an obsession that often borders on creepiness. (Remember when Jamm literally stink-bombed Leslie’s wedding, just because he could?) Redeeming moments/qualities: None. —Megan Garber
