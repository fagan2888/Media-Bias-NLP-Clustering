BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) â€” Jean-Baptiste Grange of France won the slalom title Sunday at the world championships after first-run leader Marcel Hirscher of Austria straddled a gate in deteriorating conditions.

Trailing by 0.88 seconds heading into the final run of the last race, Grange had no trouble with the heavy snow and low visibility as he finished in a combined time of 1 minute, 57.47 seconds. Fritz Dopfer of Germany was second, 0.35 seconds behind, and teammate Felix Neureuther earned bronze.

The results are unofficial while lower-tier racers still compete.

Hirscher, the defending champion, was dropping time when he went out with the finish line in sight. He lifted up his goggles and stared down the course in disbelief.

The 25-year-old Hirscher leaves Beaver Creek with gold in the Alpine combined and team event, along with a silver in the giant slalom.

American Ted Ligety finished 21st.
