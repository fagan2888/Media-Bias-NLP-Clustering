Its work should be completed by Nov. 1, in time for legislators to debate the merits when they gather in Salem next February.\n\nDr. Samuel Metz, member of Oregon Physicians for a National Health Program, applauded the decision. \u201dI am reassured the Oregon healthcare financing study will be conducted by an organization with experience, competence, and credibility. The Oregon Health Authority made a wise choice. The RAND Corporation has not conducted national or state health care financing studies, but it has, over several decades, performed highly respected studies comparing health insurance deductibles to outcomes. These results have been interpreted and misinterpreted to support or reject consumer directed healthcare plans.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, the Oregon Health Authority awarded the contract to RAND, one of three competitors, which requested $395,525 to conduct its work. The Public Consulting Group, Inc., also submitted a proposal for $324,000 along with the Wakely Consulting Group for $405,270.\n\nDuring the 2015 session, House Bill 2828 authorized the OHA to oversee a comprehensive study of healthcare financing in Oregon, one that will look at a number of possible situations, including single payer, a public option on the insurance exchange, and a full rollout of the Affordable Care Act, possibly with a Basic Health Plan for working-class residents.\n\nSen. Michael Dembrow, D-Portland, a long-time advocate of a single-payer system, fought hard for this study, and his legislation nearly died on the final day of the 2015 session, until Sen. Alan Bates, D-Ashland, changed his vote, \u201cwith two broken arms,\u201d and while he\u2019d offer his begrudging support, he highlighted the single-payer aspect of the study and described it as a lost cause.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to spend $300,000 in this state on something that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d said Bates, an osteopathic family physician. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend money on this [study] ever again. Our present healthcare system is barely sustainable and I don\u2019t want to put any more load on it.\u201d\n\nAccording to an earlier article in The Lund Report, Dembrow never regained the support of Hass or Winters, both of whom supported an unfunded study in 2013, along with Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose and three other Republicans, including Sen. Jeff Kruse of Roseburg. All Democrats\n\nand one Republican -- Rep. Andy Olson of Albany -- supported HB 2828 in an earlier House vote.\n\nNow that the study looked to actually be going forward, Johnson suddenly had concerns that it might be tainted by a small amount of private funding from the Northwest Health Foundation that will supplement state resources.\n\nDembrow highlighted the support of Oregon Health & Science University President Dr. Joe Robertson, the Oregon Public Health Association and the Oregon Medical Association. Aside from examining the expansion of a Medicare-like system -- the single-payer option -- Dembrow hinted that HB 2828 could give the state insights into less revolutionary reform efforts.\n\n\u201cThe results of this study could strengthen the existing CCO system,\u201d he said, referring to the coordinated care organizations that manage the Oregon Health Plan for low-income residents. Single-payer advocates have also said they will use the results of the study to serve as the backbone for a ballot measure charging the Oregon Legislature with implementing a universal healthcare system. Measure 91, legalizing recreational marijuana sales, was approved by the voters but carried out by the Legislature, and had a similar implementation structure.\n\nAlthough Dr. John Kitzhaber, the former Oregon governor, has always taken an ambivalent stance towards single payer, Kruse tied Kitzhaber to HB 2828 like an albatross, now that he no longer supports the study: \u201cOur former governor, who resigned in disgrace, was always a supporter of single payer. \u2026 Friends, a move to have the government take control of healthcare is one of the worst things we can do for our citizens.\u201d\n\nAnother Republican, Sen. Brian Boquist of McMinnville, was more judicious. He said he did not actually oppose the study, he just thought the Oregon Health Authority was wasting well more than $300,000 in its existing $19.5 billion budget through duplicative programming. \u201cWe just need to tell them to go study it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe contract calls for researchers to look specifically at four healthcare concepts: single payer, where the government would provide a program for everyone through taxes; a commercial insurance product for all with the essential health benefits of the Affordable Care Act; adding a public option and basic health plan insurance products to the federal exchange for Oregon; and the default, the current system under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe researchers must look at both costs and savings. They\u2019ll also have to identify a funding mechanism for the first option, a missing component that has stalled a single-payer system in Oregon.\n\nThis could be particularly tricky in Oregon since the state has long rejected a sales tax, and additional payroll or income taxes would come on top of the state\u2019s already very high personal income taxes. But Metz said an economist had already sent an idea to Health Care for All Oregon that would provide adequate funding by relying on a capital gains tax.\n\nBesides a complete overhaul, the study could show the path to smaller improvements, such as opening up a public option or coordinated care to more people, which might be accomplished with waivers from the federal government.\n\n\u201cIf everything goes well in the procurement from now on the contractor will have five months to complete a very complicated task,\u201d said Rep. Mitch Greenlick, D-Portland. \u201cI will be delighted if anything useful comes out of the study.\u201d\n\nDiane can be reached at diane@thelundreport.org.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "article_summary": "Dembrow highlighted the support of Oregon Health & Science University President Dr. Joe Robertson, the Oregon Public Health Association and the Oregon Medical Association.\nThe RAND Corporation has not conducted national or state health care financing studies, but it has, over several decades, performed highly respected studies comparing health insurance deductibles to outcomes.\nSupporters of a single-payer healthcare system couldn\u2019t be more pleased that the RAND Corporation was chosen to conduct an in-depth study on the most feasible way to achieve universal coverage.\n\u201dI am reassured the Oregon healthcare financing study will be conducted by an organization with experience, competence, and credibility.\nThe Oregon Health Authority made a wise choice."}
