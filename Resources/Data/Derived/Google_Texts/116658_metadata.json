Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\nTuesday night\u2019s two-hour event in Las Vegas was widely expected to be a two-person horserace between Clinton and Sanders, but the former Maryland governor held his own on a range of domestic and foreign policy issues.\n\nRelated: O\u2019Malley, the Dems\u2019 David, Could Use First Debate as His Slingshot\n\nO'Malley, who entered the race in May, has struggled to establish himself as a viable alternative to Clinton. His support hovering around just a few percentage points, Tuesday night's debate was his first opportunity to introduce himself to voters nationally. \u201cAfter 15 years of executive experience I have learned how to be an effective leader,\" O\u2019Malley said during his introduction before he rattled off his progressive bona fides, including expanding the DREAM Act at the state level and passing comprehensive gun safety legislation.\n\nFrom the opening moments of the debate, O\u2019Malley seemed to be reeling under tough questioning by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper about his \u201czero tolerance\u201d policing activities while Mayor of Baltimore that many linked to ongoing community unrest and last spring\u2019s riots.\n\nBut O\u2019Malley saw an opening when Clinton began berating Sanders, a self-described Democratic-socialist, for his opposition to gun control laws and his support for giving gun manufacturers immunity from prosecutions from mass shootings, like the recent tragedy in Oregon.\n\n\n\nWhen asked by Cooper whether Sanders was tough enough on guns, Clinton replied, \u201cNo, not at all. I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence. This has gone on for too long and it\u2019s time the entire country stood up to the NRA.\u201d\n\nRelated: Debate Night: 5 Critical Issues That Clinton and Sanders Will Clash Over\n\nO\u2019Malley boasted that as governor, he passed tough gun control legislation in the Maryland Assembly over considerable tough opposition. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re talking about these things, but I\u2019ve actually done them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe passed comprehensive gun safety legislation not by looking at what the polls said--we actually did it.\u201d\n\nWhen Sanders said he was limited in what he could do because he represents a rural state, O\u2019Malley replied that there are plenty of rural areas in Maryland that support hunting, yet he was able to pass legislation that respected the views of hunters, \u201cAnd we did it by leading with principle, not by pandering to the NRA.\u201d\n\nLater, O\u2019Malley didn\u2019t back down when the debate moved to national security and when the candidates would be willing to use military force.\n\n\u201cNo commander-in-chief should take the military option off the table,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Where Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley Stand on the Issues\n\nHe later used a question about the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, to chide Clinton\u2019s tenure as the nation\u2019s top diplomat.\n\nO\u2019Malley argued the assault showed, \u201cWe need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are who are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing though. O\u2019Malley seemed to get ahead of himself when addressing the topic of Russia\u2019s military build-up in Syria.\n\n\u201cI think Assad's invasion of Syria will be seen as a blunder,\" O'Malley said, mistakenly referring to the country\u2019s longtime president.\n\nBut he teamed up with Sanders to tangle with Clinton on fiscal policy, saying she doesn\u2019t want to reinstate Glass-Steagall, a Depression-Era law that separated the banking industry from the securities industry that was repealed in 1999.\n\nO\u2019Malley acknowledged that he was \u201cglad\u201d to support Clinton in 2008 \u201cbut something happened in between.\u201d\n\nHe criticized both Sanders and Clinton for \u201cold thinking\u201d when it comes to immigration, touting his efforts at the state level that he argued went further than President Obama on programs like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) that allows undocumented individuals who came to the U.S. as children to stay provided they meet certain requirements.\n\nWhile O\u2019Malley rose to the occasion, the two other Democratic contenders, former U.S. senator Jim Webb (VA) and former Rhode Island governor and U.S. senator Lincoln Chafee, were non-factors.\n\nMany of Webb\u2019s answers fell flat with the crowd and he spent most of the night bickering with Cooper for more face time.\n\nChafee, who at the beginning of the night called himself a \u201cblock of granite,\u201d gave perhaps the night\u2019s worst answer when he chalked up his opposition to Glass-Steagall to be newly arrived in the Senate following the death of his father.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re being a little rough on me,\u201d he said to Cooper.\n\nIn his closing statement, O\u2019Malley complimented his fellow contenders and drew a contrast with the two Republican presidential debates.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear anyone denigrate women\u201d or make racist comments or speak ill of another American \u201cbecause of their religious beliefs,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Desperate to gain some kind of traction in the polls, Martin O\u2019Malley deftly maneuvered through the Democratic Party\u2019s inaugural presidential debate to show he at least belongs on the same stage as former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the insurgent Sen.
