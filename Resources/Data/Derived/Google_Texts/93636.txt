Kamenetz Endorses Van Hollen For Senate

Rep. Chris Van Hollen received another endorsement Monday for his U.S. Senate, this time from Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz.

“Chris Van Hollen is ready to fight for Maryland values from day one,” Kamenetz said in a release from Van Hollen's campaign. “He will fight for the middle class each and every day, and he knows that equal work deserves equal pay. Chris will protect Social Security and Medicare, and he will lead the fight to expand Obamacare, not destroy it. I am proud to support Chris Van Hollen for the United States Senate.”

The Democrat from Montgomery County faces House colleague Rep. Donna Edwards of Montgomery County in the primary race for the seat held by the retiring Sen. Barbara Mikulski. The endorsement news comes two days after a Baltimore Sun/University of Baltimore poll found Edwards now holds a slim lead in what had been a close race between the two.

Van Hollen, the former chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has endorsements from the Baltimore County Council's Democrats, unions and many of the state's prominent Democratic elected officials, including Attorney General Brian Frosh, Montgomery County Executive Ike Leggett, Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker and 2014 gubernatorial candidate Heather Mizeur.
