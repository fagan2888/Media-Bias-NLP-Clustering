Renisha McBride, 19, grinning for the camera. And then, Ms. McBride, bloodied and lifeless on a porch.\n\nThe shooting ignited racial tensions here because the homeowner, Theodore P. Wafer, is white. But prosecutors did not make race an issue. They began their case by recounting the events that led to the death of Ms. McBride after she appeared at Mr. Wafer\u2019s front door in Dearborn Heights in the middle of a November night. Ms. McBride, who had been in a car accident, was unarmed when she approached the stranger\u2019s house, prosecutors say, but Mr. Wafer opened his front door and fired a shotgun at her head through a locked outer screen door.\n\n\u201cThe defendant in this case had other options,\u201d Danielle Hagaman-Clark, an assistant Wayne County prosecutor, told the jury in an opening statement, laying out the second-degree murder, manslaughter and weapons charges Mr. Wafer faces. \u201cHe could have called 911, but he didn\u2019t. His actions that night were unnecessary, unjustified and unreasonable.\u201d\n\nThe defense said that Mr. Wafer, 55, had been acting in self-defense, believing that someone \u2014 perhaps multiple people \u2014 was breaking into the small house where he lived alone. \u201cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u201d Cheryl Carpenter, Mr. Wafer\u2019s lawyer, bellowed at the top of her voice, portraying the pounding at his doors that she said Mr. Wafer was woken by before 5 a.m. on Nov. 2, 2013. The banging went on, from side door to front door, Ms. Carpenter said, as Mr. Wafer fumbled around, in terror, in the dark \u2014 unable to find his cellphone and only eventually getting his shotgun.\n\n\u201cHow would you feel if this is what you saw and went through at 4:30 in the morning one night?\u201d Ms. Carpenter asked the jurors in her opening statement. \u201cIf somebody is coming after you in your house, you have special protection.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Carpenter suggested that, in the darkness and rush of events, Mr. Wafer did not immediately know Ms. McBride\u2019s race or sex. But the case has stirred longstanding friction here and elsewhere, with some people likening it to racially charged shootings such as Trayvon Martin\u2019s in Florida.\n\nRacial tension can simmer just below the surface here, particularly in moments when life in Detroit, which is more than 80 percent black, intersects with life in neighboring suburbs like Dearborn Heights, which is more than 80 percent white. Some civil rights leaders here have suggested that Ms. McBride, who may have been seeking help after her car accident, was probably presumed to be threatening because she was black and that Mr. Wafer may be more likely to walk free because he is white.\n\nIn Michigan, a self-defense law allows deadly force only if a person \u201chonestly and reasonably believes\u201d that it is necessary to prevent an imminent death or great bodily harm. Under Michigan\u2019s so-called castle doctrine, there is no legal requirement for a person to retreat if inside his or her home.\n\nFor months, much had been unknown about the events that unfolded in the hours before Ms. McBride\u2019s death, and prosecutors indicated on Wednesday that the authorities may never know exactly where Ms. McBride was and what she was doing immediately before her death.\n\nIn the early morning hours, Ms. McBride \u2014 who had been drinking vodka and smoking marijuana with a friend, her friend testified on Wednesday \u2014 was in a car accident on a street within Detroit\u2019s city limits. She hit a parked car, and an autopsy later showed she had a blood alcohol level of more than twice the legal limit. Neighbors along the street testified that they had offered assistance to the young woman, who appeared to be injured and seemed disoriented, but that Ms. McBride had refused help and wandered away.\n\nSeveral hours later, and six blocks from the crash site, Ms. McBride appeared on Mr. Wafer\u2019s front porch. Her family has suggested that she may have come to the door seeking help. But Mr. Wafer\u2019s lawyers said she pounded repeatedly on the doors, broke part of a screen and a peephole, and may have left a muddy footprint on Mr. Wafer\u2019s air-conditioning unit. That might have given Ms. McBride a view inside a room where Mr. Wafer had been sleeping, the lawyers said.\n\n\u201cGet your mind set in Ted\u2019s mind,\u201d Ms. Carpenter told jurors, saying Mr. Wafer had no landline telephone and grew so frightened that \u201chis heart is coming out of his chest.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s still hoping, \u2018Go away, go away, go away, leave me alone,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nBut Ms. Hagaman-Clark, the prosecutor, said Mr. Wafer would have had to take the time to load his Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun, take a safety device off and pull a trigger that requires significant force. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some sort of hair-trigger device,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140723160227, "twitter": {"description": "Theodore P.
