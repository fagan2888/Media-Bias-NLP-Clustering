The Centennial location opened in 2011 and the Sheridan restaurant in 2012.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long before there was trouble between the new franchisees and corporate headquarters.\n\nSteak \u2018n Shake eventually sued the Baerns family in 2013 in federal court because they refused to sell menu items required by the chain. The family countered by saying it had been misled into believing the business was more profitable, that Colorado was an expensive territory and that they could only make money by running the business their own way.\n\nA judge agreed with Steak \u2018n Shake and ordered the locations to remove the chain\u2019s name and identifying logos. That meant the franchisees were forced to violate land leases that restricted the locations to be only Steak \u2018n Shakes.\n\nCaruso, in attempting to salvage his original sale, offered to broker a new sale and had two interested buyers, both of whom were already Steak \u2018n Shake franchisees, Caruso says in court papers.\n\nThe chain refused to allow it, Caruso said, because \u201c(Steak \u2018n Shake) believed that (the franchisees) could not handle running the two stores.\u201d\n\nWith little hope to get things running again, the Baernses accepted Steak \u2018n Shake\u2019s offer to buy the stores at $475,000 each. Although Caruso received much of that money, the Baernses still owe him about $2 million more, an amount he was awarded last year in a separate lawsuit he filed in Arapahoe County district court.\n\n\u201cSteak \u2018n Shake interfered with the sale of the restaurants not because it believed that the two exiting franchisees couldn\u2019t handle running the restaurants,\u201d Caruso\u2019s court brief says, \u201cbut rather to give Steak \u2018n Shake a distinct economic advantage when it purchased the restaurants for itself.\u201d\n\nLawyers for Steak \u2018n Shake had no comment about Caruso\u2019s allegations, but said they would be filing a response in court.\n\nThe case is slated for a July trial.\n\nBoth restaurants have been operating under Steak \u2018n Shake corporate leadership since late 2013.\n\nDavid Migoya: 303-954-1506, dmigoya@denverpost.com or twitter.com/davidmigoya\n\n.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Past owner: Steak \u2018n Shake kept him from collecting on sale of stores", "title": "Past owner: Steak \u2018n Shake kept him from collecting on sale of stores", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/14/past-owner-steak-n-shake-kept-him-from-collecting-on-sale-of-stores/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150414__steakshakep1-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150414__steakshakep1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-14T15:44:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T07:55:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Consumer news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded61\"", "article_summary": "A judge agreed with Steak \u2018n Shake and ordered the locations to remove the chain\u2019s name and identifying logos.\nThe two were the first Steak \u2018n Shake restaurants in Colorado.\nBoth restaurants have been operating under Steak \u2018n Shake corporate leadership since late 2013.\nSteak \u2018n Shake eventually sued the Baerns family in 2013 in federal court because they refused to sell menu items required by the chain.\nCaruso, in attempting to salvage his original sale, offered to broker a new sale and had two interested buyers, both of whom were already Steak \u2018n Shake franchisees, Caruso says in court papers."}
