(WTNH) \u2014 Hartford HealthCare is eliminating the equivalent of 335 full-time jobs, which will affect 418 staff members, due to cuts in reimbursements.\n\nOf the 418 people affected, 105 work in the eastern Connecticut hospitals, 71 work in central Connecticut hospitals, 68 work at Hartford Hospital, and 174 work outside hospitals.\n\nThis is the third round of layoffs in as many years for the company.\n\n\u201cDespite our best efforts to reduce costs and increase revenues this year, Hartford HealthCare faces additional Medicaid cuts, bringing our total Medicaid payment reductions from the State of Connecticut to more than $100 million over five years,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Flaks, executive vice president and chief operating officer, in a letter to all staff on Wednesday.\n\nMichelle Sharp, with the Connecticut Hospital Association, says the newest budget is devastating to hospitals who are already on the ropes.\n\n\u201cSo the state budget as it stands today would impose a hospital tax of $350 million a year on hospitals and cut Medicaid and other programs by $58 million a year. That is going to have a huge negative impact on the hospitals, their patients, on their communities, on jobs, and on the economy, so it\u2019s going to force hospitals to make some very difficult decisions,\u201d she said.\n\nLawmakers are working towards a special secession to revisit the budget, but for now, Robbin, a healthcare worker, can\u2019t believe the taxes and cuts.\n\n\u201cIt hit home, but I\u2019m not really thinking about myself, I\u2019m thinking about the state as a whole,\u201d she said.\n\nHartford healthcare says layoff notices will be sent out in the next few weeks.\n\nIn addition to the job cuts, Hartford HealthCare says it\u2019s also looking at reducing and consolidating some programs and services to create additional efficiencies and lower costs. The company says specific details are still being worked out.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Hartford, Connecticut, CT, Hartford Healthcare, layoffs, jobs, cuts", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488522642", "og": {"site_name": "WTNH Connecticut News", "description": "Hartford HealthCare is eliminating the equivalent of 335 full-time jobs, which will affect 418 staff members, due to cuts in reimbursements.", "title": "Hartford HealthCare job cuts to affect more than 400 workers", "url": "http://wtnh.com/2015/06/17/hartford-healthcare-cutting-jobs/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://lintvwtnh.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/hartford-hospital.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hartford HealthCare is eliminating the equivalent of 335 full-time jobs, which will affect 418 staff members, due to cuts in reimbursements.", "title": "Hartford HealthCare job cuts to affect more than 400 workers", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwtnh.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/hartford-hospital.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WTNH", "site": "@wtnh", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Business, Connecticut, Hartford County, Connecticut News, News, Top Video, Video,Bob Wilson, WTNH Reporter and Matt Buynak, WTNH.com Staff", "msapplication-tooltip": "Connecticut News, CT Weather, Conn Traffic and Roads", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wtnh", "fb": {"pages": 48010180735}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtnh.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/4eb8f03fcc8a8756ac275dd34c27b214?s=16", "application-name": "WTNH Connecticut News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WTNH8", "published_time": "2015-06-17T19:48:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-18T02:25:15+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "ZhFDO7qoefSEo7HNtJIuKwhzd9Scb3I7EiPvU_GALiE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Hartford HealthCare is eliminating the equivalent of 335 full-time jobs, which will affect 418 staff members, due to cuts in reimbursements."}, "article_summary": "In addition to the job cuts, Hartford HealthCare says it\u2019s also looking at reducing and consolidating some programs and services to create additional efficiencies and lower costs.\nHARTFORD, Conn.
