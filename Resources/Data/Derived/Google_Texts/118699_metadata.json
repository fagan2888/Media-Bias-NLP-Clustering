The massive service workers\u2019 union, UNITE HERE, which boasts more than 265,000 members, has issued a scathing study that accuses ObamaCare of worsening \u201cincome inequality.\u201d Those are fighting words among Democrats, who have settled on accusing Republicans of fostering income disparity in a bid to hold the Senate this fall. With culinary workers in Las Vegas threatening to shut down the Strip with an ObamaCare-fueled strike, the issue is reaching a boiling point for already-divided Democrats. Big labor\u2019s complaint about the law relates to targeted taxes that penalize benefits plans that provide \u201cCadillac\u201d health coverage. Such benefits are the key selling point for many unions. ObamaCare poses a major threat to already flagging private-sector union membership. The report reads like a ransom not to the president and vulnerable Democrats, deliver another carve out or face the wrath of the groups that fund and provide foot-soldiers for Democrats: \u201cHaving already made efforts to accommodate businesses, churches and congressional staff, it is ironic that the administration is now highlighting issues of economic inequality without acting to preserve health plans that have been achieving the goals of the ACA for decades.\u201d\n\nPay cut - Washington Examiner: \u201c[The union] warned that due to Obamacare\u2019s much higher costs for health insurance than what union workers currently pay, the result will be a pay cut of up to $5 an hour. \u2018If employers follow the incentives in the law, they will push families onto the exchanges to buy coverage. This will force low-wage service industry employees to spend $2.00, $3.00 or even $5.00 an hour of their pay to buy similar coverage.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nTHREE HOTS, A COT AND OBAMACARE FOR PRISONERS\n\nNYT: \u201c\u2026jails and prisons around the country are beginning to sign up inmates for health insurance under the law, taking advantage of the expansion of Medicaid that allows states to extend coverage to single and childless adults \u2014 a major part of the prison population\u2026 Although Medicaid does not cover standard health care for inmates, it can pay for their hospital stays beyond 24 hours \u2013 meaning states can transfer millions of dollars of obligations to the federal government. But the most important benefit of the program, corrections officials say, is that inmates who are enrolled in Medicaid while in jail or prison can have coverage after they get out. People coming out of jail or prison have disproportionately high rates of chronic diseases, especially mental illness and addictive disorders. Few, however, have insurance, and many would qualify for Medicaid under the income test for the program \u2014 138 percent of the poverty line \u2014 in the 25 states that have elected to expand their programs. Health care experts estimate that up to 35 percent of those newly eligible for Medicaid under Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law are people with histories of criminal justice system involvement, including jail and prison inmates and those on parole or probation.\u201d\n\n[Flashback - Jailhouse navigators find captive audience for ObamaCare - Daily Caller: \u201c\u2026billionaire George Soros and the Obama administration help fund the Chicago nonprofit that set up Obamacare enrollment programs for prison inmates. Chicago-based Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC) helped establish Obamacare enrollment programs for prisoners at Chicago\u2019s Cook County Jail.\u201d]\n\nMystery numbers: Officials not tracking rate hikes for cancelled plans - Denver Post: \u201cIn some cases, people whose policies were canceled are finding that new, [ObamaCare] compliant insurance is more expensive\u2026. But Colorado\u2019s insurance division is not tracking what happens to premiums as policyholders move to ACA-compliant plans, so it\u2019s not known how many people are facing premium hikes and how steep those increases are.\u201d\n\nRise of the \u2018uber presidency\u2019 - George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley explores what he says is President Obama\u2019s \u2018power grab\u2019: \u201cThe United States is at a constitutional tipping point: The rise of an uber presidency unchecked by the other two branches. This massive shift of authority threatens the stability and functionality of our tripartite system of checks and balances. \u2026 In this sense, Obama is not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he has become the very danger that separation of powers was designed to avoid\u2026To be clear, President Obama is not a dictator, but there is a danger in his aggregation of executive power.\u201d\n\nHOT AIR: SENATE DEMS HOLD GLOBAL WARMING TALK-A-THON\n\nIt may seem helpful to his goal of retaining the Senate, but Majority Leader Harry Reid is allowing the most liberal members of his party to make noise about climate change all night long. The issue is murder on the red-state Democrats who\u2019s survival is key to keeping Reid in power. But for the liberal activists and corporate donors who keep the party chugging, it\u2019s a must-do. In contrast to the epic Republican floor speeches of late, like the drone filibuster from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and the day-long floor speech on ObamaCare from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tonight\u2019s antics are leadership-sanctioned. Sen. Brian Schatz D-Hawaii, who is facing a thorny primary challenge back home, is leading the effort. Participants will include Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn.\n\nByronic explainer - Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York: \u201cDemocrats know where their money is coming from.[Tom Steyer] founded a political action committee called NextGen Climate Action and has announced plans to spend $100 million in the 2014 midterm elections \u2018to pressure federal and state officials to enact climate change measures through a hard-edge campaign of attack ads against governors and lawmakers,\u2019 according to a New York Times report. An all-night talkathon is not exactly bold action. But perhaps it\u2019s enough for Democrats to show their big-money donors that they\u2019re doing something.\u201d\n\n[Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel has the latest on the Senate Dems all-nighter.]\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nIn the first of a three-part series, James Pinkerton considers Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the politics of an aging nation: \u201c\u2026 [I]f tens of millions of Americans develop [Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related] dementia\u2014a condition requiring 24/7 care that can last for years\u2014then we face a catastrophic fiscal and ethical crisis in the decades ahead. \u2026 Lack of interest from liberals might be explicable, because, after all, the Democrats have made health insurance, as opposed to health itself, their big cause\u2026 Improving the medical health of Americans could indeed be one such way [for the GOP] to break through to alienated swing voters\u2026 In a public health emergency\u2026 action is needed. It needn\u2019t be bureaucratic action, but it has to be some sort of action. That\u2019s a medical imperative, and, for Republicans, it\u2019s also a political imperative.\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Bill Young, R-Fla. Democrats were banking on a win in the increasingly blue Pinellas County district after recruiting 2010 gubernatorial nominee Alex Sink to run. The district was Sink\u2019s only bright spot in her failed bid four years ago. But, as Slate\u2019s Dave Weigel points out, the district is \u201cObamacare\u2019s Ground Zero.\u201d From Weigel: \u201cRepublicans watched the county go for George W. Bush, then for Barack Obama, then for Barack Obama again. They watched it vote for Alex Sink, in 2010, when she ran for governor\u2026A drive through the district, which covers all but the most urban parts of Pinellas, doubles as a tour of an Obamacare panic zone\u2026\u201d The takeaway: If Sink can find a way to hold on, Democrats may feel emboldened to defend the president\u2019s troubled law. If she stumbled, Democrats will again sound the retreat.\n\nEarly votes suggest squeaker - Tampa Bay Times: \u201cAs of Saturday, about 117,000 ballots had been cast in Pinellas County\u2019s special election for Congressional District 13 \u2026Republicans had a 4,515-vote advantage over Democrats in District 13 and likely will cast significantly more votes on election day than Democrats. It still may not be enough for [Republican David Jolly], given the way swing voters ultimately pick the winner in this centrist district. Consider that in 2012, Republicans had cast nearly 11,000 more votes than Democrats by election day and then outperformed Democrats on election day by more than 9,000 votes. Barack Obama still narrowly won the district. In 2010, Republicans had a nearly 12,400-vote lead prior to election day and then on election day cast more than 8,600 more votes than Democrats. Sink still narrowly beat Republican Rick Scott in the district. It\u2019s shaping up to be a squeaker, but giving the recent track record of District 13 voters, Jolly needs an even stronger GOP surge in the final stretch and on Tuesday. If it\u2019s really close, we may not know the winner for sure until March 21, the deadline for overseas ballots to arrive.\u201d\n\nRUBIO TO ROLL OUT ECONOMIC PLAN\n\nWSJ: \u201c[Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.] will use the Washington speech, hosted by Google Inc. and the Jack Kemp Foundation, to propose streamlining the federal regulatory review process for natural-gas pipelines, creating a system to monitor the impact of regulations, expanding access to the wireless spectrum and more closely coordinating research breakthroughs between the government and private businesses, among other things. In an interview, Mr. Rubio said the speech is meant to advance discussions about the best way to expedite economic growth. The U.S. isn\u2019t as competitive as it used to be, he said, blaming that loss of vitality on \u2018our tax laws, our regulatory structure and our national debt.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nGOP FRONTRUNNERS STAKE OUT PUTIN POSITIONS\n\nFox News: \u201c[On \u2018Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace,\u2019 Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.] defended his foreign policy views, including his position that the United States should seek \u2018respectful\u2019 relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sent troops into the Crimea region of Ukraine amid the country\u2019s political turmoil. Paul said he would warn Putin that he\u2019s creating \u201cchaos\u201d and potentially the next Syria-type crisis. He also said he embraces the Reagan maxim of \u2018Don\u2019t mistake our reluctance for war for a lack of resolve.\u2019 Said Paul: \u2018People still need to know this. Were I in charge, I think they would\u2019\u201d\n\n[Rand Paul claims Ronald Reagan\u2019s foreign policy mantle in his Breitbart column today.]\n\nWashington Examiner: \u201cSen. Ted Cruz said President Obama\u2019s \u2018weakness\u2019 has embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin to act militarily in Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region. \u2018Putin fears no retribution\u2019 from the United States, said the Texas Republican in an interview shown Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u2018This Week\u2019 Cruz, who called Putin a \u2018KGB thug,\u2019 said the Obama administration\u2019s policy has been to \u2018alienate and abandon\u2019 U.S. allies and to \u2018coddle and appease our enemies\u2019\u2026 Cruz also criticized fellow conservative GOP Sen. Rand Paul for the Kentuckian\u2019s recent comments that the U.S. should have a \u201crespectful\u201d relationship with Russia. \u2018I\u2019m a big fan of Rand Paul, he and I are good friends; I don\u2019t agree with him on foreign policy,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\n[Watch Fox: Sen.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., the likely GOP challenger to embattled Sen. Mark Pryor. Pryor tops the list of incumbent Senate Democrats in red states who are vulnerable due to President Obama\u2019s low approval and the unpopularity of ObamaCare. Mitt Romney carried Arkansas by 23 percent in the 2012 presidential election. Watch the interview here.\n\nIf you feel the need to say so\u2026 - \u201cYou can look at the whole tape that MSNBC ran -- and I thought it was fair -- one of the things I said is that I\u2019m very supportive of veterans and very appreciate [sic] to all veterans including my opponent.\u201d \u2013 Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., explaining in an interview why he, who holds his father\u2019s Senate seat, rebuked Republican challenger Rep. Tom Cotton for thinking his service in Iraq and Afghanistan \u201centitled\u201d him to a Senate seat.\n\nBEGICH GETS ON KOCH\n\nSen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, debuts his first television ad today. Like other struggling Democrats, Begich is focusing on Charles and David Koch, the oil-industry billionaires who launched Americans for Prosperity, the group that has been assailing Begich\u2019s record on air for weeks. From Begich\u2019s ad: \u201cFirst it was a D.C. actress pretending to be an Alaskan\u2026Now ads attacking Mark Begich on a carbon tax have been called false and not true.\u201d The oil business is crucial to Alaska\u2019s economy, so Koch attacks are riskier there. Begich tries to finesse that angle by criticizing Koch Industries for closing an Alaska refinery.\n\nPICK SIX: THUMBS UP IN MICHIGAN?\n\nRepublicans need to gain six seats to take control of the Senate.

It was carried twice by Barack Obama, and if you array the states in order of Obama 2012 percentage it was the state that cast the 270th electoral vote for him. So although Obama did just slightly better in Colorado (51 percent-46 percent) than nationally (51percent-47 percent), Colorado was arguably the median state in the political spectrum. Entering the 2014 electoral cycle, Colorado had two apparently popular candidates for reelection, Governor John Hickenlooper and Senator Mark Udall. But they have not been faring well in public polls, as I have noted several times.\u201d\n\nNOT EXACTLY RED MEAT FOR KANSAS DEMOCRATS\n\nKansas Gov. Sam Brownback has been sagging in the polls, but the Democratic brand is in such poor repair in Kansas that he still may be hard to unseat this year. Hence a novel approach unveiled by the state party at its convention this weekend. Wichita Eagle: \u201c\u2026Democratic leaders expressed confidence about the party\u2019s chances to win the governor\u2019s race with House Minority Leader Paul Davis \u2013 plus a few House seats in November\u2019s election. Their strategy is simple: Convince moderate Republicans dissatisfied with the conservative wing of the GOP that they have a place underneath the Democratic Party\u2019s big tent\u2026 \u2018This election is not about putting a Democrat in the governor\u2019s office. It\u2019s about putting a commonsense Kansan in the governor\u2019s office.\u2019\u201d\n\n[Minnesota Republican Senate frontrunner Mike McFadden has released a new Web video chronicling a day on the campaign trail. \u201cAnd Republicans, we are as bad as Democrats and it\u2019s killing us\u2026we have too many people in Washington that are there because they just want to be something\u2026\u201d]\n\nAlready in the barn - Des Moines Register: \u201cThe Des Moines Register\u2019s latest Iowa Poll shows 63 percent of Iowans approve of the job [Gov.
