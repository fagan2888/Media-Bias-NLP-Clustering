The memorial education fund will support the couple\u2019s daughter, Georgia, 2, and a baby soon to be born.\n\nHam shared the news in an Instagram post, followed by several other photos of the couple.\n\nWe lost our Jake yesterday, and I lost part of my heart and the father of my sweet babies. I don\u2019t have to tell most of you how wonderful he was. It was self-evident. His life was his testimony, and it was powerful and tender and fierce, with an ever-present twinkle in the eye. I will miss him forever, even more than I can know right now. No arms can be her father\u2019s, but my daughter is surrounded by her very favorite people and all the hugs she could imagine. This will change us, but with prayer and love and the strength that is their companion, we can hope our heartache is not in vain\u2013 that it will change us and the world in beautiful ways, just as he did. If that sounds too optimistic at this time, it\u2019s because it is. But there was no thought too optimistic for Jake, so take it and run with it. I will strive and pray not to feel I was cheated of many years with him, but cherish the gift of the years I had. In a life where nothing is guaranteed, Jake made the absolute, ever-lovin\u2019 most of his time with all of us. This is a family picture we took a couple weeks ago. It was taken because Jake, as always, was ready with a camera and his immense talent. All four members of our little, growing family are in it. I can never be without him because these babies are half him. They are made of some of the strongest, kindest stuff God had to offer this world. Please pray that he can see us and we\u2019ll all make him proud. God, I love him.

We set out to recruit the best of the best to join their government and help us harness the power of technology and data to innovate new solutions for the 21st century. Simply put, Jake was one of the best. Armed with a brilliant mind, a big heart, and an insatiable desire to give back, Jake devoted his life to empowering people and making government work better for them. He worked to give citizens a louder voice in our society. He engaged our striving immigrants. He pushed for more transparency in our democracy. And he sought to expand opportunity for all. I\u2019ve often said that today\u2019s younger generation is smarter, more determined, and more capable of making a difference than I was as a young man. Jake was proof of that. Michelle and I are praying for all of Jake\u2019s family and his many friends, most of all his wife, Mary Katharine Ham, their daughter, Georgia, and their growing family. They\u2019ll always have a family here at the White House.\n\nThe memorial fund was started Sunday afternoon by Guy Benson, co-author with Ham of \u201cEnd of Discussion.\u201d He set a goal of $200,000; half of the money was raised by 11 p.m. Sunday. Benson said the contributors will provide for the Brewers\u2019 education.\n\nHam encouraged others to donate to the Travis Manion Foundation in support of families of U.S. servicemen who have died.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A memorial fund was created to support the children of Jake Brewer, a White House staffer and Mary Katharine Ham's husband, who died in a charity bike ride.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A memorial fund was created to support the children of Jake Brewer, a White House staffer and Mary Katharine Ham's husband, who died in a charity bike ride.", "title": "Memorial Fund Created for Jake Brewer's Children", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150921_JakeBrewer.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-23T15:13:18+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PjbzdD"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A memorial fund was created to support the children of Jake Brewer, a White House staffer and Mary Katharine Ham's husband, who died in a charity bike ride.", "title": "Memorial Fund Created for Jake Brewer's Children", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150921_JakeBrewer.jpg"}, "creator": "@RobertBluey", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2015-09-21T07:00:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-23T15:13:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "jake brewer, mary katharine ham, bike accident, white house, barack obama, guy benson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8aeb\"", "article_summary": "A memorial fund created to support the children of Jake Brewer, a White House staffer who died during a charity bike ride Saturday, reached its $200,000 goal in donations a day after it was launched.\nThe memorial education fund will support the couple\u2019s daughter, Georgia, 2, and a baby soon to be born.\nBrewer, 34, was married to Mary Katharine Ham, a former Heritage Foundation employee who is the editor at large of HotAir.com and a Fox News contributor.\nThe memorial fund was started Sunday afternoon by Guy Benson, co-author with Ham of \u201cEnd of Discussion.\u201d He set a goal of $200,000; half of the money was raised by 11 p.m. Sunday.\nWe lost our Jake yesterday, and I lost part of my heart and the father of my sweet babies."}
