The other is the 225-year period when a \u201cFor Men Only\u201d sign has hung over the door to the Oval Office.\n\nPHOTOS: Christians in Hollywood\n\nMrs. Fiorina has no problem breaking glass to do it, candidly discussing what she sees as the foreign policy failures of George W. Bush, her opposition to amnesty and her disdain for crony capitalism that marries government interests to Wall Street.\n\nShe also doesn\u2019t mince words when it comes to problems she sees with big-government liberals. She cited the example of Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber, who was captured on video boasting that Americans were too stupid to understand the law.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that they care about helping people, but I also don\u2019t doubt that in their heart of hearts a lot of them think they are smarter than you are, better than you are, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re going to decide for you,\u201d Mrs. Fiorina said in a wide-ranging interview with The Washington Times.\n\nPHOTOS: Best handguns ever made\n\nIn that respect, she said, they are a lot like some CEOs who decide for other people rather than listen to their customers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think President Obama spends an awful lot of time consulting with other people,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s smarter than everyone else. He\u2019s pretty much said so.\u201d\n\nAt age 60, Mrs. Fiorina doesn\u2019t need another career. She is a comfortable millionaire who proved she could run a tech giant effectively in a once male-dominated Silicon Valley. She has tested politics by running in 2010 for the Senate against Barbara Boxer in California and losing by 10 points. She is chairwoman of the influential American Conservative Union Foundation, a perch that lends her plenty of opportunity to shape policy and rub elbows in Washington.\n\nBut she aspires to do more to countervail the liberal forces of the Warrens, Obamas, Clintons and Grubers of the world. So she is boning up on policy and preparing for a possible run for president against a slate of all-male Republican rivals. If she dives into the race, she plans to stand out against the rest of the field.\n\nSince the days of Ronald Reagan, Republican presidential aspirants have claimed fealty to conservatism\u2019s holy trinity of free markets, traditional values and a strong military.\n\nMrs. Fiorina agrees with those principles but adds one of her own.\n\n\u201cThe philosophy of conservatism is that no one of us is any better than any other one of us,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone has gifts, everyone wants to live a life of dignity and purpose and meaning, and everyone can do that.\n\n\u201cLiberals don\u2019t believe that, and that is the core difference between liberals and conservatives, because liberals think some are smarter than others,\u201d she said.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t shrink from answering the question of why a technology executive who ran a company of 180,000 workers with little political experience thinks she is qualified to run a nation of more than 300 million.\n\n\u201cA large part of our problem is that we have so many people in elective office, including the president, who have done nothing but government and politics all their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cSo maybe they know government, but so far government isn\u2019t working real well.\u201d\n\nMrs. Fiorina said the next president needs to have \u201creal experience in making tough decisions in tough circumstances and will need to know how bureaucracies work and know technology.\u201d\n\nWhy technology?\n\n\u201cBecause it is a transformative tool that is never used to its full extent here in Washington,\u201d she said.\n\nBesides, she asks, \u201cwhen did we come up with this idea that only a professional politician could run for office? It\u2019s a modern and not particularly good invention. And it\u2019s not the way our republic ran for 150-plus years.\u201d\n\n\u2018Warren is right\u2019\n\nAfter every question, she pauses for a second or two before responding with a cascade of complete, clear, grammatically correct sentences, not interrupted by even a single thought-collecting \u201cum\u201d or \u201cah\u201d or \u201cyou know.\u201d\n\nAt first, Mrs. Fiorina sounds almost like a comrade-in-arms with the more liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, noting that both women want to find ways to end what they regard as an unholy alliance between Wall Street and its cronies in the executive branch of the federal government.\n\nIt\u2019s been going on under Republican and Democratic presidents, she said.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren is right. We have crony capitalism in this country,\u201d Mrs. Fiorina said of the woman who was a Harvard law professor and is the No. 1 liberal heartthrob in the Senate.\n\nMany liberals say they would give their eye teeth to see Mrs. Warren contest former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Some on the left see Mrs. Clinton as having no degrees of separation from the economic ravagers of Wall Street.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a free market in this country today. We have crony capitalism, which is why small businesses are folding up and going away,\u201d Mrs. Fiorina said. \u201cIt\u2019s why more of them are being destroyed than being created.\u201d\n\nMrs. Fiorina\u2019s apparent consonance with Mrs. Warren vanishes quickly.\n\n\u201cWarren\u2019s wrong about the answer to crony capitalism. It\u2019s not more big government, which only creates more crony capitalism,\u201d she said. \u201cThe answer is less government, radical simplification, real government reform \u2014 not just enough to lower tax rates. You have to simplify the tax codes.\u201d\n\nMrs. Fiorina\u2019s worldview was shaped by her winding journey from receptionist with a Stanford University degree in medieval history and philosophy and law school dropout to division chairman of Lucent Technologies, and then head of everything at Hewlett-Packard.\n\n\u201cI was raised conservative, but I wasn\u2019t politically active for a very long time,\u201d she said. \u201cSo while I grew up listening to my father rail against the evening news and The New York Times, I would say, \u2018Daddy, why do you read it? It makes you so upset.\u2019 But he liked a good fight, right? But I wasn\u2019t active \u2014 didn\u2019t think about how to apply those principles particularly.\n\n\u201cThe way I became a conservative was actually through business,\u201d she said. \u201cI figured out that when I had a tough problem, the person in my organization I least expected turned out to be the person who could help me solve it. In other words, I figured out that everyone around me has potential. Everyone has gifts.\u201d\n\nDespite her five-star work resume, she said skill and experience in managing a large bureaucracy takes second place to qualifications for president.\n\n\u201cIf I could only pick one, I would say a coherent worldview\u201d because it takes that to understand why and how \u201cgovernment now has to be fundamentally reformed, not tinkered with,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAn understanding of how bureaucracies work and how they can be changed is also very important,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t important 100 years ago, but it is now.\u201d\n\nThough Mrs. Fiorina hasn\u2019t formally announced her candidacy, she is formulating policy positions.\n\nShe said she won\u2019t even consider giving the millions of people who entered the United States illegally an opportunity to gain citizenship status. Once the U.S. border is fully secured, she said, only then would she consider granting legal work status.\n\nThat raises the related question of why she thinks the federal government can afford to spend billions more dollars attempting to create an impermeable border wall when it is already spending hundreds of billions of dollars fighting wars abroad.\n\n\u201cYou should ask President Obama,\u201d she retorted.\n\nBut the Afghanistan and Iraq wars were begun by President George W. Bush and not by Mr. Obama.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe mismanaged going into Iraq and getting out.\n\n\u201cIt was totally realistic for us to go into Afghanistan to deny al Qaeda a safe haven,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was foolish was to say we\u2019re going to build a central government where none has existed for 2,000 years. That\u2019s called nation-building. That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t mistake Mrs. Fiorina as a pacifist, even if she finds fault in both of the past presidents\u2019 approaches to fighting terrorism.\n\n\u201cThere are times when we must protect our interests and those of our allies,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s unrealistic to say we\u2019re never going to get into wars.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carly Fiorina, who rose to power in corporate America to become Hewlett-Packard's first female chairman and CEO, is aiming to smash two more glass ceilings, but this time in politics.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Carly Fiorina, who rose to power in corporate America to become Hewlett-Packard\u2019s first female chairman and CEO, is aiming to smash two more glass ceilings, but this time in politics.", "title": "Carly Fiorina aims to smash politics\u2019 glass ceiling, liberal elitism, crony capitalism", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/16/carly-fiorina-aims-to-smash-politics-glass-ceiling/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/16/2_162015_ap3580210662608201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/16/2_162015_ap3580210662608201.jpg", "description": "Carly Fiorina, who rose to power in corporate America to become Hewlett-Packard's first female chairman and CEO, is aiming to smash two more glass ceilings, but this time in politics.", "card": "summary", "title": "Carly Fiorina aims to smash politics\u2019 glass ceiling, liberal eli"}, "Author": "Ralph Z.
