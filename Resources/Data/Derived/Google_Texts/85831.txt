NORTH AUGUSTA, S.C.(WRDW)-- The deadline to avoid a fee when it comes to healthcare passed but it doesn't mean you're off the hook when it comes to filing your taxes.

Kathryn Playford reviewed the South Carolina Marketplace, but no matter how many ways she added it up, she said she couldn't afford Obamacare. "There is no way I can make a thousand dollar deductible," she said. "The insurance is more than I can afford to pay out monthly...we make just enough money to miss the earned income credit so that doesn't help either," she added.

Playford and her husband opted out of Obamacare but are now paying the price on their tax returns. "I filed our taxes. We filed jointly and we are getting $45 back with two kids," she said. "We normally get back $1000-$ 2000."

Steve Harvey, E.A. with H&R Block said one of the biggest tax changes this year is the penalty for not enrolling in a health insurance plan; it's almost doubled. "A family of four making $60,000, if they don't have insurance, it's about $975," Harvey said.

And, for those people who have enrolled in Obamacare, they will see changes filing taxes too. "The other change this year is more documents are required . There is a form A, form A 1095, there is a 1095 B and C.," Harvey said.

The IRS will not allow you to file without form 1095-A if you have Obamacare. If you have Obamacare, you will get form 1095-A in the mail. You must fill it out and file it with your taxes.

Forms 1095-B and 1095-C are for people who have insurance through their work or a private company.
