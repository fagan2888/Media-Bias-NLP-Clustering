Don Young stopped in Ketchikan on Friday, and spoke during a special Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce lunch. He addressed some of his favorite issues: Federal regulatory overreach, the need to increase manufacturing in the United States, the need for a new president \u2013 but not Clinton \u2013 and how much he loves working for Alaska.\n\nRep. Don Young said Alaska\u2019s current budget woes could have been avoided if state lawmakers had listened to him back in the 1980s, when a similar drop in oil prices led to a similar budget deficit.\n\n\u201cI kept telling them: You\u2019ve got to diversify into an economic plan that keeps the budget stable and not depend on one industry. And the state didn\u2019t listen.\u201d\n\nHe said oil prices rebounded then and the state continued to rely on oil tax revenue for most of its income. If it had instead invested more in fisheries, tourism and timber, Young said, Alaska wouldn\u2019t be facing a $4 billion deficit now.\n\nHe said Alaska is sitting on a gold mine, if it\u2019s managed correctly.\n\n\u201cThe one bad part about it: We can manage it correctly, but we have what I call a nasty landlord. That nasty landlord is the federal government, and the utilization of regulations is stifling this country and this state.\u201d\n\nIn hopes of alleviating that problem somewhat, Young has introduced a measure that would transfer 2 million acres of the Tongass National Forest to state ownership. He said Alaska still hasn\u2019t received all the land it was promised at statehood, so a transfer makes sense.\n\nYoung said he believes the bill will succeed in Congress, and if it also makes it past the president \u2013 although probably not the current one \u2013 Young said the state then can use its new acreage for logging.\n\nYoung often addresses the issue of manufacturing, and how those jobs no longer exist \u2013 at least not in large numbers \u2013 in the United States. He told the Chamber audience that the national debt continues to increase because the country no longer makes its own stuff.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all guilty. Each one in this room is guilty. I challenge all of you to take all the clothes off your body not made in the United States. What do I have? I got a bunch of naked people. And that\u2019s not too attractive, I\u2019ll tell you right now. We\u2019re all guilty because we buy from abroad, using borrowed dollars to buy.\u201d\n\nTerry Wanzer, a local business owner, asked Young about the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare. Young said it\u2019s the worst piece of legislation ever passed, but he doesn\u2019t believe it ever will be fully repealed.\n\n\u201cOnce you give birth to something like that, it\u2019s pretty hard to put it back in the toothpaste tube.\u201d\n\nInstead, Young said, he hopes to revise the national healthcare reform measure.\n\nAnother audience member expressed concern that President Barack Obama will use his power to declare national monuments to put more of Southeast Alaska off limits to resource extraction.\n\nYoung said it\u2019s likely the president will try and if he succeeds, the only way to repeal it would be by another president. But, he said, Hillary Clinton won\u2019t do it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right up front with you: I am not a Hillary supporter. I remember her when she had braces on her teeth and long braids. She was a prosecutor to Richard Nixon as an intern in law school. She was a little snit then and she\u2019s a big snit now.\u201d\n\nDick Coose, a Ketchikan City Council member, expressed concern about President Obama obstructing Congress.\n\n\u201cWe send a Republican Congress back there and got nowhere,\u201d Coose said. \u201cThe traitor sitting in the White House just gives you the finger. What are we going to do about it?\u201d\n\nYoung responded that it\u2019s partly Congress\u2019 fault, for not working together and for removing the power of earmarks.\n\n\u201cWithout earmarks I have no way to make that kid get his hand out of the cookie jar, or put it in. I had the Transportation Committee and I was very proud of it. I had 75 votes, half Democrats and half Republican and they all voted with me. One of the reasons I had power over them: I could reward or I could punish.\u201d\n\nYoung briefly addressed his bid for re-election and the recent announcement of a new candidate: Steve Lindbeck, who is running as a Democrat.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to come down and say we need a new face. Maybe. But keep in mind this congressman \u2014 your congressman \u2014 has signed into law by presidents more than any other legislator to date. I think that\u2019s a pretty successful job.\u201d\n\nYoung will turn 83 in June. If re-elected, this will be his 23rd term as Alaska\u2019s only congressman.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "MasterSlider 2.12.2 - Responsive Touch Image Slider", "og": {"site_name": "KRBD", "description": "Rep.
