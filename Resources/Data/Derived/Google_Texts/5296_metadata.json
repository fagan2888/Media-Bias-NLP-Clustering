The board is also expected to name an acting executive director.\n\nWhile they have not disclosed the replacement, Garcia said it \"could be the chairwoman that wants to take control.\"\n\nGarcia's annual salary as executive director is listed as $163,000, although he says his salary is $155,000. He also says he is one of the lowest-paid public housing authority directors in Hudson County.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Amanda Eisenberg | The Jersey Journal", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "hoboken", "title": "Special meeting to 'terminate the contract' of Hoboken Housing Authority director", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Special meeting to \\u0027terminate the contract\\u0027 of Hoboken Housing Authority director\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/special_meeting_to_terminate_t.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jjournal-news/photo/15532152-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13546760\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-02T07:00:24Z\", \"author\": \"Amanda Eisenberg | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"hoboken\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@njdotcom", "image": "http://media.nj.com/jjournal-news/photo/15532152-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The Hoboken Housing Authority board of of trustees will hold a special meeting Monday to \"terminate the contract\" of Executive Director Carmelo Garcia, according to the agenda for the meeting.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@aeis17"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, August 02, 2014,  3:00 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jjournal-news/photo/primary-elections-1fba6e069166be88.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"eisenbam\", \"author_nickname\": \"Amanda Eisenberg | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"11745654\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The Hoboken Housing Authority board of of trustees will hold a special meeting Monday to \"terminate the contract\" of Executive Director Carmelo Garcia, according to the agenda for the meeting.", "title": "Special meeting to 'terminate the contract' of Hoboken Housing Authority director", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/special_meeting_to_terminate_t.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, August 02, 2014,  3:00 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The Hoboken Housing Authority board of of trustees will hold a special meeting Monday to \"terminate the contract\" of Executive Director Carmelo Garcia, according to the agenda for the meeting."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7fff\"", "article_summary": "The Hoboken Housing Authority board of of trustees will hold a special meeting Monday to \"terminate the contract\" of Executive Director Carmelo Garcia, according to the agenda for the meeting.\nThe Hoboken Housing Authority Resident Advisory Board is planning to march from the housing complex on Jackson Street to City Hall in support of Garcia.\nHe also says he is one of the lowest-paid public housing authority directors in Hudson County.\n\"Garcia spent sleepless nights in the Housing Authority ensuring the safety of his residents,\" she said.\nGarcia's annual salary as executive director is listed as $163,000, although he says his salary is $155,000."}
