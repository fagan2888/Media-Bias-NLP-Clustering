This is absolutely counter-productive to our efforts to create a strong economy,\u201d he said, adding that the United States is lagging behind other countries where college is free.\n\nSanders, who serves as the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, also proposed restructuring the student loan program.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense that students and their parents are forced to pay interest rates for higher education loans that are much higher than they pay for car loans or housing mortgages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must also end the practice of the government making $127 billion over the next decade in profits from student loans.\u201d\n\nHis proposal comes just a month after President Obama pitched a plan to Congress that would make community college free.
