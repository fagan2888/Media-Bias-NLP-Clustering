Movement conservatives broadly oppose the idea of taxing wealthy people to subsidize the lower and middle classes. They don\u2019t like regulating the private sector very much either. Add in the political incentives they faced to uniformly oppose President Obama\u2019s agenda, the zero Republican votes for the Affordable Care Act, and you\u2019ve planted seeds of lasting hostility.\n\nBut the hostility has become so deeply rooted that it now stands on its own, detached from the ideological and partisan antipathies that gave rise to it.\n\nIt has forced conservatives to blind themselves to the law\u2019s positive, unobjectionable qualities, and police those within their ranks who dare to acknowledge them.\n\nTalking Points Memo\u2019s Josh Marshall called this reactionary phenomenon Obamacare McCarthyism. It ensnared Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., who\u2019s running for Senate in 2014 and had the temerity to suggest that Republicans shouldn\u2019t just idly mock the law when it stumbles. A few years ago, Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wy0., said he liked the concept of insurance exchanges \u2014 which are crucial components of GOP-backed Medicare privatization proposals and other conservative reform ideas \u2014 and now a hardline super PAC is using his words against him, as if he\u2019d called for the creation of a public option.\n\nBut on the battlefields of partisan warfare, this sort of post-principled contempt, combined with the inception of benefits, has turned the fight over Obamacare from a dispute over first principles, into a culture war, in which signaling matters more than tactical victories.\n\nThe repeal campaign \u2014 once marked by earnest and sustained efforts to wipe the law off the books \u2014 has all but burned itself out. But the law remains a potent political organizing force \u2014 a rallying cry Republicans believe they can use to channel the right\u2019s Obamacare obsession into voter turnout.\n\nAn astute friend remarked to me on Tuesday that the GOP\u2019s position on Obamacare is coming to resemble its position on abortion in one key way: loudly, consistently, uniformly opposed, but ultimately not really driven to eliminate it. The backlash they\u2019d face would be brutal, but they might stand to gain by fighting it on the margins and keeping the issue alive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hostilities to the law have become detached from the ideological and partisan antipathies that gave rise to them", "title": "The right\u2019s core dishonesty: How Obamacare became its own culture war", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Hostilities to the law have become detached from the ideological and partisan antipathies that gave rise to them", "title": "The right\u2019s core dishonesty: How Obamacare became its own culture war", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/04/how_obamacare_became_its_own_culture_war/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/02/boehner_obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hostilities to the law have become detached from the ideological and partisan antipathies that gave rise to them", "title": "The right\u2019s core dishonesty: How Obamacare became its own culture war", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/02/boehner_obama.jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Beutler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, culture wars, Editor's Picks, GOP, Jack Kingston, Mike Enzi, Obamacare, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6ab\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Affordable Care Act, culture wars, Editor's Picks, GOP, Jack Kingston, Mike Enzi, Obamacare, The Right, Politics NewsMany people think of the right\u2019s Obamacare hatred as an outgrowth of straightforward partisan and ideological truths.\nBut the law remains a potent political organizing force \u2014 a rallying cry Republicans believe they can use to channel the right\u2019s Obamacare obsession into voter turnout.\nAdd in the political incentives they faced to uniformly oppose President Obama\u2019s agenda, the zero Republican votes for the Affordable Care Act, and you\u2019ve planted seeds of lasting hostility.\nMovement conservatives broadly oppose the idea of taxing wealthy people to subsidize the lower and middle classes.\nThe backlash they\u2019d face would be brutal, but they might stand to gain by fighting it on the margins and keeping the issue alive."}
