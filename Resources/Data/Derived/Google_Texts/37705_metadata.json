I hesitated before I turned around: As a conservative in Gotham, I never know if I\u2019ll be accosted by a raving leftist screaming \u201cfascist!\u201d at me. (Yes, that happened.)\n\nI turned slowly to see a smiling older woman approaching me with her hand extended.\n\nThe story she shared with me was remarkable. She said that she currently works on a broadcast network\u2019s nightly newscast, although she declined to reveal which one. A thirty-year veteran of news, she had worked at the highest levels for all three major networks. She had produced their most important programming: evening news broadcasts, morning shows, and countless election nights. She clearly knew how the network news sausage was made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a conservative,\u201d she told me, \u201calthough I have kept that quiet for three decades because while the liberal bias was rampant, I enjoyed the work and wanted to keep my jobs.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, though,\u201d she continued, \u201cthe networks have always been biased to the left. But I have never, ever seen the bias as bad or as obvious as it\u2019s been since Barack Obama first appeared.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked her for an example, she replied, \u201cEvery morning, we hold a meeting about how to build that evening\u2019s broadcast. We\u2019ve been doing this for decades. Everybody talks about which stories we\u2019re going to air, what the line-up looks like, and which reporters we\u2019ll have live in the field and which ones will be filing taped pieces. In the past, the left-wing bias was always left unspoken. People just \u2018got it,\u2019 because they all thought the same.\n\n\u201cOnce Obama pulled ahead of Hillary and certainly once he became president,\u201d she said, \u201cthe bias came out of the closet. Now, every morning when we meet to discuss that night\u2019s show, they literally say \u2014 out loud \u2014 \u2018How do we protect Barack Obama today?\u2019\u201d\n\nI made her repeat that last bit: that the team assembling a national newscast for one of the Big Three television networks says \u2014 out loud, every day \u2014 \u201cHow do we protect Barack Obama today?\u201d\n\nThere it was, real proof of what we suspected from years of evidence: that the leftist agenda was real, tangible and no longer disguised. And it had morphed from simple bias to dangerous advocacy.\n\nThis dovetails with what former CBS investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson reports in her new book, \u201cStonewalled.\u201d Every time she tried to investigate the Obama administration on major scandals in which evidence of cover-ups was mounting \u2014 Fast and Furious, Benghazi, the IRS targeting of conservatives \u2014 she was either ignored or stopped outright by her superiors at CBS, including CBS News president David Rhodes, whose brother Ben happens to be President Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser.\n\nShe reports that her investigative work was buried or not aired at all, that she got no support from the network, and most outrageously, that she was targeted by the White House and Department of Justice, both of which thought she was \u201cout of control.\u201d In a scene right out of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d her computer was hacked by a \u201cgovernment-related entity\u201d and crucial files related to her investigations were erased before her eyes.\n\nMy colleague at Fox Business, Melissa Francis, recently divulged that when she was at CNBC several years ago, she reported to her audience that Obamacare\u2019s math \u201cdidn\u2019t add up.\u201d She was then reprimanded by her bosses for reporting the truth. Francis says, \u201cI was told that I was, quote, \u2018Disrespecting the office of the president\u2019 by questioning the math of Obamacare.\u201d She\u2019s revealing the confrontation now, she says, because once Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber admitted that the Obama team deceived the \u201cstupid\u201d public, she felt \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the \u201ccover-up.\u201d\n\nAn administration built on lies has enjoyed mafialike protection from a corrupt and supine press. They are therefore all complicit in the Obama policies that have crippled America: Obamacare, IRS targeting, Fast and Furious, Benghazi, the outrages at the Veterans Administration, NSA wiretapping, the Bergdahl-Taliban prisoner swap, the gutting of the military and so on (endlessly).\n\nThere are some journalists actually doing their jobs. Many, however, do whatever they can to defend Mr. Obama and advance his agenda, out of an ideological affinity with or an emotional draw to the first black president.\n\nCheerleading isn\u2019t what the press is supposed to do. And they know it because they never cheerlead when Republicans are in power. Many in the media, however, no longer care about accountability, intellectual honesty or the truth \u2014 and without a free press animated by those things, a great republic cannot stand for long.\n\nBut the media don\u2019t seem to care about that. After all, they operate with only one question in mind: \u201cHow do we protect Barack Obama today?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Monica Crowley is online opinion editor at The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "About six weeks before the 2012 presidential election, I was walking through Rockefeller Center in New York when I heard a woman's voice calling my name.
