Trevor Seigler ran around the right side on a zone-read play and got a 14 yard touchdown. A two point conversion makes it 8-0.\n\nChoctaw answered with a long drive, capped by quarterback Quint Gornto's 12 yard run. The Indians went for two but failed so they trailed 8-6 into the second quarter.\n\nThere the Indians grabbed their first lead, another drive capped by Gornto's 20 yard touchdown pass to Richie Grant, who caught it at the five and dragged two defenders across the goal line. The Indians then convert on the two point try and were up 14-8.\n\nThe Commanders put up a good drive late in the half, but would fumble at the Choctaw 7. The Indians recovered and then drove down the field and hit a field goal with less than ten seconds to go in the half.\n\nChoctaw. would rule the second half as well, adding another 17 points on the way to the 34-18 final.\n\nSo the Indians now 11-2, will host Armwood out of the Tampa area, Friday December 5th, at Etheridge Stadium.
