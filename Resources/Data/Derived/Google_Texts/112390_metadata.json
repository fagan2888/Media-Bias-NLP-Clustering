The GOP frontrunner refuses to change his campaign\u2019s disturbing tone, and his rivals are at a loss for how to combat it.\n\nThe last few days on the campaign trail have been dominated by chaos, the likes of which hasn\u2019t been seen in American politics in nearly 50 years. On Friday, Trump cancelled a rally in Chicago amid worries of violence. Tensions spilled over into Saturday, with one man rushing the billionaire during a speech in Ohio while another rally in St. Louis erupting in violence.\n\nRelated: From Bawdy Jokes to Body Slams, What\u2019s Next for the Trump Campaign?\n\nThe standoff threatens to go nationwide on Tuesday, when voters in five states and the Northern Mariana Islands go to the polls.\n\nMaking his rounds on the Sunday talk show circuit, the former reality TV star shrugged off the unrest, maintaining that he was within his rights to make the comments.\n\n\"I don't accept responsibility, I do not condone violence in any shape,\" Trump said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\u201d \u201cI'm just expressing my opinion. What have I said that's wrong?\"\n\nRelated: This Is What the GOP\u2019s Surrender to Trump Looks Like\n\nIn fact, he peppered his appearances with fresh lines of attack: labeling the protestors as \u201cprofessional disruptors\u201d who \u201cdon\u2019t love this country,\u201d accusing the media of unfairly covering the demonstrations, doubling-down on his erroneous claim that the man who rushed the stage had connections to ISIS and charging Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders is responsible for the violence, an accusation he originally made in a Tweet.\n\nBernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2016\n\nThe Vermont lawmaker vehemently denied the charge.\n\n\u201cI won't shock you \u2026 by telling that you Donald Trump lies a whole lot. He calls me a communist. That's a lie. To suggest that our campaign is telling people to disrupt his campaign is a lie. We don't,\u201d Sanders said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace The Nation.\u201d\n\nRelated: 5 Times Donald Trump Condoned Violence Against Protesters\n\nAs for the inciting incident that created this feverish momentum, the release of video footage showing an elderly man sucker-punching a protester at a Trump rally in North Carolina \u2013 for which the attacker was arrested \u2013 the billionaire said he might pay the man\u2019s legal bills, something the mogul has promised supporters in previous rallies after giving the green-light to beat up demonstrators.\n\n\u201cI'm going to look at it. I'm going to see what was behind this because it was a strange event,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe three contenders still looking to best Trump for GOP nomination have been put adrift by the bedlam, condemning the anarchy but hesitating to break with their vows to support whoever is the eventual Republican nominee.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, whose political future depends on winning Florida\u2019s primary on Tuesday, went the furthest.\n\n\u201cWe've not reached the point in this country where our political discourse looks like the comments section of a blog, where people can just say whatever they want about anyone without any rules of civility, no norms that govern how we interact with one another,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we've reached the point where we can't debate the proper tax rate or health care policy, our differences on foreign policy, what the government's role should be in education, without resorting to \u2018you're a bad person,\u2019 \u2018you're an evil person,\u2019 you know, \u2018I can say or do anything I want because I'm angry,\u2019 we're going to our lose our republic,\u201d Rubio warned.\n\nOhio Governor John Kasich refused to \u201cwallow in the mud\u201d with Trump, a strategy that seems to be paying off. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released early Sunday shows Kasich, who has emphasized a positive message in the face of Trumps\u2019 demagoguery, leading the billionaire by 6 points, 39 to 33 percent, in the Buckeye State.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said that \u201cin any campaign, responsibility starts at the top.\"\n\n\u201cAnd it is not beneficial when you have a presidential candidate like Donald Trump telling his supporters, 'Punch that guy in the face.' We ought to have a president who brings us together, who doesn't seek to divide us,\u201d he said on NBC. But he vowed to uphold his promise to back the GOP nominee.\n\nAt this point in the primary calendar, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the mayhem will be enough to trip up the Trump train. Tuesday\u2019s contests likely will be the last for Rubio, who the NBC/WSJ/Marist survey found trailing Trump in Florida by double-digits. The best GOP elders can hope for now is that Cruz and Kasich peel off enough delegates to prevent Trump from reaching the 1,237 threshold and force a contested or brokered convention this summer.\n\nPerhaps realizing he might be coming to the end of his candidacy, Rubio lamented the national outrage that has been codified by the recent ugly incidents.\n\n\u201cI don't know how else to describe this election at this point but, you know, other than it's an important one from a generational perspective, and yet it's turned into a real circus. And now it's turned into something even worse,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s rallies are threatening to turn the 2016 Republican presidential primary into a roving brawl.
