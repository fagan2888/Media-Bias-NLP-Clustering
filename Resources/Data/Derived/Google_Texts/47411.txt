Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker blamed President Barack Obama on Sunday for the recent spate of attacks on police.

Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union,” the Republican presidential contender said the president's “absence of leadership” is creating an environment where people attack law enforcement officers just because of their uniforms.

“I think his absence of leadership, as speaking out as a leader on this issue,” has contributed to the murder of police officers, Walker said. “When people are going after the men and women in uniform … it is the duty of the president to stand up and say something about that.”

Earlier this month, Walker wrote an op-ed for the conservative website Hot Air that said anti-police rhetoric has worsened under Obama. If he's elected president, Walker said he'd unite Americans.

“In the last six years under President Obama, we’ve seen a rise in anti-police rhetoric. Instead of hope and change, we’ve seen racial tensions worsen and a tendency to use law enforcement as a scapegoat,” Walker wrote. “This inflammatory and disgusting rhetoric has real consequences for the safety of officers who put their lives on the line for us and hampers their ability to serve the communities that need their help.”

“We need a president who first and foremost says that law enforcement professionals across this country are doing the job,” Walker said. “He has been silent on this and that’s an outrage.”

On Sunday, CNN host Jake Tapper pointed out that Obama has in fact praised law enforcement, but Walker said Obama avoids speaking out against hateful rhetoric.
