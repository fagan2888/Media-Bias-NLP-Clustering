Typically \u2014 although it\u2019s not the case for everyone \u2014 people at risk of developing prediabetes are overweight, 45 years or older, have a family or genetic history of diabetes, do not exercise or have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy.\n\nA blood glucose test is the only way to diagnose prediabetes, and some health experts think more patients should have one.\n\nFor those who do have prediabetes, moving more and eating less could nip it in the bud. Research shows people with prediabetes who achieve a 5 percent to 7 percent weight loss with exercise and diet can reduce or delay the onset of diabetes by 58 percent. Outcomes are even higher for people older than 60.\n\n\u201cThere is a remarkable effect that occurs with modest weight loss; it\u2019s more powerful and more effective than medication,\u201d says Venice endocrinologist Dr. Robert Dubin. \u201cI spend all day telling my patients to change the way they eat.\u201d\n\nJennifer Tucker-Mogensen, Director of Health Innovation at the Venice YMCA, says the program focuses on two goals: two and a half hours of moderate exercise a week, and a weight loss of 7 percent. It\u2019s open to anyone with prediabetes \u2014 testing can be done onsite at the Y \u2014 and is free for people with Medicare.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to bridge the community gap and help medical systems that don\u2019t quite fill their patients\u2019 needs,\u201d says Tucker-Mogensen. \u201cThis is evidence-based and clearly demonstrates that if the two program goals are attained, an individual can reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent.\u201d\n\nThose who enroll attend 16 weekly one-hour classroom sessions, followed by monthly maintenance sessions. There are weekly homework assignments, daily food tracking, exercise, and lots of talking and sharing. Small groups of 10 or fewer gather with a diabetes education instructor to discuss not just fat, calories and exercise, but also how to champion the day-to-day struggles many face when trying to lose weight \u2014 the messy emotional and social stuff that can derail even the most dedicated.\n\nDuring a recent Monday morning class \u2014 the 11th week \u2014 class instructor Leslie Carlsen passes around some handouts on the day\u2019s topic: Talk Back to Negative Thoughts.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re talking about negative thoughts and how they can undermine our success,\u201d says Carlsen, standing in front of a dry erase board, marker pen ready. \u201cWhat are some of the negative thoughts you had last week?\u201d\n\nAfter a few seconds, the hands go up, people start talking and Carlsen starts writing: \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel bad when I have a cheat day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I eat the way other people do?\u201d\n\nTo counter this feeling, Carlsen says, \u201cTurn it into a positive spin: I ate it; I own it; I will change what I am doing the rest of the day. Don\u2019t beat yourself up.\u201d\n\nTRACKING IS KEY\n\nThe core component of the program \u2014 which starts right away and requires some getting used to \u2014 is tracking each day\u2019s food intake, every morsel that passes the lips, and recording its caloric and fat content. Fat is the focus and the goal is to keep it at 42 grams a day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an eye-opening piece, and really is the pivotal cornerstone to the program,\u201d says Tucker-Mogensen.\n\nCarlsen says the program won\u2019t work if you don\u2019t track \u2014 but is also quick to remind the group that staying in the race is what that matters, not how fast you get there.\n\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t reach 7 percent; they might reach 5 percent; but they have still reduced their risk greatly,\u201d says Carlsen. \u201cEven if you lose two pounds, you\u2019ve just reduced your risk by 13 percent \u2014 that\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nKaren Borling of Englewood, 68, enrolled in the program with encouragement from her doctor.\n\nShe says the tracking was tedious at first, but it has become easier and helped her shed significant weight so far.\n\n\u201cI like the idea of eating better, and this teaches us balance and how to maintain weight loss. It\u2019s something we can use for the rest of our lives,\u201d says Borling, one pound shy of reaching her goal.\n\nTo help meet her exercise goals, she uses the free YMCA gym pass that she gets at the end of the class \u2014 you have to show up and stay the full hour to get one.\n\n\u201cYou feel so much better after exercise,\u201d Borling says. \u201cWhen I come home from water aerobics I have so much more energy now; I don\u2019t sit down anymore.\u201d\n\nDubin, the Venice endocrinologist, has been steering patients to the program since its inception several years ago. Most of those who go, he says, have a success story to share.\n\n\u201cAfter three years, they come back to see me and they say, \u2018Dr. Dubin, I still don\u2019t have diabetes,\u2019 \u201d he says.\n\nDubin likes to repeat a quote by Thomas Edison: \u201cThe doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re starting to do right now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m excited; my patients are excited. Having a program like the YMCA that really works and is evidence-based in our community is a remarkable opportunity. It really makes a difference.\u201d\n\nAlthough Frank Porter wasn\u2019t referred by his doctor, he joined the program last year. He has lost 6.5 percent of his weight, he reports, and got his blood sugar down to a healthier level. He\u2019s also completely off the blood pressure medication he had been taking for 20 years.\n\n\u201cBefore, I was just totally ignorant of nutrition. I\u2019m aware now,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to sacrifice and give up things; just do things in moderation. I don\u2019t just blindly throw down the peanuts now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/09/hfdiabetes02.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05d3\"", "article_summary": "What the AMA wants, Wah says, is for more doctors to screen their patients for prediabetes and refer those who have it to the program.\nVenice resident Frank Porter, 77, says he put on a few pounds over the years but didn\u2019t think it was serious.\nPeople who have prediabetes and do nothing are 15 percent to 30 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes within five years, says the CDC.\n\u201cWe wanted to bridge the community gap and help medical systems that don\u2019t quite fill their patients\u2019 needs,\u201d says Tucker-Mogensen.\nA blood glucose test is the only way to diagnose prediabetes, and some health experts think more patients should have one."}
