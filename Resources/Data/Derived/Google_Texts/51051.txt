Moda Health Insurance announced Monday morning that it will not be providing healthcare insurance for Alaska’s individual market in 2017.

Currently, the company says it has 14,000 Alaska members enrolled in this program, which means in November, those looking to sign up for Affordable Care Act coverage for 2017 will have to choose a different insurer.

“We have experienced a pretty significant financial loss in the last two years in the individual market in Alaska,” said Jason Gootee, Moda’s Director of Alaska Sales and Service. “It got to a point where we could no longer sustain that.”

Gootee says Moda will continue to cover its other lines of medical and dental businesses across Alaska.

Monday's announcement by Moda Health will leave Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield as the only company providing individual health insurance policies in the state.

In a press release issued Monday, Alaska Division of Insurance director Lori Wing-Heier voiced concern over the announcement from Moda.

“A single insurer does not allow for adequate choice for the 23,000 Alaskan consumers on the individual market, and is even more of a concern given that Premera is also experiencing significant losses in Alaska’s individual market,” Wing-Heier wrote.

Gootee says high claim costs and a relatively small market size in Alaska have been ongoing concerns for the company.

“Alaska has some fairly high healthcare costs. I think it’s some of the highest health care costs in the country, and we found we haven’t been able to bring in enough premiums to cover the costs of claims on an individual market,” Gootee said.

Currently moving through the legislature is Senate Bill 206, which would offer a reinsurance program for “high risk” residents with an insurer assessment to cover the costs of this program.
