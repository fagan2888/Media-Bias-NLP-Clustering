In a year where there have already been 10 fatalities on the Caltrain tracks, the transit agency’s social media outreach is proving to be especially important to share key transit updates with Bay Area commuters.

Our team is working quickly to clear the debris from the tracks, assess damage & work to restore service. Expect delays, seek alt. #Caltrain — Caltrain (@Caltrain_News) February 24, 2015

The locomotive ivolved is leaking fluids and cannot move under its own power. May get NB track soon to single track. #Caltrain

Northbound track has been cleared for 10 MPH speed restriction, traffic not resuming yet. But that’s a step in right direction. #Caltrain

Jeremy Lipps has been Caltrain’s social media officer for just over two years and manages outbound communication for Caltrain’s Facebook, Google Plus, Foursquare, Instagram, Pinterest and Twitter accounts. The official Caltrain Twitter account, @Caltrain_News , provides quick and free news on service impacts, media updates, delays and interruptions, community notices and other general information.Joe Wagstaffe, a Caltrain commuter and Twitter follower, follows Caltrain on Twitter: “There was one day … where three people had tragedies and they [Caltrain] handled it really well. They were updating every few minutes — where the delays were, how they were adjusting trains and what that meant.”

As the voice of Caltrain on Twitter, Lipps said he has a “fun, no-nonsense kind of tone,” but that truthful and transparent communication remains the ultimate goal. The @Caltrain_News account answers inquiries Monday through Friday, between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.

The video above explores how Caltrain is getting information out to Bay Area commuters and features interviews with Lipps and Wagstaffe.
