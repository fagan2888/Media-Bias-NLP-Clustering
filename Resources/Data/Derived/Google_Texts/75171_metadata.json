Nothing captures that more succinctly than the following phrase, which appeared in Politico on Friday: \u201cIn a big win for House Republicans and President Obama \u2026\u201d The night before, the vast majority of House Democrats had broken with the White House over a bill to keep the government running, while most Republicans hailed that same $1.1 trillion spending bill as a triumph. This followed last week\u2019s announcement by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the U.S. economy, in November, created three hundred and twenty-one thousand jobs\u2014on top of an October count of two hundred and forty-three thousand and a September increase of two hundred and seventy-one thousand\u2014a report in which conservatives somehow saw evidence of the failure of Obamanomics.\n\nFor all the dismal predictability of our politics, the landscape is in the process of being at least partially reordered, and not only because of the Republican victory in the midterm election. The impressive rate of job creation, too, is unsettling old dynamics. Monthly employment reports used to provide an occasion for John Boehner\u2019s catchphrase: \u201cWhere are the jobs, Mr. President?\u201d (Sort of a \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201d for a new century.) Now that the answer is \u201cRight here, Mr. Speaker,\u201d Republican leaders are out of sorts, fumbling for the right rejoinder. Reince Priebus, the Party chairman, while \u201cglad\u201d about all those new jobs, is nonetheless aggrieved that \u201cObama-Clinton Democrats\u201d have \u201cpushed job-killing policies when we needed job-creating policies.\u201d (Look for more of this two-headed hydra in the coming months; in a speech on Wednesday, Senator Ted Cruz went after the \u201cObama-Clinton foreign policy.\u201d) The House Republican Conference, acknowledging through gritted teeth that the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.8 per cent, would have us focus instead on the labor-force participation rate, which is at \u201cCarter-era levels\u201d\u2014not a compliment, unless we\u2019re measuring funk.\n\nThis sullenness notwithstanding, it would be wrong to conclude that conservatives are losing the argument over the direction of the economy. As a new poll by the Times reveals, the brightening picture has diminished but still not erased the Republican advantage on economic questions. The public remains receptive to the notion that \u201coverregulation\u201d is a drag on growth; in the Times poll, this rates as a greater concern than economic inequality. Neither the recent job gains nor the rise in average hourly earnings have restored confidence that the government can do much to improve the lives of working-class and middle-class people. When \u201cprime-age\u201d men and women would sooner remain unemployed than take a low-wage job\u2014because, as a new series in the Times explains, these jobs pay too poorly to support a family\u2014we are seeing a dangerous decoupling of the state of the economy from the fate of individual Americans, as they themselves see it.\n\nThe implications will, of course, be felt in 2016. (By the agreement of both parties and all major media outlets, everything, including rainfall averages and fantasy-football player rankings, must now be assessed in terms of their implications for the 2016 election.) Writing in The New Republic (before the purge), Danny Vinik sees only \u201cgood news\u201d for Hillary Clinton, she of the \u201cObama-Clinton\u201d axis: \u201cThe more the economy improves over the next 24 months,\u201d Vinik contends, \u201cthe better Clinton\u2019s changes are of winning the presidency.\u201d This might be right, and the idea that credit accrues to the outgoing President\u2019s party has a certain intuitive appeal.\n\nIt is, however, at odds with recent experience. The economic expansion of the nineteen-eighties gave a boost to the campaign of Vice-President George H. W. Bush in 1988, but Vice-President Al Gore did not get the lift he needed from an even stronger economy in 2000. His opponent, George W. Bush, conceded the strength of the economy, but successfully cast doubt on Gore\u2019s role in it. \u201cOur economy is strong today not because of Al Gore,\u201d Bush said that October. \u201cOur economy is strong today because we\u2019re a land of dreamers and doers.\u201d The budget surplus also lent force to Bush\u2019s argument for a massive tax cut. \u201cThat money is not the government\u2019s money,\u201d he said again and again. \u201cThat money is the people\u2019s money.\u201d The seemingly limitless boom of the nineteen-nineties created, in still another way, a disadvantage for Gore. During the summer of 2000, President Clinton told a group of us that if growth could now be taken for granted\u2014\u201cif people think this economy\u2019s so strong you couldn\u2019t wreck it with a sledgehammer\u201d\u2014it would be much harder to convince them that Bush was a risky choice.\n\nThe nation\u2019s main economic challenge, it appeared at the time, was to \u201cextend the promise of prosperity to every forgotten corner of this country,\u201d as Bush put it in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention that August. And if the current recovery continues to gain momentum, that could again become the focus of a Presidential election. Hillary Clinton, who established a strong connection with working-class and middle-class voters during her 2008 primary campaign, might have an advantage in a contest like that, but it will not be automatic; it will have to be earned, or at least reasserted.\n\nThe middle class might well be up for grabs. Republicans are aware of this; the way you can tell is that none of them\u2014not even Mitt Romney\u2014is talking about \u201ctakers\u201d this time around. Instead they toss around terms like \u201cwage stagnation,\u201d and not only to blame it on President Obama. But when Senator Rand Paul says he has a plan to address stagnant middle-class incomes, it sounds more like the Republican plan to address just about anything: cut spending, repeal Obamacare, end \u201cthe President\u2019s war on fossil fuels.\u201d Jeb Bush, too, outlines a boilerplate conservative agenda\u2014deregulation; an \u201call-in\u201d energy policy; simplification of the tax code; entitlement reform\u2014as a strategy to \u201csee a rising income for the middle class again,\u201d which is how he put it at this month\u2019s meeting of the Wall Street Journal CEO Council, a group that knows a few things about rising incomes.\n\nAmong the contenders, only Senator Marco Rubio has given real attention to the problems facing middle-class families. In January, he\u2019ll publish a book on the theme, called \u201cAmerican Dreams.\u201d The cover features the senator, hands on hips, in a classically heroic pose. Posturing aside, when Rubio talks about the \u201cinsecurity\u201d that \u201chas coiled itself\u201d around the lives of hard-pressed people, he actually sounds like he understands it. Rubio\u2019s proposal to create a \u201cwage-enhancement credit\u201d for low-wage workers suggests a seriousness of purpose. At the same time, Rubio\u2019s idea of an innovative anti-poverty program is to roll all federal spending on the poor into a \u201cFlex Fund\u201d for the states\u2014in other words, a block grant, not unlike the ones that Newt Gingrich was proposing twenty years ago. \u201cTurning federal programs into block grants is a shopworn idea with a long history of disappointment,\u201d Peter Edelman, the Georgetown Law professor and former aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy, wrote earlier this year, when Rubio released, with fanfare, his proposal.\n\nThe trouble for Rubio\u2014indeed, for all the Republican hopefuls\u2014is that the ideological rigidity of the right, its reflexive hostility to government solutions and its exaltation of the market, constrains their creativity and prevents them from developing a genuinely effective response to income stagnation. That is, an effective policy response. Their political response is well-practiced. Republican candidates are going to keep doing what they have done for a long time, with frequent success: stoking middle-class frustration and directing it at Democrats. What struggling workers and non-workers actually need from politicians is exactly what the G.O.P. works so hard to obstruct: \u201cbold, persistent experimentation,\u201d as Franklin Roosevelt put it in 1932. Unless someone grabs the mantle of reform, a winter of discontent is coming, and it\u2019s going to be a long one.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160525190933, "description": "Despite steady improvement under Obama, it would be wrong to conclude that conservatives are losing the argument over the direction of the economy.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "Despite steady improvement under Obama, it would be wrong to conclude that conservatives are losing the argument over the direction of the economy.", "title": "Can Republicans Gain from Job Growth? - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Shesol-Republicans-economy-1200-630.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2014-12-13T13:56:16-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/can-republicans-gain-job-growth", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite steady improvement under Obama, it would be wrong to conclude that conservatives are losing the argument over the direction of the economy.", "title": "Can Republicans Gain from Job Growth? - The New Yorker", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Shesol-Republicans-economy-1200-630.jpg", "creator": "@JeffShesol", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"2933001\",\"title_alt\":\"Can Republicans Gain from Job Growth?\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/12\\/Shesol-Republicans-economy-728-375.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "article": {"section": "News Desk", "tag": "Republicans", "published_time": "2014-12-13T13:25:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-13T13:56:16-04:00"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 2933001, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Economy, Marco Rubio, Republicans"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5ff\"", "article_summary": "Now that the answer is \u201cRight here, Mr. Speaker,\u201d Republican leaders are out of sorts, fumbling for the right rejoinder.\nAnd if the current recovery continues to gain momentum, that could again become the focus of a Presidential election.\nRepublicans are aware of this; the way you can tell is that none of them\u2014not even Mitt Romney\u2014is talking about \u201ctakers\u201d this time around.\nHis opponent, George W.
