Colorado was the state with the highest home price appreciation in January with a 9.1 percent increase, while Texas and Wyoming were shortly behind with 8.3 percent increases. New York homes rose by 5.6 percent.\n\n\u201cIn part, these trends reflect the strength of regional economies,\u201d Frank Nothaft, chief economist at CoreLogic, said in a press release. \u201cColorado and Texas have had stronger job creation and have seen 8 to 9 percent price gains over the past 12 months.\u201d Core Logic wasn\u2019t immediately available for comments.\n\nA quick price gain doesn\u2019t mean the market is overvalued, but strong demand for real estate and limited supply can certainly lead to a market being overvalued. And the more prices are overvalued, the greater the chance that a bubble might be forming.\n\nTrulia\u2019s Bubble Watch data, which lists home prices relative to fundamentals for the nation as a whole and for 100 U.S. metro areas, can shed light on whether the U.S. and these states might be overvalued.\n\nIn the country, home prices were still 2 percent undervalued relative to fundamentals in the fourth quarter, Trulia wrote in January. In the first quarter of 2006, at the height of the last housing bubble, home prices soared to 34 percent overvalued.\n\nRelated: Why a Booming Job Market Hasn\u2019t Led to a Booming Housing Market\n\nThere\u2019s not yet a bubble in the U.S., despite factors reminiscent of the last housing bubble, including low interest rates (still below 4 percent) and somewhat lax rules on down payments for first-time buyers. But looking at specific states can give a different picture and the Trulia data points to some markets being overvalued.\n\nAll Colorado and New York markets mentioned by Trulia were still undervalued in the fourth quarter, including New York City (5 percent undervalued) and Long Island (4 percent undervalued). Wyoming wasn\u2019t even mentioned.\n\nWhat about Texas?\n\nSome of the largest price increases, including distressed sales, occurred in the Houston/The Woodlands/Sugar Land market (10.9 percent) and in the Dallas/Plano/Irving market (9.1 percent), according to CoreLogic.\n\nRelated: 10 Best Cities for Job Seekers\n\nTrulia\u2019s Bubble Watch claims that all but one market (Fort Worth) was found to be overvalued. Home prices in Austin were overvalued by 16 percent, while those in Houston, San Antonio and Dallas were overvalued by 10 percent, 7 percent and 3 percent respectively. The oil business isn\u2019t the only industry feeding that home price appreciation in the Lone Star state. Technology has also been a large contributor, especially in Austin.\n\nWhether the steep home price appreciation in some Texas markets will lead to a bubble will depend on whether the employment growth there is sustainable in the long term.\n\nA continued drop in oil prices, or even a tech bubble burst, could easily curb demand for housing in hot Texas markets, and take some of the air out of the sky high prices.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Real estate prices increased again in January, with several states reaching new histor", "title": "Get Ready for Another Real Estate Bubble", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/03/Get-Ready-Another-Real-Estate-Bubble", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05092012_Housing_Bubble_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/03/Get-Ready-Another-Real-Estate-Bubble", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05092012_Housing_Bubble_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Real estate prices increased again in January, with several states reaching new histor", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf22b\"", "article_summary": "Real estate prices increased again in January, with several states reaching new historic highs, leading experts to wonder whether another real estate bubble might be brewing.\nIn the first quarter of 2006, at the height of the last housing bubble, home prices soared to 34 percent overvalued.\nA quick price gain doesn\u2019t mean the market is overvalued, but strong demand for real estate and limited supply can certainly lead to a market being overvalued.\nAnd the more prices are overvalued, the greater the chance that a bubble might be forming.\nRelated: 10 Best Cities for Job SeekersTrulia\u2019s Bubble Watch claims that all but one market (Fort Worth) was found to be overvalued."}
