For those of you who also work in the devil\u2019s bathtub, aka the internet, you\u2019ve no doubt already seen a million and three new dieting tips to help usher your body dysmorphia into 2016.\n\nAfter all, being a woman in the United States means that \u2014 in addition to fumbling through the avalanche of violations of your reproductive rights \u2014 you must regularly confront definitively insane expectations of what you should look like. In the past week \u2014 without ever seeking out such information, mind you \u2014 I have learned that the heinous trifecta of wheat, sugar, and legumes (?!) is slowly killing me, and that to get Gisele B\u00fcndchen\u2019s body, I must only eat wild salmon and raw leaves.\n\nFortunately, this has inspired lots and lots of genuinely wonderful writing, and those pieces are what I\u2019m going to share with you as chasers this week. Because when you\u2019re all alone with your own personal stash of internalized inadequacies, it\u2019s nice to remember that you\u2019re in good company.\n\nSHOT: Has this seemed like a particularly shitty year for reproductive rights? It\u2019s not just in your head: For starters, 57 new abortion restrictions have been enacted in 17 states, bringing the total number of new abortion restrictions since 2010 up to 288. That\u2019s five times the number of restrictions that were put into place between 1995 and 2010. The Guttmacher Institute put together a full report on all the ways in which 2015 sucked (for uteri).\n\nCHASER: \u201cOn the days when you are not waving your arms like a loon, Tracy Anderson has another DVD called Dance Cardio Workout. It\u2019s so incredibly hard that I can only do twenty minutes of it. From what I can gather, it is completely unexplained jumping to the dulcet beeping of late Madonna. You have to jump for a whole hour. I\u2019m so tired afterward I actually have to go to sleep.\u201d \u2014 \u201cI Tried Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Diet and Got A Rash On My Face,\u201d Rebecca Harrington\n\nSHOT: And to drive the point above home for the grade-oriented: The Population Institute just released this year\u2019s reproductive rights report card for the country \u2014 and, well, we\u2019re definitely headed to detention. On reproductive health issues like access, education, and prevention, we\u2019ve fallen from last year\u2019s C grade to a D+ \u2014 and 19 states are straight-up failing.\n\nCHASER: \u201c\u2018Cat,\u2019 she said to me one afternoon, \u2018let\u2019s change the way you eat. Let\u2019s change the way you live.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll do anything,\u2019 I lied. \u2018I\u2019m\u2013,\u2019 Julie said. \u2018I will not,\u2019 I hissed, \u2018Julie, be told, incidentally, to do Physique 57 next to Kelly Ripa or whoever. Fuck no. I\u2019m not doing the new thing with the bike. SoulCycle. I\u2019m not doing Barry\u2019s Boot Camp or whatever it is you do in at seven o\u2019clock in the morning in Midtown with Bryan! You need to be realistic.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m getting you a cleanse,\u2019 she said.\u201d \u2014 \u201cTHINNERRR: The Ritual Cleanse Made Me Drop 8 Pounds (and I\u2019m Still Losing Weight),\u201d Cat Marnell\n\nSHOT: Oregonian ladies: If you\u2019re over 18, you can now officially get birth control pills, patches, and rings straight from the pharmacy, and it\u2019s covered by insurance under the Affordable Care Act. (It\u2019s not technically over the counter: The pharmacist still has to write a prescription, but you don\u2019t have to undertake the pesky step of a long, often invasive consultation with your doctor.) California will follow suit shortly.\n\nCHASER: \u201cI\u2019ve known smart women who\u2019ve gone to extremes to hide the fact that they have to work for their figure. I\u2019ve been one of them. I once got out of sharing bread pudding on a date by saying that the sight of it made me sad because it was served at my grandpa\u2019s shiva. (For that lie, I am sorry, Papa. RIP.)\u201d \u201cNobody Wants To Be The Girl On A Diet,\u201d Lauren Bans\n\nSHOT: Along with a coalition of cities lead by NYC, Obama has weighed in on the upcoming Supreme Court case that will examine Texas abortion clinic restrictions, insisting: \u201cCome on, dudes, we\u2019ve got to strike these down.\u201d And while we\u2019re waiting on that case, the Texas Supreme Court has quietly wrecked abused and neglected minors\u2019 ability to obtain abortions without parental consent.\n\nCHASER: \u201cFor the blissfully unfamiliar, a body wrap is a kind of quick-fix \u201cslimming\u201d treatment that involves sweating out a bunch of water. There was a brief fad for wrapping when I was a teenager \u2014 it was like the Master Cleanse of its day, and women\u2019s magazines were full of breathless stories of inches instantly lost. This was also around the time Martin Lawrence went jogging in a wet suit to drop a couple pounds and almost died. He\u2019s always been a hero of mine, so naturally, I wished I had the kind of cash for an expensive spa treatment that magically removed fat and toxins.\u201d \u2014 \u201cJulieanne\u2019s Home Spa Nightmares 2: Slimming Body Wrap of Death,\u201d Julieanne Smolinski\n\nSHOT: So why is the state of reproductive rights so bleak right now? According to Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fl.), head of the Democratic National Committee, it might have to do with millennials being \u201ccomplacent\u201d on abortion rights. Huh.\n\nCHASER: \u201cI would so much rather say something aloud about my chubby arms than internalize it until it becomes bottled up, until I\u2019m pulling at the skin alone in my room at 2am trying to figure out what my body is. I love talking about my acne at this point. My face is bleeding sometimes! It\u2019s bleeding. The part of my body that is supposed to keep the blood inside it is rupturing, visibly, on my fucking face. To not acknowledge it is doing something very weird that I don\u2019t want to partake in.\u201d \u2014 \u201cOn Being Ugly,\u201d Fran Hoepfner\n\nAND A LI\u2019L NIGHTCAP: Our heroine of the week, South Carolina State Rep. Mia McLeod, filed a bill that would require that men seeking Viagra, Cialis, and similar medications go through the same exhaustive process that women face when trying to obtain reproductive health care. McLeod knows the bill doesn\u2019t have a chance in hell of passing, but she\u2019s trying to provide some perspective on the issue of abortion and birth control access.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/shotsandchasers.jpg?w=50", "sailthru.author": "Eve Andrews", "pocket-site-verification": "600c3e036c3d0b8412be38a78681c7", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Grist", "description": "When you\u2019re all alone with your own personal stash of internalized inadequacies, it\u2019s nice to remember that you\u2019re in good company.", "title": "It\u2019s a weird time to be an American woman \u2014 so let\u2019s read some great writing by them", "url": "http://grist.org/living/its-a-weird-time-to-be-an-american-woman-so-lets-read-some-great-writing-by-them/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/shotsandchasers.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/shotsandchasers.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "grist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-08 15:28:57", "robots": "noodp", "sailthru.title": "It\u2019s a weird time to be an American woman \u2014 so let\u2019s read some great writing by them", "msapplication-tooltip": "We're an online news organization that uses humor to interpret green issues & inspire environmental action.", "p": {"domain_verify": "c293daabda398bd8ceee45abea0b3201"}, "fb": {"app_id": 548917378618963}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://grist.org/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/330e84b0272aae748d059cd70e3f8f8d?s=16", "application-name": "Grist", "sailthru.tags": "living, politics, birth-control, contraception, reproductive-health, shots-chasers, women, womens-health, eve-andrews", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/grist.org", "published_time": "2016-01-08T20:28:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-25T00:11:53+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eefandrews"}, "sailthru.description": "When you\u2019re all alone with your own personal stash of internalized inadequacies, it\u2019s nice to remember that you\u2019re in good company.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/shotsandchasers.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "When you\u2019re all alone with your own personal stash of internalized inadequacies, it\u2019s nice to remember that you\u2019re in good company."}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s not just in your head: For starters, 57 new abortion restrictions have been enacted in 17 states, bringing the total number of new abortion restrictions since 2010 up to 288.\n), head of the Democratic National Committee, it might have to do with millennials being \u201ccomplacent\u201d on abortion rights.\nSHOT: Has this seemed like a particularly shitty year for reproductive rights?\nAfter all, being a woman in the United States means that \u2014 in addition to fumbling through the avalanche of violations of your reproductive rights \u2014 you must regularly confront definitively insane expectations of what you should look like.\nis slowly killing me, and that to get Gisele B\u00fcndchen\u2019s body, I must only eat wild salmon and raw leaves."}
