If I had played my best tennis and lost, it would have felt better,\u201d Koyanagi said. \u201cI was really tired today and my legs were dead. I couldn\u2019t move or even really get to balls.\u201d\n\nKoyanagi played three matches on Saturday, including a three-hour, three-set semifinal.\n\nThe Ojai marked the final event of Koyanagi\u2019s career at Ventura College. The loss was only his second in the two years he played for the Pirates.\n\nKoyanagi also lost to Santa Barbara City College\u2019s Sasha Hedberg, an Oxnard native, during the regular season this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great two years. I guess if I could have won this title, it would be a perfect life at VC. But things can\u2019t be perfect all the time,\u201d Koyanagi said. \u201cIt just stinks because the coach from UCSB was here to watch and I didn\u2019t play well.\u201d\n\nKoyanagi became emotional after he lost and was consoled by his teammates and members of the VC women\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cGive credit where credit is due, Javi played awesome. Hiro just didn\u2019t have his legs under him today,\u201d VC coach Nelson Emery said. \u201cBut that is what makes Ojai special. It\u2019s not always the best player who wins, it\u2019s the person who survives and keeps surviving.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "VC\u2019s Koyanagi fails to defend his title", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/happening-now/VCs-Koyanagi-fails-to-defend-his-title-376910011.html", "image": {"width": 3264, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/0425_vcsp_ojainotebook.jpg", "height": 2448}, "type": "article", "description": "His mind was willing, but his body wasn\u2019t able.", "title": "VC\u2019s Koyanagi fails to defend his title"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/0425_vcsp_ojainotebook.jpg", "description": "His mind was willing, but his body wasn\u2019t able.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "VC\u2019s Koyanagi fails to defend his title"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Ventura College sophomore Hironori Koyanagi\u2019s failed to defend his singles title at The Ojai, losing to Irvine Valley\u2019s Javi Velasco 7-5, 6-2.\nVentura College sophomore Hironori Koyanagi\u2019s failed to defend his singles title at The Ojai, losing to Irvine Valley\u2019s Javi Velasco 7-5, 6-2 in the Men\u2019s Community College singles final on Sunday afternoon at Libbey Park.\n\u201cGive credit where credit is due, Javi played awesome.\nIf I had played my best tennis and lost, it would have felt better,\u201d Koyanagi said.\nThe Ojai marked the final event of Koyanagi\u2019s career at Ventura College."}
