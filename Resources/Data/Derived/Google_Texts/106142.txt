Police evacuated people from the Chickasha Walmart due to a suspicious device found in the parking lot.

Shoppers are being allowed to return to the Walmart in Chickasha after police determined a suspicious device was harmless.

Police and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol bomb squad were called to the store at 2001 S. 1st Street Friday morning when someone spotted a possible explosive in a pickup truck parked outside the store.

Police evacuated the store and roped off the truck with crime-scene tape while they waited for the bomb squad to arrive. They also shut down several streets around the store.

Once there, explosives experts x-rayed the suspicious package and determined it was harmless.

Two men said they were kicked out of the same Chickasha Walmart because they were gay.
