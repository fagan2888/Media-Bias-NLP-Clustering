Sure enough, she got no pesky challenges about her refusal to sit for questions from Iowans nor about her ObamaCare falsehoods.\n\nToday, the toughest questions Ernst got from host Neil Cavuto were whether she\u2019d vote for Mitch McConnell as majority leader if she wins her senate race and whether repealing ObamaCare is really doable.\n\nSmiling through most of the interview, Ernst said, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a number of Iowans across the state that are having issues with ObamaCare. Policies have been cancelled. We\u2019re seeing horrible increases in their insurance policy rates. Those policies that had to meet the Affordable Care Act requirements. So, we re seeing doctors going away. You can\u2019t keep your doctor if you like your doctor. You certainly couldn\u2019t keep your policy if you liked your policy. Iowans don\u2019t like that. Their heath care options have been limited by ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nCavuto asked, \u201cIf you made it to the United States Senate, Ms. Ernst, would you call for a vote on repealing ObamaCare outright, or would you dismantle it around the edges \u2013 either the medical device tax, the kind of stuff that Mitch McConnell was telling me a few days ago are more doable tactics?\u201d\n\n\u201dWell, first, I think we do need to repeal but replace ObamaCare with something that is more patient centered and addresses pre-existing conditions,\u201d Ernst replied. ObamaCare already addresses pre-existing conditions, but Cavuto didn\u2019t mention it.\n\nErnst continued, \u201cWhatever we can do to get this bad law gone is what we need to do. \u2026It\u2019s not just hurting folks here in Iowa, it is hurting all of America. It\u2019s unsustainable, unaffordable, and we can do better for the American people.\u201d\n\nCavuto said, \u201cBut I got the impression when I was talking to Mitch McConnell that it wasn\u2019t realistic.\" Cavuto added that McConnel had since \"dialed it back a little bit.\" However, Cavuto said, McConnell's \"initial impression was let\u2019s remove the things we think we have a good shot at shooting down, like that medical device tax \u2013 maybe some other onerous provisions, the insurance provisions \u2013 but as far as repealing it outright, not doable.\u201d\n\nErnst merely reiterated, \u201cI do think we need to repeal the law. It\u2019s a bad law, we can do better.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the percentage of uninsured has dropped to its lowest level since 2008, and health care costs have slowed dramatically. Cavuto didn\u2019t point that out. He also didn\u2019t ask Ernst about snubbing her home state\u2019s newspapers.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "Hm4WSGwKbdO8u42k5xWFW8/Nz26eYqrpD0wb00lBS2o=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/still_dodging_iowa_press_joni_ernst_again_visits_fox_news_11012014", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Still Dodging Iowa Press, Joni Ernst Again Visits Fox News"}, "Title": "Still Dodging Iowa Press, Joni Ernst Again Visits Fox News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2fb\"", "article_summary": "Smiling through most of the interview, Ernst said, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a number of Iowans across the state that are having issues with ObamaCare.\nU.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst (R-IA) may be too chicken to talk to the editorial papers in her home state but she\u2019s got no qualms about going on Fox News.\nErnst continued, \u201cWhatever we can do to get this bad law gone is what we need to do.\nToday, the toughest questions Ernst got from host Neil Cavuto were whether she\u2019d vote for Mitch McConnell as majority leader if she wins her senate race and whether repealing ObamaCare is really doable.\nSure enough, she got no pesky challenges about her refusal to sit for questions from Iowans nor about her ObamaCare falsehoods."}
