RIVERTON, Wyo. (AP) - The new Wind River Job Corps facility in Riverton has officially opened its doors to provide free job training to disadvantaged youths.

The Casper Star-Tribune reports (http://bit.ly/1MVoemO ) Monday’s opening of the seven-building campus marked an end to a decadeslong push by Fremont County residents and Wyoming officials to bring a Jobs Corps facility to the state.

Republican Senator Mike Enzi, who backed efforts to build the center, says the facility’s location in Riverton allows it to be accessible to the Wind River Indian Reservation, which has had high unemployment rates.

The center cost about $42 million to construct and will cost about $10 million to $15 million annually to operate. Once everything is up and running, the center will provide training for up to 300 students, ages 16 to 24.
