She wrote in the decision, \"Congres[s'] power of the purse is the ultimate check on the otherwise unbounded power of the executive.\" She added that Congress has a constitutional interest in protecting its role in authorizing how public money is spent.\n\nIn addition, Collyer rejected the administration's argument that the court should not be involved in a political conflict between the executive and legislative branches of government. She wrote in the decision, \"The mere fact that the House of Representatives is the plaintiff does not turn this suit into a non-justiciable political dispute.\" She added, \"Despite its potential political ramifications, this suit remains a plain dispute over a constitutional command, of which the Judiciary has long been the ultimate interpreter.\"\n\nFurther, Collyer said the decision should not be viewed as a pathway for future Congresses to sue future presidents. She wrote that the decision should not \"open\" any \"floodgates\" for such lawsuits because her ruling is based on \"the extraordinary facts\" of this particular case.\n\nWhile the case likely would not greatly affect the ACA, some consumers' out-of-pocket spending could increase sharply if the cost-sharing subsidies are invalidated (California Healthline, 9/10).\n\nAppeal Details\n\nThe Department of Justice in court documents filed Monday called Collyer's decision \"a momentous step\" that \"would invite litigation over numerous other disputes between the political branches.\" DOJ noted in the filing that Collyer's decision allowed a chamber of Congress to sue the executive branch \"[f]or the first time in [U.S.] history.\"\n\nThe administration has requested that the lawsuit be placed on hold while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reviews the issue of standing (Roll Call, 9/21).", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>The Department of Justice has appealed a recent U.S. District Court decision that allows the House to continue a lawsuit challenging the administration's power to make changes to the Affordable Care Act.
