So the Hardee County school counselor said she fights to get students the help they need. Often, she looks for signs that are worrisome, but not yet evidence a teen is at risk for suicide.\n\n\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve been having issues with is cutting,\u201d Saddler said of the act of poking and slashing skin with a sharp object. \u201cThey\u2019re starting in junior high and sometimes we get reports from teachers that someone is self-injurious.\u201d\n\nSuicide is the ninth leading cause of death in Florida, and the 10th in the United States, according to the Florida Suicide Prevention Coalition.\n\nOn Sept. 10 every year, advocacy groups across the country honor \u201cWorld Suicide Prevention Day\u201d by opening the floor for victims and survivors of suicide to share their stories and reach out to the greater community.\n\nThis year, the Tampa Bay Suicide Prevention Task Force and the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay collaborated on an interactive event that includes guest speakers, demonstrations on coping and resiliency, and a candle light vigil to remember people who died by suicide. The event is being held at the James A. Haley VA Hospital.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to start this event to help people interact with others who have been impacted [by suicide],\u201d said Ken Gibson, a spokesman for the Crisis Center.\n\n\u201cThere will be plenty of people who have personally struggled.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is one death by suicide in the U.S. every 13 minutes. Organizers said the Crisis Center event is meant to direct those who may be suffering from depression or grappling with suicidal thoughts on finding help in the community.\n\nSaddler, the counselor who is not involved in the Crisis Center event, said the stigma attached to mental health makes it a tough topic to discuss openly.\n\n\"A lot of it is a pull yourself up by your boot straps, suck it up and go on kind of mentality,\u201d she said. \u201cTough it out.\"\n\nSaddler said communities need more private resources to deal with their mental health.\n\n\"People don't want to be seen going to the mental health center,\u201d she said. \u201cI've had parents who have asked for other resources so that they don't have to go here.\"\n\nAriana Matos is an intern and Daylina Miller is a reporter at WUSF in Tampa.
