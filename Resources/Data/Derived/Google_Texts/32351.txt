A Sarasota hospital nurse was arrested Wednesday after a patient accused him of committing a lewd act at her bedside, investigators said.

Sean Golden, 43, who worked for Complex Care Hospital at Ridgelake, faces one count of lewd exhibition in the presence of a disabled person.

State investigators are looking into whether Golden committed similar crimes at another hospital, the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office said.

The 54-year old patient was at the hospital with injuries sustained in a fall, deputies said. She was physically incapacitated at the time, deputies said.

The woman said that about 9:30 p.m. Saturday, Golden entered her room, told her details about his personal life and said he wanted to be her private nurse, deputies said.

After the conversation, he stood up, touched the front of his pants and said, “See what you’re doing to me,” according to an arrest affidavit.

About 10:30 p.m., the woman awoke as Golden was standing over the bed committing a lewd act by himself, according to the affidavit.

The patient reported the incident to another nurse, who called authorities.

During the investigation, detectives learned that the state Department of Health is investigating Golden over three allegations made while he worked for another facility.

Golden, of Bradenton, was booked at the Manatee County Jail and later released on $5,000 bond.
