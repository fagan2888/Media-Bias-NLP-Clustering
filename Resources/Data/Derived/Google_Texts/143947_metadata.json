It was $24 when we bought it and is $64 now. We will be in the lowest tax bracket this year and should be in a higher bracket in a later year. A planner suggested selling some, paying taxes on the profit, and repurchasing it. \u2014 Viola C.\n\nA: \u201cTaxes should never be the sole reason to trade a stock,\u201d says Scott Bishop, director of financial planning at STA Wealth Management in Houston. Likewise, you can get into trouble holding a security longer than you should simply for the sake of saving a bit on taxes.\n\n\n\nThat said, there are times when selling in one year may be more opportune than selling in another.\n\nFirst, you need to understand how any gains from the sale of stock will be taxed.\n\nIf you had held the shares for less than a year, they would be taxed at your marginal tax bracket, in which case an early sale would probably do nothing to improve your tax situation.\n\nSince you\u2019ve owned these shares for several years they will be taxed at your long-term capital gains rate. \u201cCurrently the tax rates on long-term capital gains vary depending on your income level,\u201d says Bishop.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the 10% or 15% marginal bracket, your long-term capital gains will be nothing. Obviously, there would be a benefit to selling before the end of this year if you expect to be in either of those brackets in 2015.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the 25% to 35% bracket, your rate will be 15%. And if you\u2019re in the 39.6% bracket, you\u2019ll be taxed 20% on the gains; plus you may owe an additional 3.8% of net investment income tax stemming from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt\u2019s probably helpful to do the math and see how the decision translates to dollars.\n\nSay you own 100 shares of stock that has appreciated $40 a share. If you\u2019re in the lowest brackets this year, selling will save you $600 versus waiting until the following year and paying at the 15% rate. If your long-term rate is 15% and you think it will be 20% next year, the difference is only $200.\n\n\u201cSome people get stuck in this analysis when they are talking about a pretty small dollar amount,\u201d says Bishop, noting that you should be sure to factor for the transaction costs of a sale.\n\nIf you decide to sell, there are no rules preventing you from buying the very same stock the next day. (The only time you need to worry about this is when you sell a stock at a loss and hope to write that off against a gain.)\n\nThat said, if you wouldn\u2019t buy the stock again at today\u2019s prices, says Bishop, consider putting the proceeds to work somewhere else. \u201cDon\u2019t let biases drive the decision to buy the stock again,\u201d he says. Just because the stock has done well so far doesn\u2019t mean it will continue to do so.\n\nFinally, if you\u2019re looking at taking advantage of a lower tax bracket to sell a single stock, ask yourself if you should use this window to make more substantial changes to your portfolio. For example, maybe you\u2019d benefit from converting some of your IRA holdings to a Roth IRA.\n\nIn doing so, you\u2019ll owe income taxes now but have the benefit of tax-free withdrawals later. Over time, that could translate not just to hundreds of dollars in savings but possibly thousands.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is there a benefit to taking profit from a stock that has done well since purchasing it several years ago?", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Q: Is there a benefit to taking profit on a stock that has done well over several years?
