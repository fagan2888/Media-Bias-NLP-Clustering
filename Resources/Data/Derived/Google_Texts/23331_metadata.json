But enough about Super Bowl XLIX.\n\nWait for it \u2026 Super Bowl 50 in Santa Clara, Calif. \u2014 The Denver Broncos circa 1998 vs. The Broncsters of the Midway (duh Bears), John Elway vs. John Fox, Peyton Manning vs. Jay Cutler, Gary Kubiak vs. Adam Gase, Jeff Rodgers\u2019 special teams against Joe DeCamillis\u2019 special teams et al.\n\nWouldn\u2019t that be unique?\n\nWell, er, not so.\n\nSuper Bowl 33 in South Florida \u2014 John Elway and Mike Shanahan vs. Dan Reeves and his son-in-law, special-teams coach Joe DeCamillis.\n\nAs Katy Perry would sing, the Broncos are coming \u201clike a dark horse\u201d back to the Super Bowl a year from now. Atonement time.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, the Broncos and the Bears meet in the 2015 regular season in Denver. Could they remeet (copyright pending) in the Super Bowl?\n\nImagine if you\u2019re Rip Van Winkle and just awakened from an extremely long sleep and turned on \u201cThe Sports Show\u201d: \u201cJohn Elway is the chief football executive of the Broncos, and Gary Kubiak is the coach, and Rick Dennison is the offensive coordinator, and Wade Phillips is the defensive coordinator, and Peyton Manning is the quarterback, and John Fox is the coach of the Bears, and his offensive coordinator is Adam Gase, and Jay Cutler is the quarterback?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re dreaming, Rip Van.\n\nIt is well to remember that Manning\u2019s only Super Bowl victory was over \u2026 wait for it \u2026 the Bears.\n\nThere are a couple of issues, though, before we all make airline, hotel and restaurant reservations in San Francisco for the epic game.\n\nThe Bears have about as much chance of reaching the Super Bowl with Cutler as I do of winning Powerball. And I don\u2019t buy tickets.\n\nWhat a great Super Bowl story \u2014 \u201cJay Cutler: from Santa Claus, Ind., to Santa Clara, Calif.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t believe in Santa Claus, or Cutler. And when Fox and Gase spend five weeks with him, they will believe more in St. Nick or Nick Foles.\n\nHow about the Broncos making it to No. 50 (no Roman numerals, the NFL has decreed)?\n\nYou gotta believe. They were in seven of the first 49 \u2014 one-seventh. I like those odds, especially with Peyton coming back (and he sounded like a man eager to play again Friday morning, and there was no limp in his gait, or hesitation in his speech) and the reunion of Elway, Kubiak, Dennison and Phillips. I didn\u2019t have a warm and cozy feeling about Doug Marrone as Broncos coach, or Vance Joseph as defensive coordinator or \u201cBronco Brocko\u201d Osweiler at quarterback.\n\n\u201cI really like Brock,\u201d said a Broncos defensive player who I won\u2019t reveal, but his initials are T.J.W. \u201cHe has a cannon for an arm, and he\u2019s good in practice, but we haven\u2019t seen him in a game under fire.\u201d\n\nMarrone was a nice coach with Buffalo, and Joseph was a good backup quarterback at Colorado. No way, though.\n\nGive me a healthy Peyton, a Kubiak-Dennison combo running the offense (running!) and Phillips, one of the most brilliant defensive coordinators in the game. He will switch the Broncos back to a 3-4 scheme (the Orange Crush was 3-4).\n\nOh, you say, Peyton is too old at 39, and Wade is too old at 67. How did you like Josh McDaniels when he was 32? Ronald Reagan was sworn in as president when he was just shy of 70. Frank Lloyd Wright built a famous house in Scottsdale, Ariz., when he was 70. Elway was in his late 30s when he won a couple of Super Bowls with a running game.\n\nA bunch of Broncos have relaxed in Arizona the past couple of weeks. They were playing in the Pro Bowl and/or hanging out at Ocean Club in Scottsdale. Ocean? They are here as individuals. Last year the Broncos were there in New York as a team, and that\u2019s what all of them want in Santa Clara as a team.\n\nIf the Broncos add a few free agents with their salary cap space, and they bring back their important free agents, they definitely will be a major factor again next season.\n\nThey get New England in Denver, not in Foxborough, Mass.\n\nThis Super Bowl belongs to the Patriots and the Seahawks, and America is pulling against the Patriots. However, Bill Beli- chick and Tom Brady will have their way.\n\nBut 50 is the big number for the Broncos. As in 50-7 over the Seahawks.\n\nCan\u2019t wait.\n\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or twitter.com/woodypaige", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: Super Bowl 50: Broncos vs. Bears?", "title": "Paige: Super Bowl 50: Broncos vs. Bears?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/31/paige-super-bowl-50-broncos-vs-bears/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-31T18:30:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:48:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Woody Paige"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaddb\"", "article_summary": "The Broncsters of the Midway (duh Bears), John Elway vs. John Fox, Peyton Manning vs. Jay Cutler, Gary Kubiak vs. Adam Gase, Jeff Rodgers\u2019 special teams against Joe DeCamillis\u2019 special teams et al.\nWait for it \u2026 Super Bowl 50 in Santa Clara, Calif. \u2014 The Denver Broncos circa 1998 vs.\nIt is well to remember that Manning\u2019s only Super Bowl victory was over \u2026 wait for it \u2026 the Bears.\nThe Bears have about as much chance of reaching the Super Bowl with Cutler as I do of winning Powerball.\nSuper Bowl 33 in South Florida \u2014 John Elway and Mike Shanahan vs. Dan Reeves and his son-in-law, special-teams coach Joe DeCamillis."}
