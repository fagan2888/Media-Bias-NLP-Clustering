(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nTed Cruz would spend his first day in office trying to undo some of Barack Obama\u2019s biggest achievements via executive order.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview about how he\u2019d spend his first 100 days as president if he won, the Texas GOP senator pledged to roll back more than just the president\u2019s controversial orders related to immigration.\n\n\u201cIf you live by the pen, you die by the pen,\u201d Cruz said by phone Tuesday, as he traveled from Dallas to an afternoon tour of the Southern border. \u201cEverything put in place by executive order can be undone by executive order.\u201d\n\nCruz said he would use the transition to bring a team together \u201cto engage in a careful, systematic review of each executive action and to rescind every one of them that exceeds the Constitutional and legal authority of the president.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s comments underscored the tenuousness of some of Obama\u2019s biggest second-term accomplishments, enacted by executive order because of a Republican-dominated Congress. He\u2019s the first of several presidential candidates to outline his governing priorities in an interview with PowerPost, a new Washington Post site that will focus on the intersection of policy and politics.\n\nOther highlights from the interview:\n\nCruz promised to do whatever it takes to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, which he calls \u201cthe single greatest national security threat to the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn day one, I would expect to convene the national security team for a serious, careful, sober assessment of where Iran stands \u2013 how close they are to acquiring nuclear weapons \u2013 and to review every tool at our disposable to assure that under no circumstances does Iran acquire nuclear weapons,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Israel, he responded to this week\u2019s Supreme Court decision by saying that he would allow Americans born in Jerusalem to list Israel as their birthplace on passports. Though Republicans and Democrats have promised in the past to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Avis to the contested city, Cruz pledges that he would actually follow through.\n\nThe senator, who was the first major party candidate to formally announce his candidacy back on March 23, said he\u2019s running to try \u201cto get a mandate from the electorate\u201d to push far-reaching tax and regulatory reform. He really wants to eliminate the Internal Revenue Service, which he believes would be possible with a flat tax, but he recognizes how politically challenging such a proposition would be. So he would want to get the public behind it through the primary and general election.\n\n\u201cI intend to do everything possible to make 2016 a referendum on repealing Obamacare and adopting a flat tax,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about his legislative priorities, Cruz said he would focus on tax and regulatory reform first. He would also push for Congress to \u201crepeal every word of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHe described himself as \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the Supreme Court will side against the government in King vs. Burwell on the grounds that the federal government has \u201cillegally collected billions of dollars in taxes from Americans who do not owe them.\u201d If the court invalidates coverage for millions now receiving health subsidies, Cruz said he wants legislation that would let states \u201copt-out of Obamacare\u201d altogether.\n\nCruz promises on the trail to repeal the Common Core state standards.\n\n\u201cThis administration has used Race To The Top funds to pressure states to adopt Common Core standards,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the very outset, if I\u2019m elected, the administration would no longer use federal authority to coerce states into adopting Common Core.\u201d\n\nAsked who he might appoint to his Cabinet if he were elected, Cruz said that engaging with that question in a detailed way would be like telling a woman on a first date what he would like to name his children.\n\n\u201cOne step at a time,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Cruz said he could definitely see picking some of his GOP rivals in the 2016 race for prominent posts.\n\n\u201cAny Republican president would be a fool not to look very seriously at the men and women who will be on that debate stage as very serious and even likely members of a Republican cabinet and even a Republican dream team,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Ted Cruz would immediately roll back all of Barack Obama's executive orders that he felt exceeded legal authority.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jhohmann", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "President Ted Cruz would immediately roll back all of Barack Obama's executive orders that he felt exceeded legal authority.", "title": "\u201cIf you live by the pen, you die by the pen\u201d", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/10/if-you-live-by-the-pen-you-die-by-the-pen/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/23/Local/Images/Cruz0011427124850.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JamesHohmann"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "ted cruz, obama, the daily 202, executive order, 2016", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jhohmann"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, obama, the daily 202, executive order, 2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd263\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf you live by the pen, you die by the pen,\u201d Cruz said by phone Tuesday, as he traveled from Dallas to an afternoon tour of the Southern border.\nBut Cruz said he could definitely see picking some of his GOP rivals in the 2016 race for prominent posts.\n\u201cThis administration has used Race To The Top funds to pressure states to adopt Common Core standards,\u201d he said.\n(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)Ted Cruz would spend his first day in office trying to undo some of Barack Obama\u2019s biggest achievements via executive order.\n\u201cI intend to do everything possible to make 2016 a referendum on repealing Obamacare and adopting a flat tax,\u201d he said."}
