Burwell case will affect Biola\u2019s refusal of providing Plan B and Ella contraceptives on the account of possibly being abortive.\n\nThis may alter many other religious affiliated schools and nonprofits\u2019 declination of provision of all Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptives. Oral arguments were presented before the Supreme Court of the United States on March 23 from six individual birth control lawsuits filed against the Department of Human Health and Services.\n\nTHE PROCESS\n\nThe arguments came from various religious affiliated organizations and colleges, which will affect Biola\u2019s declination of providing all FDA approved contraceptives under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe case is in the process of determining whether the Department of Human Health and Services\u2019 contraceptive-coverage mandate violates religious nonprofits\u2019 right of not wanting to provide all FDA-approved contraceptives.\n\nAlthough Biola is not against contraceptives, it is against morning-after pills such as FDA- approved Plan B and Ella. Biola\u2019s Health Center is also careful of prescribing oral contraceptive pills due to not every female being a good candidate for the drug. They may have to be provided to Biola\u2019s female employees through the ACA if the court decides not to exempt schools like Biola and other religious nonprofits from following Obamacare law.\n\nPRESENTING THE CASE\n\nBiola called for an injunction from the Seventh Circuit court in 2012 said Jerry Mackey, the university\u2019s legal counsel, so the school would not have to abide by the ACA\u2019s rule of having to supply all FDA approved contraceptives.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re presenting your case to the court, basically, to the judge and saying \u2018We think we have a really good chance of winning this case so in the meantime don\u2019t apply the law against us until we have a chance to challenge it,\u2019\u201d Mackey said.\n\nAfter the injunction was granted, SCOTUS took up the Zubik v. Burwell case, resulting in the Seventh Circuit court holding that injunction while SCOTUS makes a decision.\n\nDespite Biola\u2019s specific case not being judged before SCOTUS, other religious affiliated schools\u2019 cases are being presented before the court.\n\n\u201cOur case is technically not before the court, but I believe there are 5 CCCU [schools] that are,\u201d Mackey said.\n\ninterfere with implantation\n\nAs far as Biola\u2019s stance against morning-after pills, Tamra Hocking, health center staff physician, said the pills are kindred to abortion, hence being called abortifacients.\n\n\u201cWe really feel that those two types of conception are unethical because they have a very high probability of killing an embryo. Plan B and Ella work after conception,\u201d Hocking said.\n\nElla is said to not be an abortion pill but only delays ovulation \u2014 egg release \u2014 up to five days after sex. However, females differ in menstrual cycle stage when taking the pill, therefore causing varied outcomes.\n\n\u201cWhen a woman takes [Ella] they don\u2019t know exactly where they are in their cycle. All they know is that they want to kill whatever is in [their body],\u201d Hocking said.\n\nElla can interfere with implantation of an early embryo when taken after ovulation, making the drug embryocidal, according to the European Medical Association.\n\nTerminology is tricky\n\nPlan B, on the other hand, contains progesterone, a hormone that allows an embryo to implant and develop. Progesterone, however, can also prevent pregnancy when taken in higher than normal doses.\n\n\u201cTerminology is tricky. If you\u2019re not really pro-life then you don\u2019t even consider [the embryo] viable life until it\u2019s implanted, whereas in my belief and at Biola, we believe life begins at conception,\u201d Hocking said.\n\nA California law passed in 2013 that will take effect in April will allow females to obtain hormonal contraceptives from pharmacies without a prescription. Biola employees currently do not receive oral contraceptive pills through the Health Center. Students who need OCPs can attain them through careful inspection and approval from a Health Center physician. Both, employees and students will have access to OCPs without a prescription once this law takes effect.\n\nBy Jocelyn Meza\n\nOther Stories U.S. wages war against ideas Americans block unwanted ideas rather than discussing them.\n\nBirth control case taken on by SCOTUS On Nov. 6, the Supreme Court combined seven separate birth control lawsuits filed against the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nConsider alternatives to funding a false gospel Professor Thaddeus Williams challenges the notion that Christians cannot care about both supporting women\u2019s health and defunding Planned Parenthood.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://chimes.biola.edu/static/media/photos/2016/Apr/06/cache/7NE01BirthControl_GG-5_home_banner.jpg", "site_name": "The Chimes | Biola University", "description": "While Biola\u2019s birth control case remains under injunction, a similar case filed by religious affiliated schools and nonprofits is being presented to the Supreme Court.", "title": "SCOTUS heard oral arguments for contraception case"}}, "article_summary": "Tweet Email SCOTUS heard oral arguments for contraception caseWhile Biola\u2019s birth control case remains under injunction, a similar case filed by religious affiliated schools and nonprofits is being presented to the Supreme Court.\nDespite Biola\u2019s specific case not being judged before SCOTUS, other religious affiliated schools\u2019 cases are being presented before the court.\nBiola\u2019s Health Center is also careful of prescribing oral contraceptive pills due to not every female being a good candidate for the drug.\nAfter the injunction was granted, SCOTUS took up the Zubik v.
