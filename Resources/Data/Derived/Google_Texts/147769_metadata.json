The program, known as Lifeline, started in the 1980s with landlines, switched to mostly bare boned phone/text wireless models and soon will offer more sophisticated phones with Internet access.\n\nThe rationale, accepted by most who noticed at the time: Without phone access, those in poverty or near-poverty often had no way to get help in emergencies or (a clincher for some critics) to respond quickly to job offers. Internet access, a classic extension of a plausible program, is a clear leap away from the personal emergency justification for free phones.\n\nQualifying for a free phone is simple enough. If anyone in a household takes part in any government assistance program\u2014from food stamps to unemployment\u2014or if the household income is below federal poverty guidelines, a free phone is available. For example, ever since the law allowed able-bodied people with income at or below the poverty line to be eligible for food stamps, a growing number of college students have qualified. As such, they\u2019re \u201cpre-approved\u201d for free-cellphones.\n\nThe website FreeGovernmentCEllPhones.net assures illegal immigrants that they can get the phones too. It has published an e-book, The Undocumented Alien\u2019s Guide to Free Government Cell Phones.\n\nThe free-phone program has even poked its way into a debate, mostly among conservatives, over whether entitlement programs like this will ever be trimmed or eliminated (the scenario is that the welfare state implodes as financially unsustainable) or remain a politically untouchable part of American life, whatever the cost.\n\nRobert Weissberg, professor of political science, emeritus, at the University of Illinois, says a free phone with unlimited minutes, \u201cmay quickly become an inalienable right\u2014in six months a basic phone may also be insufficient if friends have an even fancier gadget.\u201d\n\nOne carrier executive, Gary Carter, manager of national partnerships for Assurance Wireless, apparently already considers free phones a civil right, or something close to it. A blogger for the New York Post quoted him as saying, \u201cThe program is about peace of mind. It\u2019s one less bill that someone has to pay, so they can pay their rent or for day care. \u2026 It is a right to have peace of mind.\u201d\n\nSince each income\u2013based entitlement can serve as a gateway to other related programs\u2014getting on the burgeoning food stamp program triggers qualification for a free phone\u2014each new benefit can be seen as \u201cearned\u201d by participation in a previous one. The deeper problem, Weissberg says, is that behind the benevolence, today\u2019s federal help profoundly differs from the past interventions, breeding ingrained dependency and infantilizing the people it wants to help.\n\nRead more at The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When you pay your monthly phone bill, you\u2019re not only paying for your own service, you", "title": "What That Sneaky Fee on Your Phone Bill Means", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/11/07/What-Sneaky-Fee-Your-Phone-Bill-Means", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07232013_Lost_iPhone_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/11/07/What-Sneaky-Fee-Your-Phone-Bill-Means", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07232013_Lost_iPhone_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When you pay your monthly phone bill, you\u2019re not only paying for your own service, you", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7e1\"", "article_summary": "When you pay your monthly phone bill, you\u2019re not only paying for your own service, you\u2019re paying for someone\u2019s free cellphone service, too.\nQualifying for a free phone is simple enough.\nInternet access, a classic extension of a plausible program, is a clear leap away from the personal emergency justification for free phones.\nIt\u2019s one less bill that someone has to pay, so they can pay their rent or for day care.\nIf anyone in a household takes part in any government assistance program\u2014from food stamps to unemployment\u2014or if the household income is below federal poverty guidelines, a free phone is available."}
