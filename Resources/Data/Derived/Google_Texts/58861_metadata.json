The latest is a fundraiser at the University of California, San Francisco, one of the nation's top medical schools. An official at that medical school took to Twitter to propose that the those who are \"nonbelievers\" in Obamacare be denied medical care. The use of the term \"nonbeliever\" reveals that progressivism has become a religion. Disagreement on political policies is now a matter of faith, not political debate, at least ont he left side of the spectrum. Here is a copy of her tweet (the original has been deleted and her account suspended):\n\nOf course, the ultimate boss of Ms. Handler would be the new president of the University of California, Janet Napolitano. She, and the Board of Regents, should be queried as to whether Ms. Handler's public expression of hate is something that the University will tolerate.\n\nProgressives are showing signs of coming apart as the fantasies about Obama and the progressive agenda are running into reality. Recently, we have seen Michigan State University Professor William Penn caught on tape indoctrinating his class about evil Caucasians who \"raped\" the country, instead of teaching them creative writing, which is what the taxpayers of Michigan were paying him for. He has been \"punished\" with a paid vacation, no longer required to teach his classes, but still collecting his paycheck, much like Lois Lerner and the State Department officials who allowed the massacre of an ambassador and 3 others in Benghazi.\n\nThen there is Kansas University Professor David Guth, who on Monday, shortly after the Navy Yard massacre, tweeted, \"#NavyYardShooting The blood is on the hands of the #NRA . Next time, let it be YOUR sons and daughters. Shame on you. May God damn you.\"\n\nHe has been placed on administrative leave, which I suspect means he is also collecting a paycheck from the taxpayers, while not having to perform the duties associated with his job.\n\nThe theme of wishing death on the children of those who disagree with progressives was also taken up by the communications director of the California Democrats in Sacramento, who tweeted:\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice all the people who liked this vile wish.\n\nOf course, President Obama will say nothing about this. His pious talk about civility in the wake of the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords is down the memory hole.\n\nThe fact that there are so many progressives out there who think death is the appropriate punishment for disagreement with their politics is a dangerous sign. It is time for responsible Democrats (if there are any left) to speak up. But I am not holding my breath.\n\nHat tips: Hot Air, Twitchy, and Instapundiut.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2013/09/medical_school_official_urges_denial_of_care_for_obamacare_nonbelievers.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/legacy_assets/blog/assets/Allan Brauer tweet.png", "title": "Blog: Medical school official urges denial of care for Obamacare 'nonbelievers'"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "An official at that medical school took to Twitter to propose that the those who are \"nonbelievers\" in Obamacare be denied medical care.\nThe latest is a fundraiser at the University of California, San Francisco, one of the nation's top medical schools.\nThen there is Kansas University Professor David Guth, who on Monday, shortly after the Navy Yard massacre, tweeted, \"#NavyYardShooting The blood is on the hands of the #NRA .\nDisagreement on political policies is now a matter of faith, not political debate, at least ont he left side of the spectrum.\nProgressives are showing signs of coming apart as the fantasies about Obama and the progressive agenda are running into reality."}
