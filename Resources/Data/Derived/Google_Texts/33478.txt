Dunbar took the streets Sunday for its 72nd annual celebration of Easter.

Hundreds of people lined the streets to watch the parade along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

City and religious leaders took part in promoting faith and peace.

The parade is a tradition, with some saying it's a moment to focus on the good in the community.

"It's a lot of negative things going on in the Dunbar community and the city of Fort Myers. And this is very important for family, friends, and children. The youth more importantly," said Nyema Brown.
