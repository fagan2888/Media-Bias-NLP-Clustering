But if you don\u2019t grow the private economy over the long haul, you can\u2019t be the party of opportunity because there are only so many golden eggs to pass out if you don\u2019t have a healthy goose.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama courts GOP ahead of uphill Senate vote)\n\nPart of growing the private economy, said From, involves raising the minimum wage, but not quite to the level embraced by some liberals.\n\n\u201cWe ought to increase the minimum wage,\u201d From said. \u201cBut we\u2019re probably not going to increase it to the level that a lot of people \u2014 some people, anyway, in the Democratic Party \u2014 would like. And what our goal ought to be, as modern, tough liberals, is that nobody who works full time, year-round in this country to support a family ought to be poor. That ought to be the liberal goal.\u201d\n\nFrom said that the party\u2019s current leader \u2014 President Barack Obama \u2014 could stand to sharpen his own vision on economic matters.\n\n( PHOTOS: 20 politicians talk minimum wage)\n\n\u201cI think he could articulate a theory of economic growth that people could understand better,\u201d From said. \u201cI think he could take a strong stand on issues that would lead to growing the economy. \u2026 I think a little less rhetoric, what I could call class warfare and more on focusing on how you grow the economy.\u201d\n\nFrom says that the bungled roll-out of Obamacare hurts the Democratic Party\u2019s aspirations of being good stewards of efficient, effective government.\n\n( PHOTOS: 12 Democrats criticizing the Obamacare rollout)\n\n\u201cWe have to make it work,\u201d said From. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on Democrats to make government work. Democrats are the party that believes in an activist government. We believe that the government is the agent of our collective wills. It is the vehicle for doing good things for people. \u2026 You just cannot mess around with Obamacare. It\u2019s just too important.\u201d\n\nLong a Clinton family friend and ally, From says he would support a presidential run by Hillary Clinton should she choose to pursue it and says that her road to the White House has some natural advantages.\n\n\u201cShe needs to take the core principles that under girded Bill Clinton\u2019s principles, the New Democratic principles of opportunity, community and responsibility, but understand that there are new challenges and come up with a new agenda,\u201d From said. \u201cIf she lays out a vision for the future of the country with specific ideas, I think she\u2019s going to be unstoppable. \u2026 I think that when people look back on eight years of peace and prosperity, some of the personal things that may have gotten in the way at the end of his administration, people forget that. But I think people will look back at the 1990s as as pretty good time in this country.\u201d\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;We ought to increase the minimum wage,&quot; says the Democratic Leadership Council founder.", "title": "From: It's still the economy", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/al-from-its-still-the-economy-101820.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/07/al_from_sg_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Democratic Leadership Council,Democrats,Economy,Al From,Minimum Wage", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "&quot;We ought to increase the minimum wage,&quot; says the Democratic Leadership Council founder.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda242\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think he could take a strong stand on issues that would lead to growing the economy.\nAlthough From told POLITICO that the current Democratic Party \u201cis doing pretty well,\u201d he says \u201cwe also have some big challenges.\u201dStory Continued Below\u201cWe have to make sure that we can grow the economy and create jobs,\u201d From said.\nBut if you don\u2019t grow the private economy over the long haul, you can\u2019t be the party of opportunity because there are only so many golden eggs to pass out if you don\u2019t have a healthy goose.\u201d( Also on POLITICO: Obama courts GOP ahead of uphill Senate vote)Part of growing the private economy, said From, involves raising the minimum wage, but not quite to the level embraced by some liberals.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re probably not going to increase it to the level that a lot of people \u2014 some people, anyway, in the Democratic Party \u2014 would like.\nBut I think people will look back at the 1990s as as pretty good time in this country.\u201dFollow @politico"}
