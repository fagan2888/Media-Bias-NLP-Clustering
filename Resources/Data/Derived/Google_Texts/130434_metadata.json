He\u2019s a long shot candidate, but one that could find avenues of attack to further undercut the narrative of Hillary Clinton\u2019s supposed invulnerability. Yet, over at Hot Air, Ed Morrissey mentioned a development regarding Webb\u2019s Born Fighting PAC, which apparently benefitted his family. While Morrissey noted that this story could shine a light on Webb\u2019s possible hypocrisy about the system being \u201crigged,\u201d he also mentioned that this could be an opening salvo from the Clinton team concerning the dissemination of opposition research [bold text is US News]:\n\nA couple of commenters think that this may be a signal that Hillary Clinton\u2019s team is getting a head start on oppo research and dissemination. Noah found this buried in a US News report, which will feed that suspicion: While they aren\u2019t acknowledging Webb publicly, Clinton loyalists are keeping an eye on him privately. The week before Thanksgiving, staffers of Philippe Reines, Clinton\u2019s longtime communications guru, pitched talk radio producers on the racy, sexually charged writings in Webb\u2019s novels, according to a source. Webb was forced to fend off a similar attack in 2006, when Allen accused him of \u201cdemeaning women.\u201d That would have been just days after Webb\u2019s announcement \u2026 and it\u2019s old news anyway. It\u2019s interesting to see the Clintonistas using a kitchen-sink strategy this early in the process. It definitely sends a message to other Democrats who might dare to intrude on Coronation II: Hillary\u2019s Boogaloo.\n\nWebb beat incumbent George Allen in the 2006 senate race by a slim margin. And if Team Hillary is looking for the \u201cwar on women\u201d angle, they\u2019re a little late. This line of attack really wasn\u2019t effective in 2014; at times, it was laughed at openly in debates.\n\nBesides being a candidate that could do well with the \u201cbeer track\u201d voters with his brand of populism, Webb also has foreign policy bona fides that Clinton cannot match or attack, as Jacob Heilbrunn of the National Interest wrote in the New York Times right before Christmas:\n\nIn contrast to Mrs. Clinton, who has gotten into hot water for trying to retroactively amend her views and record, Mr. Webb did not arrive at these beliefs casually or opportunistically. As his recent memoir, \u201cI Heard My Country Calling,\u201d makes clear, his opposition to ventures abroad is as much viscerally emotional as intellectual. Growing up as a self-described military brat, he spent his formative years in Britain, where he saw firsthand the effects of loss of empire and the devastation wrought by World War II. \u201cBritain was bled out and spent out,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey understood the great price of the recent wars in a much more sobering way than did most Americans.\u201d After he returned from war-torn Beirut just before a truck suicide bomber destroyed the Marine Corps headquarters in October 1983, he felt a nagging irritation as he rode home in a taxi early in the morning along George Washington Memorial Parkway. Then he realized that the calm silence was bothering him; it was both the emblem of America and the \u201cprotective vacuum that surrounds our understanding when it comes to the viciousness that war brings to so many innocent noncombatants in other lands.\u201d Mr. Webb\u2019s exposure to foreign societies gave him the ability, much like President Obama, to view America as both an insider and an outsider. Whether Mr. Webb will attempt to begin a successful maverick campaign is an open question. But he is an eloquent and forthright speaker whose foreign policy experience would make it difficult for Mrs. Clinton to paint him as an isolationist or a novice who will leave America open to attack, as she attempted to do to Mr. Obama during the 2008 primaries. On the contrary, it\u2019s Mrs. Clinton whose interventionist foreign policy record leaves her politically vulnerable.\n\nWilliam Greider reiterated such sentiments last fall in the left-wing publication the Nation:\n\nIn 2007, Chris Matthews dubbed him \u201cthe anti-war warrior.\u201d That\u2019s a clever label, but it fundamentally misconstrued Jim Webb\u2019s position. He is not anti-war in the classical sense\u2014war fought for history\u2019s long-established justifications or real threats to the nation. What Webb opposes are reckless and limitless interventions the United States has initiated during the post\u2013Cold War era of the last three decades. Presidents of both parties, including Barack Obama, have strayed from the old principles and the country has been deeper into foreign conflicts without clear purpose or strategy. \u201cIt is not a healthy thing when the most powerful and capable nation on earth has a foreign policy based on vagueness,\u201d Webb observed. He had in mind George W. Bush but also Obama\u2019s vague purpose in entering the bloody civil war in Syria. \u201cThere is no such thing,\u201d Webb has asserted, as \u201chumanitarian war,\u201d a feel-good concept popularized by some of Obama\u2019s national security advisors. \u2026 Jim Webb, I acknowledge, is probably not going to become our next president. But he has the possibility of becoming a pivotal messenger. I think of him as a vanguard politician\u2014that rare type who is way out ahead of conventional wisdom and free to express big ideas the media herd regards as taboo. With luck, the country might have two such characters in the 2016 primaries\u2014Jim Webb and Bernie Sanders. In different ways, both are expressing unsanctioned ideas that Americans need to hear.\n\nHey, if a beaten and bloodied Hillary campaign emerges from victorious from this melee a la Romney in 2012, that\u2019s fine by me. At least it\u2019ll show that Ms. Clinton is just like anyone else running for president in 2016: human and beatable. At the same time, it also shows that progressives haven't\u2013and probably never will\u2013forgive her for her 2002 vote, which authorized the use of force in Iraq.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We're back to Webb's books again..05/26/2016 20:28:39PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "We're back to Webb's books again.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Team Hillary 'Keeping An Eye' On Jim Webb", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/01/05/team-hillary-keeping-an-eye-on-jim-webb-n1938882", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/207/2014-06-18T032927Z_3_LYNXMPEA5G16W_RTROPTP_3_USA-POLITICS-CLINTON.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "We're back to Webb's books again.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Team Hillary 'Keeping An Eye' On Jim Webb", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/01/05/team-hillary-keeping-an-eye-on-jim-webb-n1938882", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/207/2014-06-18T032927Z_3_LYNXMPEA5G16W_RTROPTP_3_USA-POLITICS-CLINTON.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Team Hillary 'Keeping An Eye' On Jim Webb, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "And if Team Hillary is looking for the \u201cwar on women\u201d angle, they\u2019re a little late.\nWhether Mr. Webb will attempt to begin a successful maverick campaign is an open question.\nNoah found this buried in a US News report, which will feed that suspicion: While they aren\u2019t acknowledging Webb publicly, Clinton loyalists are keeping an eye on him privately.\n\u201cIt is not a healthy thing when the most powerful and capable nation on earth has a foreign policy based on vagueness,\u201d Webb observed.\nAs previously mentioned, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb has launched an exploratory committee for a possible 2016 presidential run."}
