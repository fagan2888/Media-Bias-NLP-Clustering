He stood with consumer advocates, retirees and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the liberal favorite who has pushed the administration to tighten Wall Street regulations.\n\n\u201cWe've got a lot more work to do to make sure the recovery reaches every single American out there and not just those at the top,\u201d Obama said in remarks delivered at AARP headquarters.\n\nThe proposed rule, which Obama can put in place without congressional approval, would impose a requirement on some financial advisors to act as what the law calls \u201cfiduciaries\u201d for their clients, meaning that when they recommend or sell investments, they would be required to put the clients' interests ahead of other factors, such as their own compensation or company profits.\n\nThe aim is to crack down on advisors who steer investors to products that provide hidden payments or generate higher fees, and not necessarily those that provide the best returns.\n\nCurrently, advisors are required to recommend \u201csuitable\u201d investments for clients, but that standard leaves considerable room for abuses, according to consumer advocates who have long called for imposing a fiduciary requirement.\n\nThe White House says that conflicts of interest cost savers millions. A report released Monday by the Council of Economic Advisors estimated that investors receiving \u201cconflicted advice\u201d earn lower returns \u2013 roughly 1 percentage point lower each year \u2013 than other investors. That adds up to roughly $17 billion in lost returns in IRAs each year, the report said. Over time the losses build to tens of thousands of dollars for average workers.\n\nFinancial services industry officials dispute those estimates, saying the losses are smaller.\n\nThe Department of Labor proposed similar regulations in 2010, only to see a strong industry pushback and criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Opponents argued that the rules as written would have inadvertently prevented investors from receiving important advice and would have dictated how firms could compensate their employees.\n\nThe new version of the proposal includes exemptions aimed at addressing those concerns, officials said.\n\nThe president, however, suggested that some of the financial industry\u2019s complaints were overblown. Rules governing retirement investing are decades old and in need of updating, he said.\n\nInput from Wall Street will be welcome during the process of writing a final version of the regulation, he said, but \u201cwhat I won\u2019t accept is the notion that there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese industry doomsday protections have not come true in other countries\u201d that have taken more aggressive steps, Obama argued. And while some firms may suffer under the new rule, if their advisors are \u201cbilking\u201d clients, \u201cthen you shouldn\u2019t be in business. That\u2019s pretty straight-forward.\u201d\n\nThe tough talk came from a president trying to burnish his record on financial regulation as the clock ticks down on his tenure. Obama argued that the reform he enacted in the wake of the banking collapse \u201chas been meaningful, it has been effective.\u201d\n\nThe White House enlisted Warren\u2019s advice on this and other economic proposals \u2013 making a relatively rare attempt to win the public approval of an advocate who is beloved by many Democratic liberals, but not so much by Wall Street. Warren recently met with Obama\u2019s top domestic policy advisor, Cecilia Munoz, to discuss this proposal, as well as measures on community colleges and student loans, a White House official said.\n\nThe announcement comes as Republicans are preparing to outline their top economic proposals in a budget. Officials say the president will try to draw a stark contrast in the coming weeks by making announcements about proposals they say will boost wages, make college more affordable and protect consumers.\n\n\u201cThese steps -- which will have a real, tangible impact on millions of working- and middle-class Americans -- come at a time when Republicans in Congress are pushing the same failed trickle-down economic policies that led to the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,\u201d White House senior advisor Brian Deese said on Monday in an email announcing the regulations.\n\nA White House fact sheet did not detail the precisely how the new exemptions would accommodate some of the industry\u2019s past concerns. The exemptions were described as \u201cmore principles-based\u201d and the new proposals would not prohibit revenue-sharing or commissions or dictate how firms pay their advisors, the fact sheet said.\n\nThe White House said the new higher standards would not apply to advisors providing \u201cgeneral education\u201d about employer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obama proposes tougher consumer rules to protect IRA investors", "date": "2015-02-23", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "President Obama on Monday proposed tougher regulations on investment brokers who handle retirement funds, saying new rules would limit hidden fees, \u201cback-door payments\u201d and conflicts of interest that eat into middle-class Americans\u2019 savings.", "title": "Obama proposes tougher consumer rules to protect IRA investors", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-retirement-20150223-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54eb4334/turbine/la-na-obama-retirement-20150223", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "President Obama, Elizabeth Warren, retirement savings, IRAs", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82892075", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "President Obama, Elizabeth Warren, retirement savings, IRAs", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "President Obama on Monday proposed tougher regulations on investment brokers who handle retirement funds, saying new rules would limit hidden fees, \u201cback-door payments\u201d and conflicts of interest that eat into middle-class Americans\u2019 savings.
