Mary Fallin, conservative talk radio host Glenn Beck, and U.S. Senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz during Sunday's rally.\n\nCruz\u2019s visit Sunday evening marks the fourth appearance by a presidential candidate in Oklahoma in a little less than 48 hours. Florida Senator Marco Rubio appeared at the same venue Friday afternoon, while GOP frontrunner Donald Trump spoke a few blocks away at the Cox Convention Center Friday evening. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders appeared at the Cox Center just a few hours before Cruz\u2019s rally, and former president Bill Clinton campaigned in Edmond on behalf of his wife Hillary on Saturday morning.\n\nThe Texas Senator appeared with conservative talk radio host Glenn Beck, who said he rarely endorses a candidate. Gov. Mary Fallin introduced Beck, but stopped short of endorsing Cruz. She also spoke during Rubio\u2019s rally Friday, and appeared at Trump\u2019s campaign event as well.\n\n\n\nOklahoma @GovMaryFallin introduces Glenn Beck.

Supporters also lined the balcony, and Cruz told them all this fall\u2019s presidential election boils down to three key issues: Jobs, freedom, and security.\n\n\u201cAll of us are here today because America is in crisis,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re bankrupting our kids and grandkids. Because our constitutional rights are being assaulted each and every day. And because America has receded from leadership in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Senator said the country has been trapped in seven years of \u201cObama-Clinton stagnation,\u201d and said current economic policy isn\u2019t working. He also made a subtle jab at Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real easy to talk about making America great again. You can even print that on a baseball cap. But the real question is, do you understand values and principles that made America great in the first place?\u201d Cruz asked. \u201cThey key to our economy is small business. It\u2019s the heart of the economy.\u201d\n\nCruz also said if he\u2019s elected, he\u2019ll repeal every word of the Affordable Care Act, and pass new health care reform that makes insurance personal, portable, and affordable. He also advocated for adopting a flat tax.\n\n\u201cWhere every American can fill out our taxes on a postcard, and when we do that, we should abolish the IRS,\u201d Cruz said, which drew a cheer from the crowd.\n\nHe criticized politicians, and Washington deal-makers concerned about lobbyist interests, and said that\u2019s most clearly illustrated by immigration, and the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill crafted by a bipartisan group of Senators known as the \u201cGang of Eight.\u201d Cruz called it a \u201cmassive amnesty bill,\u201d and highlighted Rubio\u2019s involvement in the legislation, tying him to President Obama then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\n\u201cI made a very different decision,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI made the decision to stand with millions of Americans and say, \u2018This will not stand,\u2019 and we defeated amnesty in Congress.\u201d\n\nHe then brought up Trump, and criticized him for campaign contributions to five members of the Gang of Eight, specifically \u201copen-border Democrats.\u201d Cruz also said he would build a wall between the United States and Mexico, triple the border patrol, and end sanctuary cities.\n\nCruz then shifted to the second issue he says this election is about \u2013 freedom. He started by remembering the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, calling him a \u201clion of the law.\u201d He said the high court vacancy underscores the stakes of the election. He repeated that the country is \u201cone liberal justice away\u201d from a left-wing majority that would undermine religious liberty.\n\n\u201cWe are one justice away from the Supreme Court concluding that your religious freedom can be taken away, and the government can force you to violate your faith on paying a fine,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe are one justice away from the Supreme Court ordering that Ten Commandments monuments to be torn down all over this country. We are one justice away from the Supreme Court effectively erasing the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.\u201d\n\nHe shifted to what he called the third critical issue of this election \u2013 security. He said for the past seven years president Obama has abandoned and alienated U.S. allies, and appeased enemies. He criticized Trump and Clinton for openness to work with Palestinians.\n\n\u201cIf I am elected president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nCruz also said he would stand up to terrorism, rebuild the military, and compared his approach to how President Reagan dealt with the Soviets.\n\nThe Texas Senator concluded his speech by calling Oklahoma a battleground during the Republican presidential primary on Tuesday, and said he\u2019s the only candidate that\u2019s beaten Trump, and can continue to do so.\n\n\n\nRev.

Patriots who love this country. All of us are here because America is in crisis.\u2014 Brian Hardzinski (@brianhardzinski) February 28, 2016\n\nCruz: If we need to, we\u2019ll overwhelming force, kill the enemy, \u201cget the heck outta there.\u201d\u2014 Brian Hardzinski (@brianhardzinski) February 28, 2016\n\nCruz: You want to know who will stand up to Washington? Ask yourself, who is Washington attacking?\u2014 Brian Hardzinski (@brianhardzinski) February 28, 2016\n\nCruz: It took Jimmy Carter to give us Ronald Reagan. And I\u2019m convinced Obama\u2019s longest-lasting legacy will be new generation of GOP leaders.\u2014 Brian Hardzinski (@brianhardzinski) February 28, 2016\n\nSeveral hundred supporters lined up outside during the hours before the doors to the Chevy Bricktown Events Center opened. Edmond resident Jon Rogers said he supports Cruz because he\u2019s kept promises to his constituents, and didn\u2019t fall into what he called the \u201cWashington cartel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Congress and the Senate are supposed to act upon what the people sent them there to do, and most of them don\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cTo me, Ted Cruz is the person who\u2019s going to hopefully rally back, and just like he\u2019s done in the past, he\u2019s stood up for what he\u2019s said and what his constituents wanted.\u201d\n\nRogers also said he doesn\u2019t trust Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI understand people are behind him because he\u2019s saying a lot of things that people want to hear as far as politically correctness, or not being politically correct,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cBut if you look back at his past, he\u2019s a liar, and he\u2019s too wishy-washy.\u201d\n\nTyler and Sarah Merrill drove to Oklahoma City from Wellston to see Cruz because they agree with his policies, and his record, and said he\u2019s honest, even though other GOP candidates continue to refer to Cruz as a \u201cliar.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has done what he\u2019s said he\u2019s going to do, even whenever it\u2019s come back to look negatively on him, or people haven\u2019t necessarily liked the way it looks, or other Senators haven\u2019t agreed with him,\u201d Tyler Merrill said. \u201cIt\u2019s made it difficult for him in his position in the Senate, but he\u2019s done what\u2019s supposed to. He\u2019s done what he said he was going to do.\u201d\n\nMerrill said he\u2019s for small government, and he doesn\u2019t see that with the other candidates. He referred to Trump as \u201centertaining.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fear more what would happen after his presidency than to much him being president,\u201d Merrill said.\n\nKGOU produces journalism in the public interest, essential to an informed electorate.
