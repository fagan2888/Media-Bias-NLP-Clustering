Beside her is a bag. A substantial bag. A bag that has a personality all its own. One of her hands is on its big, strong shoulder.\n\nBut the expression on her face registers annoyance. In fact, that hand on the bag\u2019s shoulder suggests a gentle chastisement, one that pleads for a little understanding, a little patience and, really, must you be so obvious, showing off the lovely tan of your skin? That bag is irritating her, if you ask me. It always wants to sit right beside her, take up space, butt in on a photo shoot even. If the bag had its way, it would plunk itself down on her lap all the time. And I can tell it\u2019s the sort of bag that is happiest when she keeps a good firm grip on its handle.\n\nStudying that ad, I thought that maybe the fashion editors behind that particular Max Mara shoot had not been clear with the expression they asked Garner to summon (either that or Garner, who is considered a great actress, isn\u2019t). But then I realized that just as all fashion editors everywhere seem to conspire behind our backs about what will be the new, hot looks each season \u2013 what fun they must have had when they met for herbal tea and zero-calorie crackers earlier this year to decide that we should all be throwing away our money on more leopard print this fall! \u2013 so do fashion marketers.\n\nThat, surely, is the reason why the Bag (handbag, tote, you name it) is the New Boyfriend this year. If we let our metaphoric imagination run a little wild, given that fashion is often interpreted as a vast silent language expressing cultural anxieties and fantasies, it\u2019s a cheeky feminist take of the economic independence of women who don\u2019t feel they need or want a man, except the kind who will carry your stuff around for you, agree to be elegant arm candy and never, ever complain. These aren\u2019t bags for demure ladies or frivolous girls. They are bags for women who know who they are, where they\u2019re headed and what they\u2019re willing to tolerate \u2013 or not. They are in charge and take charge. They have a hand on the handle of all things, as it were. Especially those boyfriend substitutes.\n\nThe Kate Spade people have come right out with the comparison. \u201cShe took coffee breaks with her beau perhaps a little more often than she should,\u201d reads the coy print advertisement for the 2 Park Avenue Beau Bag, which features a young woman who looks like she\u2019s playing hooky from the office with her handsome, ultrasoft-cowhide lover. \u201cThe ideal companion to tote around town,\u201d carries on the marketing material. Not that Beau\u2019s a cheap date \u2013 he/it costs $498 \u2013 but, with high-end Gucci escorts going for as much as $3,000, he\u2019s certainly a more affordable version of a good time.\n\nSpeaking of Gucci, the women in the ads for the Italian brand\u2019s bags look as though they\u2019re planning to commit a lewd sexual act with one. In a Vionnet ad, the model is fellating her bag\u2019s chain strap while watching herself in a mirror. The Hugo Boss campaign shows women sporting their stern, boxy bags like a bouncer protecting them from the camera\u2019s lens. And in a Louis Vuitton ad, Michelle Williams looks slightly bored with her expensive boyfriend. In fact, she appears ready to dump him in the back of the closet \u2013 which, of course, is another nice thing about boyfriends that are bags. They\u2019re easy to break up with.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about bags. We all have relationships with them \u2013 some good, some bad, some indifferent. In the essay collection I Feel Bad About My Neck (And Other Thoughts on Being a Woman), the late Nora Ephron wrote one entitled I Hate My Purse, which hilariously described the tension between a woman and her \u201cdemanding accessory.\u201d The purse is \u201ca reflection of negligent housekeeping, hopeless disorganization,\u201d she complained. In short \u2013 and to continue the boyfriend metaphor \u2013 a bag may make you look good and come in handy, but it can also bring out your worst traits.\n\nThe other day, I overheard a conversation between two women that perfectly explained the whole bag/boyfriend thing \u2013 why we need more than one, why we divorce some, why we can grow tired of them and treat them badly, why we then splurge on new ones with the delusional hope that a whole new happy relationship is possible.\n\nWoman #1: \u201cThat\u2019s a great bag.\u201d She pointed to her friend\u2019s flat cross-body purse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Woman #2 responded, patting it gently like a dog. \u201cIt carries the essentials. I put my keys in it. My wallet. I can take it anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you have your hands free!\u201d Woman #1 noted enviously, like a wife who might pointedly admire how a friend\u2019s husband washes the dishes without being asked.\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d the other acknowledged smugly. Then she looked down at the bag with a hint of displeasure. \u201cBut, like all bags, they are never perfect.\u201d\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.333", "description": "Handbags are being increasingly anthropomorphized by designers and marketers targeting financially independent women with cheeky guy-substitute allusions", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "Handbags are being increasingly anthropomorphized by designers and marketers targeting financially independent women with cheeky guy-substitute allusions", "title": "My new beau is handsome, reliable \u2013 and lined with metallic jacquard", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/fashion-and-beauty/fashion/my-new-beau-is-handsome-reliable-and-lined-with-metallic-jacquard/article14197706/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/470/life/fashion-and-beauty/fashion/article14197705.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/KateSpade.jpg", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/14197706", "iphone": "tgam://article/14197706"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "description": "Handbags are being increasingly anthropomorphized by designers and marketers targeting financially independent women with cheeky guy-substitute allusions", "account_id": 1512948019, "card": "app", "site": "@globeandmail"}, "robots": "noarchive", "last-modified": "2013-09-14 12:00:00 EDT", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "Jennifer Garner;bag;fashion;boyfriend;ad;fashion editors;boyfriend substitutes;column;Sarah Hampson;handbag;Kate Spade;Max Mara;beau;2 Park Avenue Beau Bag;Gucci;Vionnet;Hugo Boss;Michelle Williams;marketer;", "article": {"engagement": "true", "type": "column", "id": 14197706, "comments": "false", "pages": 1}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8eb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Woman #2 responded, patting it gently like a dog.\nThey are bags for women who know who they are, where they\u2019re headed and what they\u2019re willing to tolerate \u2013 or not.\nThe Hugo Boss campaign shows women sporting their stern, boxy bags like a bouncer protecting them from the camera\u2019s lens.\nThat, surely, is the reason why the Bag (handbag, tote, you name it) is the New Boyfriend this year.\nAnd I can tell it\u2019s the sort of bag that is happiest when she keeps a good firm grip on its handle."}
