Florida State players wore special ribbon decals on their helmets Saturday to honor the victims of this week's shooting at the university library.

Investigators are still trying to determine why 31-year-old Myron May, a 2005 FSU graduate who went on to law school in Texas and returned to Florida three weeks ago, opened fire in the lobby of the Strozier Library early Thursday morning.

One victim remains in critical condition at Tallahassee HealthCare, one was released from the hospital late Friday and one was treated and released right after the shooting.

When the third-ranked Seminoles (10-0) hosted the Boston College Eagles at Doak Campbell Stadium, the team's helmets had the ribbon decal, part of the university's #FSUnited campaign to support the victims.
