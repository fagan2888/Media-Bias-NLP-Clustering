Sam Brownback, a Republican, has just signed a bill from his state legislature banning welfare recipients from spending the public aid they receive through the federal Temporary Aid to Needy Families program in ways lawmakers deem wasteful or inappropriate.\n\nNow off limits are travel on cruise ships \u2013 likely somewhat scarce in landlocked Kansas \u2013 as well as adult entertainment, tattoos, alcohol, lingerie, and a long list of other products and services disapproved of by the Kansas state legislature.\n\nRelated: 30 Things You Can't Buy on Welfare\n\nSupporters say the move has benefits. First, they say that by drawing bright lines that separate acceptable spending from unacceptable, lawmakers are actually helping welfare recipients make better decisions and nudge them toward transitioning off public assistance sooner. Second, they claim, it will save money by making welfare fraud less attractive to people who want to spend TANF money on these so-called luxuries.\n\nOne state lawmaker told the Associated Press that every dollar spent fraudulently is a dollar not going to otherwise eligible families. At least 23 other states have also passed laws restricting how these public benefits can be used, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nThere are problems with much of this reasoning, however. First, it\u2019s unclear that substantial numbers of welfare recipients are heading to the tattoo parlor, the casino, or the travel agent when their electronic benefits card is reloaded. A federal study of welfare spending found that less than 1 percent of welfare funds are spent at such establishments.\n\nSecond, the law is largely unenforceable, since TANF recipients can use the electronic benefits cards to withdraw cash. The law, however, does take some steps to prevent the poor from making big-ticket purchases under the radar by banning cash withdrawals of more than $25 per day.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why the Global Economic Recovery Could Stall Out\n\nInterestingly, the bill does not bar TANF recipients from buying guns and ammunition with their welfare checks. The spokesperson for the Kansas Department of Children and Families said that TANF checks are meant to be spent on necessities \u2013 and defended the exemption for weapons on the grounds that if they are needed to protect a family in a \u201cdangerous neighborhood\u201d or to hunt for food, they could be considered a necessity.\n\nHere\u2019s a partial list of what is now off limits for TANF spending in Kansas:\n\nCasinos\n\nJewelry stores\n\nMassage parlors\n\nBody piercing parlors\n\nLingerie shops\n\nVapor cigarette stores\n\nFortune-telling businesses\n\nVideo arcades\n\nSwimming pools\n\nCruise ships\n\nTheme parks\n\nStrip clubs\n\nConcert tickets\n\nLottery tickets\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Kansas\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature is cracking down on the ways in which welfare recipients can spend public dollars \u2013 and that means cruise ship spending is now off limits.", "title": "Welfare Crackdown: Kansas Bans Cruises for the Poor", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/16/Welfare-Crackdown-Kansas-Bans-Cruises-Poor", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06132013_Cruise_ship_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/16/Welfare-Crackdown-Kansas-Bans-Cruises-Poor", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06132013_Cruise_ship_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Kansas\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature is cracking down on the ways in which welfare recipients can spend public dollars \u2013 and that means cruise ship spending is now off limits.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf852\"", "article_summary": "A federal study of welfare spending found that less than 1 percent of welfare funds are spent at such establishments.\nNow off limits are travel on cruise ships \u2013 likely somewhat scarce in landlocked Kansas \u2013 as well as adult entertainment, tattoos, alcohol, lingerie, and a long list of other products and services disapproved of by the Kansas state legislature.\nSecond, the law is largely unenforceable, since TANF recipients can use the electronic benefits cards to withdraw cash.\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why the Global Economic Recovery Could Stall OutInterestingly, the bill does not bar TANF recipients from buying guns and ammunition with their welfare checks.\nFirst, it\u2019s unclear that substantial numbers of welfare recipients are heading to the tattoo parlor, the casino, or the travel agent when their electronic benefits card is reloaded."}
