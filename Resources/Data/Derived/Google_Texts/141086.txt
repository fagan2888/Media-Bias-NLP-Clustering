PARIS (AP) — Star-power met with conquistadors at Sunday as Kanye West, Ciara and Chris Brown held center stage at Paris Fashion Week’s Givenchy’s show that channeled the Spanish adventurers who sailed in search of the Cities of Gold.

Meanwhile, former Destiny’s Child singer Kelly Rowland posed with Formula One racing driver Lewis Hamilton at John Galliano’s front row, as Celine unveiled its latest fall-winter 2016 collection.

GIVENCHY’S CONQUISTADOR

Givenchy’s Riccardo Tisci is often inspired by combat.

In Sunday’s complex and accomplished show the Italian-born designer expressed this — with subtlety — by channeling the Spanish conquistador of the 1500s, who went to South America as a colonizer in search of new land and adventure.

Native Central American patterning — large eyes and Inca or Mayan-style geometric shapes — appeared in slim-fitting dresses and tops in dark, cream and yellow, on models with eyeliner that elongated the eye.

Ominous, large gold coin pendants meanwhile adorned dark, gothic bombers.

The conquistador was represented by militaristic jackets in red, black and brown, sometimes with luxuriant fur arms. This collection was very much about the cultural fusion that came about when the Spanish colonizer came to Latin America and discovered the native traditions.

As ever with Tisci, the complex reference in this collection were deftly handled — creating a focused and harmonious fashion display.

Snake skin boots evoked the fauna of the conquistador’s new found terrain, and a series of leopard and jaguar-print looks, perfectly evoked the Native Central American tribes’ admiration for wild cats.

CELINE’S SIMPLICITY

It was a beautiful, if fairly straight-forward, collection at the normally thought-provoking Celine Sunday.
