The original story stated water and sewer rates were proposed to rise.)\n\nThe house at 1241 3rd Ave. is old and the owners want the city to say so.\n\nProposed water rate structure Existing for single-family home 0 - 2,900 gallons: $1.89/1,000 gallons 2,901 - 6,900 : $2,36/ 1,000 6,901 - 20,900: $3.07/1,000 20,901 - 40,900: $3.78/1,000 40,900+: $4.72/1,000 Proposed for single-family home 2015 0 - 5,000 gallons: $2.24/1,000 gallons 5,001 - 15,000 : $3.17/ 1,000 15,001 - 35,000: $3.75/1,000 35,000+: $5.28/1,000\n\nSusan Abenilla-Brown, her husband Brian Brown and her mother Elanore Abenilla are petitioning the city commission Tuesday to designate the house, built sometime between 1900 and 1920, as a local historic landmark.\n\nThe Historic Preservation commission has already recommended the house be given the designation, which would prevent anyone from altering the exterior of the home without prior permission from the commission.\n\n\"Everybody keeps saying to us 'You know you can't make changes to the house' and we say 'That's the point,'\" Abenilla-Brown, 51, said. \"We want it to say how it is. Why would we want it to change?\"\n\nThe house, a bungalow-style structure with original glass in the windows, oil lamp sconces and a special shelf where the residents of yore would have stored their wall-mounted crank phone.\n\nThe house was inventoried in 1986 and included in the West Side Historic District, which is on the national register of historic places. The home is also listed in the Colorado HIstorical Society Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation, but Abenilla-Brown said those distinctions don't adequately protect the home in the future.\n\n\"I don't want to see someone buy the house and tear it down and put up some piece of pre-fab garbage, not that all pre-fab homes are garbage,\" Abenilla-Brown said.\n\nWater and sewer rates\n\nDuring Tuesday's meeting, the city council will also consider a rise in water on a first reading.\n\nOn Dec. 9, city staff presented to the council on what Public Works and Natural Resources Manager Dale Rademacher said was a need to raise water rates to keep up with rising costs of providing water to the city.\n\nAfter some debate on alternative rate structures, council chose to collapse the existing rate structure from five tiers of use to four, which many of the council members said they considered easier to navigate.\n\nThe ordinance before the council on Tuesday increases water rate by an average of 9 percent every year from 2015 to 2019.\n\nWhile water rates are proposed to rise in March, sewer rates rose in January under an ordinance passed in 2012. Due to the completion of the Windy Gap debt payment and retiring utility infrastructure, system development fees for water and sewer are going down overall also.\n\nAlcohol attorney\n\nThe council will also consider whether to allow Mayor Dennis Coombs to sign a contract for special counsel with attorneys Lyons Gaddis Kahn Hall Jeffers Dworak & Grant P.C., who have specialization in boozy legal matters.\n\nCity staff are recommending acquiring the special counsel because City Manager Harold Dominguez must apply for an arts liquor license on behalf of the Longmont Museum.\n\nMuseum staff has identified selling beer, wine, liquor or champagne during special events in the yet-to-be-completed Stewart Auditorium as something the community expects from a museum and the museum hopes to reap a profit from the venture.\n\nThe law firm began in Longmont and still has an office based here on Kimbark Street as well as an office in Louisville. The contract states that the price for Adele L. Reester as primary counsel is $235 an hour, while the prices for associate attorneys and paralegals range from $65 an hour to $270 an hour. The city will not pay for routine mileage and the city can terminate the agreement at any time with reasonable written notice.\n\nKaren Antonacci: 303-684-5226, antonaccik@times-call.com or twitter.com/ktonacci", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27300391/historical-house-rising-water-rates-attorney-alcohol-be", "modificationDate": "2015-01-12T20:05:42-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0111/20150111__12TCAMTGw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Karen Antonacci \n \n  Times-Call staff writer", "description": "The house at 1241 3rd Ave. is old and the owners want the city to say so.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27300391:view"}, "startDate": "2015-01-11T16:28:31-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27300391/historical-house-rising-water-rates-attorney-alcohol-be", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0111/20150111__12TCAMTGw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The house at 1241 3rd Ave. is old and the owners want the city to say so.", "title": "Historical house, rising water rates, attorney for alcohol to be discussed at Longmont meeting"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "The house at 1241 3rd Ave. is old and the owners want the city to say so.", "title": "Historical house, rising water rates, attorney for alcohol to be discussed at Longmont meeting", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27300391/historical-house-rising-water-rates-attorney-alcohol-be", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0111/20150111__12TCAMTGw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-11T16:28:31-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-01-11T14:39:17-0700", "sailthru.title": "Historical house, rising water rates, attorney for alcohol to be discussed at Longmont meeting", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Karen AntonacciTimes-Call", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0111/20150111__12TCAMTGw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-01-11T16:31:02-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "article_summary": "While water rates are proposed to rise in March, sewer rates rose in January under an ordinance passed in 2012.\nWater and sewer ratesDuring Tuesday's meeting, the city council will also consider a rise in water on a first reading.\n(Editor's note: Two fact errors related to water and sewer rates were corrected in this story.\nThe original story stated water and sewer rates were proposed to rise.)\nThe ordinance before the council on Tuesday increases water rate by an average of 9 percent every year from 2015 to 2019."}
