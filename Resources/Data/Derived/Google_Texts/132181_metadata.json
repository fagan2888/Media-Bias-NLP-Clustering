The New York Times reporter \"plays the contrarian\" by spinning a story about how Obamacare wasn't really determinative in the race, claiming that it's only a base-energizing issue. Host Joe Scarborough quickly knocks that analysis down, predicting that Obamacare will deliver punishing blows to Democrats in back-to-back midterm cycles:\n\nBarack Obama and his Democratic Party are facing difficult political headwinds less than eight months before November\u2019s midterm elections, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Obama\u2019s job-approval rating has dropped to a low point of 41 percent, never a good position for the party controlling the White House; By a 33 percent to 24 percent margin, Americans say their vote will be to signal opposition to the president rather than to signal support, though 41 percent say their vote will have nothing to do about Obama; Forty-eight percent of voters say they\u2019re less likely to vote for a candidate who\u2019s a solid supporter of the Obama administration, versus 26 percent who say they\u2019re more likely to vote for that candidate; And Republicans hold a one-point edge over Democrats on which party registered voters prefer to control Congress, 44 percent to 43 percent. While that\u2019s within the poll\u2019s margin of error, Republicans have traditionally fared well in elections when they\u2019ve held a slight lead on this question.\n\nThe right/wrong direction was at 41/53 just before the 2012 election, which Obama barely won; it\u2019s now 26/65. The approval rating for Obama is worse now than it was when HHS laid an egg last October with ObamaCare. Obama\u2019s approval on the economy slightly improved from December\u2019s all-time low in this series of 39/58, but the 41/56 rating now is (a) a margin-of-error change, and (b) the second-worst of the series. His ratings on foreign policy have now dropped to an all-time low as well of 41/53, although it was 41/49 last August, during the Syrian \u201cred line\u201d debacle. This may be a better indicator of Obama\u2019s fall from polling grace, too, since foreign policy had been a strong suit in his polling. August 2013's poll was the first time in his presidency that those ratings had gone negative....The problem for Obama and Democrats in this poll is that his personal likeability no longer keeps his overall numbers afloat. The \u201cpersonal feelings\u201d rating for Obama is now 41/44, with 15% neutral, in this poll.\n\nTodd notes a data point that he says is the \"best news\" for Democrats:\n\n\n\n\n\nBest health care news for Dems in #nbcwsjpoll. A Dem candidate who favors FIXING law tops a GOP cand who favors repeal, 48-47. #nbcwsjpoll \u2014 Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) March 12, 2014\n\nThree problems with that argument: First, this question essentially produces a tie. Democrats have claimed the repeal crowd is a relatively small minority. Second, some of the biggest Obamacare \"fixes\" (and they're just that -- big -- not tweaks) that Americans want would destroy the underpinnings of the entire law. Third, Democrats just test drove the \"fix it\" message in Florida. And lost. It's a long way to November. There should be no counting of chickens on the Right. But the momentum and political winds are hard to ignore.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tea leaves..05/26/2016 18:06:47PM EST.", "author": "Guy Benson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Tea leaves.", "title": "Guy Benson - Following Florida Loss, NBC/WSJ Poll Piles More Bad News on Democrats", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/03/12/nbcwsj-poll-bad-news-for-dems-fl13-tea-leaves-n1807724", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/65/7c02d74f-5cdb-401c-95cf-d0c3a83b3156.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Tea leaves.", "title": "Guy Benson - Following Florida Loss, NBC/WSJ Poll Piles More Bad News on Democrats", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/03/12/nbcwsj-poll-bad-news-for-dems-fl13-tea-leaves-n1807724", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/65/7c02d74f-5cdb-401c-95cf-d0c3a83b3156.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Following Florida Loss, NBC/WSJ Poll Piles More Bad News on Democrats, Guy Benson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Before we get to the poll, let's check in on MSNBC's Morning Joe as the gang grapples with last night's seismic event in Florida.\nThe approval rating for Obama is worse now than it was when HHS laid an egg last October with ObamaCare.\nThe \u201cpersonal feelings\u201d rating for Obama is now 41/44, with 15% neutral, in this poll.\nAugust 2013's poll was the first time in his presidency that those ratings had gone negative....The problem for Obama and Democrats in this poll is that his personal likeability no longer keeps his overall numbers afloat.\nThe right/wrong direction was at 41/53 just before the 2012 election, which Obama barely won; it\u2019s now 26/65."}
