On the contrary, at the start of the play, Richard is celebrating an upturn in his family\u2019s fortunes.\n\n\u201cNow is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer in the deep bosom of the ocean buried,\u201d he says.\n\nSo, he\u2019s saying this is the winter of our discontent, as in, this is \u201cthe end of our discontent.\u201d It\u2019s been buried deep in the ocean, \u201ctransformed into glorious summer.\u201d\n\nOf course, things didn\u2019t work out so well for old Richard. But it\u2019s still a beautiful and hopeful image.\n\nSo my point is: if we think about how Shakespeare employed the phrase, we can use it to express hope and optimism.\n\nYes, it\u2019s still cold and miserable and more snow is coming. But it\u2019s mid-February.\n\nDaylight savings begins in just three weeks. And then, spring, baseball, the sweet smell of grass are not far behind.\n\nSo I\u2019m hoping this really is \u2018the winter of our discontent.\u2019 If we think of what those words meant to Shakespeare, it should make us all feel a little better and hopeful.\n\nWe can thank the bard for reminding us that this too shall pass.\u201d\n\n\u2013Anthony Brooks\n\nOther stories from this show:", "article_metadata": {"description": "An essay by Anthony Brooks to help get us through these cold, dark, snowy days.", "og": {"site_name": "radioboston", "description": "An essay by Anthony Brooks to help get us through these cold, dark, snowy days.", "title": "Finding Hope In \u2018The Winter Of Our Discontent\u2019", "url": "http://radioboston.wbur.org/2015/02/18/winter-discontent", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/9/files/2015/02/0218_winter-discontent-624x404.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://radioboston.wbur.org/2015/02/18/winter-discontent", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/9/files/2015/02/0218_winter-discontent-624x404.jpg", "site": "@RadioBoston", "card": "summary", "title": "Finding Hope In 'The Winter Of Our Discontent'"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-02-18", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "keywords": "radioboston wbur boston metro local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3a3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI want to say this about our collective frustration and stress \u2014 and about \u2018the winter of our discontent\u2019 \u2014 a phrase coined by William Shakespeare.\n\u201cNow is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer in the deep bosom of the ocean buried,\u201d he says.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Shakespeare meant something very different when he wrote it.\nThe phrase comes from Richard the III \u2014 and it\u2019s not a reference to a cold unhappy winter season.\nSo my point is: if we think about how Shakespeare employed the phrase, we can use it to express hope and optimism."}
