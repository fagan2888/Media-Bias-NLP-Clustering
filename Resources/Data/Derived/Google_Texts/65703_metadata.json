Because on March 3, Mitchell Research & Communications released a poll that actually asked Republican voters more about their religious identity than whether they\u2019re evangelicals. Conducted for Fox News in Detroit the day after Super Tuesday, it found that Donald Trump was supported by 52 percent of Catholic Republicans in the state, as compared to 42 percent overall.\n\nTed Cruz, at 19 percent, had the support of only 11 percent of Catholics. Marco Rubio, himself a Catholic, fared only marginally better among his co-religionists: 16 percent versus 15 percent. Catholics chose John Kasich at the same rate as everyone else \u2014 14 percent. Ben Carson, then still in the race, was at 5 percent overall, 2 percent among Catholics.\n\nMichigan Catholics are concentrated in the southeastern part of the state where deindustrialization has taken away so many good blue-collar jobs. This is the white population that gave votes to Wallace in 1968 1972 and became Reagan Democrats in the eighties. Trump promises to bring the jobs back, which is enough to trump anything Pope Francis says about immigration.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s GOP primary, Catholics will be one-third of the vote and Protestants one-half. The Mitchell poll shows the latter more closely divided, with 33 percent for Trump, 25 for Cruz, 14 for Rubio, 13 for Kasich, and 8 for Carson. Evangelicals alone \u2014 36 percent of the vote \u2014 put Cruz ahead of Trump by a nose, 31 percent to 30 percent. That tells us that non-evangelicals, i.e. Mainliners, have very little use for Cruz.\n\nSo what will happen on Tuesday?\n\nCompared to Mitchell\u2019s mid-February poll, Trump and Carson have held steady while the three other candidates all gained a few points (from the departed Jeb Bush and \u201cUndecided\u201d). In the meantime, the latest Michigan poll from ARG \u2014 taken on Friday and Saturday \u2014 shows a leap for Kasich from 17 percent three weeks ago to 33 percent, putting him out in front of Trump, who dropped from 35 percent to 31 percent. ARG has Cruz gaining a few points to 15 percent, Rubio and Carson sliding to 11 percent and six percent respectively.\n\nIf ARG is right \u2014 and Saturday\u2019s primary and caucus results suggest that it is \u2014 the post-Super Tuesday attacks on Trump are finding their mark. Then, on Tuesday, Cruz will pick up most of the now departed Carson\u2019s evangelicals, Trump will hold his his Catholic base, Rubio will continue to fade, and the governor from next door will get a flood of Protestants. That would leave Trump and Kasich fighting it out for first place in the mid-thirties, Cruz finishing in the low 20s, and Rubio falling into the single digits.\n\nUpdate: A new Mitchell/Fox 2 Detroit poll, taken yesterday, shows Trump comfortably back on top, Kasich falling into a tie for second place with Cruz, and Rubio no longer in double digits. Adding to Trump\u2019s robust Catholic support is improved standing with Protestants \u2014 including evangelicals. The big Kasich bump in the earlier poll may prove to have been an anomaly.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Opinion, Politics, Catholic, Republican presidential race", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "But will it be enough?", "title": "Catholic vote key for Trump in Michigan", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2016/03/06/catholic-michigan-republican-trump/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Michigan.svg_.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@directorsilk"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/03/06/catholic-michigan-republican-trump/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/03/06/catholic-michigan-republican-trump/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "But will it be enough?"}, "article_summary": "Evangelicals alone \u2014 36 percent of the vote \u2014 put Cruz ahead of Trump by a nose, 31 percent to 30 percent.\nCompared to Mitchell\u2019s mid-February poll, Trump and Carson have held steady while the three other candidates all gained a few points (from the departed Jeb Bush and \u201cUndecided\u201d).\nTrump promises to bring the jobs back, which is enough to trump anything Pope Francis says about immigration.\nMarco Rubio, himself a Catholic, fared only marginally better among his co-religionists: 16 percent versus 15 percent.\nMichigan Catholics are concentrated in the southeastern part of the state where deindustrialization has taken away so many good blue-collar jobs."}
