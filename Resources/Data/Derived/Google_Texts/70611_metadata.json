Prego, which means \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d in Italian, is a red tomato sauce often used for pasta, chicken parmesan, or other classic Italian dinners, according to Campbell's Kitchen.\n\nThe FDA report states that the Prego sauces were manufactured on Dec. 15, 2013, and have an expiration, or \u201cBest By\u201d date of June 16, 2015. They were made in Paris, Texas, and shipped to several distribution centers in Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. The products in question also have a four-digit, military time code ranging between \u201cCT BJ ZV 0330\u201d through \u201cCT BJ ZV 0449.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsumers who have purchased the product should not eat it,\u201d the FDA report states. Though no reported cases of illness have surfaced, the FDA urges consumers to \u201creturn the product to the store where the product was purchased for a full refund.\u201d\n\nThe Campbell Prego incident appears to be one of the first food recalls of 2014. Wal-Mart also announced today that they would recall \u201cFive Spice\u201d donkey meat sold in locations in China, due to the fact that DNA from other animals \u2014 including foxes \u2014 was found in it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "prego recall 2014, campbell soup, italian tomato sauce, spaghetti, spoilage", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FDA issued a report urging consumers to not eat Campbell's Prego Italian sauce after the company discovered several spoiled jars during a routine inspection.", "title": "Campbell Recalls Prego Traditional Italian Sauce Due To Spoilage Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/prego-recall-2014-campbell-soup-company-recalls-tomato-sauce-due-risk-spoilage-266181", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/02/spaghetti.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA issued a report urging consumers to not eat Campbell's Prego Italian sauce after the company discovered several spoiled jars during a routine inspection.", "title": "Campbell Recalls Prego Traditional Italian Sauce Due To Spoilage Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/prego-recall-2014-campbell-soup-company-recalls-tomato-sauce-due-risk-spoilage-266181", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/02/spaghetti.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/02/spaghetti.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-01-02T15:25:24-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-02T16:56:58-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FDA issued a report urging consumers to not eat Campbell's Prego Italian sauce after the company discovered several spoiled jars during a routine inspection."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde700\"", "article_summary": "Campbell Soup Company's product Prego, a tomato sauce that can be used on spaghetti, has been recalled due to the risk of spoilage.\nPrego, which means \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d in Italian, is a red tomato sauce often used for pasta, chicken parmesan, or other classic Italian dinners, according to Campbell's Kitchen.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced Tuesday that Campbell Soup Co., well-known for its canned and microwavable soups, has voluntarily recalled some 300 cases of Prego Traditional Italian sauce due to the risk of them being spoiled.\nThe food manufacturing company had reportedly been doing a routine inspection of its products when it discovered that the sauce inside several of the 24-ounce jars was spoiled.\nThey were made in Paris, Texas, and shipped to several distribution centers in Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Oklahoma."}
