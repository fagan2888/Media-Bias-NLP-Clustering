(WPRI) \u2014 The Affordable Care Act may change the way you file your federal income tax return this year.\n\nThere are new information forms that can help you complete your tax return, which you should\u2019ve received last month if you purchased your health insurance through HealthSource RI.\n\n\u201cThis year, everybody is getting a tax document called a 1095,\u201d said Linda Katz of the Economic Progress Institute.\n\nThe 1095 is basically a proof of health insurance, and there are three versions of the form: A, B, and C.\n\nThe A form is for people who have purchased health insurance through a marketplace such as HealthSource RI. The B form is for people who have insurance through a small business or public insurance such as Medicare or Medicaid, while the C form is for employer-provided health insurance.\n\nAccording to Katz, people who received the 1095 B or C \u201cjust need to read it, see if it\u2019s accurate, and file it with their records. They don\u2019t have to bring it when they file their taxes.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll use the information on that form to complete another form, and you may get money back or owe money. It\u2019s all based on the advance tax credit payments that were estimated for 2015.\n\n\u201cIf your income turned out to be higher than you anticipated, then you got too much credit and you have to pay back a little bit,\u201d added Katz. \u201cIf your income turned out to be lower, you got too little in the tax credit and you can wind up getting more money back from the government to help pay for health insurance.\u201d\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have health insurance and you weren\u2019t exempt from coverage, you\u2019ll be facing a tax penalty. If you still don\u2019t have coverage this year, you could be facing a more expensive tax penalty next season.\n\n\u201cThe important takeaway is if you\u2019re uninsured this year in 2016, check through HealthSource RI, apply to see if you\u2019re eligible, either through Medicaid or a special enrollment period,\u201d said Katz.\n\nIf you\u2019re expecting a 1095 B or C form, you may not have received it yet, but you can still file your taxes.\n\nFor more information about the 1095 A form, contact HealthSource RI or RIReach, Rhode Island\u2019s health insurance consumer support line.\n\nHealthSource RI\n\nBy phone: 1-855-840-4774\n\nVisit the HealthSource RI website\n\nRIREach\n\nBy phone: 1-855-747-3224\n\nVisit the RIReach website", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 1095 is basically a proof of health insurance, and there are three versions of the form: A, B, and C.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488539287", "og": {"site_name": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News", "description": "The 1095 is basically a proof of health insurance, and there are three versions of the form: A, B, and C.", "title": "Health care form may change how you file your taxes", "url": "http://wpri.com/2016/03/01/new-healthcare-form-may-change-how-you-file-your-taxes/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "https://lintvwpri.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/contentidb04d4a8bf33c0e016b0f6a706700022ffmtjpgrolepreviewreldt2015-01-12t223647mediaphotorecordid5371500637974bd9a2a079c553d914e8cloudfrontavailablefalseakamaiavailabletrueitemid4a-e1421353597161.jpg", "height": 316}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "WPRI.com", "description": "The 1095 is basically a proof of health insurance, and there are three versions of the form: A, B, and C.", "title": "Health care form may change how you file your taxes", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwpri.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/contentidb04d4a8bf33c0e016b0f6a706700022ffmtjpgrolepreviewreldt2015-01-12t223647mediaphotorecordid5371500637974bd9a2a079c553d914e8cloudfrontavailablefalseakamaiavailabletrueitemid4a-e1421353597161.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wpri12", "site": "wpri12", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Call 12 for Action, Local News, Money, News, Top Video  Consumer Investigator Susan Campbell WPRI 12 Eyewitness News", "msapplication-tooltip": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News | WPRI.com: Rhode Island news, weather, information", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wpri", "fb": {"pages": 20074438201}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wpri.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1b04de707c0e872b43e051b6f92f59c6?s=16", "application-name": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WPRI12", "published_time": "2016-03-01T23:33:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-04T15:39:55+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "UWpZtk5XlRP8hEHWWrNPNVI8BulxVr0d1aFCNQQIY9U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": ",Call 12 for Action, Local News, Money, News, Top Video"}, "article_summary": "For more information about the 1095 A form, contact HealthSource RI or RIReach, Rhode Island\u2019s health insurance consumer support line.\nThe B form is for people who have insurance through a small business or public insurance such as Medicare or Medicaid, while the C form is for employer-provided health insurance.\nIf you\u2019re expecting a 1095 B or C form, you may not have received it yet, but you can still file your taxes.\nThe 1095 is basically a proof of health insurance, and there are three versions of the form: A, B, and C.The A form is for people who have purchased health insurance through a marketplace such as HealthSource RI.\n(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)PROVIDENCE, R.I.
