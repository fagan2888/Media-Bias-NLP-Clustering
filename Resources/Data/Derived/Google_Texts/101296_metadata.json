Sharpton\u2019s arrival comes just two days after Obama embraced the controversial activist and former FBI informant at a New York event hosted by the liberal broadcaster. Obama used the Sharpton event to accuse Republicans of trying to reverse the 1965 Voting Rights Act and intentionally suppress black voters with state laws requiring voters to show identification. \u201cThe real voter fraud is those that try to deny our rights by making arguments about voter fraud.\u201d Obama compared the ID laws to the Jim Crow restrictions of the segregated South and cast himself as a modern-day civil rights leader. It may not wash with most voters, but will it be enough to frighten the Democratic base into action?\n\n[WSJ: \u201c[A blueprint first sketched out by a Yale University law student four years ago], which seized on a mostly ignored provision of the 1965 [Voting Rights] law, has become the government's strategy for challenging states it believes are enacting discriminatory voting laws, including North Carolina and Texas.\u201d]\n\nIt worked before - While liberals may be enthused that the president is back to attacking Republicans on matters of race, it\u2019s not a risk-free path. The administration discovered the dangers of ham-handed outreach last week with a botched effort to alarm the single, female voters on whom Democrats rely. After getting pasted over their pay-equity gambit, though, the Obama Democrats are showing no reticence about applying blunt political force to sensitive topics, this time on race. But as campaign watchers learned in 2012, audacious negativity is not something of which Team Obama is afraid. In fact, the forecast for the coming election is increasingly negative and hostile. Remember, whatever was said about Obama\u2019s unprecedentedly negative re-election campaign, it certainly worked.\n\nTop house Dem: GOP animated by racism - Fox News: New York Rep. Steve Israel said Sunday a significant part of the Republican Party is \u2018animated by racism,\u2019 marking the third time in recent days that a leading Democrat has appeared to make race an issue and drawn a sharp response from Republicans\u2026 Israel made his comments after Attorney General Eric Holder testified Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, then suggested the next day at a forum on civil rights that the past five years in Washington have been marked by \u2018unprecedented, unwarranted, ugly and divisive adversity.\u2019\u201d\n\n[\u201cThis strikes me as kinda crybaby stuff from Holder. My sense about this is both Eric Holder and Barack Obama have benefited politically enormously from the fact that they are African American and the first to hold the jobs that they hold.\u201d \u2013Brit Hume on \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace\u201d]\n\nNo Obama generation in politics - NYT: \u201cUnlike John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, who inspired virtual legislatures of politicians and became generational touchstones... [President Obama] has so far had little such influence. That is all the more remarkable considering he came to office tapping into spirit of volunteerism and community service that pollsters say is widespread and intense among young people. Mr. Obama has come to represent that spirit, but he has failed, pollsters say, to transform it into meaningful engagement in the political process. \u2018If you were to call it an Obama generation, there was a window,\u2019 said John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University. \u2018That opportunity has been lost.\u2019 He said the youth who came of voting age around the time of the 2008 election have since lost interest in electoral politics, and pointed to a survey he conducted last year among 18- to 29-year-olds. Although 70 percent said they considered community service an honorable endeavor, only 35 percent said the same about running for office.\u201d\n\nDOCTORS DESPAIR AT OBAMACARE\n\nThe Daily Beast: \u201cUnfortunately, things are only getting worse for most doctors, especially those who still accept health insurance. Just processing the insurance forms costs $58 dollars for every patient encounter, according to Dr. Stephen Schimpff, an internist and former CEO of University of Maryland Medical Center who is writing a book about the crisis in primary care. \u2026 What worries many doctors, however, is that the Affordable Care Act has codified this broken system into law. While forcing everyone to buy health insurance, [ObamaCare] might have mandated a uniform or streamlined claims procedure that would have gone a long way to improving access to care\u2026 Industry leaders are fixated on patient satisfaction, despite the fact that high scores are correlated with worse outcomes and higher costs. Indeed, trying to please whatever patient comes along destroys the integrity of our work. It\u2019s a fact that doctors acquiesce to patient demands\u2014for narcotics, x-rays, doctor\u2019s notes\u2014despite what survey advocates claim. And now that Medicare payments will be tied to patient satisfaction\u2014this problem will get worse. Doctors need to have the ability to say no. If not, when patients go to see the doctor, they won\u2019t actually have a physician\u2014they\u2019ll have a hostage.\u201d\n\nOBAMACARE STRAINS TAX ENFORCEMENT\n\nHere\u2019s one thing that might improve ObamaCare\u2019s popularity - AP: \u201cAs millions of Americans race to meet Tuesday\u2019s tax deadline, their chances of getting audited are lower than they have been in years. Budget cuts and new responsibilities are straining the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s ability to police tax returns. This year, the IRS will have fewer agents auditing returns than at any time since at least the 1980s. Taxpayer services are suffering, too, with millions of phone calls to the IRS going unanswered...Last year, the IRS audited less than 1 percent of all returns from individuals, the lowest rate since 2005\u2026The IRS also is implementing large parts of President Obama\u2019s health law, including enforcing the mandate that most people get health insurance.\u201d\n\nWAIT. WHAT?\n\n\"Clearly, the estimate that [the ObamaCare Web site] was ready to go Oct. 1 was just flat-out wrong.\u201d \u2013 Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in an interview with NBC News.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d \u2013 Sebelius in the same interview when asked if she had \u201cany regrets\u201d about her tenure.\n\nMy dear friend, whatshername - Breitbart: \u201c\u2026Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius misspelled the name of her successor, Sylvia Burwell, in her final goodbye email to her HHS coworkers\u2026 \u2018As you\u2019ve no doubt heard by now, in the coming months I will be passing the baton to my friend and colleague, Sylvia Burrell [sic]...I've worked closely with Sylvia in her role as director of OMB\u2026\u201d\n\n[\u201cThere's no doubt that she was a good choice for OMB. That does not necessarily make her a good choice for HHS.\u201d \u2013 Sen. Tim Scott, R-SC, on \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace\u201d expressing reservations about voting to confirm Sylvia Burwell as the next Health secretary.]\n\nNEVADA RANCH STANDOFF STILL SIMMERS AFTER FEDS BACK DOWN\n\nKVVU: \u201c[The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s] decision to \u2018conclude\u2019 the herding operation by Neil Kornze, the agency's director, was made after a week of protests at the Bunkerville ranch of Cliven Bundy. BLM said Bundy has refused to pay grazing fees for more than a decade, but Bundy has maintained that his family was using the land long before the BLM arrived.\u201d\n\nWatch Fox \u2013 Fox News Correspondent William LaJeunesse has the latest developments on the standoff.\n\nReid a no-show, so far - Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has remained silent since the Feds fell back. But he may not be able to stay silent forever. Liberal group Americans Against the Tea Party claimed Reid \u201cprobably didn\u2019t want his name attached to the biggest civilian massacre in US history right before election season. The fact that they were and are classifiable as terrorists, and the fact that Bundy\u2019s new kingdom is federal property, seems to have lost out to the power of election season.\u201d\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nDavid Grimm asks \u201cHow Smart is that Doggie in the Window?\u201d for Time magazine: \u201cCanines, in some ways, are even smarter than we are. We used them as tools for thousands of years \u2014 as hunters, guardians, and herders \u2014 but now they use us. When they\u2019re bored, we provide toys... And when they can\u2019t figure out a problem, they look to us for information. We\u2019ve become the Internet for dogs\u2026Every species has evolved the skills it needs to survive\u2026 The reason dogs seem so smart is because they\u2019ve evolved to live in our world, to tackle the same social and cognitive problems we have. So, in many ways, when we peer into the mind of a dog, we\u2019re really peering into our own.\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Boeing, she said, \u2018has just agreed to double its contribution to $2 million.\u2019 Clinton did not point out that, to secure the donation, the State Department had set aside ethics guidelines that first prohibited solicitations of Boeing and then later permitted only a $1 million gift from the company\u2026 The November 2009 episode was an indicator of a mutually beneficial relationship between one of the world\u2019s major corporations and a potential future president. Clinton functioned as a powerful ally for Boeing\u2019s business interests at home and abroad, while Boeing has invested resources in causes beneficial to Clinton\u2019s public and political image\u2026 In 2010, two months after Boeing won its $3.7 billion Russia deal, the company announced a $900,000 contribution to the William J. Clinton Foundation intended to rebuild schools in earthquake-ravaged Haiti... The company\u2019s ties came into play again this month when its in-house lobbyist, former Bill Clinton aide Tim Keating, co-hosted a fundraiser for Ready for Hillary, the super PAC backing her potential presidential run. The Boeing relationship meshed well with efforts by Clinton to expand the State Department\u2019s advocacy of U.S. economic interests abroad, part of a broader philosophy that has emphasized partnering government with businesses to solve problems. A potential side benefit for Clinton has been the chance to strengthen ties to the kind of powerful allies in the business community who could assist a possible presidential bid...\u201d\n\n[Hugh Hewitt explains why Hillary Clinton is President Obama's George H.W. Bush. \u201cBush the Elder won easily in 1988, with 40 states and 426 electoral votes. The third term, but calmer, is a good pitch. To stop a sequel the GOP will have to avoid their Dukakis, the man who seemed different, but who wasn't, in the end, anything except a decent but dull pol from a base state. The GOP will need a nominee with both fire in the belly and brains in abundance; rhetorical ability and an understanding of the world as it is, not as we would wish it to be.\u201d]\n\nMeet the Clintons\u2019 diet guru - NYT profiles the diet doctor who helps the Clintons get back into fighting trim for the campaign trail. \u201cNine years ago, on their 30th wedding anniversary, Hillary Rodham Clinton gave her husband a gift she hoped would ensure many more years together: Dr. Mark Hyman. Dr. Hyman was charged with helping the former president after a 2004 quadruple bypass surgery. In the time since, the doctor has become part of the Clintons\u2019 circle of friends and advisers, but one with an important difference. The Clintons, after all, have a small army of aides who offer political and policy advice, but not many who can tell a former and potential president to lay off the ranch dressing\u2026As she contemplates another run for the presidency, few topics receive more scrutiny than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health. And as with most female candidates, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s personal appearance often emerges as a topic of conversation.\u201d\n\nPAUL KNOCKS JEB ON ILLEGALS\u2019 \u2018ACT OF LOVE\u2019\n\nFox News Latino: \u201cSen. Rand Paul, [R-Ky.] a potential 2016 presidential contender, took aim at another possible Oval Office candidate \u2013 Jeb Bush \u2013 over the former Florida governor\u2019s recent comments defending undocumented immigrants. In an interview on ABC\u2019s \u2018This Week\u2019 that aired Sunday, Paul said that Bush was inarticulate when he described immigrants who come to the United States illegally as committing an \u2018act of love.\u2019 Paul said that those immigrants \u2018are not bad people\u2019 but added the United States \u2018can't invite the whole world\u2019 inside its borders. Paul\u2026says Bush should have kept his focus on controlling the U.S. borders. Bush says the GOP cannot demonize immigrants and should show compassion. He described illegal immigration as an \u2018act of love\u2019 by people trying to provide for their families.\u201d\n\n[Reuters breaks down the dynamics for the GOP field in the first in the nation primary state.]\n\nPaul backs off Cheney criticism - Paul also walked back his pre-Senate swipe at former Vice President Dick Cheney. Paul had suggested Cheney\u2019s enthusiasm for the invasion of Iraq may have been motivated by seeking profits for his former employer, Halliburton \u201cI don\u2019t think Dick Cheney did it out of a malevolence. I think he loves his country as much as I love this country.\u201d\n\nPALIN PRAISES HANDEL\u2019S CONSERVATIVE CRED IN AD\n\nGeorgia Republican Senate hopeful Karen Handel\u2019s first television ad hits airwaves today with a spot featuring former Gov. Sarah Palin, R-Alaska. In the ad, Palin touts Handel\u2019s conservative bona fides, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be surprised when Karen comes though, doing the things she says she will do.\u201d Handel is vying for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., in a May 20 primary.\n\nPICK SIX\n\nRepublicans are hoping to pick up an additional six seats to gain control of the Senate this November.

Rodney Davis, R-Ill. Davis won his seat by just over 1,000 votes in 2012 in a state President Obama won handily. The race says a lot about the political atmosphere for other races in the president\u2019s home state and around the country. Watch here.\n\n[Ed. note: It seems fitting to share this on the 149th anniversary of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Davis\u2019s district includes many Lincoln historical sites in and around Springfield, including Lincoln\u2019s Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery.]\n\n\n\nREPUBLICANS BROADENING MINORITY BASE\n\nFox News: \u201cA group of Asian Americans is starting a grassroots effort to garner support for the Republican Party and its candidates, saying the GOP most closely aligns with their core values including family, education and entrepreneurship. The group, the Asian Republican Coalition, is co-founded by international investment banker John Ying, who during the 2012 presidential election cycle served on the Republican National Finance Committee\u2026 over the past three presidential election cycles, Asians have increasingly voted Democrat:\u2026\u201d\n\nFor the ladies - The Republican National Committee is upping its efforts to attract women. RNC Co-Chairwoman Sharon Day and Rep. Shelly Moore Capito, R-WV, launch a new GOP strategy, \u201c14 in \u201914,\u201d today to recruit women under the age of 40 to spread the conservative message in the final 14 weeks before the November elections.\n\nGREEN GROUPS TEAM UP FOR CAMPAIGN SPENDING\n\nWaPo: \u201cTwo major environmental groups will announce Monday that they are creating an alliance between their two political action arms, in an effort to expand their influence on national policymakers. The League of Conservation Voters and the National Resources Defense Council Action Fund are starting LeadingGreen, a collaboration that will steer donations to federal candidates and enlist the help of major donors in lobbying elected officials.\u201d\n\nPOLITBURO CHIC\n\nThe Week: \u201cWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney and his family are featured in a worshipful profile in this month's Washingtonian magazine. It\u2019s the sort of adoring journalistic exercise reserved for only the most handsome of the power elite\u2026 But keen observers may notice the kitchen decor in the photo: Soviet propaganda posters. They really are the perfect pop of color whether you are the dour and sincere Nikita Khrushchev or the cheeky press-wrangler for a president who is constantly accused of being a socialist himself.\u201d\n\n[Daily Mail: \u201cThe photograph shows Carney and Shipman standing in front of a briefing podium, miming the routine of a press conference by taking questions from their enthusiastic children. The bookshelf is situated behind them. A dozen or more cut-and-paste operations later, 12-year-old Hugo Carney's left pinky finger wound up halfway across the room, left behind when a book jacket was cloned.\u201d]\n\nMATZOH LUCK AT THE CHECKPOINT\n\nWith the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Passover at sundown tonight, observant Jews are racing the clock to be with their families for start of the High Holiday. But those flying to get there they needn\u2019t worry about cracked crackers. The Transportation Security Agency says it is \u201caware\u201d that matzoh, the un-leavened, and frankly bland, \u201cbread of haste\u201d is fragile. If you\u2019re Seder-bound, you can take solace from this TSA Travel Advisory: \u201cSome travelers will be carrying boxes of matzoh, which are consumed as part of the Passover ritual. Matzoh can be machine or handmade and are typically very thin and fragile, and break easily. Passengers traveling with religious items, including handmade matzoh, may request a hand inspection by the TSO of the items at the security checkpoint.\u201d Just don\u2019t try telling them that your extra carry-on bag is for Elijah, the unseen prophet.\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
