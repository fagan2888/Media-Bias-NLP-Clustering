It also urges countries to make midwifery care a priority in their health budgets and to provide midwives with better education tools.\n\nThe report analyzes the status of midwifery in 73 countries\u2014all either low- or middle-income--that account for 92 percent of the world's maternal and new born deaths. Often, midwives lack such basic supplies as first aid kits and blood for transfusions that can help reduce the risk of maternal and newborn deaths.\n\nAuthors find only 42 percent of the medical, midwifery and nursing personnel who are available in these countries are being tapped.\n\nInvesting in midwifery benefits the health care system by allowing doctors and nurses to tend to other health needs, finds the report, which was coordinated by the United Nations Population Fund, the International Confederation of Midwives and the World Health Organization.\n\nCall for Universal Access\n\nMidwifery2030 , a policy initiative that accompanies the report, calls for all women of reproductive age to have universal access to midwife services. calls for all women\n\nThese services range from preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV and treating sexually transmitted diseases to preventing pregnancy and providing abortions where they are legal, according to the report\u2019s definition of the field.\n\nOut of the 73 countries studied, 45 percent are attempting to retain their midwifery work force in rural areas while 28 percent are increasing recruitment and deployment of midwives. Only 20 percent of the countries have regulatory codes for their midwives.\n\nLow wages for midwifery are a key hurdle to expanding the available work force and recruiting new practitioners, authors find.\n\nThe lack of geographical data on the workforce and health facilities in these countries prevents health workers from understanding the accessibility of midwifery services. Although most of the countries surveyed in this report have policies to deliver sexual, reproductive, maternal and newborn health care, little is known about how well midwives are accepted by women and their communities.\n\nEven though countries have up-to-date curricula the report finds that there is still a lack of necessary infrastructure and resources. Lack of adequate funding prevents teaching institutions from purchasing quality equipment and hiring qualified teaching staff which ultimately impacts the quality of midwifery care.\n\nNicole Deniflee is an editorial intern at Women's eNews\n\nWould you like to Comment but not sure how?
