For an insurance plan, it looks at processes aimed at ensuring patient safety, closing gaps in care, and improving consumers\u2019 health and the health care they get. It also measures how well a plan controls costs, reduces waste, and whether it educates and encourages consumers to manage their own health well.\n\nThe five plans that have volunteered to be measured \u2014 and have their results displayed publicly \u2014 also provide details on how they measure performance of medical providers, and how they pay them.\n\nThe other plans, in order of how well they scored overall, were Cigna, followed by Aetna, United HealthCare, and Regence BlueShield. Both Group Health and Cigna improved significantly from last year\u2019s scores, overall.\n\nThe report said Group Health was only 2 percentage points below the best performance in the nation on \u201chelping members get/stay healthy;\u201d it was just slightly below the national best in \u201chelping members manage acute/episodic conditions and advanced care.\u201d\n\nRegence was the highest-scoring plan on giving members information on costs.\n\nMore than half of a plan\u2019s score depends on how well it supports its members in helping get healthy, be good consumers and manage their own health, including acute, episodic or chronic conditions.\n\n\u201cHealth plans have an important role to play in improving the quality and value of the health-care system, and understanding their performance \u2014 and where it can be improved \u2014 is also important,\u201d said Susie Dade, deputy director of the Washington Health Alliance. Participation in the Alliance evaluation educates consumers and employers about performance, and about the willingness of each plan to allow their own efforts to be measure against national standards and to share the results publicly, she added.\n\nPremera Blue Cross has declined to participate in the Alliance report since 2009. Melanie Coon, Premera spokeswoman, said the insurer supports the Alliance on \u201cnearly all\u201d its initiatives, and participates in many of its programs. But Premera prefers to put its energy and resources into other organizations that measure health-plan performance, she said.\n\n\u201cWe support transparency in health plan performance, and we demonstrate that by investing our resources in the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA)\u201d and the Consumer Assessment for Healthcare Providers and Systems, Coon said.\n\nThe Alliance report, she said, is redundant, and doesn\u2019t add value for Premera\u2019s customers, \u201ccompared to the additional administrative costs we would incur\u2026and pass on to our customers.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance report said most plans had \u201copportunities for improvement.\u201d Those include improving programs on tobacco cessation and obesity management, broader support for providers to manage chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, depression and substance abuse, and providing more information to members on costs.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "Group Health Cooperative was the overall top-scoring health plan among five graded by the Washington Health Alliance, a collaborative of employers and others working to improve health-care transparency through measurement.
