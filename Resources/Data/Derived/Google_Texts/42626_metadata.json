We need patients to stay in network,\u201d said Daniel Marino, senior vice president of The Camden Group.\n\nHis own doctor lost his business recently when he had the flu, Marino said. Having been told he had to wait two hours to see someone, Marino went to a local retail clinic and got speedy results.\n\n[Also: Live staff reports from the HFMA 2015 ANI]\n\nThe best method to attract and keep consumers is to build access to points of care throughout the organization, from a hospital\u2019s retail clinic to physician offices, primary care and medical specialists.\n\nProviders need to align physicians, hospitals, post-acute and ancillary providers with an organized system of clinical care, he said.\n\n\u201cThe successful ones that are out there are building systems of care,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology and analytics, connected with care will reduce redundancy and drive down cost.\u201d\n\nTo make up the difference in revenue as fewer people go to a hospital and reimbursement models change, providers must drive members into the organization.\n\n\u201cAccess becomes critical,\u201d Marino said. \u201cHospitals and physicians are starting to align. The next thing is to engage consumers. Link them into your network so they don\u2019t want to leave.\u201d\n\nThe best way to drive new membership is to collaborate product offerings with payers, he said.\n\n[Also: Nonprofits must adapt]\n\nIf you have a contract to take care of a population, you\u2019ll want to see that person who is currently not in the system, he said.\n\nPhysicians must lead the care coordination initiatives, according to William Faber of The Camden Group, by serving on the governing boards, setting the quality metrics and driving clinical protocols, he said.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t start thinking about providing value, our competition is going to get us,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nFaber compared the new healthcare world to a \u201cfast food culture\u201d in which patients want convenience and quality.\n\nHealthcare is among the last large sectors of the economy to get an integrated network, and to track its costs.\n\n\u201cHow much does it cost to take care of the diabetic patient?\u201d Faber said. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe up-front investment for clinical integration is $3 million to more than $20 million depending on infrastructure, according to the consultants.\n\nThe investment promotes greater access and care convenience to retain members, Marino said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just talk about clinical integration as you set it up, you have to talk about what\u2019s next around value-based contracting,\u201d Marino said. \u201cIf you do a better quality of care with a patient, you will reduce costs.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/control-costs-integrate-physicians-panel-says", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doctor%20with%20patient-feature.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The best method to attract and keep consumers is to build access to points of care throughout the organization, from a hospital's retail clinic to physician offices, primary care and medical specialists, experts at HFMA 2015 ANI say.", "title": "To control costs, integrate physicians, panel says"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doctor%20with%20patient-feature.png"}, "description": "The best method to attract and keep consumers is to build access to points of care throughout the organization, from a hospital's retail clinic to physician offices, primary care and medical specialists, experts at HFMA 2015 ANI say.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "To control costs, integrate physicians, panel says"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "ORLANDO -- To lessen financial risk in the switch from fee-for-service to being pay-for-value, providers need to track the cost of care through clinical integration, according to healthcare consultants who spoke during the Healthcare Financial Management Association 2015 Annual Institute conference on Monday.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Providers need to align physicians, hospitals, post-acute and ancillary providers with an organized system of clinical care, he said.\n\u201cYou probably don\u2019t know.\u201dThe up-front investment for clinical integration is $3 million to more than $20 million depending on infrastructure, according to the consultants.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just talk about clinical integration as you set it up, you have to talk about what\u2019s next around value-based contracting,\u201d Marino said.\nHealthcare is among the last large sectors of the economy to get an integrated network, and to track its costs.\nWe need patients to stay in network,\u201d said Daniel Marino, senior vice president of The Camden Group."}
