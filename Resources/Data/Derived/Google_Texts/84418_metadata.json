After unknown persons defaced a model appearing in their \"Get Your Game Face On\" advertisment \u2014 a campaign CG, the official beauty partner for the NFL, signed with all 32 teams \u2014 Covergirl.com/NFL is now down-for-maintanence.\n\nThe image, pictured right, shows the model sporting a black eye instead of the original Baltimore Ravens-inspired make-up that was meant to get women excited for football. #BoycottNFL and #GoodellMustGo are the hastags users are sharing with the image in an effort to further advocate for the NFL commisioner Roger Goodell to resign after he grossly mishandled the domestic abuse case against (now) former player Ray Rice.\n\nThough CG did not deface their own ad, they've made it clear they don't support domestic violence. \"As a brand that has always supported women and stood for female empowerment, CoverGirl believes domestic violence is completely unacceptable,\" the cosmetics company told E!
