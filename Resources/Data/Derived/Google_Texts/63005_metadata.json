Hillary Clinton dodges questions about email, presidential run\n\nThe former secretary of state continued to tease people waiting to hear her announce a presidential run during a speech at the Emily's List 30th Anniversary Conference and Gala in Washington, D.C., Tuesday night. She also steered completely clear of recent controversy over her use of a personal email account as secretary of state.
