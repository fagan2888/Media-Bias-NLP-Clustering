Use the idea of an impartial spectator to step outside yourself and see yourself as others see you. Use that vision to know yourself. Avoid the seductions of money and fame, for they will never satisfy.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like something from a theologian or self-help guru. But those words were penned by Adam Smith, author of \u201cThe Wealth of Nations,\u201d the late-18th-century work considered the first real book on economics.\n\nThe quotation is from \u201cThe Theory of Moral Sentiments,\u201d a less well-known book that Smith wrote earlier in his career but that is, arguably, equally important.\n\nThe insights in \u201cMoral Sentiments\u201d have been revived in a remarkable book published late last year, \u201cHow Adam Smith Can Change Your Life,\u201d by economist Russ Roberts.\n\nLike many people, I thought Smith was the original champion of why acting in one\u2019s self-interest was good for society\u2013ostensibly because it allowed each person or firm to specialize in what he or it did best and then trade for whatever else was required. But the self-interest that Smith made famous can be a powerful force for good in one\u2019s personal life.\n\nAccording to Smith, many of us do good things because we want others to approve and admire us. Mr. Roberts explores implications of this and other Smith insights.\n\nMr. Roberts\u2019s witty, candid take on Smith is filled with his own wisdom. Gurus, theologians and economists alike might learn a thing or two from him and the first modern economist.\n\nRobert Litan is a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, chief economic adviser to Patent Properties Inc., and the author of \u201cTrillion Dollar Economists.\u201d He is on Twitter: @BobLitan.\n\nALSO IN THINK TANK:\n\nFor 2016 Candidates, Middle-Class Woes Overshadow the Poor\n\nWhat\u2019s Boosting U.S. Manufacturing?
