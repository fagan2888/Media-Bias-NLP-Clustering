After all, practice makes perfect, and GOP lawmakers have all kinds of practice trying to remove \u201cObamacare\u201d from the books.\n\nAll of which brings us to now and the new Republican initiative to repeal the ACA \u2013 yes, they keep wasting time on this \u2013 which is going surprisingly poorly.\n\nFor example, congressional Republicans are trying to pursue their goal through the budget reconciliation process, but this week, Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough said reconciliation is only supposed to be used for bills that decrease the deficit, and according to the Congressional Budget Office, repealing the Affordable Care Act would make the deficit vastly larger.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has suggested firing MacDonough and replacing her with a parliamentarian who\u2019ll interpret Senate rules in ways Republicans want them to be interpreted.\n\nMaking matters slightly worse, The Hill reports that GOP senators are divided among themselves over how to pursue repeal, with \u201csome Republicans are balking at a proposal to repeal the expansion of Medicaid.\u201d The Hill\n\n\u201cI am very concerned about the 160,000 people who had Medicaid expansion in my state. I have difficulty with that being included,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia. Sen. John Hoeven (R), who represents North Dakota, where an estimated 19,000 people gained access to Medicaid after Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple decided to broaden the program, said he was unsure about repealing the expansion. [\u2026] \u201cI respect the decision of our Legislature and our governor on Medicaid expansion,\u201d said Sen. Steve Daines (R) of Montana, which has a Democratic governor. \u201cI\u2019m one who respects their rights and voices.\u201d\n\nOne unnamed senator added, \u201cRepealing the Medicaid expansion is not going to be in there because it\u2019s too problematic for many Republicans.\u201d The lawmaker added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stick the state with the bill.\u201d\n\nI see. So Republicans are eager to gut the American health care system, except for the popular parts that are actually delivering health security to American families.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, GOP leaders are still trying to figure out the road ahead. They realize all of this is theatrical anyway \u2013 President Obama will veto any repeal bill \u2013 and the endeavor is more of a dress rehearsal for 2017, when Republicans expect to control the White House and Congress simultaneously.\n\nBut the key lesson here is that some Republican lawmakers are starting to realize that it\u2019s vastly easier to talk about \u201crepealing Obamacare\u201d than it is to actually take Americans\u2019 benefits away to scratch a partisan itch.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Repealing Obamacare is \"more appealing as a talking point, a fundraising pitch and an electoral strategy than it is as an exercise in public policymaking.\"", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republicans-struggle-badly-aca-repeal-plan", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Repealing Obamacare is \"more appealing as a talking point, a fundraising pitch and an electoral strategy than it is as an exercise in public policymaking.\"", "title": "Republicans struggle badly with ACA repeal plan", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republicans-struggle-badly-aca-repeal-plan", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/gettyimages-478483376.jpg?itok=pPrBfL9b", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Republicans struggle badly with ACA repeal plan", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republicans-struggle-badly-aca-repeal-plan", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/gettyimages-478483376.jpg?itok=rA804GEe", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Repealing Obamacare is \"more appealing as a talking point, a fundraising pitch and an electoral strategy than it is as an exercise in public policymaking.\""}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-11-13T10:00:30-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Repealing Obamacare is \"more appealing as a talking point, a fundraising pitch and an electoral strategy than it is as an exercise in public policymaking.\"", "nv": {"tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care,health-care-reform,obamacare,republicans,senate-republicans,rachel-maddow-show", "author": "steve-benen", "published": 1, "date": "11/13/2015 10:00:30 EST", "title": "Republicans struggle badly with ACA repeal plan", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republicans-struggle-badly-aca-repeal-plan"}, "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Republicans, Affordable Care Act, Health Care, Obamacare, Senate Republicans"}, "article_summary": "You\u2019d think after several dozen votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, congressional Republicans would be quite adept at one of their favorite hobbies.\n[\u2026] \u201cI respect the decision of our Legislature and our governor on Medicaid expansion,\u201d said Sen.
