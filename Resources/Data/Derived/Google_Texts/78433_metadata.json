Shannon and James Lankford, are now answering attack ads that are airing on television as the primary election draws near.\n\nOne ad against Lankford says the Congressman voted three times to increase the debt limit by three trillion dollars.\n\nLankford said Tuesday that ad is misleading, saying he voted to use the debt ceiling as leverage to force democrats to decrease federal spending.\n\nAn ad attacking Shannon says the former Oklahoma Speaker of the House voted for higher debt and expanded Medicaid for the same special interests that employed him.\n\nThe Shannon campaign canceled our interview, but responded via e-mail, saying Shannon reduced the state's debt and stopped the Obamacare Medicaid expansion plan.\n\nWhat neither ad points out is that both candidates voted along with the republican majority on each issue.\n\n\"I think what is deceptive is they try to use a term that I'm increasing debt, when I'm actually working to get out of debt,\" Lankford said in a phone interview.\n\nThe Shannon campaign said, \"The facts are indisputable. JL has voted to increase the debt limit in the United States by $3 Trillion.\"\n\nLankford said he refuses to run attack ads, pointing out that a conservative group, Foundation for Economic Prosperity, produced and paid for the commercial that attacks Shannon.\n\nThe Oklahoma primary elections will be held on June 24.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican candidates for U.S. Senate, T.W.
