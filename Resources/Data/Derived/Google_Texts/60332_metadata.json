(REUTERS/Brian Snyder)\n\n3942183\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s executive order on global warming ignores strong scientific evidence that the earth has not warmed in the last 15 years.\n\nIncreasingly, media outlets have been reporting that global warming has been on hiatus since about 1998, causing climate scientists to scramble for an explanation.\n\nThe recent United Nation\u2019s climate report even acknowledged that there had been no significant warming over the last 15 years, but glossed over the evidence by saying that 15 years was too small a time period to declare global warming over.\n\nIn fact, the Obama administration, along with European governments, lobbied to have such data downplayed or even omitted from the UN\u2019s recent climate report. Evidence of no warming would undercut the upcoming international climate negotiations in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just part of the desperate move to rebrand their vehicle from global warming \u2014 which it isn\u2019t any more \u2014 to being all about catastrophic weather,\u201d Chris Horner, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cWhile the statistics disgrace such an effort, they think it has more emotional appeal and hasn\u2019t yet been so roundly discredited.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Obama administration and environmentalists have been focusing more on \u201cextreme weather\u201d events as a way to raise awareness about global warming, as global temperatures stay flat.\n\n\u201cNow, we know that no single weather event is caused solely by climate change,\u201d the president said in June. \u201cBut we also know that in a world that\u2019s warmer than it used to be, all weather events are affected by a warming planet. The fact that sea level in New York, in New York Harbor, are now a foot higher than a century ago \u2014 that didn\u2019t cause Hurricane Sandy, but it certainly contributed to the destruction that left large parts of our mightiest city dark and underwater.\u201d\n\nRecently, Obama\u2019s advocacy arm, Organizing for Action, tweeted out the president\u2019s condolences to the victims of Hurricane Sandy who lost their homes when the storm hit last year.\n\nThe effects of extreme weather on the East Coast have been devastating. #ThisIsReal pic.twitter.com/QZNeg9vP88 \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 29, 2013\n\nHowever, scientists have pushed back on the conclusion that the weather is becoming more extreme. Dr. Roger Pielke of the University of Colorado testified before the Senate that it\u2019s \u201cincorrect\u201d to claim that global warming is driving extreme weather events.\n\n\u201cIt is misleading and just plain incorrect to claim that disasters associated with hurricanes, tornadoes, floods or droughts have increased on climate timescales either in the United States or globally,\u201d Pielke told senators. \u201cIt is further incorrect to associate the increasing costs of disasters with the emission of greenhouse gases.\u201d\n\n\u201cHurricanes have not increased in the U.S. in frequency, intensity or normalized damage since at least 1900,\u201d Pielke added. \u201cThe same holds for tropical cyclones globally since at least 1970.\u201d\n\nU.S. floods have not increased in \u201cfrequency or intensity\u201d since 1950 and economic losses from floods have dropped by 75 percent as a percentage of GDP since 1940, according to Pielke\u2019s research.\n\nFurthermore, tornado frequency, intensity, and normalized damages have also not increased since 1950, and there is some evidence that this has declined. Droughts have been shorter, less frequent, and have covered a smaller portion of the U.S over the last century. Globally, there has been very little change in the last 60 years, he said.\n\nObama\u2019s executive order creates the interagency Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience, which is tasked with coordinating the federal government\u2019s response to global warming and supporting state and local efforts to prepare for the impact of a changing climate.\n\n\u201cThere is no trend in extreme weather events over the past century in spite of the mild warming that has occurred,\u201d said David Kreutzer, economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cHowever, increases in wealth and demographic changes subject more people and property to the existing, serious weather risks. Directly addressing the resilience of our communities to severe weather impacts makes much more sense than expensive climate policies that have no impact on weather catastrophes.\u201d\n\nThe makeup of Obama\u2019s new climate council makes it seem more like a war council than one preparing for increasingly bad weather. According to the order, the council will be co-chaired by the chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the director of White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the assistant to the president for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration uses \u2018climate change\u2019 as an excuse to accomplish other goals,\u201d said Daniel Simmons, director of regulatory and state affairs at the Institute for Energy Research. \u201cWho knows why the administration is including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and the Department of Veterans Affairs on a council to \u2018prepare the national for the impacts of climate change.'\u201d\n\nFollow Michael on Twitter and Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
