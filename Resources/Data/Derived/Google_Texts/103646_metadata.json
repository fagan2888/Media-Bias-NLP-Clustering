Those plans also take all comers, regardless of pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"And that means individuals can no longer be discriminated against because of their health status,\u201d said Christina Goe, general counsel for the insurance commissioner.\n\nThe pent-up demand, people receiving services after years of no coverage, and in some cases stopping payment on premiums and dropping off the plans, also contributes to price instability.\n\nGoe said it's expected to take about three years for the pent-up demand to level out. Doran said the Blue Cross rates are carefully calculated and are intended to create long-term stability.\n\nThe total number of enrollees in the plans affected is just a small portion of people in the state, and about 80 percent of those enrollees receive federal subsidies, with their own costs capped as a percentage of income.\n\n\u201cSo a good percentage of the individual market in Montana will not really see the full effect of the rate increase,\u201d Goe said.\n\nMontana Health Co-op, a nonprofit created by the ACA, is asking for an increase in part because it lost a lot of money in its platinum plan, the most comprehensive package of benefits.\n\n\u201cSo sicker people gravitated to [the] platinum plan,\u201d said Jerry Dworak, the co-op's president and CEO. \u201cThe mix that we got was a lot different than what we thought we would.\u201d\n\nThe co-op is dropping that platinum offering for 2016.\n\nDvorak said there's a general rule in insurance that about 20 percent of the enrollees will incur about 80 percent of the claims, and vice versa. In the co-op, just 120 people out of 14,000 enrollees, less than 1 percent, ran up about half of all costs, he said.\n\nThe plan is paying for some drug treatments costing upwards of $70,000 a month.\n\n\u201cThe number of mega-claims, large claims, was far greater than we ever anticipated,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile overall health costs keep going up, including traditional group plans.\n\nRichard Miltenberger of The Leavitt Group consults for employers seeking group plans.\n\nHe points to three reasons starting with individual behavior starting with individuals and their poor health habits.\n\n\"We all need to take better care of ourselves. That's part of the reason costs are high in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cSecondly, I point to the health care system. We don't have transparent pricing. I can tell you the price of gasoline in Montana right now. I can't tell you the price of an appendectomy.\n\n\u201cThe third thing \u2014 and I wouldn't let these folks off the hook \u2014 are the insurance companies. The insurance companies are taking too big a part of the pie.\"\n\nDvorak agreed on the need for lower costs for medical services and drugs.\n\n\"Unless there's some kind of cost-structure to control the claims, we're never going to get control of the premiums,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ACA specifies how much insurers can spend on its non-medical costs in administering the plan. And if they end up overcharging, customers will get refunds.\n\n\"There's no incentive for us to inflate prices by any beams,\u201d Doran said. \"Because (a) we won't be competitive in the marketplace, and (b) we would have to make rebates to our members in the future.\n\nThe state insurance commissioner will act on the rate requests later this summer. Goe said many things come into consideration when considering the requests, and that there's \u201cback and forth\u201d between her office and the insurers before a final price is set.\n\nThose prices will be in effect when open enrollment for the plans starts in November, with plans taking effect in January.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Montana's health insurance providers have requested some big rate increases on some plans.Last week, U.S. Senator Steve Daines (R-Montana) took to the Senate floor with a chart of the increases, ra...", "author": "Sanjay Talwani - MTN News", "og": {"url": "http://www.krtv.com/story/29291333/proposed-heath-insurance-rate-increases-unlikely-to-affect-most", "image": "http://KXLH.images.worldnow.com/images/8033606_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Montana's health insurance providers have requested some big rate increases on some plans.Last week, U.S. Senator Steve Daines (R-Montana) took to the Senate floor with a chart of the increases, ra...", "title": "Proposed heath insurance rate increases unlikely to affect most"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KXLH.images.worldnow.com/images/8033606_G.jpg", "description": "Montana's health insurance providers have requested some big rate increases on some plans.Last week, U.S. Senator Steve Daines (R-Montana) took to the Senate floor with a chart of the increases, ra...", "card": "summary", "title": "Proposed heath insurance rate increases unlikely to affect most"}, "wnreadableurl": "proposed-heath-insurance-rate-increases-unlikely-to-affect-most", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KXLH", "fb": {"app_id": 161591973908016}, "date": "2015/06/10", "KEYWORDS": "Great Falls, Montana, News, news, breaking news, weather, CBS", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS09", "news_keywords": "Great Falls, Montana, News, news, breaking news, weather, CBS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06ce\"", "article_summary": "\"And one of the builders said, 'This likely means that I no longer will be able to provide health care insurance for my employees,'\u201d he said.\nMontana's health insurance providers have requested some big rate increases on some plans.\nRichard Miltenberger of The Leavitt Group consults for employers seeking group plans.\nMeanwhile overall health costs keep going up, including traditional group plans.\n\u201cSecondly, I point to the health care system."}
