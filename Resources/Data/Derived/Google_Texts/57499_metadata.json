In the first three years it is targeting 450,000 people\u2014almost half in Los Angeles County.\n\n\n\nIt started enrolling eligible people April 1, on a voluntary basis and will fully take effect in Los Angeles on July 1. That\u2019s when those who haven\u2019t signed up will be assigned to one of five project health plans.\n\n\n\nMedicare Not Enough\n\n\n\nSpeaking recently at a forum for ethnic media and community stakeholders, organized by New America Media, Casillas described stressful and wasteful situations in the current system that he and other health care providers hope will end with the new, coordinated-care approach. Dozens of older adults also participated in the event, held at the St. Barnabas Senior Center in collaboration with the Los Angeles Aging Advocacy Coalition.\n\n\n\nFor example, he said, \u201cWith just the Medicare benefit, if you\u2019re working with a patient with diabetes, you can\u2019t really manage them appropriately unless you can address their nutrition \u2013 unless they actually have a working refrigerator, unless they have some kind of access to healthy meals. Same thing with high blood pressure and other types of heart diseases.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso, he said, the new Cal MediConnect program should help patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or related dementias coordinate their medical care with caregiver support services at home. Many have received state In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) benefits, he said, but if those services aren\u2019t coordinated with a provider [and] the medical system, they won\u2019t be part of a truly effective care plan.\n\n\n\nCal MediConnect will provide each patient with a care coordinator and add previously uncovered vision care and non-emergency transportation, such as for doctors\u2019 visits. It will combine federal Medicare benefits with health services under MediCal (California\u2019s name for state-administered Medicaid for low-income people.)\n\n\n\nPatients will also have access to a care team. Not only their doctor, but also a nurse, social worker, nutritionist, physical and occupational therapists, transportation coordinator and other specialists will establish each person\u2019s health plan.\n\n\n\nParticipating insurers must also offer an adequate provider network with enough specialists, primary care physicians, language interpretation and others.\n\n\n\nA major change through Cal MediConnect is that MediCal will now manage three programs considered national innovations 30 years ago, but which were not coordinated into seamless patient care. They include the state\u2019s IHSS home care program, adult day health and case management.\n\n\n\nCalifornia is one of about 20 states participating in the three-year demonstration project through the Affordable Care Act aimed at improving care while reducing unnecessary cost.\n\n\n\nCasillas noted that Cal MediConnect is partly based on PACE, or the Programs for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly. Created 40 years ago in San Francisco\u2019s Chinese community, PACE combines Medicare and Medicaid funding and allows health providers to give patients appropriate care with fewer bureaucratic barriers. Casillas directs the PACE program at AltaMed.\n\n\n\nBlue Envelopes Offer Three Options\n\n\n\nThe hope with Cal MediConnect, he said, \u201cis an improvement over the status quo for patients and providers\u2019 offices.\u201d\n\n\n\nThose being brought into the new system are receiving blue envelopes from the state Department of Health Services explaining three options. Eligible beneficiaries can enroll in a Cal MediConnect plan blending both their Medicare and MediCal coverage; they can sign up for only a MediCal managed care plan while keeping their current Medicare coverage; or in Los Angeles they can join a PACE plan.\n\n\n\nAddressing the community forum audience from his wheelchair, Jorge Chuc, a Latino community peer mentor with Personal Assistance Services Council-L.A., said at first he was worried that with Cal MediConnect he might lose his doctor, a widespread concern in the community, and one Casillas acknowledges.\n\n\n\n\u201cA huge challenge the system is going to face,\u201d he said, \u201cis that doctors in the community who have not previously participated in and are not contracted with a [Cal MediConnect] plan are still the key link to the patients and still provide a lot of influence and education.\u201d\n\n\n\nMany doctors, however, remain unaware that plans can include them for up to a year without their having to join the managed care network. \u201cPlans are working hard to engage those providers in their networks, because they are a crucial link [to patient care],\u201d Casillas went on.\n\n\n\nMost important, Chuc declared, \u201cOpen the blue envelope, read it, choose the best plan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCal MediConnect includes five plans available in L.A. County \u2013 Care First, Care More, HealthNet, LA Care and Molina.\n\n\n\nPatient\u2019s Confusion\u2014and Rights\n\n\n\nAmber Cutler, staff attorney for the National Senior Citizens Law Center, emphasized that even if dual Medicare-MediCal beneficiaries wait until after July 1 and find the state has enrolled them in a new plan, \u201cYou have the right to disenroll from Cal MediConnect or change plans at any time for any reason.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe added, \u201cKeep in mind, though, that you\u2019d still have to enroll in a MediCal Managed care plan.\u201d That\u2019s because the state is moving all MediCal recipients out of customary fee-for-service insurance and into managed care plans. The federal Medicare, however, always allows patients to switch back to fee-for-service coverage.\n\n\n\nAileen Harper, executive director of L.A.\u2019s Center for Health Care Rights told the forum audience, \u201cMany consumers find the Cal MediConnect program confusing.\u201d\n\n\n\nHarper\u2019s agency includes the county\u2019s Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP), charged with helping the public at no cost \u2013 in all languages \u2013 to understand their health care choices. Notices from the state, including in the blue Cal MediConnect envelopes, list HICAP\u2019s toll-free 800 number.\n\n\n\nShe explained that HICAP is responsible for helping people navigate their Cal MediConnect options by enabling them to understand notices from the state and fill out enrollment forms. HICAP counselors will also help beneficiaries find out if their doctors are part of the five participating plan networks.\n\n\n\nAlso listed on notices to affected Los Angeles County residents is the toll-free number for the Health Consumer Center at Neighborhood Legal Services of L.A.\n\n\n\nSupervising Attorney Stephanie Lee said the state designated the program as the independent Cal MediConnect ombudsman tasked with helping consumers with problems, such as filing appeals and complaints or obtaining referrals to other organizations they may need.\n\n\n\nOne recent caller, for instance, was a Korean-speaking nursing home patient, age 81, who was concerned she may have to move to another home. Lee said the senior could neither reach her physician nor get answers from the facility because a Korean speaker was not always available.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were able to educate her and see what plans her nursing home and doctor worked with,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\n\nServing Vulnerable Populations\n\n\n\n\u201cThe overarching issue,\u201d she stressed, \u201cis that this program involves vulnerable populations, who may not be able to understand what is happening or be able to make any decisions.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the St. Barnabas forum, several participating seniors, such as Anacleto Mendoza of the Filipino American Service Group Inc., and, speaking through an interpreter, Ok Sook Yoon, a volunteer at the Korean Resource Center, raised a range of concerns as Cal MediConnect goes into effect. Their worries ranged from the possible continuation of past, disorganized care to losing a doctor of 20 years who speaks the patient\u2019s language.\n\n\n\nOverall, Casillas explained, \u201cThe challenge will be in the first few months of the program to make sure the patient is assigned to the right case manager and care team. There may be some barriers to doing that as they initially enroll, but the structure of this program should address those issues.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor any questions about Cal MediConnect in L.A.
