(AP) - Three health centers in Rhode Island have been awarded a combined $3 million to expand.\n\n\n\nRhode Island's congressional delegation says the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded the funding for facility renovation and expansion. The funds will increase access to health care for a projected 11,250 additional patients.\n\n\n\nComprehensive Community Action in Cranston and Blackstone Valley Community Health Care in Pawtucket are slated to get $1 million each. The Providence Community Health Centers will receive nearly $1 million.\n\n\n\nU.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, says these centers are a vital source of health care for many families and the funding will expand high-quality primary and preventive care options for thousands of people.\n\n\n\nThe funding comes from the Affordable Care Act's Community Health Center Fund.\n\n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
