There will be too much information shared. There will be shifting alliances. There will likely be dancing, drinking, arguing, a confusing kiss even. There will also be the truly unexpected.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not an overcrowded genre, couples plays \u2014 especially those with only four characters \u2014 tend to be memorable. And volatile. Yes, even when they\u2019re making us laugh. Of course, the couples are never simply representatives of relationships. And that\u2019s likely why we\u2019re drawn to them. Add a couple to a story and you exponentially expand its hothouse insights, whether they\u2019re about love and desire, anger and forgiveness or status and thwarted aspirations.\n\nHere are a few more arch works that challenge their romantic quartets \u2014 and us.\n\n\u201cGod of Carnage\u201d\n\nYasmina Reza\u2019s 2009 Tony-winning play begins as two couples meet to discuss a school-yard incident in which one couple\u2019s son hit the other in what appears to be an instance of bullying. The nastiness that follows between these upscale, educated, oh-so-mannered parents make whatever occurred between their sons mere child\u2019s play. In 2011, Roman Polanski\u2019s film adaptation opened, starring Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz, Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly. As good as the cast is, the film could not do what theater does so well: lock us in a room and exploit the set-up for some surprisingly authentic insights.\n\n\u201cCloser\u201d\n\nBritish playwright Patrick Marber\u2019s relationship tale \u2014 with its predeliction for blue language and sexual teases \u2014 might be described as very lovely people doing and saying quite unlovely things. Those people are a doctor, an obit writer and hobbled novelist, a photographer and a waif of a stripper. Over the course of four years, the quartet couples and uncouples in ways that school us in deceit, fear and most compelling, male competition.\n\nFew can best Mike Nichols when it comes to taking a play to the screen. In 2004, he directed Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman and Jude Law in a version of \u201cCloser,\u201d which earned Owen and Portman Oscar nominations.\n\n\u201cYour Friends & Neighbors\u201d\n\nWhile this 1998 indie comedy-drama didn\u2019t originate as a play, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that this caustic tale of marital malaise and sexual politics came from a playwright: Neil LaBute. It has that kind of high, uncomfortable emotional humidity.\n\n\u201c(D)escribing who does what, and with whom, would be pointless,\u201d wrote Roger Ebert in his four-star review. \u201cThe underlying truth is that no one cares for or about anybody else very much, and all of the fooling around is just an exercise in selfishness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d\n\nThings do not get much more incendiary than Edward Albee\u2019s 1962 domestic war games set in an associate professor\u2019s on-campus home. Indeed, a certain play that shall go nameless actually burns down the house and still it cannot outdo George and Martha for fireworks. Or collateral damage. Poor Nick and Honey, they don\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nNeed a refresher? Lakewood\u2019s Edge Theater Company will be presenting the classic in late July.\n\nAsked why audiences are drawn to relationship bonfires, Edge executive director Rick Yaconis replied by e-mail, \u201cWe love seeing the drama in other people\u2019s relationships, and mostly try to avoid the drama in our own.\u201d Indeed.\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy\n\n\u201cDETROIT\u201d\n\nWritten by Lisa D\u2019Amour.
