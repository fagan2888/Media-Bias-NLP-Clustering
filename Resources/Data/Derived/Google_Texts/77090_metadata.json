It's not a luxury; a large majority of businesses use customer information to gain an advantage in a competitive marketplace. If a company isn't analyzing data, it's probably steps behind the competition.\n\nIt wasn't always like this: With limited personalized consumer feedback, companies for decades typically had to use a one-size-fits-all approach to interact with customers. But today, with customers willingly submitting the most personal information imaginable about their desires, experiences and problems, companies can pull out every needle in the haystack and react accordingly.\n\nData analytics for customer experience management will bring a business only so far.\n\n\"We have a huge amount of data, but lots of companies have tons and tons of information and don't know what to do with it,\" said Phil Walden, director of digital strategy at Moviepilot. \"The advantage goes to those who have a clear idea of what to do with it.\" For Moviepilot, the \"doing\" happens thanks to proprietary software that culls and analyzes user information gleaned from Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr. Others rely on vendor software to do the heavy lifting and -- if they're truly invested in maximizing customer interactions -- integrate the data with their CRM systems so they can properly respond.\n\nBut no matter the technology, many companies that use data analytics for customer experience management say it will bring a business only so far. \"In addition to the technology,\" said T.J. Houk, Trupanion's director of business intelligence, \"it's the people who understand the data and the company itself to make the most of the data. Otherwise, it's just data.\"\n\nMay the data be with you Walden couldn't imagine Moviepilot's business without its ability to analyze customer data. The company couldn't provide the latest stories, photos and gossip on its members' favorite movies if it didn't know which films they liked in the first place. When Moviepilot launched four years ago, its founders knew they couldn't create an ordinary dot-com website. People wouldn't easily discover relevant movie reviews and news from Moviepilot through Google searches, but they would see stories if the content streamed through their favorite social channels and sparked engagement. Thus, when users want to share stories or comments, follow a favorite writer or receive updates on a specific movie, they must sign into the Moviepilot website through their Facebook accounts. For users, allowing access to their accounts means they get select content about their favorite movies and actors in their Facebook streams. For Moviepilot, it means a treasure trove of user demographics, locations and other personal information at its disposal. With the aid of proprietary software, Moviepilot sorts all this data -- indexing selected interests against the movies that similar users like -- and determines what kinds of information a user should see next. \"We find what our users are interested in and give them what they like,\" Walden said. \"Internally, we use the data to influence our content strategy. So, say, if they like X-Men, they'll probably like certain movies and TV shows from that action genre. Eventually, the data helps us learn why they're interested in a certain thing, and that [has] helped our growth.\" What Walden means is that by making sense of each user's information and interests, Moviepilot closes the gap between the data it collects and the data it creates. That created data tells Moviepilot that, for instance, certain 20-year-olds in San Francisco prefer Supergirl, while 30-year-olds in the Midwest favor Wonder Woman. So the content that Moviepilot will push onto a user's personalized website or her Facebook feed will reflect what she read in the past, and will also consider the stories her Facebook friends are reading. Before personalized data laid bare customers' interests, a business would have sent a survey group into the field and would have been lucky to accumulate 100 honest and complete responses, Walden said. Now, personalized data from Moviepilot's users' Facebook pages -- as well as information gleaned from their Twitter and Instagram accounts -- provides thousands of detailed answers, he said, pointing to the nearly 30,000 data points already collected from Avengers fans who are awaiting a sequel that's still a year away. The personalized data not only satisfies more than 20 million users' individualized movie interests and strengthens Moviepilot's position as a resource -- it also allows the company to give moviemakers the type of marketing data they crave. Moviepilot works with 21st Century Fox, Fox Searchlight, Hallmark Channel and other studios, helping them devise targeted social and marketing strategies. Armed with thousands of keywords used by its members -- that have been separated by gender, age and other factors -- Moviepilot determines which search terms work best to identify where and how to place a studio's advertisement on the Web. \"It's information the studios don't have, so we can say, 'Your audience for this movie is older males,'\" Walden said. \"Before, everything was done on a gut feeling, and movies that were made for young men missed their mark. The data proves and disproves those ideas.\"\n\nPatient care gets a boost But analytics can do more than determine people's movie preferences; it can help save lives. Analyzing real-time patient information such as vital signs and medication use lets healthcare providers extend the best treatment and enhance, inarguably, the most important customer experience of all. The international auditing company KPMG uses data analytics to measure treatment patterns, costs and medical outcomes to answer the eternal question of how to best serve a patient. KPMG pulls data from Medicare and Blue Cross Blue Shield claims to reach conclusions on how much a particular treatment should cost and how providers can improve patient care. \u201cEspecially now, with the regulations coming up with the Affordable Care Act, you can use data analytics and actually follow through with quality of care,\u201d said Bharat Rao, an advisory principal at KPMG. \u201cProviders can ask, \u2018Am I reducing the number of avoidable errors? Am I following guidelines?\u2019 It\u2019s harnessing the data of day-to-day treatment to improve healthcare.\u201d By analyzing patient data, KPMG aims to help the healthcare industry reduce variability. In other words, the data will reveal that medication worked better for a group of patients on the West Coast than surgery did for another group on the East Coast, according to Ashraf Shehata, principal of KPMG\u2019s Global Healthcare Center of Excellence. \u201cWhen you see that variation, the key is to address it,\u201d Shehata said. \u201cSo you cannot lock the data in the analysts\u2019 hands, but you have to put it in the hands of the providers. That\u2019s why you're seeing an improved relationship between the payers and the providers.\u201d Clear, personalized data, in other words, has started to knock down silos in the healthcare industry and has led to new procedures and practices that improve patient care. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole movement toward the transparency of data,\u201d Shehata said. \u201cThe data shows what\u2019s behind out-of-pocket costs or the time it took to get an appointment. The comments and ratings that make Yelp successful are making their way to healthcare products and services. Patients are demanding it.\u201d While KPMG reviews personal data on a large scale, many hospitals struggle with analyzing smaller data sets. \u201cA lot of hospitals are in a position where they collect data across multiple IT systems and multiple archives, but they can\u2019t reposition it,\u201d said Christopher Rosin, chief scientist at Amara Health Analytics in San Diego, which crunches patient data through a platform from DataStax Enterprise to catch the early stages of medical conditions such as sepsis. \u201cThe data we get is in a very rare form. Hospitals have only recently reached a point where they have a critical mass of patient data,\u201d Rosin said. \u201cData sources from the same hospital may steer to the patient in different ways, so we need to standardize it. A big part of it is natural language processing and the ability to extract things like diagnosis of a disease or treatment.\u201d\n\nPrivacy matters Although healthcare providers can independently crunch all the data they acquire from patients, privacy expectations \u2014 as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \u2014 limit the type of patient information that providers can share with third-party sources, including those that perform analytical services. Hospitals, clinics and insurance companies can\u2019t release patients\u2019 conditions, what medical services they received, what medication they took or other identifying information. That doesn\u2019t go for aggregated data, which can be shared because it doesn\u2019t trace to a particular person\u2019s medical condition. \u201cThe data is not personally identifiable, but it is the foundation for academic studies and population health management,\u201d Shehata said. \u201cThe aggregated data is used for developing medical protocols and resource planning. Employers can use this data to see what sort of healthcare spending they have per employee and benchmark it against other organizations. Much of the work on big data in healthcare is centered on aggregated data.\u201d Still, relying largely on aggregated data limits the healthcare industry from seeing the full picture of patient care. \u201cThe protection of private patient data is a very significant, and perhaps inherent, barrier to the free flow of data for healthcare research and the development of new insights that could improve patient care,\u201d Rosin said. \u201cTo avoid disclosing private protected patient health information, patient data cannot flow freely unless it is totally de-identified. But in the case of full rich data, such as narrative notes by physicians and nurses, de-identification risks corrupting the underlying meaning; and full de-identification is very hard and it is difficult to prevent re-identification.\u201d In other words, academic researchers are precluded from using large-scale comprehensive data to develop new insights on patient care, Rosin said. \u201cSo we\u2019re a long way from fully realizing the kinds of healthcare insights we might get with deep analysis of the full richness of data from hundreds of millions of patients,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Customer experience analytics tools need to be balanced with human insight in order to improve customer experience.", "og": {"site_name": "SearchCRM", "description": "Customer experience analytics tools need to be balanced with human insight in order to improve customer experience.", "title": "Customer experience strategy hinges on insight from analytics", "url": "http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/feature/Customer-experience-strategy-hinges-on-insight-from-analytics", "image": "http://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/visuals/searchCRM/marketing/CRM_article_013.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@searchcrm", "image": "http://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/visuals/searchCRM/marketing/CRM_article_013.jpg", "description": "Customer experience analytics tools need to be balanced with human insight in order to improve customer experience.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Customer experience strategy hinges on insight from analytics"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 870327132989388}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/businessinformationmagazine/200402560107445"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTo avoid disclosing private protected patient health information, patient data cannot flow freely unless it is totally de-identified.\nPatient care gets a boost But analytics can do more than determine people's movie preferences; it can help save lives.\nAnalyzing real-time patient information such as vital signs and medication use lets healthcare providers extend the best treatment and enhance, inarguably, the most important customer experience of all.\nHospitals have only recently reached a point where they have a critical mass of patient data,\u201d Rosin said.\nBut no matter the technology, many companies that use data analytics for customer experience management say it will bring a business only so far."}
