The Kansas Lottery site had such an overload that it was down for a bit and if you still can't find the numbers we have them here.

The winning numbers in tonightâ€™s $380M #Powerball jackpot are: 5-10-21-34-58, Powerball 33.



"I have hundreds of customers coming in playing Powerball, only Powerball," said Dhyah Abughalia, West Wichita Valero store owner.

His store in West Wichita was flooded with customers, all hopeful for the $380 million dollar grand prize. "They're evening putting in the extra $10 dollars to play the Powerball because the jackpot is so high, it's crazy.

"The odds aren't in your favor but somebody's going to win it and it's a life changer so I gotta try," said Ricky Pickens. He bought himself several lotto tickets.

KAKE News took to the streets to ask Wichitans what they would do with that much money. Believe it or not, fancy cars, expensive trips, or even shopping sprees weren't at the top of everyone's list.

Camren Burns said he would, "take care of my family, try to give back to the community, do anything to help out with hospital bills or anything else that my family needs."
