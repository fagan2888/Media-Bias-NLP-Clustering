Then he said people should set up their own savings plans. We don\u2019t know what he means.\n\nThe other leading Republican candidate, who topped the polls for at least 100 days, wants to throw out millions of immigrants who have been living and working in America for years. He wants to wall off the nation to keep undocumented foreigners out.\n\nAnother presidential candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, is running into stiff opposition from conservative Republicans because he expanded his state\u2019s Medicaid program, the only health insurance many poor Ohioans have.\n\nHouston voters overturned a city ordinance that would have prohibited bias in housing, employment, city contracting and business services. Opponents complained the measure would have permitted transgenders who were born men to enter women\u2019s bathrooms. (As if unisex bathrooms on planes don\u2019t exist.)\n\nIn Kentucky a businessman won the governor\u2019s race despite alienating a lot of Kentuckians, refusing to talk to some reporters, riding around in a gold Cadillac and promising to take away Obamacare from half a million Kentuckians and reject federal funds for Medicaid.\n\nIn our politics today there\u2019s increasing contempt for those who need help. It\u2019s alarming.\n\nOn the other hand, a study by Indiana University\u2019s school of philanthropy predicts that total charitable giving in America will increase 4.8 percent this year and 4.9 percent in 2016.\n\nAnd while Ohioans firmly rejected an initiative that would have legalized marijuana, including medical marijuana needed by severely epileptic children \u2014 which a majority of people favor \u2014 that rejection was attributed to a provision that inexplicably would have created a marijuana monopoly for 10 groups of investors.\n\nSo the evidence is mixed. What is probably going on here is frustration and anger at political stalemate along with a poignant cry to \u201cgive us new faces.\u201d Washington is broken. The immigration system is broken. The health care system is broken. The concept of fair wages is broken.\n\nBy extension, the politicians are saying America is broken.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what Americans think. They think the problem is leadership.\n\nThis is the problem: If next year\u2019s presidential election were held right now, Hillary Rodham Clinton would get 47 percent of the vote and Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, would get 47 percent.\n\nOf course, a lot will happen in a year.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear Americans are almost evenly divided between those who think government can and should solve the major problems society faces and those who want private enterprise to take charge, almost unfettered by government restrictions. Half the people want political compromise; half do not. Half the people want to make drastic cuts in government services no matter who gets hurt; half the people are willing to put up with bureaucracy and even waste, fraud and abuse to keep such services coming.\n\nThere is no short-term way to \u201cfix\u201d this. Whoever wins the White House next November will struggle to get anything accomplished \u2026 unless we change how we think and talk.\n\nClinton shouldn\u2019t say, even jokingly, that Republicans are her \u201cenemy.\u201d Carson shouldn\u2019t compare Obamacare to Nazism. Voters must not give credence to Donald Trump\u2019s insistence he should be president because he\u2019s the loudest, rudest and richest. Marco Rubio can\u2019t assume his youth, heritage and dismissive attitude toward his former mentor mean he deserves the presidency.\n\nVoters must demand civility and thoughtfulness. They must insist on serious policy proposals and in-depth knowledge about our problems. An Iowa man recently said, \u201cI\u2019m for Ben Carson because he doesn\u2019t yell.\u201d Really, that is not the gold standard for choosing the most powerful leader in the world.\n\nNobody promised democracy would be easy. But it\u2019s been around for a long time; there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t work as it is supposed to work.\n\nFamilies can learn to live with their differences. If Americans stop the name-calling and work out disagreements with practical solutions, we can get along.\n\nMore pragmatism, less ideology and more compassion won\u2019t mean losing our American values but rather keeping them.\n\nAnn McFeatters is a columnist for Tribune News Service.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Are Americans becoming less compassionate?
