Cyndi Thomas has recently joined HealthForce as vice president of business development. HealthForce services are designed to ensure that healthcare providers have accurate coding and are fully prepared for the transition to the new ICD-10 system.\n\nHealthForce has a staff of more than 100 experienced coders who will provide coding services to hospitals and health systems nationwide. \"HealthForce is committed to quality and compliance. Our medical records coders have all gone through quality checks,\" Ms. Thomas explained. \"They are trained, supervised and mentored under the same strict standards operating at North Shore-LIJ. Our coders have a proven track record of success in seeing projects through from start to finish.\"\n\n\n\nBy October 1, 2015, the Affordable Care Act requires that all healthcare systems in the United States begin using ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition) medical documentation and coding procedures. ICD-10 will replace the current coding system, ICD-9, for all medical reporting and payment processes except workers' compensation and no-fault insurance. This conversion impacts the way medical services are documented, coded and billed as well as how healthcare providers are reimbursed for providing patient care. Failure to effectively adopt and use the new ICD-10 code set by the deadline will result in significant financial consequences for health systems.\n\n\"With its vast expertise in medical coding, North Shore-LIJ brings enormous value in helping healthcare organizations understand the financial implications of this transition to ICD-10,\" said Frank Danza, the health system's senior vice president and chief revenue officer. \"We are unique in the coding outsourcing business because we don't require clients to outsource their entire Revenue Cycle. Unlike others, we are not a staff augmentation company. We apply the same accuracy and quality oversight for our clients as we do for our own coding operations, delivering dedicated support from individual coders with the expertise to meet the specific needs of our customers.\"\n\nMs. Thomas has 18 years experience staffing credentialed and experienced hospital coders. She has successfully built two contract coding enterprises at nationally respected staffing companies.\n\nTo learn more about HealthForce and its services, contact Ms. Thomas at 516-580-9692\n\nAbout North Shore-LIJ Health System\n\nOne of the nation's largest health systems, North Shore-LIJ delivers world-class clinical care throughout the New York metropolitan area, pioneering research at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, a visionary approach to medical education highlighted by the Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, and healthcare coverage to individuals, families and businesses through the CareConnect Insurance Co.
