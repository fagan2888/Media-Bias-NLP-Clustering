It covers children whose parents make too much to qualify for the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System but may not earn enough to be able to afford private insurance, even with the subsidies available in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDr. Elizabeth McKenna, a pediatrician, pointed out to members of the House Health Committee that Congress has agreed to pick up the full cost of the program through 2017. She said there\u2019s no reason for the state to reject the money and leave children without coverage.\n\nBut the measure, which now goes to the House Appropriations Committee, faces an uncertain future amid concerns that the state will end up obligated \u2014 whether legally or politically \u2014 to pick up the cost once the federal government stops picking up the entire tab.\n\nGov. Doug Ducey did not ask lawmakers to restart Kids Care, suspended in 2010, in his State of the State message to lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re willing to look at any plan,\u201d said press aide Daniel Scarpinato. \u201cBut we need to ensure that we\u2019re not obligating (state) taxpayers to ongoing spending that the federal government is not going to support.\u201d\n\nThe Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, currently covers all individuals whose income is below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. That\u2019s $27,724 for a family of three.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the pricetag is picked up by the federal government.\n\nKids Care, first implemented more than a decade ago, covers children in families up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $40,180 for that family of three. It has traditionally been funded with a 3-1 match: Every dollar the state puts up generates $3 from Washington.\n\nIn 2010, however, with the state facing a deficit, Gov. Jan Brewer convinced lawmakers to freeze enrollment.\n\nAt that time there were close to 45,000 children in the program. Current enrollment is now just 730.\n\nRep. Regina Cobb, R-Kingman, who is championing the restoration, said there\u2019s a \u201cgood chance\u201d Congress will keep up the 100 percent funding beyond 2017.\n\nBut she assured colleagues that there\u2019s no fiscal trap down the road. Cobb said Arizona is the only state in the country which does not have an active Kids Care program.\n\nCobb inserted language in the legislation to require the AHCCCS director to notify state budget officials by July 1, 2017 whether Congress is going to continue with full funding. At that point, it would be up to the state to decide whether to pony up the necessary dollars to keep the program in place.\n\nMcKenna, who said she is speaking on behalf of pediatricians around the state, said it\u2019s important for children to have insurance.\n\n\u201cWhen children are uninsured, their families cannot bring them in when they\u2019re sick,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cSo a minor illness such as a cold or bronchitis becomes a major illness such as pneumonia, oftentimes requiring expensive emergency room evaluations and, many times, hospitalization.\u201d\n\nMcKenna said if the parents don\u2019t have insurance the hospitals end up swallowing the expenses.\n\nRep. Jay Lawrence, R-Scottsdale, pointed out that GOP presidential contenders have promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He said that could dry up funding as soon as next year.\n\nBut Kelly Whitener, a health policy expert at Georgetown University, pointed out that Kids Care actually is part of a 1997 federal law known as the State Health Insurance Program. She told Lawrence any move to undo \u201cObamacare\u201d would not affect this program.\n\nDana Naimark, president of the Children\u2019s Action Alliance, said restarting the program is about more than keeping kids healthy. She said it also affects education.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not healthy, how can you learn?\u201d Naimark said. \u201cIf your ear hurts, how can you pay attention?\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Eric Meyer acknowledged that the program is not exactly free, with the cost being paid by federal tax dollars. But he said if Arizona doesn\u2019t take its share, the dollars \u201cget redistributed to other states to use.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PHOENIX \u2014 Deciding they can\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d\u2019 to free money, a House panel voted unanimously Tuesday to once again provide health insurance to children of the working poor.", "og": {"site_name": "East Valley Tribune", "description": "PHOENIX \u2014 Deciding they can\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d\u2019 to free money, a House panel voted unanimously Tuesday to once again provide health insurance to children of the working poor.", "title": "House committee votes to lift freeze on Kids Care enrollment", "url": "http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/state/article_21f77a04-d01a-11e5-98fe-670b786c2cd6.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eastvalleytribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/69/e699e694-d01a-11e5-a5fd-7beff386134b/56bb72aa7cd43.image.gif?resize=200%2C274", "height": 274}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@evtnow", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,100006692256060,1527006887", "app_id": 148566918492476}, "keywords": "hb 2309,arizona health care cost containment system,dr. elizabeth mckenna,gov. doug ducey,kids care,daniel scarpinato,rep. regina cobb, r-kingman,ahcccs,rep. jay lawrence, r-scottsdale,kelly whitener,dana naimark,children\u2019s action alliance,state,top_story", "news_keywords": "hb 2309,arizona health care cost containment system,dr. elizabeth mckenna,gov. doug ducey,kids care,daniel scarpinato,rep. regina cobb, r-kingman,ahcccs,rep. jay lawrence, r-scottsdale,kelly whitener,dana naimark,children\u2019s action alliance,state,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d34\"", "article_summary": "HB 2309 would lift the freeze imposed on enrollment in the Kids Care program.\nDoug Ducey did not ask lawmakers to restart Kids Care, suspended in 2010, in his State of the State message to lawmakers.\nCobb said Arizona is the only state in the country which does not have an active Kids Care program.\nBut Kelly Whitener, a health policy expert at Georgetown University, pointed out that Kids Care actually is part of a 1997 federal law known as the State Health Insurance Program.\nPHOENIX \u2014 Deciding they can\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d\u2019 to free money, a House panel voted unanimously Tuesday to once again provide health insurance to children of the working poor."}
