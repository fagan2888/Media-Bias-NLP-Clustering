The study examined 291 U.S. cities. On a scale of 100, Denver scored an impressive 99. Boulder got a B-plus, 87 points. Aurora scored 66, and Colorado Springs managed just 60 points, giving the state an average of 78 points, one point below the national average.\n\nThe cities were graded on recognition of same-sex relationships, employment and contracting policies, inclusiveness of city services, law enforcement and \u201cmunicipal leadership on matters of equality,\u201d according the report\u2019s authors.\n\nWhile Denver did extremely well, 25 cities aced it with 100 points for \u201cexcellent policies ranging from non-discrimination laws, equal employee benefits and cutting-edge city services,\u201d including Minneapolis, Atlanta, St. Louis and Missoula, Mont.\n\nFour cities scored zeros, two of them in Mississippi, Starkville and Southhaven, joined by Kansas City, Kan., and Port St. Lucie, Fla. The groups that published the report hope it spurs those with low scores to do better.\n\n\u201cHere in Colorado, state and city leaders are taking critical steps to protect LGBT Coloradans and their families,\u201d said Jon Monteith, spokesman for One Colorado, the state\u2019s leading LGBT advocacy organization. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing this progress in communities across the country, as this year\u2019s MEI demonstrates, but we also know our work continues to fulfill our vision of a fair and just Colorado where all are truly equal.\u201d\n\nChad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, called the rating system, in its second year, \u201cgroundbreaking,\u201d as it examined \u201cbasic fairness\u201d in municipalities large and small across the country.\n\n\u201cEquality isn\u2019t just for the coasts anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nThe full report is available on the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s website.\n\nColorado crossed a threshold on May 1, when civil unions became state law, passed by the legislature earlier this year. Mayor Michael Hancock delivered a powerful address before a celebratory dinner. City Councilwoman Robin Kniech, the city\u2019s first openly gay city council member, elected in 2011. Afterward, Hancock presided over civil-union ceremonies from midnight until almost daylight. Colorado House Speaker Mark Ferrandino and his partner, Greg Wertsch, were among the couples. They later held a private ceremony on the west balcony of the state Capitol, officiated by state Supreme Court Justice Monica M\u00e1rquez, the first openly gay person on that body.\n\nDenver\u2019s former mayor, John Hickenlooper, politically drove the issue of civil unions to his desk for a signature into law.\n\nAlso this year, One Colorado ensured that the state\u2019s health insurance exchange and private insurers recognized the issues and needs of LGBT patients.\n\nIn September, Denver hosted two national meetings of LGBT-oriented organizations. For the first time, the GLMA \u2014 which has dropped the more formal Gay and Lesbian Medical Association \u2014 convened in Colorado to discuss advances in healthcare for LGBT people. That discussion included work being done to reduce HIV infections in the city by 50 percent over the last seven to eight years. That work is being led by Dr. Mark Thrun, the director of both the HIV/STD Prevention and Control program and the Denver Prevention Training Center for the city health department.\n\nAmerican Veterans for Equal Rights held its national convention in Denver for the third time to discuss LGBT rights and issues in the military.\n\nOn the other hand, in 2006 Colorado voters approved a constitutional amendment that effectively banned same-sex marriage.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "civil unions,equality,gay rights,LGBT issues", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "The Human Rights Campaign gave Denver a high score, but Colorado Springs got the equivalent of a D-plus in a nationwide report released Monday.", "title": "Colorado cities score average 78 out of 100 for LGBT equality", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2013/11/19/denver-scores-99-out-of-100-for-lgbt-equality-colorado-springs-gets-60/102707/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2013/11/20130501__cd01civilunions1p1-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Human Rights Campaign gave Denver a high score, but Colorado Springs got the equivalent of a D-plus in a nationwide report released Monday.", "title": "Denver scores 99 out of 100 for LGBT equality, Boulder 87 and Colorado Springs a D-plus", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2013/11/19/denver-scores-99-out-of-100-for-lgbt-equality-colorado-springs-gets-60/102707/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2013/11/20130501__cd01civilunions1p1-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@joeybunch", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Human Rights Campaign gave Denver a high score, but Colorado Springs got the equivalent of a D-plus in a nationwide report released Monday."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde836\"", "article_summary": "Aurora scored 66, and Colorado Springs managed just 60 points, giving the state an average of 78 points, one point below the national average.\nOn a scale of 100, Denver scored an impressive 99.\n\u201cHere in Colorado, state and city leaders are taking critical steps to protect LGBT Coloradans and their families,\u201d said Jon Monteith, spokesman for One Colorado, the state\u2019s leading LGBT advocacy organization.\nWhen the Human Rights Campaign and the Equality Federation Institute graded equal rights in four Colorado cities, the state scored the equivalent of a C-Plus, according to the organization\u2019s annual Municipal Equality Index released Tuesday.\nCity Councilwoman Robin Kniech, the city\u2019s first openly gay city council member, elected in 2011."}
