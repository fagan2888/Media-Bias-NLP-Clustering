The Energy Department is reviewing applications for exports on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis, he said.\n\nReview Factors\n\nSeparately, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said Russia\u2019s ability to use its energy resources to influence nations like Ukraine may play a role in the U.S. department\u2019s review of the more than 20 applications to export natural gas.\n\nGeopolitics and the effects on global markets are factors the department weighs when determining whether such an export application is in the national interest, Moniz said yesterday at a Bloomberg Government breakfast.\n\nTalbott, asked about lifting the ban on crude oil exports for pressure on Russia\u2019s oil-dependent economy, said: \u201cYes, but as with pretty much all of the economic sanctions, they are intended to have a punishing effect on Russia, to make Putin pay a cost. But there are going to be costs for us as well.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. sanctions against Russia are \u201cpart of a chess game that\u2019s now going to be played out,\u201d Talbott said. Yet \u201cthis has been a one-man show. I don\u2019t think since Stalin was in the Kremlin has there ever been a single individual who could do something like this entirely on his own.\u201d\n\nThe era of Russian leaders such as Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin is over, Talbott added.\n\n\u2018New Ballgame\u2019\n\n\u201cWe now have overtly and pugnaciously a leader in the Kremlin who does not believe that the fundamentals of the U.S.- Russian relationship and the relationship between Russia and the West is one of partnership. He sees it as adversarial and competitive,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a new ballgame.\u201d\n\nOn the domestic front, Furman gave modestly optimistic assessments for the future of the U.S. unemployment rate and health-care premiums under the Affordable Care Act. In accordance with projections in Obama\u2019s fiscal 2015 budget plan, Furman said the jobless rate, which was 6.7 percent in February, should drop during this year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a new forecast,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019d expect it to continue to fall from where it is today.\u201d\n\nSeizing on a recent Congressional Budget Office report that insurance premiums under the president\u2019s health-care law will be 15 percent lower than the agency initially projected, Furman declined to say whether rates will rise for consumers -- only that they won\u2019t be as high as the estimates.\n\n\u2018Way Lower\u2019\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re already way, way lower than we would have thought they\u2019d be,\u201d he said. \u201cI look for premiums continuing to be below what was originally projected,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe insurance companies will be setting their premiums.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s little common ground between Obama and congressional Republicans on implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Furman called Camp\u2019s proposal to revamp the tax code a \u201cconstructive\u201d addition to the long-running debate over how to adjust corporate tax rules.\n\n\u201cThere certainly have been conversations,\u201d between Camp and the administration since the plan\u2019s release, Furman said.\n\nThough he\u2019s close to Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary and National Economic Council director who had been in competition with Yellen for the Fed chairmanship, Furman said Obama\u2019s choice for the post has handled herself well.\n\nYellen is \u201cdoing just a terrific job,\u201d Furman said. \u201cWe knew how qualified she was when she was picked.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jonathan Allen", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-21/furman-says-crimean-crisis-could-affect-u-s-economy", "title": "Furman Says Crimean Crisis Could Affect U.S. Economy", "description": "The geopolitical crisis in Ukraine may have an impact on the U.S. economy, the chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers said.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Jonathan Allen", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Barack H Obama,Vladimir Putin,Ukraine,Russia,Strobe Talbott,U.S. Economy,Jason Furman", "news_keywords": "Barack H Obama,Vladimir Putin,Ukraine,Russia,Strobe Talbott,U.S. Economy,Jason Furman", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-21/furman-says-crimean-crisis-could-affect-u-s-economy", "parsely-title": "Furman Says Crimean Crisis Could Affect U.S. Economy", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-03-22T04:00:45.000Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The geopolitical crisis in Ukraine may have an impact on the U.S. economy, the chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers said.", "parsely-tags": "Barack H Obama,Vladimir Putin,Ukraine,Russia,Strobe Talbott,U.S. Economy,Jason Furman,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-03-22T04:00:45.000Z", "parsely-section": "world", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-21/furman-says-crimean-crisis-could-affect-u-s-economy", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "The geopolitical crisis in Ukraine may have an impact on the U.S. economy, the chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers said.", "title": "Furman Says Crimean Crisis Could Affect U.S. Economy"}, "fb": {"status": "The geopolitical crisis in Ukraine may have an impact on the U.S. economy, the chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers said."}, "parsely-post-id": "N2SKX26KLVS101", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "The geopolitical crisis in Ukraine may have an impact on the U.S. economy, the chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers said.\n\u201cThere certainly have been conversations,\u201d between Camp and the administration since the plan\u2019s release, Furman said.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cappetite is unsated,\u201d Strobe Talbott, a former deputy secretary of state, said in an interview on the same program.\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly monitoring that situation closely, and there\u2019s a range of things that affect our economy, and that could certainly be one of them,\u201d Jason Furman said in an interview for Bloomberg Television\u2019s \u201cPolitical Capital with Al Hunt\u201d airing this weekend.\nIn accordance with projections in Obama\u2019s fiscal 2015 budget plan, Furman said the jobless rate, which was 6.7 percent in February, should drop during this year."}
