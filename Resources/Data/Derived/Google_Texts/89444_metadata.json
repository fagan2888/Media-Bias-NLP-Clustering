Actually, the Obama administration doubled down on their support, saying that a $1 million grant from Obamacare is headed their way.\n\n\u201cThe way you make a law in this country, the Congress has to pass it, the president has to sign it,\u201d McConnell said in an interview with Kentucky TV station WYMT, conceding that there is no plan for the Senate to act.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s made it very clear he\u2019s not going to sign any bill that includes defunding of Planned Parenthood,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cSo that\u2019s another issue that awaits a new president, hopefully with a different point of view about Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nThe media has managed to ignore the videos by Center for Medical Progress, offering up supporters to tout the women\u2019s health services that would be hurt by cuts in funding.\n\nThe Obama administration on Wednesday awarded more than $1 million in grants to Planned Parenthood to help promote Obamacare, a move that is drawing GOP criticism at a time when the healthcare provider is under congressional investigation.\n\nRep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) blasted the White House\u2019s decision as \u201cunconscionable\u201d in light of allegations of illegal activity in the health provider\u2019s fetal tissue program, which has prompted key Republicans to call for a total defunding of the organization.\n\n\u201cA growing body of evidence suggests that Planned Parenthood broke federal law and now the Obama administration is thumbing its nose at Congress and taxpayers by using this backdoor maneuver to boost funding for the scandal-ridden abortion giant,\u201d Black wrote in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe Obama administration on Wednesday announced nearly $70 million in federal grants to groups promoting the healthcare law. The grants will go to 100 groups in 34 states, including three Planned Parenthood affiliates.\n\nThe provider\u2019s affiliates in Iowa, Missouri and Montana will receive about $1 million in total.\n\nGrants were also awarded to groups like the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, AIDS Alabama and Oak Hill Missionary Baptist Church Ministries. Any organization that helps sign people up for Obamacare can apply for the grants, which can be used to help train navigators and promote the law generally.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Navigator grantees will help expand access to local help in many states,\u201d the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services wrote in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"url": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/mitch-mcconnell-excuses-away-defunding-planned-parenthood-grant-money-from-obamacare-revealed-49868/", "image": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Mitch-McConnell_DonkeyHotey.png", "type": "website", "title": "Mitch McConnell excuses away defunding Planned Parenthood, grant money from Obamacare revealed"}, "google-translate-customization": "7236b401605984b1-3bcbee0db8307092-g6f41da462829b1d2-19", "keywords": "Christian News, Religion News, 2016 Election, Outbreak News, Weird News, Movie News, US News, Breaking News, Internet News, Google News", "msvalidate.01": "F9A11A184D618AB8623122584A1DAB2D", "google-site-verification": "iI9n62s9s0Z-wJUY9p3-wGZp6AQYcH-Z1tDba2QiaT0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe president\u2019s made it very clear he\u2019s not going to sign any bill that includes defunding of Planned Parenthood,\u201d McConnell said.\nActually, the Obama administration doubled down on their support, saying that a $1 million grant from Obamacare is headed their way.\nWhile Republicans, pro-lifers and many who are just shocked by the Planned Parenthood videos, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered up the excuse of \u201cnot enough votes\u201d to not pursue defunding the abortion group after the outrage spreads.\nThe grants will go to 100 groups in 34 states, including three Planned Parenthood affiliates.\nThe Obama administration on Wednesday announced nearly $70 million in federal grants to groups promoting the healthcare law."}
