The state see-sawed in presidential contests.\n\nThe last two years, though, have been particularly eventful.\n\nIn 2013, after Democrats seized control of the statehouse under Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, lawmakers went on a spree, passing a liberal wish list that thrilled left-leaning constituents but alienated plenty of others, especially rural conservatives upset by a brace of gun-control measures adopted after the July 2012 Aurora theater massacre.\n\nThe result, just a few months later, was a nationally publicized recall that ended in the ouster of two Democratic lawmakers, one of them president of the state Senate.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, in a little-noticed footnote to Colorado\u2019s closely watched gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races, the Democrats won back both of those seats, and it wasn\u2019t at all close in either Pueblo or Colorado Springs.\n\nAt the time, the recall was trumpeted far and wide as a victory for pro-gun activists; a third state senator in the Denver suburbs quit soon after rather than face the prospect of being tossed from office before this year\u2019s elections.\n\nNow it\u2019s gun-control activists who are crowing.\n\nMark Glaze, former executive director of the group Everytown for Gun Safety, said the results showed that when a significant portion of the electorate turns out, rather than a small, agitated minority, support for something like universal background checks for gun buyers is a politically winning position. (That was part of the package Hickenlooper, who was reelected Tuesday, signed into law.)\n\n\n\n\u201cThe message remains that the [National Rifle Association] can bully politicians or buy them for a few pieces of silver but they have no influence over the general public,\u201d Glaze said.\n\n\u201cInteresting statement from a man who doles out money the way he does,\u201d replied Laura Carno, a conservative strategist in Colorado Springs who helped lead the recall effort against then-State Senate President John Morse. The reference was to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose generous contributions and organization, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, became an issue in the recall.\n\nOnce in Denver, the state capital, the Republicans who replaced the two booted Democrats joined efforts to overturn the state\u2019s background check requirement, as well as a new law limiting the size of gun magazines to 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nBoth attempts failed but not before the Republican who replaced Morse, Bernie Herpin, rather indelicately suggested it was \u201cmaybe a good thing\u201d that accused killer James Holmes showed up at the Aurora theater with a 100-round magazine \u201cbecause it jammed.\u201d\n\n\"If he had four, five, six 15-round magazines, there\u2019s no telling how much damage he could have done until a good guy with a gun showed up,\" Herpin said.\n\nThe remark caused great upset, not least for relatives of the Aurora victims, but didn\u2019t necessarily damage Herpin\u2019s reelection chances. Strategists on both sides say gun issues played little role in this fall\u2019s campaign, in either Pueblo or Colorado Springs.\n\nAllies of Morse did, however, take particular pleasure in Herpin\u2019s defeat by Democrat Michael Merrifield, who once worked for Bloomberg\u2019s anti-gun group.\n\nAs for the former lawmaker, his feeling is less a sense of vindication than an attitude of I-told-you so.\n\nHe noted that both Senate districts are heavily Democratic and even the relatively meager turnout for Tuesday\u2019s midterm election far exceeded the 20% of voters who cast ballots in the September 2013 recall vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, yeah, of course,\u201d Morse said in a telephone interview from Denver, where he opened a certified public accounting practice. \u201cWe were always going to take back that seat and we did.\u201d\n\nMorse had been scheduled to leave office under term limits in January 2015.\n\n\u201cI had an eight-year contract, in two four-year increments. The voters let me out after seven years,\u201d he said. He professed no regrets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I did what I did,\u201d Morse said of his support for the gun legislation.\n\nAs for Herpin, he called during a break in a Republican caucus luncheon, where lawmakers were awaiting a count of votes in suburban Adams County to learn which party will control the Senate starting next year.\n\nHe expressed no regrets either. \u201cIt was an honor to serve,\u201d Herpin said of his relatively brief Senate term, adding it was too soon to say whether he will run again in 2016.\n\nDon't wait for the next special election to follow @markzbarabak for more on national & Western politics", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "In a turnabout, Colorado Democrats win back seats lost in gun recall", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Few states have experienced the political volatility that Colorado has over the last two decades.", "title": "In a turnabout, Colorado Democrats win back seats lost in gun recall", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-colorado-gun-recall-midterm-election-20141107-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-545d6ff8/turbine/la-pn-colorado-gun-recall-midterm-election-20141107", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Guns, Gun Control, 2nd Amendment, Colorado Politics, State Legislatures, Midterm Election, Michael Bloomberg", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81911397", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-11-09", "Description": "Few states have experienced the political volatility that Colorado has over the last two decades.
