The primary GMO crops include genetically engineered corn, soy, canola, cotton, and sugar beets, which make their way into just about all grocery products sold in the U.S.\n\nMore than 64 other countries, including the entire EU, China, Russia, Japan, Brazil, and elsewhere, require mandatory labeling of genetically engineered or GMO foods.\n\nAdvertisement In Colorado, anti-labeling forces have pumped nearly $17 million into the state to try to defeat a grassroots initiative with less than $1 million in funding. These corporations trying to kill Prop. 105 include just a handful of out-of-state, multinational pesticide and junk food companies like Monsanto, Pepsico, Kraft Foods, General Mills, and Smuckers.\n\nIn my restaurants, Colterra and SALT, I have taken extra steps to ensure my menu is non-GMO. Together, Colorado families can make a big change \u2014 one that can affect truth in labeling across the country \u2014 by voting Yes on 105. It's time for all of us to take responsibility for our broken food system and make a change with every purchase, and it starts Nov. 4.\n\nFor more information, visit righttoknowcolorado.org.\n\nBradford Heap\n\nBoulder", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_26838470/bradford-heap-vote-yes-prop-105-gmo-labels", "modificationDate": "2014-10-31T15:57:14-0600", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Letters to the editor", "endDate": "2024-11-01T01:00:00-0600", "description": "As a Coloradan, chef, and restaurateur committed to farm-to-table quality, integrity, taste, health, and the environment, I encourage Coloradans to vote yes on Proposition 105 this November to require the mandatory labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in foods sold in Colorado.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26838470:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-01T01:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_26838470/bradford-heap-vote-yes-prop-105-gmo-labels", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "As a Coloradan, chef, and restaurateur committed to farm-to-table quality, integrity, taste, health, and the environment, I encourage Coloradans to vote yes on Proposition 105 this November to require the mandatory labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in foods sold in Colorado.", "title": "Bradford Heap: Vote yes on Prop. 105, GMO labels"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "As a Coloradan, chef, and restaurateur committed to farm-to-table quality, integrity, taste, health, and the environment, I encourage Coloradans to vote yes on Proposition 105 this November to require the mandatory labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in foods sold in Colorado.", "title": "Bradford Heap: Vote yes on Prop. 105, GMO labels", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_26838470/bradford-heap-vote-yes-prop-105-gmo-labels", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-01T01:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Bradford Heap: Vote yes on Prop. 105, GMO labels", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2014-10-31T15:58:16-0600", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b3c\"", "article_summary": "Together, Colorado families can make a big change \u2014 one that can affect truth in labeling across the country \u2014 by voting Yes on 105.\n105 include just a handful of out-of-state, multinational pesticide and junk food companies like Monsanto, Pepsico, Kraft Foods, General Mills, and Smuckers.\nAs a Coloradan, chef, and restaurateur committed to farm-to-table quality, integrity, taste, health, and the environment, I encourage Coloradans to vote yes on Proposition 105 this November to require the mandatory labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in foods sold in Colorado.\nIn my restaurants, Colterra and SALT, I have taken extra steps to ensure my menu is non-GMO.\nThe primary GMO crops include genetically engineered corn, soy, canola, cotton, and sugar beets, which make their way into just about all grocery products sold in the U.S.More than 64 other countries, including the entire EU, China, Russia, Japan, Brazil, and elsewhere, require mandatory labeling of genetically engineered or GMO foods."}
