FOREST, Miss. (AP) - Longtime Scott County Tax Assessor-Collector Myra Murrell Davis has announced she will not run for re-election this year and plans to retire in June.

Davisâ€™ retirement means the board of supervisors will make an interim appointment until a new collector-assessor is elected and takes office in January.

Party primaries are in August and the general election is Nov. 3.

Davis was first elected in 1997 fulfilling the unexpired term of Otis Wolverton and was re-elected to four times.

She served as president of the Mississippi Assessors and Collectors Association for 2013-2014.

Davis tells the Scott County Times (http://bit.ly/14fKhnf ) she is happy local residents can now buy car tags and pay their taxes online.
