By Ernie Smith / Aug 25, 2015\n\nForthcoming regulations for personal trainers in the District of Columbia have many in the industry\u2014particularly those affiliated with CrossFit\u2014concerned about the long-term effects of the new rules. But a coalition of trainer groups is supporting the regulations.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s capital, a set of potential regulations could shake up the personal training industry\u2014and one popular firm in the space wants to ensure it doesn\u2019t get muscled out.\n\nThat company, CrossFit, is one of the fastest growing firms in the exercise industry, thanks to aggressive franchising and a well-nurtured online community. CrossFit has been particularly successful in the Washington, DC, region, where more than 100 CrossFit training facilities are located.\n\nCrossFit\u2019s success comes at a time when pressure is growing to regulate personal training for the first time, driven in part by provisions in the Affordable Care Act that call for more emphasis on wellness and nutrition programs. As those programs grow, so do proposals to regulate the companies that provide those services\u2014and last year, the District of Columbia became the first jurisdiction to pass a law calling for such rules to be created.\n\nAs DC\u2019s Board of Physical Therapy attempts to finalize the rules, CrossFit and other fitness companies are threatening legal action to stop them, according to The Washington Post. Part of the issue, critics say, is that personal training is not a one-size-fits-all field.\n\n\u201cThis will affect everyone because \u2018fitness\u2019 is a nebulous term. That\u2019s why we have so many pathways to achieve it \u2026 we all respond differently to exercise and we all have different factors in our lives that come into play in trying to attain it,\u201d said Philip Godfrey, a medical exercise specialist quoted by the Post.\n\nCrossFit\u2019s Challengers\n\nBut some organizations in the sports and fitness space say regulations are needed to create uniform standards for the profession and protect consumers.\n\nThe Coalition for the Registration of Exercise Professionals (CREP)\u2014which includes the American Council on Exercise, the National Strength and Conditioning Association, the American College of Sports Medicine, and a number of other industry groups\u2014is arguing in favor of uniform standards for exercise professionals. The group, which launched last year, already maintains the U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals (USREPS) and has worked closely with the DC government on the bill.\n\nThe group says the regulations \u201cwill provide an appropriate level of consumer protection while preserving access to exercise programming, enhance the level of professionalism for the personal fitness trainer, containing costs and assisting consumers in differentiating between the personal fitness, athletic training, and physical therapy professions.\u201d\n\nIn comments to the Post, CREP board president Graham Melstrand emphasized that \u201cthe purpose of the law is to enhance consumer protection for the residents of the District of Columbia.\u201d\n\nBut critics, including those associated with CrossFit, see things differently. The company\u2019s blog, The Russells, has closely followed the case and at times has questioned the industry groups\u2019 motives. And Nicole Carroll, CrossFit\u2019s director of certification and training, wrote a letter to the Post, implying that the more traditional industry is attempting to push up-and-comers out.\n\n\u201cFor those in the Exercise Industrial Complex, the fear of disruptive competition explains why they want to make the District the first jurisdiction in the nation to regulate fitness programs, promoting a solution in search of a problem,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe DC Board of Physical Therapy is expected to release the rules next month.\n\nShare this article", "article_metadata": {"description": "Forthcoming regulations for personal trainers from the District of Columbia have many in the industry\u2014particularly those affiliated with CrossFit\u2014concerned.", "pocket-site-verification": "f7059b70f081a1e1ced322fc1d9787", "og": {"site_name": "Associations Now", "description": "Forthcoming regulations for personal trainers from the District of Columbia have many in the industry\u2014particularly those affiliated with CrossFit\u2014concerned.", "title": "CrossFit, Groups Fight Over DC Personal Trainer Regulations", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/0825_crossfit.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-26T00:53:02+00:00", "url": "http://associationsnow.com/2015/08/real-stretch-crossfit-trainer-groups-disagree-dc-personal-trainer-regulations/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Associations Now", "description": "Forthcoming regulations for personal trainers from the District of Columbia have many in the industry\u2014particularly those affiliated with CrossFit\u2014concerned.", "title": "CrossFit, Groups Fight Over DC Personal Trainer Regulations", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/0825_crossfit.jpg", "creator": "@associationsnow", "site": "@associationsnow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 502961619}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AssociationsNow", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2015-08-25T21:00:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-26T00:53:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Money & Business, Personal Trainer"}, "article_summary": "CrossFit, Trainer Groups Disagree on DC Personal Trainer Regulations AND What's this?\nCrossFit has been particularly successful in the Washington, DC, region, where more than 100 CrossFit training facilities are located.\nPart of the issue, critics say, is that personal training is not a one-size-fits-all field.\nThat company, CrossFit, is one of the fastest growing firms in the exercise industry, thanks to aggressive franchising and a well-nurtured online community.\nIn the nation\u2019s capital, a set of potential regulations could shake up the personal training industry\u2014and one popular firm in the space wants to ensure it doesn\u2019t get muscled out."}
