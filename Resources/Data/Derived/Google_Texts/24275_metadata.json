But in his bid for Maryland governor, Douglas F. Gansler, never one to hold his tongue, has dismissed outright his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, saying in an interview that he\u201cclearly does not have the management experience or a record.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would literally be like taking a season-ticket holder out of the stands at the Orioles or the Nationals, who\u2019s been watching for seven years, and asking them to go out and pitch against the Yankees,\u201d Gansler said of Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown.\n\nIn the interview Thursday, Gansler, the state\u2019s attorney general, called Brown an \u201cemperor with no clothes\u201d repeatedly and said that he is being propped up by the state\u2019s Democratic establishment.\n\nWhen asked if Brown, a Harvard-educated lawyer who represented Prince George\u2019s County in the legislature and is an Iraq War veteran, is qualified to be governor, Gansler said: \u201cHe\u2019s a resident of Maryland. He\u2019s old enough to be governor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a democracy,\u201d Gansler said at another point. \u201cAnbody\u2019s allowed to run.\u201d\n\nBrown declined to respond directly, and his campaign referred questions to Del. Dereck E. Davis (D-Prince George\u2019s), a supporter and former legislative colleague.\n\n\u201cTo be blunt, this smacks of desperation,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAnthony is a decorated Iraq veteran. He served in leadership in the House of Delegates and, for the past seven years, has been the second highest-ranking official in the state. To suggest that these experiences do not qualify him for governor is preposterous. The people of Maryland deserve a better debate than this.\u201d\n\nGansler\u2019s comments came in a free-wheeling interview after a chance meeting with a Washington Post reporter in the House of Delegates office building in Annapolis. Gansler was making the rounds after attending the final State of the State address of Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D).\n\nIt was not the first time Gansler has suggested that Brown is a lightweight. Gansler makes a habit of speaking bluntly, which many find refreshing but has sparked controversy in the past.\n\nIn August, Gansler found himself tying to explain secretly recorded remarks to campaign volunteers, in which he suggested that Brown was relying on his race to get elected.\n\n\u201cI mean, right now his campaign slogan is, \u2018Vote for me. I want to be the first African American governor of Maryland,\u2019 \u201d Gansler told the group. \u201cThat\u2019s a laudable goal, but you need a second sentence: \u2018Because here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done, and here\u2019s why I\u2019ve done it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn his run for governor, Gansler has cast himself as the ideas candidate, and he has rolled out more policy proposals than anyone else in the race, which includes Del. Heather R. Mizeur (Montgomery), another rival for the Democratic nomination.\n\nBut more recently, Gansler\u2019s campaign has been focusing on the \u201cwoefully disastrous\u201d rollout of Maryland\u2019s online health insurance exchange. Brown had a leadership role in implementing health-care reform in Maryland.\n\nAsked last week why he is spending so much time talking about the health exchange, Gansler first said: \u201cThis is affecting real people. Real people are being denied access to health-care coverage.\u201d\n\nBut he acknowledged another reason. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act rollout has truly exposed the emperor who has no clothes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one example we have of [Brown\u2019s] management skills has been brought to light.\u201d\n\nGansler \u2014 who boasted of his own \u201crecord of getting things done\u201d \u2014 said it is not surprising that Brown would be ill-prepared to lead a major initiative.\n\n\u201cThe lieutenant governor has never managed any people, more than the four or five people on his staff, and basically has been absent from any governance,\u201d Gansler said.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s interview, Gansler expressed little hope that other state politicians in Annapolis would get to the bottom of what went wrong with the health-care exchange. Among the dozens of fellow Democrats who have endorsed Brown are O\u2019Malley, House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller (D-Calvert).\n\n\u201cThe entrenched political establishment is all lined up behind the lieutenant governor,\u201d Gansler said. \u201cSo no one is going to be willing to look behind the curtain. . . .The emperor-has-no-clothes analogy is quite fitting because the entrenched politicians want a coronation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "maryland politics, maryland 2014 governor's race, doug gansler, anthony brown", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Attorney General Douglas F.
