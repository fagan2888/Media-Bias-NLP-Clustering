I think our New Jersey guys certainly held their own tonight.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown stole the show going undefeated at 2-0 with a 5-3 victory over Dartmouth and a 4-1 triumph over Yale but Princeton coachwas pleased with what the inaugural Liberty Invitational brought to local hockey.\n\n\"I thought all four games were hard-fought battles,\" Prier said. \"For young kids to come here and see these guys, this caliber of hockey, hopefully it's exciting. You've got some of the best hockey programs in the world right here.\"\n\nDown 3-1 to Yale late in the third period, Princeton cut the deficit in half when Andrew Ammon scored with eight seconds remaining in regulation. It would be as close as Princeton would get, however.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We showed pretty good resilience in the win Friday night. It was a gutsy win and a great start to the year,\" Prier said.\n\nMichael Ambrosia, an All-State forward at Delbarton, did not skate for Princeton due to a lower body injury but was thrilled to make it back to \"The Rock.\"\n\n\"In terms of this venue, it's an awesome facility,\" Ambrosia, who won three NJSIAA Non-Public titles at Delbarton, said. \"We continue to be thankful to the New Jersey Devils and what they do for local hockey. We really enjoyed this and look forward to coming back the next couple of years.\n\n\"There are so many paths you can take in the game but high school hockey in New Jersey is one right here you can take to get to the next level,\" Ambrosia added.\n\nKenny Agostino echoed his former teammate's sentiments.\n\n\"I saw a lot of great hockey out there. It was a fun weekend,\" Agostino said. \"Pulling up to the arena you can't help but not think about the high school days, winning three state championships on this ice. It was real cool to see.\"\n\nAgostino and his Yale teammates will return to New Haven next weekend and lift a banner commemorating its first-ever NCAA Frozen Four championship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Coming back after a rough loss last night this was a great testament to this team's character,\" Agostino said. \"We have to build off this. We're heading back home next weekend to raise our banner.\"\n\n\"We've got a lot of young guys. We need to grow as a hockey team,\" Allain said. \"I think we took a step forward from last night but we are still a long way from where we need to be.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh School Stars to Shine at inaugural Liberty Invitational\n\n\n\nLocal Hockey Represents at 2013 NHL Draft\n\n\n\nSpotlight on New Jersey: 2013 NHL Draft\n\n\n\nAgostino, Killian Orzetti help Yale capture NCAA Frozen Four National Title\n\nEmail JC Hageny\n\nFollow JC Hageny on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "boys-hockey-feed,boys-ice-hockey-feed,girls-ice-hockey-feed,ice-hockey-feed", "title": "Hockey: Brockett leads Princeton in OT; Beattie, Agostino star for Yale at Liberty Invitational", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Hockey: Brockett leads Princeton in OT; Beattie, Agostino star for Yale at Liberty Invitational \", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/hssports/blog/boysicehockey/index.ssf/2013/10/hockey_yale_princeton.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/boys_ice_hockey_blog/photo/photojpg-0c234d46b21a69fc.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11513481\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-27T02:12:17Z\", \"author\": \"John Christian Hageny/For The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"boys-hockey-feed\",\"boys-ice-hockey-feed\",\"girls-ice-hockey-feed\",\"ice-hockey-feed\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/boys_ice_hockey_blog/photo/13655325-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@JCCSPORTS", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Local stars return to skate on Prudential Center ice"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, October 27, 2013, 11:25 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/boys_ice_hockey_blog/photo/photojpg-0c234d46b21a69fc.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"jhageny\", \"author_nickname\": \"John Christian Hageny/For The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"2782\", \"source_blog_name\": \"High School Boys Ice Hockey Blog\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/hssports/blog/boysicehockey/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Local stars return to skate on Prudential Center ice", "title": "Hockey: Brockett leads Princeton in OT; Beattie, Agostino star for Yale at Liberty Invitational", "url": "http://www.nj.com/hssports/blog/boysicehockey/index.ssf/2013/10/hockey_yale_princeton.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, October 26, 2013,  8:23 PM", "article_author": "John Christian Hageny/For The Star-Ledger", "Description": "Local stars return to skate on Prudential Center ice"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbaa9\"", "article_summary": "\"Matt scored his first goal for Yale, Kenny Agostino was a threat and Matt Killian (Delbarton) did his job for us.\nIt was a fun weekend,\" Agostino said.\nAgostino and his Yale teammates will return to New Haven next weekend and lift a banner commemorating its first-ever NCAA Frozen Four championship.\nBrown stole the show going undefeated at 2-0 with a 5-3 victory over Dartmouth and a 4-1 triumph over Yale but Princeton coachwas pleased with what the inaugural Liberty Invitational brought to local hockey.\n\"Coming back after a rough loss last night this was a great testament to this team's character,\" Agostino said."}
