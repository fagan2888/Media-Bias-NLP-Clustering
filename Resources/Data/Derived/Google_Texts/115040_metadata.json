Typically, the DOL gives employers short notice to prepare for an on-site visit to review company records, interview staff members and executives, and may even record what employment posters are on-site. According to a recent industry study, 75 percent of audits resulted in penalties and required costly corrective action.\n\nRambo, MSM, PHR, SHRM-CP, specializes in strategic planning, compliance and human capital management. For more than 20 years, Rambo has held numerous senior level management positions where he led operational, finance and human resource functions for public and private companies. Rambo is the HRCI State Certification Director for the Arizona SHRM State Council, responsible for statewide professional and training certification efforts.\n\nThe free one-hour webinar is on Wednesday, May 4 from 11 a.m. \u2013 12 p.m. EST.
