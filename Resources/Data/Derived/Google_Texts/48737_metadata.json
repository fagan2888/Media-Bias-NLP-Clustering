Senate panel delays email privacy vote amid concerns MORE (R-Iowa) and other sponsors of the Patent Act unveiled a managers' amendment to the bill on Tuesday night that will be taken up at Thursday's markup.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe overall legislation is aimed at combating what industry groups say is growing abuse of the legal system, with so-called patent trolls buying up patents solely to extract settlements. The bill makes a number of changes to the legal procedures of patent trials.\n\nBut industries like biotechnology and pharmaceuticals have raised concerns about a different kind of alleged abuse taking place at the trial-like proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), which were set up after Congress last passed a patent bill in 2011.\n\nThose proceedings at the PTO \u2014 known as post grant and inter partes reviews \u2014 were meant to offer a faster and cheaper way to challenge the validity of a patent. Supporters say the proceedings are important to weed out weak or vague patents.\n\nBut critics and some lawmakers have said those proceedings are skewed too far against patent owners. They have also claimed that hedge funds use the proceedings to short stocks.\n\nThe amendment would also make a number of changes to the underlying text, including to a contentious provision on fee shifting. The amendment is meant to relieve some of the burden on universities, inventors and commercial lenders \u2014 who could be left on the hook for trolls' legal bills.\n\n\"Let me make clear that if we succeed, no one will get everything they want,\" Grassley said last month.\n\nMany large technology companies have teamed with retailers to push to crack down on patent trolls this Congress.\n\nBut pharmaceutical firms, biotechnology companies and universities have been wary of skewing too far against individual patent holders. Large patent holders like Qualcomm have also opposed broad reform.\n\nLawmakers in both chambers have been doing a delicate dance to satisfy concerns from multiple industries, all of which use patents in vastly different ways. Reform passed out of the House last Congress but stalled in the Senate under then-Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).\n\nAmong other things, the amendment unveiled Tuesday night would change the claims construction standard used in PTO proceedings to better reflect district courts, and would give the PTO director the ability to veto a proceeding.\n\nThe amendment would allow patent owners to submit evidence at the outset and would ensure multiple panels hear the case at different stages.\n\nIt would also make clear that at the outset of proceedings, patents are presumed to be valid. Senators said they are still working on a provision regarding the ability for patent holders to amend patent claims during the proceedings.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Senate Judiciary Committee will mark up the bill Thursday.", "description": "The Senate Judiciary Committee will mark up the bill Thursday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Senate Judiciary Committee will mark up the bill Thursday.", "title": "Senate panel considers key changes to patent overhaul", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/243860-senate-patent-bill-heading-for-changes", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-03T12:10:17-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-06-03T12:10-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/243860-senate-patent-bill-heading-for-changes", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-03T09:12-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Patent reform, Patent trolls, PATENT Act, Senate Judiciary Committee,Chuck Grassley,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-03T09:12:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-03T12:10:17-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/243860-senate-patent-bill-heading-for-changes", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Senate Judiciary Committee will mark up the bill Thursday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate panel considers key changes to patent overhaul"}, "dcterms.title": "Senate panel considers key changes to patent overhaul"}, "article_summary": "Senators said they are still working on a provision regarding the ability for patent holders to amend patent claims during the proceedings.\nMany large technology companies have teamed with retailers to push to crack down on patent trolls this Congress.\nBut pharmaceutical firms, biotechnology companies and universities have been wary of skewing too far against individual patent holders.\nIt would also make clear that at the outset of proceedings, patents are presumed to be valid.\nLarge patent holders like Qualcomm have also opposed broad reform."}
