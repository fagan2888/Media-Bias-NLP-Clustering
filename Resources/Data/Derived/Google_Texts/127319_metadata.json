Rand Paul, R-Ky., is the leader of the GOP presidential pack right now. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nWriter Andrew Prokop of the new Vox venture takes issue with The Run 2016\u2019s GOP front-runner: Rand Paul.\n\nHere\u2019s the rebuttal to detail why he fails to make his case.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: There is a case to be made that Paul isn\u2019t the front-runner. One could point to polls and say it is Mike Huckabee, or cite current establishment buzz and make the case for Jeb Bush.\n\n[READ: Why Rand\u2019s the Current 2016 GOP Front-Runner]\n\nBut Prokop does neither. Instead, he summons a UCLA political science professor to repeat one of the most recycled and trite lines in politics: These early polls don\u2019t matter.\n\nTo say the numbers aren\u2019t predictive is certainly true. (The Run 2016 expects the front-runner to shift many times between now and when primary voting begins. That\u2019s why there\u2019s The Chase, to track the movement.) But to say the numbers don\u2019t matter in the moment is the equivalent to shunning science.\n\nSure, polls, like pols, are flawed. But it\u2019s the best evidence we\u2019ve got.\n\nProkop notes the swings in polls are taken \u201camong a tiny population of potential voters \u2013 and worse, a population that is unusual in both ideology and enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nTrue, but the actual early primary electorate is also quite small and therefore different from the general electorate.\n\nIn 2012, just over 120,000 Republicans participated in the Iowa caucuses \u2013 meaning a candidate could win it with under 30,000 votes. In the last New Hampshire GOP primary, the number of voters totaled just over 248,000. Only in South Carolina did the pool crack the half million mark. Just over 600,000 trekked to the GOP Palmetto State primary polls in 2012.\n\n[ALSO: How Jeb Bush Became a Contender Again]\n\nAll in total, in a country of 313 million people, under a million people will have a defining impact on selecting the Republican nominee.\n\nSo yes, these polling samples are small, but relatively, so is the universe of people who participate. Additionally, a good chunk \u2013 if not a majority \u2013 of those who will vote are paying attention. That\u2019s what makes them \u201cactivists\u201d or \u201cthe base.\u201d And that\u2019s where one starts in building a coalition.\n\nNext, Prokop cites the \u201cinvisible primary\u201d -- referring to the establishment figures and party poobahs who prize electability and intend to mold the nomination process. Granted, they are important figures to track, but if anything, Prokop ignores the progress Paul has made on that front.\n\nTake how, during a trip to South Carolina last summer, Paul allayed the fears of Rep. Joe Wilson that Paul was weak on national defense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe really did address the concern I had, which was his position relative to national defense. I had a misperception that he did not recognize national defense as a paramount function of government. But he really made it clear tonight he does,\u201d Wilson said in an interview. \u201cHe reiterated something very important to me and to the people of South Carolina: that he is a stalwart of a strong national defense. I was very pleased by his positive comments.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s just one example, but it\u2019s a telling anecdote in how Paul has been courting those far outside his libertarian core.\n\nThis weekend in New Hampshire, Paul will not only star a tea party-aligned rally sponsored by Americans For Prosperity. He\u2019ll also headline two fundraisers on behalf of the New Hampshire Republican State Committee. It doesn\u2019t get more establishment than that.\n\n[MORE: A Rand Run for President in 49 States?]\n\nWhile Prokop points out Paul\u2019s legitimate weaknesses, he simultaneously ignores all the groundwork the senator has done to improve his standing with more traditional GOP constituencies. Paul conducted more early state primary travel in 2013 than any other potential aspirant. It\u2019s counted for something.\n\nFinally, in his article, Prokop notes the roller coaster ride of the 2012 primary, when insurgents like Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich were front-runners of the moment.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly the point. There were multiple front-runners of the moment in 2012 before the voters settled on Mitt Romney.\n\nThis is not a forecast that Paul will be the nominee.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Run 2016 [News]", "title": "How Vox Misses the Mark on Rand Paul", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A writer at Vox takes issue with The Run 2016's GOP front-runner, but ignores Rand Paul's progress.", "title": "How Vox Misses the Mark on Rand Paul", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2014/04/09/how-vox-misses-the-mark-on-rand-paul", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/d8/b6/59ab5e8442d0bf783cde0f345541/140409-randpaul-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "A writer at Vox takes issue with The Run 2016's GOP front-runner, but ignores Rand Paul's progress.", "card": "summary", "title": "How Vox Misses the Mark on Rand Paul"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "April 9, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "David Catanese,2016 presidential election,Paul, Rand,Pulse,The Run 2016 [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A writer at Vox takes issue with The Run 2016's GOP front-runner, but ignores Rand Paul's progress."}, "article_summary": "Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesWriter Andrew Prokop of the new Vox venture takes issue with The Run 2016\u2019s GOP front-runner: Rand Paul.\nEarly polls aren't perfect predictors, but most indicate Sen.
