Marco Rubio, a Florida senator who is Hispanic, denounced them as \u201cnot just offensive and inaccurate, but also divisive,\u201d after declining for two weeks to address the matter directly. Another Hispanic in the race, Ted Cruz, said Trump is \u201cterrific,\u201d \u201dbrash\u201d and \u201cspeaks the truth.\u201d\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nIt\u2019s an uncomfortable moment for Republicans, who want more votes from the surging Latino population.\n\nAnd it could be a costly moment if more candidates don\u2019t go beyond their Donald-will-be-Donald response and condemn him directly, said Alfonso Aguilar, a Republican who leads the American Principles Project\u2019s Latino Partnership.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for the candidates to distance themselves from Trump and call his comments what they are: ludicrous, baseless and insulting,\u201d said Alfonso Aguilar, a Republican who leads the American Principles Project\u2019s Latino Partnership. \u201cSadly, it hurts the party with Hispanic voters. It\u2019s a level of idiocy I haven\u2019t seen in a long time.\u201d\n\nSo far, Trump has paid less of a political price than a commercial one.\n\nThe leading Hispanic television network, Univision, has backed out of televising the Miss USA pageant, a joint venture between Trump and NBC, which also cut ties with Trump. On Wednesday, the Macy\u2019s department store chain, which carried a Donald Trump menswear line, said it was ending its relationship with him. Other retailers are facing pressure to follow suit.\n\nIn his speech last month marking his entry into the Republican race, Trump said Mexican immigrants are \u201cbringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d\n\nVideo by PBS NewsHour\n\nThe businessman has refused to back down, although he insists his remarks were misconstrued.\n\n\u201cMy statements have been contorted to seem racist and discriminatory,\u201d he wrote in a message to supporters on Thursday. \u201cWhat I want is for legal immigrants to not be unfairly punished because others are coming into America illegally, flooding the labor market and not paying taxes.\u201d His original comments, though, did not make a distinction between Mexicans who came to U.S. legally and those here illegally.\n\nHis rhetoric may resonate with some of the Republican Party\u2019s most passionate voters, who have long viewed illegal immigration as one of the nation\u2019s most pressing problems. But the 2016 contest brings opportunity for the party to make inroads with Hispanics, with several Latino candidates and a former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, who has deep Latino ties and speaks Spanish and hasn\u2019t been shy about using it in the campaign.\n\nEven so, Bush has said little more about Trump\u2019s comments than that they were \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have a chance to have an honest discussion about it onstage,\u201d Bush said last weekend while campaigning in Nevada, referring to Republican presidential debates.\n\nRev. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, is paying keen attention to how the candidates respond to Trump\u2019s \u201cxenophobic rhetoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re listening very, very closely, not just what candidates say but what they don\u2019t say \u2014 the sins of commission and the sins of omission,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong 2016 contenders:\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cwholly inappropriate.\u201d But in a subsequent radio interview, he said Trump is \u201ca really wonderful guy (who\u2019s) always been a good friend.\u201d\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Donald Trump\u2019s remarks reflect the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nCruz said he likes Trump and thinks NBC \u201cis engaging in political correctness\u201d in breaking ties with him.\n\nRubio said the next president \u201cneeds to be someone who brings Americans together \u2014 not someone who continues to divide.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former technology executive Carly Fiorina and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson have been silent.\n\nNot since the 2004 re-election campaign of President George W. Bush has a Republican presidential candidate earned as much as 40 percent of the Hispanic vote. Mitt Romney got a dismal 27 percent in the 2012 contest against President Barack Obama.\n\nAssociated Press writers Ken Thomas in Washington, Hillel Italie in New York and Jill Colvin in Ashland, New Hampshire, contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Hispanic leaders are warning of harm to Republican White House hopes unless the party's presidential contenders do more to condemn Donald Trump, a businessman turned presidential candidate who's refusing to apologize for calling Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers.", "pubdate": 20150703, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Hispanic leaders are warning of harm to Republican White House hopes unless the party's presidential contenders do more to condemn Donald Trump, a businessman turned presidential candidate who's refusing to apologize for calling Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers.", "title": "Hispanic leaders urge Republican presidential candidates to condemn Trump", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RTX1DA6M.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/hispanic-leaders-urge-republican-presidential-candidates-condemn-trump/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Hispanic leaders are warning of harm to Republican White House hopes unless the party's presidential contenders do more to condemn Donald Trump, a businessman turned presidential candidate who's refusing to apologize for calling Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers.", "title": "Hispanic leaders urge Republican presidential candidates to condemn Trump", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RTX1DA6M.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Vote 2016"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Ben Carson, Donald Trump, hispanics, immigrants, macys, marco rubio, Mike Huckabee, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Univision, Vote 2016"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Hispanic leaders are bristling at the largely tepid response by Republican presidential candidates to Donald Trump\u2019s characterization of Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers.\nSeveral 2016 contenders have brushed off Trump\u2019s comments while others have ignored them.\nIn his speech last month marking his entry into the Republican race, Trump said Mexican immigrants are \u201cbringing drugs.\nNot since the 2004 re-election campaign of President George W.
