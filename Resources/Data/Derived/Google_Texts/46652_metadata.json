He was Colorado\u2019s finest novelist, the author of \u201cPlainsong\u201d and \u201cEventide\u201d and three other works of fiction set in Holt, a town he created on Colorado\u2019s Eastern Plains. His final work is this slim volume.\n\n\u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d hasn\u2019t the magnitude of Haruf\u2019s previous novels. Instead it\u2019s a lagniappe, a parting gift to readers, filled with strong characters and written in the author\u2019s spare, evocative style. Although \u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d is perhaps half the length of Haruf\u2019s other works, it still packs punch.\n\nAddie, a widow of 70, approaches her widower neighbor, Louis, and asks if he\u2019d like to spend nights with her. She\u2019s not interested in marriage, nor even sex. She\u2019ll sleep better with a man beside her, she tells him, someone to talk to in the dark, someone to wake up with. She hopes she hasn\u2019t shocked Louis.\n\nNo, he says, she hasn\u2019t. After thinking it over, Louis agrees. One night soon afterward, he showers and shaves, then sneaks down the alley, his pajamas in a paper bag, and the two spend the night in bed, talking, sleeping, but not touching. They continue, and when they are both comfortable with the \u201caffair,\u201d Addie tells Louis he might as well leave his pajamas at her house. It will save paper bags, he replies.\n\nHolt, of course, is a small town, and the pair become a source of gossip. At the bakery, a man tells Louis he wishes he had his energy \u201cto stay out all night and then still have enough left over to function the day after.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things I always hear is how any story is safe with you,\u201d Louis replies. \u201cIt goes right in your ears and out your mouth. I wouldn\u2019t want to get the name of a liar and a prevaricator in a little town the size of this one. A reputation like that would just about follow you anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe arrangement turns into a friendship, as the two unburden themselves in the dark, telling of their dreams and successes, their failures and unhappy incidents of the past. Louis had an affair that nearly destroyed his marriage. Addie already knows about it. She tells of the accidental death of her young daughter. The tragedy turned Addie\u2019s husband into a cold and distant man. Louis is surprised, because Addie and her husband always seemed to be a happy couple. They kept up appearances, Addie says.\n\nJust as they settle into their relationship, Addie\u2019s 6-year-old grandson comes to stay with her. Her son\u2019s wife has taken off, and the son is dealing with bankruptcy. The little boy is unhappy, depressed, and he cries in the night. Louis becomes a surrogate grandfather and buys the boy a baseball glove and a dog, and slowly the kid comes out of his shell.\n\nLike Haruf\u2019s other works, \u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d is a simple story, told in a spartan style. It is the characters who populate the Great Plains town of Holt who make the writing profound. Both Addie and Louis are strong, if flawed in little ways. And they see life\u2019s ironies and humor. The book is filled with dry remarks, and Haruf himself adds a bit of humor by placing himself and his previous books in the story:\n\nAddie and Louis talk about the coming season at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n\u201cDid you see they\u2019re going to do that last book about Holt County?\u201d Addie asks. \u201cThe one with the old man dying and the preacher?\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t imagine two old ranchers taking in a pregnant girl, Louis says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his imagination. He took the physical details from Holt, the place names of the streets and what the country looks like and the location of things, but it\u2019s not his town. And it\u2019s not anybody in this town. It\u2019s all made up.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d is a parting gift from the author, a reminder of how profoundly we will miss Holt and its people, and Kent Haruf\u2019s extraordinary writing.\n\nGREAT PLAINS FICTION: NOVEL\n\n\u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d\n\nby Kent Haruf (Knopf)", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Book review: \u201cOur Souls at Night,\u201d Kent Haruf\u2019s last novel", "title": "Book review: \u201cOur Souls at Night,\u201d Kent Haruf\u2019s last novel", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/21/book-review-our-souls-at-night-kent-harufs-last-novel/", "image": {"width": 260, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150521__20150524_E8_BK24REVIEWOURSOULSp2.jpg", "height": 386}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150521__20150524_E8_BK24REVIEWOURSOULSp2.jpg?w=240", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-21T17:34:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T16:23:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd099\"", "article_summary": "Although \u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d is perhaps half the length of Haruf\u2019s other works, it still packs punch.\nThey continue, and when they are both comfortable with the \u201caffair,\u201d Addie tells Louis he might as well leave his pajamas at her house.\nLike Haruf\u2019s other works, \u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d is a simple story, told in a spartan style.\n\u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d hasn\u2019t the magnitude of Haruf\u2019s previous novels.\nIt\u2019s all made up.\u201d\u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d is a parting gift from the author, a reminder of how profoundly we will miss Holt and its people, and Kent Haruf\u2019s extraordinary writing."}
