Forecasts call for a 30 to 40 percent chance of rain around 3 p.m. Saturday. It is not expected to last long.\n\nSanitation crews were busy cleaning up tortillas, marshmallows, beads and Jell-o shots from Greenville Avenue after the parade ended. DART light rail continued to see crowded trains along the Red Line, especially those traveling to the Lovers Lane and Mockingbird Stations.\n\nAs of 3:35 p.m., Dallas police had issued 58 parking citations and made one arrest for public intoxication.\n\nLisa Carmen, from The Burlesque Experience in Dallas, was one of the many people riding floats during Saturday\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade. It was her first year not watching from the sidelines.\n\n\u201cWe had so much fun,\u201d she said. \u201cThe flying tortillas we didn\u2019t like and the flying marshmallows we didn\u2019t like, but other than that it was so much fun. We had a blast.\u201d\n\nThe Burlesque Experience\u2019s float was the culmination of several months of fundraisers and help from the community, Carmen said. They plan to do it again next year.\n\n\u201cWe felt like superstars,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s this feeling of almost celebrity: being able to wave to people and throw beads and people are so happy to see you.\u201d\n\nFeatured events this year include the Mavs Corner at Lovers Lane and Greenville; The Family Place Family Zone, located in the Meadows Building parking lot; and BrewFest in the parking lot of the adjacent Office Depot area for the event space.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAzL25vcnRoLXRleGFucy13ZWxjb21lLXN0LXBhdHJpY2tzLWRheS1wYXJhZGUtd2l0aC1ob290cy1ob2xsZXJzLWFuZC1sb3RzLW9mLWdyZWVuLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Naheed Rajwani", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "[This post will be updated throughout the day.] Staff writer Meredith Shamburger, who rolled through town on a parade float, reports: Dallas prepared for its annual St. Patrick's Day Parade\u2026", "title": "North Texans welcome St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade with hoots, hollers \u2014 and lots of green", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/03/north-texans-welcome-st-patricks-day-parade-with-hoots-hollers-and-lots-of-green.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2015/03/IMG_5216.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-03-14T17:24:18Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}, "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Lisa Carmen, from The Burlesque Experience in Dallas, was one of the many people riding floats during Saturday\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade.\nSanitation crews were busy cleaning up tortillas, marshmallows, beads and Jell-o shots from Greenville Avenue after the parade ended.\nStaff writer Meredith Shamburger, who rolled through town on a parade float, reports:Dallas prepared for its annual St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade by getting up early on Saturday, crowding DART rail lines and letting out hoots and hollers as they arrived on Greenville Avenue.\nThe weather cooperated during the parade, but a few drops had started to fall just as the afternoon approached.\nFloats lined up just north of Northwest Highway before the 11 a.m. kickoff, greeting people walking down the road to nab their spots."}
