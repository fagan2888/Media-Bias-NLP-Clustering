Neither one could come up with a comparable player to the Los Angeles Angels\u2019 Mike Trout, who hit a 430-foot home run and stole a base in a blink.\n\n\u201cThe only one I could come up with is Jose Canseco in his early days,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nAdded Walker: \u201cHe\u2019s bigger than I thought. That\u2019s a pretty good body type.\u201d\n\nTrout runs like a tailback and hits like a linebacker. He weighs 235 pounds. The skill set that makes him a strong candidate to win American League MVP honors was on full display before a Rockies-record crowd at Salt River Fields of 12,667.\n\nTrout spoiled Juan Nicasio\u2019s line with a laser to center field.\n\nReliever Adam Ottavino hit Trout in the left arm in his next plate appearance. Trout swiped second base on the first pitch. He wasn\u2019t trying to send a message.\n\n\u201cI was just working on stuff, on my first step, getting good jumps,\u201d Trout said.\n\nButler, Gray head to minors. Eddie Butler and Jon Gray weren\u2019t making the Rockies out of spring. This was the plan from the end of last season.\n\nThey made the Rockies\u2019 decision interesting, maximizing their monthlong stay with ability and maturity that suggests it won\u2019t be long before they return to the bigs. They were sent down Saturday and will resume pitching on regular rest in minor-league camp. Both will open the season at Double-A Tulsa.\n\nButler posted a 3.86 ERA, with Gray at 5.40 ERA.\n\n\u201cThey have plenty of arm, plenty of stuff to not only pitch at this level but to be really good. It\u2019s a matter of having a plan to attack hitters,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nFootnotes. Carlos Gonzalez is wearing a bracelet on his right wrist given to him by a cancer patient he met at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. The young girl visited spring training as part of a trip that Troy Tulowitzki hosts for kids and their families. \u2026 Tulowitzki (bruised left shin) ran and took groundballs. He\u2019s likely to return to the lineup Wednesday.\n\nRockies recap\n\nRockies 4, Angels 4 (10 innings)\n\nAt Salt River Fields\n\nHits: Carlos Gonzalez hit his first homer because \u201cI left a slider down and in right where he likes it,\u201d said Angels starter Jered Weaver. \u2026 The center-field battle remains a dead heat. Corey Dickerson showed improved defense Saturday, and Drew Stubbs improved his average to .333 with two doubles. Charlie Blackmon and Brandon Barnes are also in the mix.\n\nMisses: Jason Pridie grounded into a 7-6-3 double play to end the game as the Angels used five infielders. \u2026 Brennan Boesch was thrown out in the second inning for arguing a called third strike.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: Rockies at Dodgers. Jordan Lyles tries to get a grip on the fifth spot in the rotation.\n\nTroy E.
