It\u2019s the third year of operation for the state-run health insurance exchange, created under 2012\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nBasically, if you don\u2019t have a job that offers health insurance (and you\u2019re not 26 anymore, so can\u2019t stay on your parents\u2019 plan), you can go to the MNsure website and look through a bunch of different types of health insurance options.\n\nHere are five need-to-knows in case your head is still spinning:\n\n1. Premiums and deductibles: What they are\n\nBoth those words get thrown around a lot, so if you\u2019re not sure what they are \u2013 the premium is how much your health insurance costs every month. The deductible is the amount of money (in addition to the monthly premium) you have to pay in medical bills before insurance starts paying for it.\n\nA general rule of thumb: A low premium means you probably have a higher deductible \u2013 whereas a higher premium (so you\u2019re paying more upfront) means you might have a deductible as low as $0. With many plans though, some basic preventative measures \u2013 such as an annual physical \u2013 don\u2019t require you to pay part of the deductible.\n\n2. Premiums went up, but there\u2019s also more financial help\n\nThe premiums will, on average, be higher this year than last \u2013 but MNsure officials are touting tax credits, which you automatically can qualify for based on income and plan cost, as a big way the cost will be kept down.\n\nThose tax credits are only available when purchasing plans through MNsure.\n\n3. Need financial help? MNsure lays out the options\n\nIf you create an account, punching in your income plus the other figures it needs, the MNsure site will tell you what type tax credits or reductions you qualify for.\n\nFor a household of one, if your annual income is $47,080 or less, you qualify for tax credits of some sort. Click the chart above for a closer breakdown, and click here to see MNsure\u2019s page on financial assistance.\n\n4. The sooner you sign up, the sooner you\u2019re covered\n\nIf you pick a plan between now and Dec. 15, your health coverage kicks in Jan. 1, 2016. Choose a plan from Dec. 16-Jan. 1 15, and it starts in February; and Jan. 16-Jan. 31, it starts in March.\n\nAfter Jan. 31, you can not enroll in health insurance through MNsure until fall of 2016.\n\n5. If you don\u2019t have insurance, you\u2019ll be fined\n\nSure, giving up a chunk of your check every month to buy insurance doesn\u2019t sound appealing. But there\u2019s incentive \u2013 not having health coverage means you\u2019re facing a fine. (In 2016, it\u2019ll be either 2.5 percent of certain taxable income, or a flat $695 \u2013 whichever one is greater.)\n\nThere are some people who aren\u2019t legally required to have health insurance.
