Twelve million residents \u2014 nearly a third of the state\u2019s population \u2014 now rely on Medi-Cal, and that\u2019s increased pressure to find more doctors willing and able to treat patients for what has historically been low reimbursement rates.\n\nAt the LifeLong Clinic in West Berkeley most of the patients waiting to see a doctor are on Medi-Cal. Among them, 26-year-old Amanda Hopkins, says she enrolled half a year ago when the state expanded the benefits program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been relieving to have Medi-Cal and know that if something happened \u2014 I needed an ambulance or there was an emergency \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about being in debt thousands of dollars,\u201d she said.\n\nHopkins says before she would not have gone to the doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have this option, although it\u2019s been taking a long time to be able to get an appointment.\u201d\n\nHopkins says she had to wait five weeks for her first doctor\u2019s visit.\n\nClinic medical director Dr. Davi Pakter says the long wait is one side effect of adding nearly three million people to Medi-Cal since January, 2014. At his clinic, the patients with the greatest need are seen first.\n\n\u201cWe try very hard to arrange our schedules so that we can accommodate folks that are in urgent need,\u201d he said, \u201cand try to avoid sending folks to the emergency room \u2014 which is a much higher cost and usually not in the best interest of the patient.\u201d\n\nPakter says that means people who need a check-up or treatment for a less urgent condition can end up waiting one to two months.\n\nA lot of Medi-Cal patients are turning to federally subsidized clinics like LifeLong because private practice doctors won\u2019t accept Medi-Cal insurance.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not able to afford it,\u201d says Dr. Del Morris, the president of the California Academy of Family Physicians. Morris says the state\u2019s notoriously low reimbursement rate \u2014 one of the lowest in the nation \u2014 won\u2019t cover the cost of caring for Medi-Cal patients.\n\n\u201cThese patients, because of their social circumstance have a higher acuity level than an average patient of the same age,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are complicated patients with complex problems and take up a lot of a physician\u2019s time. To be taking on patients like this and lose money in the process is just not something most private practices are willing to do.\u201d\n\nMorris who\u2019s also the medical director of the Stanislaus County Health Services Agency \u2014 says Medi-Cal patients are often forced to get care at emergency rooms.\n\nMorris expects the situation to worsen, unless state lawmakers take action.\n\nA provision of the Affordable Care Act that temporarily boosted Medi-Cal reimbursement rates expired on December 31. Also, state lawmakers passed a ten percent cut to California\u2019s reimbursement rates during the depths of the state\u2019s recession took effect last month for primary care doctors.\n\nState lawmakers Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-La Puente) and Asm. Rob Bonta (D-Alameda) introduced a bill this week that would restore the higher reimbursement rates. But even if it passes, they\u2019ll have to persuade Gov. Jerry Brown to sign it.\n\nH.D. Palmer with the state\u2019s finance department says the governor\u2019s not budgeting for higher provider rates because California faces numerous fiscal uncertainties.\n\n\u201cSo we have to be very careful and prudent about adopting any new major spending commitments or dealing with some of the difficult but necessary reductions that had to be made in recent years,\u201d he said.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s spending on Medi-Cal will jump by $1.7 billion in a just a few years. Right now and through 2016, the federal government pays 100 percent of the cost of covering people who are eligible under the Medicaid expansion. From 2016 to 2020, the contribution will gradually decline to 90 percent, meaning California must pick up the rest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "12 million Californians -- one-third of the state's population -- is now covered by Medi-Cal.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"More Pressure on Providers in Face of Medi-Cal Expansion\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/02\\/19\\/more-pressure-on-providers-in-face-of-medi-cal-expansion\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-19 14:19:01\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-02-20 15:33:29\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":23957,\"author_id\":\"8588\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"\",\"tags\":[\"Medi-Cal\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/02\\/IMG_4338-e1424384287189.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "12 million Californians -- one-third of the state's population -- is now covered by Medi-Cal.", "title": "More Pressure on Providers in Face of Medi-Cal Expansion", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/02/19/more-pressure-on-providers-in-face-of-medi-cal-expansion/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/02/IMG_4338-640x480.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "medi-cal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf188\"", "article_summary": "A lot of Medi-Cal patients are turning to federally subsidized clinics like LifeLong because private practice doctors won\u2019t accept Medi-Cal insurance.\nA provision of the Affordable Care Act that temporarily boosted Medi-Cal reimbursement rates expired on December 31.\nMore Pressure on Providers in Face of Medi-Cal ExpansionMedi-Cal \u2014 the public health insurance program for low-income Californians \u2014 is growing faster under federal health care reform than the state expected.\nRob Bonta (D-Alameda) introduced a bill this week that would restore the higher reimbursement rates.\nMorris says the state\u2019s notoriously low reimbursement rate \u2014 one of the lowest in the nation \u2014 won\u2019t cover the cost of caring for Medi-Cal patients."}
