ANAHEIM (AP) —

Fans who speculated that Disneyland might be expanding are going to be disappointed.

Spokeswoman Suzi Brown says three parcels of land the Walt Disney Co. recently bought near the Anaheim park will be used for office space, warehouse space and additional parking.

Brown tells City News Service Wednesday that a record number of guests and an increasing number of employees have created infrastructure needs.

Some Disney fans had speculated that the property might be used for attractions based on Marvel superheroes or “Star Wars,” since the company owns both Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm.

But Brown says officials want to keep any future attractions within the boundaries of the existing park.
