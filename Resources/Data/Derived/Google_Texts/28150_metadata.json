The Stanley Cup. Of course. The Heisman is an individual award, for guys who like to strike a look-at-me pose. Heisman is the original selfie moment. Me? I\u2019m all about winning, the team and celebrating with my brothers. So Lord Stanley\u2019s Cup rules.\n\nHooch: Here\u2019s the Heisman, stiff-arming Stanley\u2019s Cup. The Cup is cool, but it looks like something awarded to the winner of the 3A state football title in \u201978. The Heisman, this is art \u2014 my kind of art, art for the sports fan who has the John Elway \u201cRifleman\u201d poster framed. A cast bronze ball carrier, 13.5 inches tall and weighing 25 pounds, immortalizing a hero each December. Winter chills, to be sure.\n\nKiz: When the Stanley Cup gets handed from Joe Sakic to Ray Bourque, that\u2019s the essence of what sports is all about. Yeah, I\u2019m crying, bro. The Heisman? It regularly gets handed to Jason White or Gino Torretta or somebody who can\u2019t play. It has become a clich\u00e9. And the Heisman goes to \u2026 the quarterback on a team ranked near the top of the national polls. Excuse my yawn, bro. It\u2019s the most boringly predictable reality show since \u201cReal Housewives of \u2026\u201d\n\nHooch: First of all, \u201cReal Housewives of Atlanta\u201d is underrated. Second of all, for every Jason or Gino, there\u2019s Bo or Tebow, single-named Heisman legends. And what\u2019s cool is that for a year, Torretta was indeed the best. And we\u2019ll always remember that amazing season, regardless of the fact his pro career was a bust. We can name more Heisman winners than even the teams that won the Cup. How many readers remember that the Lightning and Hurricanes won Lord Stanley\u2019s chalice?\n\nKiz: Ever try drinking from the Heisman? The Cup is a party. If my foggy memory is accurate, the sun rising on Miami Beach and the Cup in 1996 was the perfect ending to the best all-night rave of my life. And one more thing: You gotta love how the Cup grows as a living history of the game, built one line at a time with tiny names engraved on the trophy. In fact, Charlotte and John Grahame, a mother and son from Denver\u2019s first family on hockey, are both on the Cup. Now that\u2019s cool.\n\nHooch: Ever try drinking as the Heisman winner? You never have to buy a beer again.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman vs. Kiszla: Which is the better trophy: Heisman or Stanley Cup?", "title": "Hochman vs. Kiszla: Which is the better trophy: Heisman or Stanley Cup?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/13/hochman-vs-kiszla-which-is-the-better-trophy-heisman-or-stanley-cup/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141213__20141214_CC2_SP14BENMARKp1.jpg", "height": 429}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141213__20141214_CC2_SP14BENMARKp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-14T00:12:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:47:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Heisman, this is art \u2014 my kind of art, art for the sports fan who has the John Elway \u201cRifleman\u201d poster framed.\nHooch: Here\u2019s the Heisman, stiff-arming Stanley\u2019s Cup.\nSo Lord Stanley\u2019s Cup rules.\nKiz: As a child born in South Bend, Ind., shortly after Notre Dame star Paul Hornung won the Heisman Trophy, isn\u2019t it obvious what my answer is?\nHooch: Ever try drinking as the Heisman winner?"}
