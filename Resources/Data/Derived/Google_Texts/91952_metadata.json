It will be a massive stainless steel sculpture that will span across the Big Sioux River.\n\nThe installation will be the length of a football field and rise between Sixth and Eighth streets in downtown Sioux Falls.\n\n\"Beyond the beauty of the sculpture is the symbolism of recognizing the dreamers, past, present and future and also the character and spirit of Sioux Falls,\" Clark said.\n\nIt will be the work of famed South Dakotan Artist Dale Lamphere and will be the capstone of the SculptureWalk created by Jim Clark more than a decade ago.\n\n\"It is unique. No other cities around the country have a sculpture of this magnitude that represents the character of the city like this sculpture will,\" Clark said.\n\nClark says the privately-funded installation will become a signature piece of art for the city, honoring a growing city lead by dreamers.\n\nThe Arc of Dreams is expected to be installed and dedicated in the spring of 2016. Organizers say it will be a huge asset to the cultural economy.\n\n\"It will cause people to come off the interstate and say, I have to see this Arc of Dreams that everyone talks about. So we are talking about cultural tourism, we are talking about economic development, we are talking about tributes, we are talking about inspiration. What more could you want,\" Paul Schiller said.\n\nDesigners are also going to build a walking path on either side of the arc, highlighting stories of the City's great dreamers.\n\nNews\n\nOutdoors {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction:\n\nA misspelling was corrected in this story.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "The riverfront skyline is going to drastically change as a massive art sculpture will arch over the Big Sioux River in downtown Sioux Falls.
