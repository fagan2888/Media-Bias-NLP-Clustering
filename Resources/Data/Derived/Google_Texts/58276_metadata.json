But a new analysis from the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics and some recent polling suggest that Republicans shouldn\u2019t get their hopes up just yet.\n\nThe University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics on Thursday released new ratings for six Senate elections, all of which either favored an incumbent Democrat or predicted a more difficult path for an incumbent Republican.\n\nRelated: Trump Has Some Bad News for Cruz in New York\n\n\u201cAssuming the GOP nominee for the White House is either Trump or [Texas Sen.] Ted Cruz, we think the Democrats will fare reasonably well down-ballot (more so with Trump than Cruz, though Cruz will also have a difficult time carrying many swing states),\u201d write Larry J. Sabato, Kyle Kondik, and Geoffrey Skelley.\n\nNeither Trump nor Cruz is seen as particularly electable in a general election, and the so-called coattail effect produced by a Democratic presidential victory could wind up carrying new Dems into the Senate. In November, 34 Senate seats will be up for election, with Republicans defending 24 of them. A net gain of four seats would give Democrats control if there is a Democratic vice president. A five-seat swing would hand them control of the Senate outright.\n\n\u201c[I]n recent presidential cycles, about 80% of states with Senate elections have backed the same party for the presidency and the Senate,\u201d they wrote. If a Democrat takes the White House in November, \u201cstraight-ticket voting could bode poorly for the GOP.\u201d\n\nThe worst news in Thursday\u2019s analysis was for Sens. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio. Both men saw their races downgraded from \u201cLeans Republican\u201d to \u201cToss-up\u201d on the Center for Politics\u2019 scale. Roy Blunt of Missouri and Richard Burr of North Carolina both saw their races downgraded from \u201cLikely Republican\u201d to \u201cLeans Republican.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Wisconsin Debacle a Major Warning to the GOP\n\nEven long-time Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley took a hit, dropping from \u201cSafe Republican\u201d to \u201cLikely Republican.\u201d (Grassley is likely suffering in part from reaction to his decision as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to deny a vote to Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.)\n\nThe one Democratic senator whose rating changed was Michael Bennett of Colorado. His race moved from \u201cLeans Democratic\u201d to \u201cLikely Democratic.\u201d\n\nRecent polling data out of Wisconsin, the most recent state to hold a Republican primary election, also suggests that even if Trump\u2019s attempt to take the GOP mantle is thwarted, a Cruz candidacy might not exactly stir the hearts of GOP voters.\n\nTo be sure, Trump is the most toxic candidate in the field, even among Republicans. After the Wisconsin primaries on Tuesday, Republican voters were asked whom they would vote for in a general election under a variety of scenarios. If Trump were the Republican nominee and Hillary Clinton were the Democratic nominee, for example, only 61 percent of GOP voters said they would support him. Eight percent said they wouldn\u2019t vote at all, 18 percent said they would seek a third-party candidate, and 10 percent said they would vote for Clinton over Trump.\n\nRelated: How Voter Anger Finally Erupted and Gave Us Trump and Sanders\n\nAnd while Cruz\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t as bad as Trump\u2019s, they\u2019re still pretty bad.\n\nIf Cruz won the nomination and ran against Clinton, only 66 percent of Republicans said they would support him. Only in a race against a candidate like Trump can the threat of losing one-third of your party\u2019s support in a general election be considered a victory.\n\nFive percent of Wisconsin Republicans said they wouldn\u2019t vote in a general election if Cruz were the nominee, 18 percent said they would look for a third party candidate, and 6 percent would vote for Clinton.\n\nLooking ahead to November, if the Wisconsin exit polls are even close to correctly gauging the attitude of the broader electorate, that\u2019s terrible news not just for the Republicans\u2019 dream of recapturing the White House, but for their defense of the Senate as well.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With the air of inevitability surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s potential nomination dissipating somewhat, there might be some hope among Republicans that what looked like an unmitigated down-ballot disaster in November might not be so awful after all.
