Meadows sees Congress as becoming impotent and irrelevant \u2014 a sign of eroding self-government.\n\nHe blames this primarily on a culture of enforced \u201ctimidity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not rewarded for fighting in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Meadows says. Republicans have various means by which to enforce their non-confrontational culture that helps liberals and the mainstream media. In this interview, the congressman provides examples of the phrases Republicans often hear. They include: \u201care you part of the team?\u201d \u201cwe need to show we can govern,\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t make waves.\u201d\n\nHowever, partisan Democrats seem not to have gotten this memo.\n\nWhen Meadows voted his conscience against a rule vote to consider the Obama trade legislation, Meadows was punished by getting stripping of his sub-chairmanship, starting him on a path of being a public and likable rebel against Speaker Boehner. When a national backlash against Boehner started, Meadows was allowed to return. Now a growing number of dissenters are finding momentum this fall in challenging the House Speaker again.\n\nIn July, Meadows offered a motion to vacate the chair, a procedural vote of no-confidence for Boehner.\n\n\u201cWashington, D.C. is not working for the average citizen,\u201d Meadows says.\n\nWill there be more consequences for Meadows violating the cultural norms on behalf of the citizens he represents? While there are reputational and social or political consequences to being a rebel against Speaker Boehner these days, Meadows says with tears welling up in his eyes, \u201cit pales by comparison\u201d to what our military sacrifices all the time for this nation.\n\nHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about being be-headed tomorrow for standing up for my faith.\u201d\n\nFor more on Rep.
