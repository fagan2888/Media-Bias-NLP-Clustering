Touch-A-Tractor continues Sunday in St. Charles

hello

The ninth annual Touch-A-Tractor event is this weekend on the front lawn of the Kane County Farm Bureau, Randall Road at Oak Street, St. Charles.

The event continues 10 a.m. Sunday, April 6, and benefits Kane County Farm Bureau Foundation Ag Literacy and Scholarship Programs. Admission is free.

Kids can sit in the seat of an antique tractor, see modern farm equipment, participate in hands-on activities, ride pedal tractors, shell corn, see farm animals and enter for a free chance to win their very own pedal tractor. Bringing nonperishable food items to the event for a local food pantry earns visitors an extra entry in the pedal tractor drawing.
