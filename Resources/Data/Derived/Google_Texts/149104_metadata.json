Unless the Division is able to obtain a stay, the records are due for release next week.\n\nAs I write in my story today, Don Campbell, the attorney representing National Review and the Las Vegas Review-Journal in this suit, described the judge\u2019s ruling:\n\n\u201cThe judge clearly and unequivocally determined that the Division of Insurance had withheld public records that should have been disclosed pursuant to the Nevada Public Records Act.

The Nevada Division of Insurance also deployed some odd legal tactics in its attempt to keep these records from the public. In its initial denial letter, it claimed, in what appeared to be a contradiction, that the Division possessed no responsive records whatsoever \u2014 and that it also could not disclose the responsive records it possessed. Further justifying its refusal to release records, the Division cited a clause in the Nevada legal code, NRS 679B.190(7), which states that \u201cthe Commissioner may classify as confidential the records of a consumer or information relating to a consumer to protect the health, welfare or safety of the consumer.\u201d However, the records requested were not about consumers but about possibly criminal navigators. The Insurance Division\u2019s initial response also cited a law that was repealed in 1967 \u2014 purely a mistake, I was later assured.
