However, he is pairing his Tea Partyism with a communitarian messaging of late, culminating in a family-friendly tax reform plan that goes as far as any politician\u2019s proposal, and certainly any Republican one, of late to put the needs and well-being of working families ahead of the wealthy and well-connected.\n\nAs Jim Pethokoukis describes it, \u201cSenator Mike Lee of Utah is offering fellow Republicans a possible path out of the political and policy wilderness.\u201d\n\nAt its core: a new $2500 per child tax credit \u2014 in addition to the existing $1000 credit \u2014 available to all parents of dependent children and applicable to both payroll and income taxes. The expanded tax break would help reduce the \u201cparent tax penalty.\u201d Parents contribute twice to senior social insurance programs; first when they pay payroll taxes, then again when they incur the cost of raising the next generation of taxpayers, their kiddies. \u2026 In a way, Lee is proposing a \u201chuman capital\u201d gains tax cut. \u2026 In addition, Lee would reduce the current seven individual income tax brackets to two with 15% and 35%.\n\nYuval Levin also finds Lee\u2019s proposal more than sound (it is based in large part on an article published in the second issue of Levin\u2019s own magazine, National Affairs):\n\nThe combination of reforms Lee proposes is, to begin with, good policy. It would make our tax code friendlier to growth and more supportive of prosperity, and would correct a number of iniquities in the current code, in the process easing for many the path into the middle class and upwards through it and beyond it. It\u2019s also good politics, as offering a larger child credit would help build a broader constituency for the other tax reforms (which conservatives have long wanted) while at the same time enabling the right to show working-class families how conservatives policies can improve their lives.\n\nMost of all, though, Levin celebrates the positive signal that this speech represents, for \u201cto see a prominent conservative politician take up the cause and offer the sort of vision of it that Lee did in his remarks today, is a cause for great encouragement and hope. \u2026 Encouraging signs are few and far between these days, but this was a big one.\u201d\n\nTim Carney over at the Washington Examiner gives Mike Lee\u2019s plan the official libertarian populist blessing, and commends it for its framing and policy:\n\nFirst, Lee\u2019s plan isn\u2019t a flat tax. He calls for a 15 percent rate and 35 percent rate. He puts much more emphasis on making the tax code clean and simple \u2013 eliminating deductions, streamlining returns \u2013 than on flatness. This tacitly accepts the notion of a progressive income tax code. He\u2019s agreeing that the rich ought to pay a higher portion. Along the same lines, Lee\u2019s tax plan would cap the mortgage interest deduction at $300,000. Most homeowners would see no difference, but lobbyists living in Northwest Washington and Chevy Chase would see their deductions shrink. Most importantly, Lee rejects the notion, persistent among some conservatives, that there\u2019s something bad about knocking low-income families off the tax rolls. The centerpiece of Lee\u2019s bill is an expanded child tax credit that would not only reduce income taxes to zero, but also offset payroll taxes. In doing so, he explicitly rejects Romney 47-percentism: \u201cWorking families are not free riders.\u201d \u2026 Remember, this sort of talk isn\u2019t coming from the squishy center, but from the Red Meat Right \u2013 from Utah, to be precise. And it could represent a much-needed libertarian-populist wave in the GOP because it comes from the same well from which the Tea Party sprung.\n\nThe pro-family sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox weighed in immediately following the speech in a follow-up panel, then continued his remarks over at The Atlantic\n\nSenator Lee\u2019s proposal is only one step in the right direction. But what\u2019s particularly encouraging about his proposal is that it would lift the sagging economic fortunes of many working-class families by targeting their payroll taxes. Let\u2019s hope more Republicans (and Democrats) take a page from Lee\u2019s playbook and seek policies that renew the flagging economic fortunes of family life in all too many of our nation\u2019s poor and working class communities.\n\nLast, but furthest from least, Pete Spiliakos is over the moon:\n\nI can\u2019t say enough good things about this speech on family-friendly tax reform by Utah Senator Mike Lee. It is a beautifully written argument for a Republican tax agenda that prioritizes the interests of middle-class and struggling working parents. Lee\u2019s speech also contains some powerful but very civil criticisms of the ideas underlying Romney\u2019s 47% comment and Rand Paul\u2019s flat tax proposal. Lee\u2019s identity as an insurgent, constitutionalist, Tea Partier allows him to position middle-class-oriented populism as authentically conservative. This is a huge step toward making the GOP a more middle-class-friendly party.\n\nThere are a few features of the speech that stand out for special notice. One is Lee\u2019s willingness to put payroll taxes on par with income taxes. Because income taxes are disproportionately paid by the well-off, and payroll taxes disproportionately by the working-class, payroll taxes have been ignored by the Republican Party. Getting a sitting Senator to recognize their importance is itself a great achievement. Another is Lee\u2019s push back against the flat tax and consumption tax crowd, prioritizing families (despite his verbal acrobatics) and representing a real departure from traditional strains of economic and libertarian thinking about tax policy.\n\nFinally, this is a tax plan that makes philosophical concessions to the world as it is, not as it might be in an economics text book. As Tim says, it tacitly accepts a progressive tax code, and accepts that the rich should pay more. Also, its core justification recognizes the future survival of the welfare state and adjusts families\u2019 taxes to better reward them for contributing to its solvency and society\u2019s well being. This is no mean thing.\n\nFollow @joncoppage\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Conservative", "description": "Mike Lee talked taxes at AEI yesterday, and the rave reviews are in.
