Pleasant attorney, as quoted by Hutchins. \"This is stupid,\u201d Robinson reportedly added.\n\nSliding a little farther down the legal ladder, Hutchins includes the learned opinion of a recent law school graduate, Andrew Patterson, in his diatribe, as well: \"You can call this bill what you want,\" Patterson told the lawmakers at the hearing last night. \"But essentially it is gutting [a federal law] ... the idea of nullification is terrifying to me.\u201d\n\nStupid and terrifying.\n\nFinally, Hutchins decides to quote an actual licensed attorney, Charleston law professor William Merkel. Merkel, as reported by Hutchins, claims, incorrectly,\n\nThe purpose behind the Constitution \u2014 and [James] Madison, the reputed father of the Constitution spells this out in great detail in his notes he made leading into to the constitutional convention \u2014 the principle [sic] purpose was to strip the states of powers and provide the federal government with ample authority.\n\nTry squaring that bald-faced mischaracterization of Madison with the following words from the man himself as written in Federalist 45:\n\nThe powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State Governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will for the most part be connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people; and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.\n\nMerkel then reminds readers that \u201cthe phrase nullification doesn\u2019t appear in the Constitution.\u201d Well, true enough, but perhaps Merkel has failed to read the Federalist Papers, or the Bill of Rights. The tenth of those fundamental amendments reads: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\"\n\nThis brief protection of the right of states to exercise their \u201cnumerous and indefinite\u201d powers would seemingly qualify under the Merkel standard as the musings of \u201cmilitant states' rights advocates.\u201d\n\nFrom beginning to end, Hutchins tries to portray nullification as an embarrassing vestige of South Carolina\u2019s secessionist past and of the Nullification Crisis of the 1830s led by South Carolinian John Calhoun.\n\n\u201cNearly 200 years later, [John] Calhoun\u2019s ideas are still alive in the S.C. General Assembly,\u201d Hutchins writes, speaking of the anti-ObamaCare legislation that will soon come before that body.\n\nHutchins isn\u2019t alone in his disdain for nullification \u2014 not even in South Carolina.\n\nEarlier this year during debate on an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to nullify ObamaCare in South Carolina, several state newspapers published an article penned by Phil Noble.\n\nIn his piece, Noble synopsizes the 19th-century Nullification Crisis and thinks the battle is won. He explains:\n\nNow, some may say that Calhoun and company were nuts when they started all this nullification and secession stuff the first time. I\u2019ll leave it to others to characterize their mental condition. But this I do know: They put in motion a chain of events that led to the death of more than 650,000 of their fellow Americans, and untold suffering for the people of our state \u2014 suffering that we haven\u2019t fully overcome yet.\n\nThis article won\u2019t wade into the deep water of Civil War causation, for unlike Noble, I admit my lack of proper education when it comes to that complicated issue.\n\nA field I am competent in, however, is the drafting of the Constitution, the federal government established by that document, and the process that led to ratification of the Constitution.\n\nDespite the example set by Noble, there is no need to question the sanity of anyone advocating for the reaffirmation of the right of states to hold as null, void, and of no legal effect any federal act that exceeds the scope of powers granted to it by the states in the Constitution.\n\nNoble believes that the Union victory in the Civil War settled the conflict between states\u2019 rights and federal \u201csupremacy.\u201d Did it?\n\nIn a word: No. The Civil War made one thing clear: The federal government believes (and the Confederacy was forced to concede) that might makes right. The Union army defeated the army of the Confederacy; therefore, so the thinking goes, secession is no longer a constitutional remedy available to states. Might makes right.\n\nOnly it doesn\u2019t.\n\nThink of it this way: Assume my neighbor and I disagree over the exact location of the boundary line between our properties. One day, while I\u2019m out building a shed that my neighbor believes encroaches on his property, we start arguing and the argument escalates to a full-fledged fist fight, and I knock out my neighbor. Does that mean that the legally binding location of our mutual property line has been settled?\n\nDoes the pummeling of my neighbor make my opinion of the location of that line the rightful boundary? Of course not. Might, it seems, does not make right, neither in boundary disputes regarding land nor in similar disagreements over states\u2019 constitutional authority.\n\nThose of us engaged in the struggle to force the federal beast back inside its constitutional cage are not nuts, and we are not feverish. Nullification is no fad and will not fade away.\n\nA growing number of concerned citizens of this Republic are no longer willing to recur to Congress to repeal unconstitutional laws or to file legal complaints in the hope that the courts will strike down offensive measures. They understand that while perhaps commendable, these tactics are futile and offer no guarantee of the restoration of constitutionally ensured freedom. They refuse to wait on this or that president, this or that congressman, or this or that political party to acknowledge their pleas for relief from federal oppression. Instead, they unashamedly will assume their right and their duty to derail the \u201clong train of abuses and usurpations\u201d and \u201cprovide new Guards for their future security\u201d: the states and themselves.\n\nFinally, in his nullification of nullification, Hutchins quotes Republican State Senator Ray Cleary, who thinks nullification is a waste of time. Speaking of the bill that would nullify ObamaCare, Cleary explains, as quoted by Hutchins:\n\nIf I could nullify it I would \u2014 if it would be worthwhile \u2014 but, like I told somebody, my high school lost every football game my junior and senior year and on Mondays we had moral victories. I'm not necessarily a believer in moral victories.\n\nPerhaps the victories would be more than \u201cmoral\u201d if more state lawmakers would recognize their right and their obligation to hold as null, void, and of no legal effect any act of the federal government that exceeds the \u201cfew and defined\u201d powers granted to it in the Constitution.\n\nAs Jefferson and Madison explained while reaffirming their \u201cwarm attachment to the Union of the States,\" state lawmakers' devotion to the Constitution and to the rule of law should compel them to \u201cwatch over and oppose every infraction of those principles which constitute the only basis of that Union, because a faithful observance of them can alone secure its existence and the public happiness.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the victories over federal overreach would multiply were enlightened state legislators and governors to stand up, tear up the federal welfare checks, and assume the \u201cnumerous and indefinite\u201d powers they retained upon forming the federal government by way of the Constitution.\n\nJoe A.
