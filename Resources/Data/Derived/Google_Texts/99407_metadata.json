Kennedy (80) and liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg (83). Liberal Justice Stephen G. Breyer will be 78.\n\nDuring a Federalist Society discussion on the first 10 years of the court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., lawyer Michael Carvin said the Supreme Court has made \u201cbaby steps toward the return to the rule of law\u201d in the past decade, despite dissatisfaction by many conservatives.\n\n\u201cIf the election goes wrong next year, none of that will matter and we will all descend into a hellish existence from which we will never emerge,\u201d Mr. Carvin said to laughter from the crowd.\n\nMr. Carvin was the plaintiffs\u2019 lead attorney in challenging the Affordable Care Act in King v. Burwell, in which the court upheld Obamacare subsidies.\n\nMichael Paulsen, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, said the next president will have an opportunity to institute \u201cmeaningful changes\u201d on the court.\n\n\u201cIdeology matters,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cJudicial philosophy matters. Sometimes it\u2019s literally a matter of life and death who you appoint to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nHe cited as an example Republican President George H.W. Bush\u2019s appointment in 1990 of Justice David H. Souter, who turned out to be a liberal jurist. Mr. Paulsen said he believes one consequence of the Souter appointment was to keep abortion legal.\n\n\u201cIt makes a world of difference, for example, that we ended up with David Souter rather [than conservatives] Edith Jones or Laurence Silberman in 1990,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cIf you had Edith Jones appointed by a Republican president, I think Roe v. Wade is overruled by a vote of 6-3 or 7-2. It\u2019s a difference in terms of saving millions of lives.\u201d\n\nJan Crawford, who covers the Supreme Court for CBS News, said the next president \u201ccould well get two, three, possibly four appointments.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn Roberts has been frustrating for many conservatives,\u201d Ms. Crawford said. \u201c[But] if a Democrat wins the White House, John Roberts may well be writing a lot more dissents on the other side.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton reportedly told supporters at a fundraiser last week that the Supreme Court is \u201cwrong on the Second Amendment\u201d and said she would work as president to reinstate a ban on assault weapons. Her comment was an apparent reference to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which ruled that the handgun ban in the nation\u2019s capital was unconstitutional.\n\nJustices Breyer and Ginsburg, who along with President Obama\u2019s appointees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan make up the court\u2019s liberal wing, were appointed by President Clinton.\n\nMost of the panelists at the Federal Society\u2019s annual gathering said it\u2019s too soon to label the Roberts court from a political or legal perspective.\n\nMr. Carvin said the court has been a \u201cmixed bag,\u201d with conservative victories such as the Citizens United ruling in 2010 that eliminated a ban on independent union and corporate campaign expenditures, and losses such as this year\u2019s ruling that legalized same-sex marriage, which he called \u201cabout as lawless as you could be.\u201d\n\nThey agreed that President George W. Bush\u2019s appointment of Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. to replace Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor has been more consequential for conservatives than Mr. Bush\u2019s selection of Justice Roberts to replace Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.\n\n\u201cJustice Alito has been, from President Bush\u2019s perspective, the home run,\u201d Ms. Crawford said.\n\nMr. Carvin said of Justice Alito: \u201cYou had a principled conservative replacing a sort of suburban Republican state legislator. You got some continuity in the law and some principle in the law.\u201d\n\nWhen the next president prepares to vet Supreme Court nominees, Mr. Paulsen said, it\u2019s entirely appropriate for the White House team to ask about a candidate\u2019s political philosophy.\n\n\u201cOf course you can know how these individuals will be as justices on the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me 10 minutes with a prospective nominee, and I\u2019ll tell you how they\u2019re likely to be [voting] on the Supreme Court. You can tell in advance the difference between a Scalia and a Souter.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives unhappy with U.S. Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage and Obamacare heard a powerful argument Thursday for defeating Hillary Rodham Clinton: The next president could appoint as many as four justices.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Conservatives unhappy with U.S. Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage and Obamacare heard a powerful argument Thursday for defeating Hillary Rodham Clinton: The next president could appoint as many as four justices.", "title": "Hillary Clinton, if president, could appoint 4 Supreme Court justices", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/12/hillary-clinton-if-president-could-appoint-4-supre/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/06/8_6_2015_dem-2016-debates8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/06/8_6_2015_dem-2016-debates8201.jpg", "description": "Conservatives unhappy with U.S. Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage and Obamacare heard a powerful argument Thursday for defeating Hillary Rodham Clinton: The next president could appoint as ma", "card": "summary", "title": "Hillary Clinton, if president, could appoint 4 Supreme Court justices"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Law Crime, Antonin Scalia, US Supreme Court"}, "article_summary": "Conservatives unhappy with U.S. Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage and Obamacare heard a powerful argument Thursday for defeating Hillary Rodham Clinton: The next president could appoint as many as four justices.\n\u201cOf course you can know how these individuals will be as justices on the Supreme Court,\u201d he said.\n\u201cGive me 10 minutes with a prospective nominee, and I\u2019ll tell you how they\u2019re likely to be [voting] on the Supreme Court.\nMost of the panelists at the Federal Society\u2019s annual gathering said it\u2019s too soon to label the Roberts court from a political or legal perspective.\nMr. Carvin was the plaintiffs\u2019 lead attorney in challenging the Affordable Care Act in King v.
