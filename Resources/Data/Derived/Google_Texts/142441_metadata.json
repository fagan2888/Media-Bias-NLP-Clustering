The website\u2019s botched roll out caused a backlog and ultimately forced the Obama administration to move back the signup dates. At Mall of the Americas people were signing up for coverage Monday.\n\n\u201cWell they want to know how much they\u2019ll have to pay, if they qualify and pretty much what insurance covers,\u201d said Odalys Arevalo, a Community Outreach Director.\n\nDozens of people took time away from their holiday shopping stand in line, and speak with healthcare navigators about their options. Handfuls of people huddled around small tables and informed advisors to make their decisions.\n\n\u201cJust before Christmas, I wanted to have the opportunity to have insurance because I don\u2019t have insurance at all and I just went two months ago to the hospital and I have a really big bill,\u201d said Alfredo Pozo.\n\nMonday\u2019s deadline to sign up for insurance coverage was pushed back to Tuesday because government officials feared heavy traffic on healthcare.gov could lead to delays in completing applications.\n\nPozo added, \u201cThis is my second time trying this is my second time I did it yesterday and today I just came to see if the system got refreshed because I had problems with my social security.\u201d\n\nArevalo added, \u201cThe system has been doing pretty well much better than expected sometimes it puts on hold for 3 or 4 minutes, but it\u2019s doing very very well.\u201d\n\nNavigators were also on hand to help figure out what if any subsidies people are eligible for. Navigators say if you make a lot of money, you get a little help. If you make a little money you get a lot of help.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people leave with very big smiles on their faces some of them with 0 premium others I just had a lady that left she makes about $13,400 a year. She\u2019s gonna pay $21/month for a full insurance policy,\u201d Arevalo said.\n\nDeadline to register and have insurance next year is Tuesday. If you enroll after Christmas your start date will vary. If you want to avoid tax penalties for not having insurance you need to enroll by March 31st. The clinic at Mall of the Americas runs until 10 p.m. Monday night. There are also clinics at Westland and Broward malls.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The deadline for Americans to sign up on healthcare.gov was extended Monday.
