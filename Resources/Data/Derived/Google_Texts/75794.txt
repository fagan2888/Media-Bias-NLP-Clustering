Ari Folman, the Israeli director of the Oscar-nominated “Waltz With Bashir,” is set to write and direct an animated feature based on the life and famous diary of Anne Frank.

The Anne Frank Fonds Basel, set up by her father, Otto Frank, has granted the filmmakers total access to their archives, the Hollywood Reporter said. This access will apply, as well, to their other branches worldwide.

Production is scheduled to begin in the winter of 2014 in several European countries.

“Bringing the Anne Frank Diary to all screens is a fantastic opportunity and challenge,” Mr. Folman said. “There is a real need for new artistic material to keep the memory alive for younger generations.”
