In exchange, insurance companies that eat some of those costs, will receive compensation from the government.\n\nSecretary Lew\u2019s answer to Ryan\u2019s inquiry referred the Congressman to a lawsuit carried out by Speaker John Boehner, on behalf of the entire House, last November:\n\n\u201cAs you know, The House of Representatives has filed a lawsuit against the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services asking the court to end these cost sharing reduction payments. Your letters relate to matters that are the subject of the House lawsuit. For matters raised in this litigation, we refer you to the Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice disagrees with Boehner, according to the Washington Examiner:\n\n\u201cIn a brief filed on Jan. 26, DOJ lawyers wrote that the Boehner lawsuit was incorrect in saying that the payments required annual appropriation. \u2018The cost sharing reduction payments are being made as part of a mandatory payment program that Congress has fully appropriated\u2019 the brief read.\u201d\n\nRick Moran at American Thinker believes the Department of Justice has a fundamental misunderstanding of how programs like this are funded:", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "description": "\"Even a second grader knows that only Congress can appropriate funds...\"", "published_at": "2015-03-02T20:59:54+00:00", "author": "Chris Enloe", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "\"Even a second grader knows that only Congress can appropriate funds...\"", "title": "Treasury Department Accused of Making Obamacare Payments to Insurers Without Approval from Congress", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 690, "identifier": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jack-Lew.jpg", "height": 388}, "updated_time": "2015-03-02T23:44:32-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/03/259524-lawless-administration-treasury-department-makes-health-care-payments-without-congressional-approval/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "\"Even a second grader knows that only Congress can appropriate funds...\"", "creator": "@chrisenloe", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jack-Lew.jpg", "title": "Treasury Department Accused of Making Obamacare Payments to Insurers Without Approval from Congress", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "post_id": 259524, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-02T20:59:54-04:00", "wp-categories": "14087 1471", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "tags": "Politics", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/03/259524-lawless-administration-treasury-department-makes-health-care-payments-without-congressional-approval/", "wp-category-slugs": "health, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Health", "published_time": "2015-03-02T20:59:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-02T23:44:32-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chrisdenloe"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jack-Lew.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "is_https": 0}, "article_summary": "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The U.S. Treasury Department recently made billions of dollars in payments to insurance companies without the approval of Congress.\nIn exchange, insurance companies that eat some of those costs, will receive compensation from the government.\nYour letters relate to matters that are the subject of the House lawsuit.\n\u2018The cost sharing reduction payments are being made as part of a mandatory payment program that Congress has fully appropriated\u2019 the brief read.\u201dRick Moran at American Thinker believes the Department of Justice has a fundamental misunderstanding of how programs like this are funded:\nFor matters raised in this litigation, we refer you to the Department of Justice.\u201dThe Department of Justice disagrees with Boehner, according to the Washington Examiner:\u201cIn a brief filed on Jan. 26, DOJ lawyers wrote that the Boehner lawsuit was incorrect in saying that the payments required annual appropriation."}
