We worked those years to get that, and now they want to take it away from us.\"\n\nIn a statement from spokesman Michael Mullen, Kraft Heinz said retirees will have a selection of health plans \"that provide equal or better benefits than our group coverage, at a similar or even lower cost.\"\n\nMany former workers, though, find that hard to believe.\n\n\"They promised us that we would never have to pay for our insurance. Now, you come back here, and you've got three different choices when you get to a certain age. Now, you've got to pay for them,\" said retiree Fred Parks.\n\nOthers said they feel like they're being robbed.\n\n\"You're guaranteed something. You stay there for 30 years, through the rough times and the bad times... There were good times, too. But then they take it away. It was guaranteed,\" said retiree Fran Thibodeaux.\n\nThe healthcare shift is one of several changes since Heinz merged with Kraft Foods in July. The company has said it plans to deliver $1.5 billion in cost savings by 2017.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Kraft Heinz Company has informed nearly 15,000 retirees that they'll be shifted to a private healthcare exchange when the company ends its employer-sponsored plan at the end of the year.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "93c0125b6e5dd793b0f306c174977ff3"}, "og": {"site_name": "WQAD.com", "description": "The Kraft Heinz Company has informed nearly 15,000 retirees that they\u2019ll be shifted to a private healthcare exchange when the company ends its employer-sponsored plan at the end of the year.", "title": "Kraft retirees forced to switch healthcare plans", "url": "http://wqad.com/2015/09/23/kraft-retirees-forced-to-switch-healthcare-plans/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/promo267332917.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/promo267332917.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@mytwitterhandle", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mytwitterhandle"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=339570924", "fb": {"pages": 32869603490}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wqad.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2882036417f6cd8ccaa6f6a7d2c6eaae?s=16", "application-name": "WQAD.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8", "published_time": "2015-09-24T01:43:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-24T03:27:36+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8"}, "keywords": "news, fran thibodeaux, fred parks, healthcare, kraft heinz, retirees, sandy hippler", "google-site-verification": "oCyrEMhIYdAYe44exrSiY6lwtVx417KNhwh2t4d9nwM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39f2\"", "article_summary": "The Kraft Heinz Company has informed nearly 15,000 retirees that they'll be shifted to a private healthcare exchange when the company ends its employer-sponsored plan at the end of the year.\nThe healthcare shift is one of several changes since Heinz merged with Kraft Foods in July.\nIn a statement from spokesman Michael Mullen, Kraft Heinz said retirees will have a selection of health plans \"that provide equal or better benefits than our group coverage, at a similar or even lower cost.\"\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this videoKraft Foods retirees say they're hurt and angry after learning their health insurance plan is changing.\nThe company has said it plans to deliver $1.5 billion in cost savings by 2017."}
