FRANKFORT, Ky. - Gov.-elect Matt Bevin announced Saturday that Don Parkinson, a retired KFC and Yum! Brands executive, will serve as secretary of the Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet in his administration.

Bevin also announced that within that cabinet Donnie Holland, of Cadiz, will serve as commissioner of the Department of Parks.

"Tourism and travel is Kentucky's third largest revenue producing industry, generating $13 billion in economic activity," Bevin said in the announcement.

Bevin said Parkinson, of Louisville, is a retired senior vice president of KFC and Yum! Brands who previously worked as advertising manager of the Pontiac Motor Division of General Motors. Parkinson also served twice as interim president of the Kentucky Center for the Arts, Bevin said.

Holland, Bevin said, is a former general manager of Wabash National Trailer Centers, president of Benson International and a general manager for Johnson Controls.

Holland, Bevin said, is a member of the Trigg County Board of Education and a former board member of the Kentucky Chamber who "has extensive experience promoting Land Between the Lakes and Lake Barkley State Resort Park," Bevin said.
