Opportunity for employment is expanding when all that gets into place,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018Leader in nursing\u2019\n\nWith high qualifications and competitive training, Thomason attributes some of the state and local success in the field to education.\n\n\u201cWhen Texas developed the competencies for nursing graduates, we were ahead of the game there, nationwide,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Texas is a leader in nursing.\u201d\n\nThe Lone Star State leads the pack in several of the WalletHub standards, including the No. 1 spot for highest annual salaries, adjusted for cost of living.\n\nHowever, in the overall \u201cwork environment\u201d ranking, Texas fell in the bottom half of the list of states.\n\nRodriguez said many things could be factored in the category, and each facility varies on how they are addressing issues to ensure local hospitals provide an environment that attracts and maintains a quality nursing staff.\n\nAt Metroplex, she said the hospital continues to make improvements to meet this goal through a recently renewed pay scale, offering internships for new nurses and fellowships for experienced nurses, as well as sign-on bonuses.\n\nAnother important aspect of maintaining a positive work environment, she said, is focusing on their health by offering wellness programs for the nurses total mental, physical and spiritual health.\n\nA profession that offers an abundance of opportunity, as well as a sense of fulfillment, nursing appears to have a positive outlook for the years ahead.\n\nThere are some challenges, however, in getting there.\n\nRodriguez said while local employment is high, there is a shortage of qualified nurses who want to transition into education, in order to train up the next generation of nurses to enter the field.\n\n\u201cWe need nurses in a large way here in Texas, but also across the nation, and you have to have educators to make that happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Killeen Daily Herald", "description": "In a recent study put out by WalletHub, Texas ranked fifth overall in a ranking of the best and worst states in the U.S. for nurses.", "title": "No. 5 for nurses", "url": "http://kdhnews.com/living/health/no-for-nurses/article_0d86a11e-fc42-11e4-a668-8fac4e208caa.html", "image": {"width": 945, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kdhnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/6c/e6c0ed18-fc42-11e4-9ce3-2f3b10984d14/555807ee7dcfa.image.jpg?resize=945%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kdhnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "In a recent study put out by WalletHub, Texas ranked fifth overall in a ranking of the best and worst states in the U.S. for nurses.", "msvalidate.01": "9F304B519542CC4AA866533D2B53AECA", "fb": {"app_id": 496799633680125}, "google-site-verification": "tvpDrly4oWZOJdt-kIl4RYZzursFYwXuQ-Ejs4m1V5k", "keywords": "health care,nursing,health care provider,american health care association,metroplex adventist hospital,seton medical center harker heights,health,top_story", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/facebook.com/kdhnews"}, "news_keywords": "health care,nursing,health care provider,american health care association,metroplex adventist hospital,seton medical center harker heights,health,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2924\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn this area, you have four hospitals within 60 miles of one another, so the employment opportunities are substantial,\u201d said registered nurse Tammy Rodriguez, chief nursing officer, Metroplex Health System.\nWith several major hospitals in close proximity to one another, the Killeen area is no stranger to the profession.\nAnother important aspect of maintaining a positive work environment, she said, is focusing on their health by offering wellness programs for the nurses total mental, physical and spiritual health.\n\u201cWith more millions of people having insurance, more health care providers are going to need it, and at the bed side you\u2019re going to need your nurses.\nHowever, in the overall \u201cwork environment\u201d ranking, Texas fell in the bottom half of the list of states."}
