MIHS, the county hospital system, is an antiquated model in financial disarray. It\u2019s exactly why county officials dumped it and turned it into a special health care district a decade ago. The Capitol Times recently broke the story of MIHS defaulting on a 10 year, $15.4 million note Maricopa County taxpayers loaned the district; they have yet to create a repayment plan.\n\nThe loan default is just the latest indicator. The manner in which the district is spending their recently approved bond money is worse. They did not disclose to voters their operating budget turmoil during last year\u2019s election. MIHS\u2019 first bond sale includes taking bond proceeds designed for capital to spend as cash in the operating budget in order to \u201ccompensate for past projects.\u201d This is not to be confused with refinancing old debt. It is roughly the equivalent of taking a home mortgage loan and using the cash to pay for day-to-day expenses because one previously remodeled a kitchen.\n\nThe district is \u201cpaying itself back\u201d for all capital costs incurred over $100,000 since January 2013, a rather arbitrary litmus test. This amounts to a $36 million download to the General Fund. Selling bonds for cash is a temporary stop gap and reflects the desperate situation the district has been in for years; it certainly does not provide a long term solution.\n\nIn the spring, former MIHS board member Bil Bruno warned Arizona Republic readers of the district\u2019s accelerating financial crisis. The district now estimates a massive structural deficit \u2013 $26.5 million in FY 2016, which presumably accounts for the one-time \u201cbonds-for-cash\u201d infusion.\n\nUnbelievably, MIHS readily admits that $25 million of the $36 million in \u201cbonds-for-cash\u201d is to repay itself for projects or items which can\u2019t be transferred to the new hospital it plans to build. Roughly 20% of the remaining $70 million in the first bond series is for equipment which also won\u2019t be transferred. Paying with interest for items destined for the dumpster is the height of mismanagement. Unsurprisingly, the bond sale was conducted privately which avoids the high-profile scrutiny of a public bond rating and incurs higher interest costs because the bonds are not sold tax-free.\n\nIf the county truly needed a level one trauma hospital for the poor, private hospitals would support their endeavors \u2013 they aren\u2019t. Hospitals are extraordinarily expensive to operate and without a robust payer mix, MIHS will require massive infusions of taxpayer funds to remain afloat. In an era where Medicaid, Medicare and Affordable Care Act insurance affords citizens the ability choose from a variety of private providers, government\u2019s role in the delivery of health care is increasingly questionable. A public-private partnership could run the burn center \u2013 it certainly wouldn\u2019t close. St. Luke\u2019s has a burn center just down the street. There are other providers who compete for the same behavioral health contracts MIHS currently executes. The county may have a need for primary care outpatient clinics in underserved areas. Such a niche role would be far more affordable for taxpayers who are only beginning to witness increased costs associated with the payment of health care.\n\nMIHS publicly promised none of the bonds would be sold until they had a sustainable fiscal horizon. They didn\u2019t explain \u201cbonds-for-cash\u201d was the plan. Using capital monies to float the operating budget and for short life-cycle items such as computers and furniture is poor policy. That combined with defaulting on the county loan are ominous harbingers. MIHS should fulfill its promise to not put taxpayers on the line with more debt until it demonstrates long-term viability in an evolving health care market.\n\n\u2014 Sean McCarthy is senior research analyst for the Arizona Tax Research Association.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maricopa County taxpayers have a ticking time bomb on their hands.
