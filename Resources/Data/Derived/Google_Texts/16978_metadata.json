The meeting near the Chesapeake Bay was full of realism about the party\u2019s slim chances to make gains in the 2014 elections. For some, in both the House and Senate, just keeping their jobs is a dicey proposition, which is why in selected races Democrats are distancing themselves from the president\u2019s health care plan. A Democratic super PAC is even running ads praising Democrats for criticizing the White House\u2019s botched rollout of the health exchanges. They get extra points for working to restore coverage to those whom the president had promised would be able to keep their plans and couldn\u2019t.\n\nJohn Dickerson John Dickerson is a Slate political columnist, the moderator of CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, and author of On Her Trail. Read his series on the presidency and on risk.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Democrats are on the defensive, but usually when they get together, someone makes the case for why people will like the law as soon as they understand it. A Democratic elected official told me as much this week. But Democrats have been making this case for four years\u2014ever since the law was passed\u2014and it hasn\u2019t moved public opinion much. Based on the president\u2019s remarks to his fellow party members, it appears he isn\u2019t holding out for any miracles.\n\nThe president spoke about the upward tick in the enrollment numbers, the number of people who were now on Medicaid, and the fact that there would be fewer uninsured Americans as a result of the law. It followed the familiar pattern from countless other speeches in which he touts whatever the latest good news is for his hard-fought law. But then he did not make the expected pivot of assuring everyone that the more people knew about the Affordable Care Act, the more they would embrace it. Instead, he said: \u201cI just want to say thank you for all of you hanging in there tough on an issue that I think 10 years from now, five years from now, we\u2019re going to look back and say this was a monumental achievement that could not have happened had it not been for this caucus.\u201d\n\nIt appears President Obama isn\u2019t holding out for any Obamacare miracles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat is cold comfort for a member of Congress. Representatives are up for re-election in nine months; they can\u2019t wait nine years. The repeated recitation of the law\u2019s benefits hasn\u2019t changed the public\u2019s unfavorable views. That will only come over the years\u2014more than a handful of years, the president suggests\u2014if people\u2019s nightmares of higher premiums and losing their doctor don\u2019t come true.\n\nThe president has always been wary about the political timeline for the law, though he used to be considerably more bullish. In making his final pitch to Democrats on the eve of their vote, he called out the courage of Reps. John Boccieri and Betsy Markey, who were in tough districts but standing up for the law. The president suggested the praise they were getting portended a possible political upside for the vote. When Ted Deutch won the first congressional election after the health reform law passed, in April 2010, the president had a mini-gloat. \u201cNow look, I mean, let\u2019s not get too excited, it\u2019s a Democratic district. But to listen to the Republicans, they were warning over and over again [the Deutch race] would be a referendum on health care. \u2026 Well, maybe it was.\u201d Deutch, who represents the most Democratic-leaning district of the three (by a long shot), is still in office. Boccieri and Markey were defeated in the 2010 elections after the law passed.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The president tells Democrats posterity will praise them, even if voters don\u2019t.", "fb-share": "Now Even Obama Doesn\u2019t Want to Run on Obamacare", "sailthru.author": "John Dickerson", "description": "On Friday, President Obama visited the House Democratic Caucus Retreat, which was a change from contributing to it.
