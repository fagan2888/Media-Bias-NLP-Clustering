President Barack Obama made a comic online video — complete with silly faces and several shots with a selfie stick — that reminds Americans that they only have through Sunday to sign up this year for Obamacare.

A BuzzFeed video released Thursday shows the commander-in-chief speaking and checking himself out in front of a mirror, practicing his messaging that people should go to HealthCare.gov by Feb. 15 to get covered.

“In many cases, you can get health insurance for less than $100 a month,” Obama said, following several instances in which he trips up on the pronunciation of “February.” The video also shows the president making sketches of first lady Michelle Obama and donning aviator sunglasses.

After an appearance on “The Colbert Report” early in this year’s health law sign-up season, the president has been pretty low key about enrollment. This video — a follow-up perhaps to last year’s deadpan “Between Two Ferns” appearance with Zach Galifianakis — is the latest youth-focused effort on the part of the administration to boost sign-ups before the open enrollment period closes at midnight Pacific time Sunday.

So far, the administration says that more than 10 million people have selected plans through HealthCare.gov and the state exchanges, and it’s likely to surge as the deadline nears. The goal is to have more than 9 million people enrolled — meaning they’ve chosen and paid for plans — through this year.
