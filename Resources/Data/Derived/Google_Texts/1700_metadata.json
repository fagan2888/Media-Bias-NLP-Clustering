It will also include a Patient Caregiver Map that will provide details of the specialists involved in a patient's care.\n\nAlerts will help care-givers can respond to issues in a timely manner, whether it is missed appointments or a need to refill medications, the cloud firm added.\n\nRather than toggling between multiple systems, care-givers make smarter patient care decisions directly from the console by browsing tasks matched to individual patients and quickly acting upon them.\n\nIt also uses Salesforce Chatter to help care coordinators review internal conversations taking place around selected patients, ensuring collaboration across the care network.\n\nFinally, providers can easily segment and manage patient populations, such as setting reminders for patients with high-blood pressure to schedule regular check-ins.\n\n\u201cThe era of precision healthcare is upon us,\u201d said Joshua Newman, chief medical officer of Salesforce's healthcare and life sciences division.\n\n\u201cJust like we use precision medicine to target more personalised treatments for cancer and other diseases, precision healthcare is enabling our customers to develop more meaningful, accurate and long-term relationships with patients. Health Cloud is a huge step forward in our industry\u2019s transformation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Cloud Pro", "description": "Firm aims to build patient relationships through health tech apps", "title": "Salesforce's healthcare cloud 'gives full view of patient'", "url": "http://www.cloudpro.co.uk/collaboration/5328/salesforces-healthcare-cloud-gives-full-view-of-patient", "image": "http://cdn2.cloudpro.co.uk/sites/cloudprod7/files/health%20IT.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Firm aims to build patient relationships through health tech apps", "title": "Salesforce's healthcare cloud 'gives full view of patient'", "url": "http://www.cloudpro.co.uk/collaboration/5328/salesforces-healthcare-cloud-gives-full-view-of-patient", "image": "http://cdn2.cloudpro.co.uk/sites/cloudprod7/files/health%20IT.jpg", "site": "@cloudprouk", "card": "summary"}, "copyright": "Dennis Publishing Limited, licensed by Felden", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Firm aims to build patient relationships through health tech apps"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe era of precision healthcare is upon us,\u201d said Joshua Newman, chief medical officer of Salesforce's healthcare and life sciences division.\nIt will also include a Patient Caregiver Map that will provide details of the specialists involved in a patient's care.\nIt claimed its new Salesforce Health Cloud would help clinicians make smarter care decisions, engage with patients across their care-giver networks and manage patient data.\nThe platform enables healthcare providers to gain a complete view of the patient with integrated data from electronic medical records (EMRs), wearables and sources such as GP and hospital notes, according to Salesforce.\nIt will also help clinicians with patient information in Health Cloud's Timeline view, which enables them to understand the progression of a patient's recovery."}
