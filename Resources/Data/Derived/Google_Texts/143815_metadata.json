Alexander is a former governor and Education Department secretary who once ran for president, while Corker is a former businessman and mayor of Chattanooga.\n\nCorker was already the focus of a short-lived \u201ccharm offensive\u201d by the White House in 2013 that matched the president with small groups of Republicans in hopes of a fresh start early in his second term. He earned the rarest of presidential invitations: a round of golf.\n\nBut both have shown no reluctance to confront the president and say they won\u2019t hesitate to do so in the next two years.\n\n\u201cWhat better time could there be to be chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee than at a time when ... it\u2019s such an important area, not just for the United States but for the world, and at a time when no doubt the president\u2019s going to be active in that regard,\u201d Corker said in an interview.\n\nThe president\u2019s trip to Tennessee \u2014 his second in just over four weeks \u2014 is expected to focus on college affordability and job training, areas that also fall under the jurisdiction of Alexander\u2019s committee.\n\nObama announced late Thursday that he would roll out a plan to make two years of community college free, or nearly so.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to do is to see the first two years of community college free for everybody who is willing to work for it,\u201d he said in a video filmed on Air Force One and posted on Facebook.\n\nAlexander is showing the challenges newly empowered Republicans can pose to the president, or the potential partnership they can offer.\n\nHe is co-sponsoring legislation the president has threatened to veto that would change the definition of full-time employment under the president's signature healthcare law from 30 hours a week to 40 hours. A similar bill passed the House on Thursday.\n\nBut he\u2019s also sponsored new bills that would make it easier for students to apply for and pay off college student loans, a White House priority. In addition, Alexander will oversee two major, must-pass education initiatives this year: reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind program and a sweeping new higher education package.\n\nGiven Alexander\u2019s resume and previous service in a presidential administration, the senator isn\u2019t likely to be wooed by a flight on Air Force One.\n\n\u201cI just think the president\u2019s putting a spotlight on a very good idea in Tennessee,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s going and I\u2019m glad to be going with him.\u201d\n\nAlexander says education policy should be a focus for bipartisan cooperation in the next two years, in addition to trade, tax reform and infrastructure, the three areas most often cited by the White House and Republican leadership. It will be a topic that takes up much of the committee\u2019s time, though Alexander also said the panel was \u201cgoing to try to repair the damage that Obamacare has done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be as much agreement about that,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the optics of Friday\u2019s trip, the White House has been cool to the idea that the president might relaunch efforts to wine and dine his congressional opposition.\n\n\u201cIt worked great, didn\u2019t it?\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest joked this week of the last \u201ccharm offensive.\u201d\n\nAs Obama looks toward the end of his term and seeks to highlight legacy achievements, Republicans are beginning a campaign to replace him in the White House and preserve their new majorities. Key party leaders \u2014 Alexander among them \u2014 have acknowledged the need to rack up some bipartisan achievements that would show voters they are worthy of trust in 2016.\n\nBut \u201cit\u2019s important for the president to show that he can govern\u201d too, Alexander said.\n\nCorker, who has also clashed with the president in areas including housing, said that while his committee would closely monitor the president\u2019s foreign policy moves, the members wouldn\u2019t be knee-jerk obstructionists.\n\n\u201cThe Foreign Relations Committee is not a place where, because the president proposes something, the automatic reaction is negative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to prod and push and make sure that good policies are put forth. We do disagree with some, obviously. But \u2026 the first reaction is to seek understanding and to see if this furthers our national interests, but not one of negativity.\u201d\n\nmichael.memoli@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @mikememoli", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Key Republican senators will join Obama in Tennessee", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "When President Obama travels to Tennessee on Friday, Air Force One will be carrying some unusual cargo: Republicans.", "title": "Key Republican senators will join Obama in Tennessee", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-obama-tennessee-republicans-20150108-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54aea617/turbine/la-pn-obama-tennessee-republicans-20150108", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obama, Lamar Alexander, Bob Corker", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82486959", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-01-08", "Description": "When President Obama travels to Tennessee on Friday, Air Force One will be carrying some unusual cargo: Republicans.
