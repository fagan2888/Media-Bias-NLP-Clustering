Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTwo days into a government shutdown that has put more than 800,000 federal workers on furlough and agencies in crisis mode, President Barack Obama met privately at the White House with the heads of the nation's top banks on Wednesday to discuss the economic impasse.\n\nObama hopes to enlist the executives\u2019 support as he urges congressional action to resolve the government shutdown and to avoid breaching the Oct. 17 deadline to raise the nation\u2019s debt limit \u2014 a situation that could batter financial markets around the world.\n\nAlthough the meeting was planned before this week's shutdown, it comes as Republicans in the House of Representatives continue refusing to allow a vote on a temporary spending resolution to fund the government. Many Republicans, including Speaker of the House John Boehner, want any bill that\u2019s passed to include a delay of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. Obama and the Democrats have refused to work with such a measure.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: Obama, lawmakers to meet on government shutdown\n\nShortly before the meeting Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said he \"would love to see a resolution\" to the shutdown. Afterward, Lloyd Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, warned about the consequences of a failure to resolve the crisis. \"We shouldn't use the threat of causing the U.S. to fail on its obligations to repay its debt as a cudgel,\" he told reporters outside the White House.\n\nAmid the government shutdown and ahead of the looming debt ceiling debate, the U.S. Treasury on Tuesday started using its last tools for pushing back the date when the government will run out of legal borrowing authority, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said.\n\nIn a letter to lawmakers, Lew said the Treasury Department was suspending some reinvestments of a government currency exchange fund, and would enter into a debt swap with the Federal Financing Bank and the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.\n\nLew said that these measures would allow the government to continue operating below its $16.7 trillion debt limit for a little while longer \u2014 but that by Oct. 17, the government will have exhausted its borrowing authority and will be left with about $30 billion in cash to pay the nation's bills.\n\nIf Congress fails to raise the $16.7 trillion borrowing cap, the United States \u2014 the world\u2019s largest economy \u2014 would go into default, potentially sending shock waves through international financial markets. The Obama administration has been unequivocal in its refusal to negotiate on the debt limit or to link raising it to a particular set of budget priorities.\n\nSome conservative Republicans have signaled that they may use the same tactic on the debt limit that they have used on government funding.\n\nPaul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the influential House Budget Committee, made the link explicit to reporters Tuesday. \"We have a debt limit coming,\" he said. \"Most budget agreements in the past have always involved debt limit increases.\n\n\"That's what we think we need,\u201d he said, \u201ca forcing action to bring two parties together.\u201d\n\nBut some groups that have traditionally been at odds with the president\u2019s policies, including over regulation and health care, are urging the passage of a budget and a subsequent raising of the debt ceiling.\n\nEven as the White House meeting appeared to shore up some support from executives of the nation\u2019s top banks, The Associated Press reported that the American Chamber of Commerce, which has been a critic of the president\u2019s health care plan and tax policies, sent Congress a letter \u2014 signed by more than 250 business groups \u2014 urging an end to the shutdown and a raising of the debt ceiling.\n\nWhile the letter made a point of criticizing some of the president\u2019s policies regarding entitlement programs and unsustainable levels of government debt, it said the debt ceiling must be raised \u201cin a timely manner\u201d in order to \u201cremove any threat to the full faith and credit of the United States government.\"\n\nStill, some conservative Republicans are unlikely to be swayed.\n\nRep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., told the AP that \u201cit wouldn't make any difference\u201d to him if big business thought the government shutdown was adversely affecting the economy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President meets with banking and business leaders on 2nd day of government shutdown", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/2/as-shutdown-continuesobamameetswithleadingbankersoneconomy.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/2/as-shutdown-continuesobamameetswithleadingbankersoneconomy/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.banks_whitehousemeeting.1380750909653.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "President meets with banking and business leaders on 2nd day of government shutdown", "title": "Obama banks on big business to help end deadlock"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/2/as-shutdown-continuesobamameetswithleadingbankersoneconomy/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.banks_whitehousemeeting.1380750909653.jpg", "description": "President meets with banking and business leaders on 2nd day of government shutdown", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama banks on big business to help end deadlock"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Republican Party, Shutdown, Wall Street, The White House, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the influential House Budget Committee, made the link explicit to reporters Tuesday.\nJamie Dimon, left, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, arrives for a meeting of top bankers with President Barack Obama at the White House on Wednesday.\nSome conservative Republicans have signaled that they may use the same tactic on the debt limit that they have used on government funding.\n\"We have a debt limit coming,\" he said.\nThe Obama administration has been unequivocal in its refusal to negotiate on the debt limit or to link raising it to a particular set of budget priorities."}
