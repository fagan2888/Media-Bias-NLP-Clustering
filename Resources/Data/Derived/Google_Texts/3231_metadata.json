It is my opinion and Dr. (Daniel) Slobodianik\u2019s opinion that liposuction will harm patients, a hot laser will cause the silicone to break, and then it hydrodissects and then it spreads,\u201d Dr. Tansar Mir, a plastic surgeon who treated Ouk at Lennox Hill Hospital, told LiveScience in the video.\n\nThe goal for Mir would be to remove any kind of foreign bodies that they might find. That way, they can go in and properly redo the butt lift surgery. He attributes the desire for butt enhancement to popular culture\u2019s increasing fascination with celebrities having abnormally large backsides.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get plastic surgery, do it the right way,\u201d Ouk said. \u201cPay the money to do it. Don\u2019t look for the easy way out. If it\u2019s going to cost you $10,000 to get the surgery that you want, then pay that. If it\u2019s something like $2,000, then you\u2019re gonna get what you pay for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "florida, woman, receives, silicone, injections, butt, enhancement, and, things, go, terribly", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Florida woman suffered debilitating side effects after receiving silicone butt enhancement injections from someone who claimed to be a licensed medical doctor.", "title": "What Happens When Silicone Butt Injections Go Wrong [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/florida-woman-receives-silicone-injections-butt-enhancement-and-things-go-terribly-340154", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/26/florida-woman-receives-silicone-injections-butt-enhancement-and-things-go-terribly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Florida woman suffered debilitating side effects after receiving silicone butt enhancement injections from someone who claimed to be a licensed medical doctor.", "title": "What Happens When Silicone Butt Injections Go Wrong [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/florida-woman-receives-silicone-injections-butt-enhancement-and-things-go-terribly-340154", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/26/florida-woman-receives-silicone-injections-butt-enhancement-and-things-go-terribly.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/26/florida-woman-receives-silicone-injections-butt-enhancement-and-things-go-terribly.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-06-27T19:27:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-27T19:26:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Florida woman suffered debilitating side effects after receiving silicone butt enhancement injections from someone who claimed to be a licensed medical doctor."}, "article_summary": "A Florida woman suffered the nasty side effects of a botched butt enhancement, after receiving injections from a person who claimed to be a licensed doctor.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get plastic surgery, do it the right way,\u201d Ouk said.\n\u201cOne of the more commonly performed methods for silicone extractions involves liposuction with the use of hot or cold lasers.\nHe attributes the desire for butt enhancement to popular culture\u2019s increasing fascination with celebrities having abnormally large backsides.\nThat way, they can go in and properly redo the butt lift surgery."}
