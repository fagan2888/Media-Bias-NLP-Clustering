The fact is, maybe they did not do that here. I am I will tell you, I\u2019m so shocked I cannot believe it. This is detective 101 for crying out loud. And now we have what looks like dozens of people in there totally destroying a crime scene, which is still vital in this investigation.\u201d\n\nThe landlord, Doyle Miller, told CNN, \u201cThis is unreal. And I need to assess the damage. It\u2019s a lot worse than what I thought.\u201d\n\nDespite the FBI\u2019s subsequent announcement that the scene had been clear, other agencies seemed gobsmacked that journalists had been able to wander through the house and tamper with personal property as well as possible evidence. When contacted by the online news outlet Grasswire, Deputy Olivia Bozek, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. That is not a cleared crime scene. There\u2019s still an active investigation going on.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, outside expert observers had a hard time believing that house should have been made available to either the owner, journalists, or the general public. The New York Daily News described how \u201csecurity consultants on cable news watched the live feed in horror, slamming the moment as the destruction and contamination of a major crime scene. One even said that allowing the media to defile the scene he most \u2018shocking screwup in police history\u2019 and could not understand why cops on any level would have allowed such a thing to happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Everyone responsible for this should feel deeply ashamed,\" said independent journalist Allison Kilkenny in reaction to bizarre episode., journalists, media, Syed Farook, Tashfeen Malik,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jon Queally | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "\"Everyone responsible for this should feel deeply ashamed,\" said independent journalist Allison Kilkenny in reaction to bizarre episode., journalists, media, Syed Farook, Tashfeen Malik,", "title": "Crime Scene Becomes Media Circus As 'Journalists' Rifle Through Shooters' Home", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/crime-scene-becomes-media-circus-as-journalists-rifle-through-shooters-home/211827/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shame_msnbc.png", "updated_time": "2015-12-04T18:28:57-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Everyone responsible for this should feel deeply ashamed,\" said independent journalist Allison Kilkenny in reaction to bizarre episode., journalists, media, Syed Farook, Tashfeen Malik,", "creator": "@jonqueally", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shame_msnbc.png", "title": "Crime Scene Becomes Media Circus As 'Journalists' Rifle Through Shooters' Home", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Tashfeen Malik", "published_time": "2015-12-05T05:00:44-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-04T18:28:57-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "That is not a cleared crime scene.\nhttps://t.co/AosKV54gVh \u2014 Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) December 4, 2015CNN guy up in arms abt crime scene not shut down, but CNN cameras still going through everything.\nThe New York Daily News described how \u201csecurity consultants on cable news watched the live feed in horror, slamming the moment as the destruction and contamination of a major crime scene.\nAnd now we have what looks like dozens of people in there totally destroying a crime scene, which is still vital in this investigation.\u201dThe landlord, Doyle Miller, told CNN, \u201cThis is unreal.\nFor those who can\u2019t see it, reporters swarming through the attackers apt, rummaging through stuff, speculating about what they\u2019re seeing."}
