With the high court set to rule on the issue by June, she said it \u201cwould not take a large adjustment\u201d for Americans should the justices say that gay marriage is a constitutional right.\n\n\u201cThe change in people\u2019s attitudes on that issue has been enormous,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cIn recent years, people have said, \u2018This is the way I am.\u2019 And others looked around, and we discovered it\u2019s our next-door neighbor -- we\u2019re very fond of them. Or it\u2019s our child\u2019s best friend, or even our child. I think that as more and more people came out and said that \u2018this is who I am,\u2019 the rest of us recognized that they are one of us.\u201d\n\nThe number of gay-marriage states has soared in recent years, largely because of court rulings. Only 12 states permitted such unions in June 2013, when the Supreme Court threw out part of a law that denied federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. The majority\u2019s reasoning in that case prompted lower courts to strike down bans on gay marriage.\n\nGinsburg joined the majority in that case. Later that year, she became the first Supreme Court justice to officiate at a same-sex wedding, in Washington.\n\nObama Support\n\nObama came out in favor of gay weddings in 2012, and he told BuzzFeed News Tuesday that he expects the court will agree.\n\n\u201cSame-sex couples should have the same rights as anybody else\u201d under the equal protection clause of the Constitution, the president said.\n\nGinsburg said she met Obama soon after he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004. Her son, James, had worked on Obama\u2019s campaign, and Ginsburg asked to be seated next to him when the justices held their traditional dinner for new members of the Senate.\n\n\u201cThere was a rapport from the start between us,\u201d said Ginsburg, who receives a hug from the president every year as he walks to the podium to deliver his State of the Union address.\n\nThe high court upheld Obama\u2019s health-care law in 2012, only to agree to hear a new challenge during the current nine-month term. The latest dispute seeks to gut the law by barring people in most of the country from receiving the tax credits designed to make insurance affordable.\n\nObamacare Legacy\n\nAsked about the president\u2019s legacy, Ginsburg pointed to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which she voted to uphold in the 2012 case.\n\n\u201cOur country was just about the only Western industrialized country that didn\u2019t have universal health care for all of the people, and he made the first giant step in that direction,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly one of the things he will be remembered for.\u201d\n\nGinsburg declined to speak directly about the new health-care case, set for argument March 4.\n\nGinsburg, the oldest justice and a two-time cancer survivor, said she has no plans to retire.\n\n\u201cI think I should do this job as long as I can do it full steam,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I begin to slow down, I think I will know. It hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Greg Stohr and Matthew Winkler", "twitter": {"description": "Americans are prepared to accept a U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, pointing to what she described as a sweeping change in attitudes toward gays.", "title": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg Thinks Americans Are Ready for Gay Marriage", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-12/ginsburg-says-u-s-ready-to-accept-ruling-approving-gay-marriage-i61z6gq2", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ikpSlXlgItFY/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Greg Stohr and Matthew Winkler", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Law,Barack H Obama,Supreme Court,Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "news_keywords": "Law,Barack H Obama,Supreme Court,Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-12/ginsburg-says-u-s-ready-to-accept-ruling-approving-gay-marriage-i61z6gq2", "parsely-title": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg Thinks Americans Are Ready for Gay Marriage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-12T10:00:00.004Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Americans are prepared to accept a U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, pointing to what she described as a sweeping change in attitudes toward gays.", "parsely-tags": "Law,Barack H Obama,Supreme Court,Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-02-12T10:00:00.004Z", "parsely-section": "world", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Americans are prepared to accept a U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, pointing to what she described as a sweeping change in attitudes toward gays.", "title": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg Thinks Americans Are Ready for Gay Marriage", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-12/ginsburg-says-u-s-ready-to-accept-ruling-approving-gay-marriage-i61z6gq2", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ikpSlXlgItFY/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Americans are prepared to accept a U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, pointing to what she described as a sweeping change in attitudes toward gays."}, "parsely-post-id": "NJMWY46JIJUU01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ikpSlXlgItFY/v2/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdae0\"", "article_summary": "Americans are prepared to accept a U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, pointing to what she described as a sweeping change in attitudes toward gays.\nLater that year, she became the first Supreme Court justice to officiate at a same-sex wedding, in Washington.\nThe high court upheld Obama\u2019s health-care law in 2012, only to agree to hear a new challenge during the current nine-month term.\nThe majority\u2019s reasoning in that case prompted lower courts to strike down bans on gay marriage.\nGinsburg, the oldest justice and a two-time cancer survivor, said she has no plans to retire."}
