Patrick Kennedy led a discussion on the future of mental health, ranging for improvements in brain research, insurance coverage for mental health treatment and breaking the stigma of mental illness.\n\n\u201cEveryone can benefit from having a better understanding to mental illness,\u201d Kennedy said, in a plea to treat mental illness just like any other illness.\n\nKennedy sponsored the Mental Health Parity Act of 2008, which requires insurance companies to pay for mental health treatment equally as they do for physical illnesses. Because of federal rulemaking, the law has only been in place for about one year.\n\n\u201cWe may not be able to get rid us of the societal biases against people with mental illness, but we can make sure that people are not legally discriminated against,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\n\u201cWith the parity law, it\u2019s not just about trying to change attitudes. We can make sure the insurance companies follow the law and we can improve the lives of millions who are currently not getting treatment,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nThe proof is in the results, Kennedy said.\n\n\u201cOur best supporters of parity are Wall Street companies who can\u2019t afford to have workers depressed and missing work,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThey know that employee is not going to be as productive and it will cost them money.\u201d\n\nThe economic bottom line also is why he thinks that Florida lawmakers will eventually expand Medicaid eligibility by taking federal dollars from the Affordable Care Act. Currently, state lawmakers have refused to accept $51 billion in federal funds to expand Medicaid coverage to about 800,000 low-income Floridians.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that the numbers will validate the most economic ways to take care of people, and whether or not to expand coverage will become less of a philosophical argument about whether you think that people should be treated with human dignity, to what is the most cost effective way to limit my liability for your illness,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nIt is a cold argument, Kennedy said, but \u201cthe politics of the decision will be taken out as the numbers prove the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes a lot more financial sense to keep people healthy, and in business, it\u2019s all about the bottom line.\u201d\n\nIn addition to championing coverage of mental illness treatment, Kennedy also detailed his plans to lead the way on brain research. Through The Kennedy Forum, launched on the 50th anniversary of his uncle John F. Kennedy\u2019s announcing of the mission to the moon, Kennedy is convening leading brain researchers to unlock the mysteries of the brain, calling it a journey into \u201cinner space.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t put a value on the most important research we can do in the nation, which is to understand everything from Alzheimer\u2019s to autism to addiction,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe need a NASA for the race to \u2018inner space,\u2019 \u201d or brain research.\u201d\n\nHe also plans to support research into traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans, and use that research to better understand other brain illness such as dementia and Parkinson\u2019s disease. He called the research into battlefield mental illnesses our \u201cSputnik moment\u201d for brain research.\n\n\u201cThe Sputnik for our research into inner space is the signature wound of war in Iraq and Afghanistan-post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is taking our heroes\u2019 lives in record numbers. They\u2019re still suffering even after they come home. It is our obligation as a nation to better understand and treat these illnesses \u2014 it\u2019s a national security issue,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nAt the free event, hosted by the Mental Health Community Centers Inc., a Sarasota-based nonprofit that provides support services for people with mental illness, Kennedy also shared stories from his past struggles with mental illness and addiction.\n\nKennedy has been treated for addiction to painkillers and diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and detailed his experience growing up around his mother, Joan Bennett Kennedy, who was an alcoholic and severely depressed, and his father, Ted Kennedy, who wore a bulletproof vest daily after his brother was assassinated.\n\n\u201cI watched my mother paralyzed by alcoholism and a mood disorder, and as she walked through the house at 2 p.m. in her terrycloth robe, obliterated, everyone turned away,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThis disease isolates you, because what we all do is turn away.\u201d\n\nHe advocated for teaching better coping skills to children so they can better handle life\u2019s struggles.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s trauma all around us, and unless we help children out, they\u2019ll carry the wounds for the rest of their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to teach them how to be in touch with their mental health so they know they can get help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "To a packed house at the Sarasota Opera House, former Rep.
