It is one of many Affordable Care Act programs Medicare is implementing to pay for quality instead of quantity. The program ties a portion of payments to hospitals\u2019 performance on certain quality measures such as death within 30 days after a heart attack and patient experience of care.\n\nCongress authorized Inpatient Hospital VBP within the Affordable Care Act. CMS states value-based purchasing accompanies payment systems accounting for the greatest share of Medicare spending. The program utilizes the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program\u2019s hospital quality data reporting infrastructure.\n\nApproximately 3,500 hospitals nationwide expect affected payments for inpatient stays. Participating hospitals receive payments based on care quality \u2014 not just magnitude \u2014 for inpatient acute care services provided.\n\nThe Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) recently announced expectations for value-based goals and timelines as part of the movement away from fee-for-service reimbursement.\n\nAnticipated future goals by 2016\u2019s end include the possibility that 30 percent of fee-for-service Medicare payments will become value-based payments via bundled payment arrangements, ACOs, or similar alternative payment models. This number is expected to rise to 50 percent of payments before the beginning of 2019.\n\nHHS proposes a goal for VBP and the Hospital Readmissions Reduction programs to shift 85 percent of traditional Medicare payments to become quality-based by 2016 with a heavier 90 percent shift possible by 2018.\n\nDefining ACOs and the forms they take\n\nPatients deserve professional respect and personal consideration from medical professionals who best comprehend how to provide \u201cthe right care at the right time, while avoiding unnecessary duplication of services and preventing medical errors.\u201d That\u2019s the belief at CMS.\n\nAt that most general level, accountable care organizations (ACOs) are units ofhealthcare providers \u2014 including doctors and hospitals \u2014 who voluntarily collaborate to \u201censure that patients, especially the chronically ill, get the right care at the right time, while avoiding unnecessary duplication of services and preventing medical errors,\u201d according to CMS. Ultimately, the end-result of a successful ACO is shared savings for both payers and providers.\n\nMedicare offers three different ACO programs to help meet and exceed such objectives.\n\nFirst is the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) which CMS explains \u201cis designed to improve beneficiary outcomes and increase value of care by \u201c[facilitates] coordination and cooperation among providers to improve the quality of care for Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) beneficiaries and reduce unnecessary costs.\u201d It is also promotes accountability for Medicare FFS beneficiaries\u2019 care, requires coordinated care for all services provided under Medicare FFS, and encourages investment in infrastructure and redesigned care processes.\n\nAlthough participation is voluntary, CMS notes that MSSP \u201cwill reward ACOs that lower their growth in health care costs while meeting performance standards on quality of care and putting patients first.\u201d\n\nSecond is the Advance Payment ACO Model catering to \u201cphysician-based and rural providers who have come together voluntarily to give coordinated high quality care to the Medicare patients they serve,\u201d says CMS.\n\nParticipants will upfront, monthly payments for them to invest in care coordination tools and services. Currently, 35 ACOs are participating and receiving three types of payment advances: upfront/fixed payment, upfront/variable payment based on the number of historically-assigned beneficiaries, or a varying monthly payment contingent on ACO size.\n\nLast is the Pioneer ACO Model, the most aggressive of all CMS-backed ACOs and a program no longer accepting applications. This early adopter model allows provider groups \u201cto move rapidly from a shared savings payment model to a population-based payment model on a track consistent with, but separate from, the Medicare Shared Services Program,\u201d the federal agency explains.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Improving quality and efficiency of medical care promotes reimbursement in regards to accountable care models and accountable care organizations.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/history-of-value-based-accountable-care-models-at-cms", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2014-10-15-Cash.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "History of Value-Based, Accountable Care Models at CMS"}, "twitter": {"description": "Improving quality and efficiency of medical care promotes reimbursement in regards to accountable care models and accountable care organizations.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2014-10-15-Cash.jpg"}, "title": "History of Value-Based, Accountable Care Models at CMS", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd8e\"", "article_summary": "Participating hospitals receive payments based on care quality \u2014 not just magnitude \u2014 for inpatient acute care services provided.\nThe program utilizes the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program\u2019s hospital quality data reporting infrastructure.\nAnticipated future goals by 2016\u2019s end include the possibility that 30 percent of fee-for-service Medicare payments will become value-based payments via bundled payment arrangements, ACOs, or similar alternative payment models.\nIt is one of many Affordable Care Act programs Medicare is implementing to pay for quality instead of quantity.\nCMS states value-based purchasing accompanies payment systems accounting for the greatest share of Medicare spending."}
