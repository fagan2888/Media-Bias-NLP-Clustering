That's just a few miles east-southeast of Pratt.\n\nThe Kansas Highway Patrol said the pilot was attempting to land on a private runway when his propeller hit the dirt, causing the plane to overturn.\n\nThe 85-year-old pilot was pronounced dead at the scene. Troopers identified him as Harrison Dale Rosenbaum of Pratt. He was the only person on board.\n\nPeople in the community say this is surprising, because Rosenbaum was an accomplished pilot who's held a commercial pilots license for many years.\n\nNeighbors say he flew just about every Saturday. This time they saw him take off and land, but didn't hear any noise from the crash.\n\nInvestigators from the NTSB are expected to arrive on scene Sunday morning.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The 85-year-old pilot was pronounced dead at the scene.
