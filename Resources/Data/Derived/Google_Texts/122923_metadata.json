She repeatedly wrote her supervisors about what she considered unconscionable delays in care for mental health patients. ( Heidi de Marco/KHN )\n\nAfter the state of California fined her employer $4 million in 2013 for violating the legal rights of mental health patients, Oakland psychologist Melinda Ginne expected her job \u2014 and her patients\u2019 lives \u2014 to get better.\n\nInstead, she said, things got worse.\n\nWithin months, Ginne, a whistleblower in the 2013 case, was back to writing her supervisors at Kaiser Permanente about what she considered unconscionable delays in care. Some patients might not live long enough to make the next available appointment, she said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell a family whose elderly mother is declining that I can\u2019t provide treatment until 2014,\u201d she wrote to her managers at the Kaiser Medical Center in Oakland in September 2013.\n\nIn February, two years after assessing the second largest fine in its history, the California Department of Managed Health Care stepped in again, finding that Kaiser had improved somewhat but still was short-changing patients on mental health care. The state is considering another fine against the health maintenance organization.\n\nCalifornia has taken perhaps the most proactive stance in the nation in enforcing laws to ensure people with mental illnesses have fair and timely access to care. But even in this state, it\u2019s proving difficult to ensure mental patients truly have equal access to treatment.\n\nParity laws, including a sweeping measure passed by the federal government in 2008 and an older California law, require insurers to provide mental health and substance abuse benefits on par with the coverage they offer for other medical care. And a separate state law requires insurers to provide patients with access to mental treatment within a specific timeframe \u2013 48 hours for an urgent visit and 10 business days for a non-urgent one.\n\nAfter the 2013 fine, Kaiser patients continued to face not just ongoing delays \u2013 they also faced arbitrary limits on treatment in direct violation of the state\u2019s parity statute, officials found. The law was intended to prevent such things as annual caps on patient visits that would not typically be faced, for instance, by patient with another chronic illness such as diabetes or heart disease. Yet, according to the 2015 report, some Kaiser staffers told mental health patients that they were not entitled to long-term individual therapy \u2014 ever.\n\n\u201cNo one ever sees a therapist once a week in the Kaiser Health Plan,\u201d according to a 2014 email a Kaiser psychologist sent to a patient, which was cited in the state\u2019s most recent report. \u201cNot a covered benefit for the past 20-something years and will not be a benefit in the future.\u201d\n\nDr. Mason Turner, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Associate Director of Regional Mental Health for Northern California, said that the organization has fixed the problems identified by the state.\n\n\u201cBetween the time the DMHC made their [initial] findings and now, we\u2019ve made substantial improvements, hired many more staff, and really put into place a lot of mechanisms to address the initial concerns that were brought up,\u201d Turner said in April.\n\nThe access problems, he said, were caused by an increase in demand, which rose in part because of the influx of new enrollees under the Affordable Care Act. In response, he said, Kaiser increased the ranks of therapists by 25 percent and arranged to contract with outside therapists when necessary.\n\nThe actions against Kaiser highlight both how far California has come in ensuring equal treatment for mental health patients and how far it has yet to go.\n\nOn one hand, after many years of \u201cabysmal\u201d enforcement, \u201cnow we have regulators who seem to be enthusiastic,\u201d said Randall Hagar, director of government relations for the California Psychiatric Association.\n\nHagar gives credit to managed health care department director Shelley Rouillard, who spent 20 years in consumer advocacy before joining the department in 2011 and becoming director in 2013. On the other hand, critics say, Rouillard and her staff are making slow progress at best.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the \u2018pace car\u2019 states, and it\u2019s still slow going,\u201d said Carol McDaid, who runs the Parity Implementation Coalition, an advocacy group made up of addiction and mental health consumer and provider organizations.\n\nHolding Insurers Accountable\n\nSoon after they fined Kaiser in 2013, California officials realized the problems with unequal coverage of mental health were much broader.\n\nFor years, California, like most states and the federal government, relied on consumers to bring complaints alleging that their rights had been violated under parity laws. State regulators grew concerned that the approach was too passive \u2014 few consumers were complaining, perhaps because of the stigma attached to mental illness.\n\nSo as a first step, the department of managed health care last year began requiring insurers under its watch to show \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 that they were complying with federal parity law.\n\nThe results were not encouraging: Of 26 managed care insurers, from Aetna to Western Health Advantage, zero were able to prove that they were fully in compliance. Most filed incomplete or flawed documents, state officials said.\n\n\u201cIt is rather shocking,\u201d Rouillard said.\n\nPart of the problem, Rouillard said, is that the federal government did not release the final regulations dictating how its parity law should be enforced until November 2013 \u2013 five years after the law was passed.\n\nIn addition to the flawed and incomplete paperwork, her department found insurers trying to control costs in ways that could be discriminatory \u2014 for example, by limiting the number of days a patient could receive inpatient care for a mental health condition.\n\n\u201cMental health services are still sort of a second class benefit as far as the health plans are concerned,\u201d Rouillard said.\n\nAt this point, Rouillard says the managed care plans she regulates are in varying stages of compliance with the federal parity law. Just one plan, Health Net, has so far been able to prove on paper that its benefits fully comply. Rouillard says she expects the other plans to follow suit by the end of the year, and in 2016, the department plans a more intensive review.\n\nCharles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, disputed that insurers see mental health a second-tier benefit. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to providing this coverage for our enrollees. It\u2019s very important, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working hard to do,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the law poses a huge challenge for health plans, he said, in part because the science underpinning diagnosis and treatment of mental illness is constantly evolving. In addition, health plans are trying to adapt not just to parity law but to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which has transformed the national insurance landscape.\n\nEven so, he said, \u201cI think by the end of this year, all the plans will have filed the right documents and will have approval from the department, and this will be something that\u2019s in the rearview mirror.\u201d\n\n\u2018A Societal Problem\u2019\n\nFinding that her situation did not improve even after the first investigation of Kaiser in 2015, psychologist Ginne made a request of her managers \u2014 copied to Rouillard \u2014 that December. She asked that six of her sickest patients be transferred to other providers who could see them more frequently.\n\nOne of them, an elderly man with dementia and depression, was hallucinating \u201cfully-formed humans,\u201d Ginne said in an interview. One day, he wandered down the block at 5 am in his pajamas, panicked, and flagged down a truck driver who called the police.\n\n\u201cHe was a danger to himself,\u201d Ginne said.\n\nAccording to Ginne, the backup in appointments meant she could see him for individual therapy only once every few months. The man had been assigned to regular group therapy for depression, which Ginne felt was inappropriate for his condition.\n\nWhen her supervisors did not transfer the man to another individual therapy provider, Ginne reported the case to Adult Protective Services, because she said she believed him to be imminent danger.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s such a bad solution,\u201d she said, shaking her head. Ultimately, he and his wife decided to quit therapy entirely.\n\nRouillard said that many managed care plans have a long way to go to ensure fair and equal access to mental health care for Californians. But she also said there\u2019s only so much her department can do.\n\nAccess to care at companies like Kaiser is also an issue of capacity \u2013 and that\u2019s not within the department\u2019s purview, she said.\n\n\u201cThere just aren\u2019t enough therapists to see everyone who needs help,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just a plan problem; it\u2019s a societal problem. And that is really the crux of the matter. We\u2019re trying to address a problem that is beyond our ability to fix, and that is a challenge.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit news organization covering health care policy and politics.
