(REUTERS/Yuri Gripas)\n\nIt was billed as a \u201cMillennial Town Hall,\u201d and it, of course, came with a hashtag and a Snapchat filter.\n\nBut Paul Ryan\u2019s appearance Wednesday at Georgetown University was, in essence, a pep talk for a generation of voters more dismayed than most at the direction of the Republican party\u2019s presidential race.\n\nOne Georgetown student got to the heart of matter early in the 45-minute Q&A session: \u201cI\u2019ll never support Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz does very little to appeal to me as a young voter. So I ask you: What advice or reasons for optimism could you offer to young Republicans such as myself who find it very difficult to support either of the two leading candidates for our party\u2019s nomination?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Ryan replied, \u201cit\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve had this question.\u201d\n\nThe crowd chuckled in the wood-paneled confines of Georgetown\u2019s Gaston Hall, on a campus that has long attracted young conservatives in the Alex P. Keaton mold \u2014 the bright, well-read and well-raised children of Republicans, much like Ryan himself. Though presidential front-runner Donald Trump had just finished delivering a foreign policy speech just a couple of miles away when Ryan took the stage, culturally, he was speaking in a different land.\n\n[Inside Paul Ryan\u2019s quest to set the Republican agenda]\n\nAnd after making his usual pains to declare his neutrality in the presidential race, Ryan made his case: \u201cLook at the ideas. Look at the platform that is being advanced,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at what it is we are presenting the country later this summer before [the Republican National Convention in] Cleveland. \u2026 Look at the policies, not at the person necessarily, because it\u2019s the policies that matter so much.\u201d\n\nRyan went on to pitch his belief in the politically redemptive power of ideas \u2014 specifically, the policy agenda that House Republicans are planning to roll out before the party convention in July \u2014 and he won applause when he renounced the \u201cmakers and takers\u201d rhetoric he once favored and when he rejected a student\u2019s suggestion that a recent House decision to remove the Mississippi state flag from a Capitol corridor amounted to \u201crenewed northern Republican reconstruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Capitol, if we\u2019re going to have symbols, we\u2019re going to have symbols that unify people and don\u2019t divide people,\u201d he said.\n\nBut in a broader range of questions from students skeptical of Ryan\u2019s policy prescriptions, he had a more complicated time playing ambassador for conservatism.\n\nWhen one student asked about rising levels of student debt, Ryan dismissed Democratic proposals for free community college and instead spoke about the downside of third-party payment regimes and the need to break up the \u201ccollege cartel\u201d to more easily allow transfers of credits. A question about climate change was met with mentions of \u201cclean coal technology\u201d and the need for scientific research \u201cto innovate our way into a cleaner economy\u201d and a dismissal of any federal carbon tax or cap-and-trade system.\n\nWhen one student asked how Republicans would replace Obamacare\u2019s prohibition on insurance denials for pre-existing conditions, Ryan sketched out how a system of state-based \u201crisk pools\u201d might work. And when another student confronted Ryan with the examples of Arizona and Kansas \u2014 where Republican-controlled state governments implemented GOP policies with decidedly mixed results \u2014 he pivoted to his favorite subject: tax reform.\n\n\u201cBecause we believe limited government doesn\u2019t mean we believe in no government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want government to be effective at what it does. We don\u2019t want government to stretch itself beyond where it should be.\u201d\n\nIf the larger point of Ryan\u2019s Georgetown visit was to ease the despair of young conservatives, though, there were signs of success.\n\nRyan Shymansky, a Georgetown senior majoring in government, attended the forum and described himself as \u201ca Republican until the Republicans nominate Donald Trump,\u201d and he said he took heart from Ryan\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cI get the sense that, even if he won\u2019t openly admit it, that he\u2019s not about to vote for Donald Trump, either,\u201d Shymansky said. \u201cI think that he represents what this party can be. I just think we have to get to the point where we\u2019re willing to accept that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "hough presidential front-runner Donald Trump had just finished delivering a foreign policy speech just a couple of miles away when Ryan took the stage, culturally, he was speaking in a different land.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "hough presidential front-runner Donald Trump had just finished delivering a foreign policy speech just a couple of miles away when Ryan took the stage, culturally, he was speaking in a different land.", "title": "Paul Ryan to millennials: \u2018Look at the policies, not at the person\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/04/27/paul-ryan-gives-conservative-millennials-a-pep-talk/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-04-27/Reuters/2016-04-27T185158Z_01_WAS824_RTRIDSP_3_USA-POLITICS-RYAN.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mikedebonis"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Paul Ryan, Georgetown University, Donald Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Paul Ryan, Georgetown University, Donald Trump"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2380\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI get the sense that, even if he won\u2019t openly admit it, that he\u2019s not about to vote for Donald Trump, either,\u201d Shymansky said.\nU.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) speaks during a town hall with millennials at the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service in Washington, U.S. April 27, 2016.\n[Inside Paul Ryan\u2019s quest to set the Republican agenda]And after making his usual pains to declare his neutrality in the presidential race, Ryan made his case: \u201cLook at the ideas.\n\u201cLook at what it is we are presenting the country later this summer before [the Republican National Convention in] Cleveland.\nThough presidential front-runner Donald Trump had just finished delivering a foreign policy speech just a couple of miles away when Ryan took the stage, culturally, he was speaking in a different land."}
