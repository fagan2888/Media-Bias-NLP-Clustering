As of 2010, there were 40 million people in this age group, and many of them will be emergency patients at some point.\"\n\nThe four groups fine-tuned the guidelines over the past two years in response to the aging population and its effect on healthcare costs. Geriatric emergency department (ED) patients account for 43 percent of all hospital admissions, and they tend to have longer ED stays and use more resources, according to the statement. Similar programs targeted at specific age groups, such as pediatrics, and conditions like strokes or trauma, resulted in improvement of care at the individual emergency room (ER) and system-wide level, according to the statement.\n\n\"Our advice to healthcare systems with limited resources is to make the entire emergency department a geriatric emergency department,\" said Mark Rosenberg, D.O., geriatric emergency medicine chief at St. Joseph's Healthcare System in Paterson, N.J., and chair of ACEP's task force for geriatric ED guidelines. \"If the ER is designed for the most frail and vulnerable, it will work for the strongest patients as well.\"\n\nThere are currently about 50 geriatric ERs operating nationwide, with another 150 in development, and older adults make up 25 percent of ER visitors, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the guidelines (.pdf)\n\n- here's the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nGeriatric ER popularity grows to meet demand\n\nDo EDs help or harm older patients?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four medical groups issued new standardized\u00a0geriatric\u00a0emergency care\u00a0guidelines\u00a0that outline how to set up programs and deliver care to this growing population,", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Four medical groups issued new standardized\u00a0geriatric\u00a0emergency care\u00a0guidelines\u00a0that outline how to set up programs and deliver care to this growing population,", "title": "Medical groups issue new geriatric ER guidelines", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/medical-groups-issue-new-geriatric-er-guidelines/2014-02-26", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,emergency care,emergency department,Emergency Room,Geriatrics,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient falls", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe442d\"", "article_summary": "Four medical groups issued new standardized geriatric emergency care guidelines that outline how to set up programs and deliver care to this growing population.\n\"Our advice to healthcare systems with limited resources is to make the entire emergency department a geriatric emergency department,\" said Mark Rosenberg, D.O., geriatric emergency medicine chief at St. Joseph's Healthcare System in Paterson, N.J., and chair of ACEP's task force for geriatric ED guidelines.\nTo learn more:- read the guidelines (.pdf)- here's the statementRelated Articles:Geriatric ER popularity grows to meet demandDo EDs help or harm older patients?\nAs of 2010, there were 40 million people in this age group, and many of them will be emergency patients at some point.\"\nGeriatric emergency department (ED) patients account for 43 percent of all hospital admissions, and they tend to have longer ED stays and use more resources, according to the statement."}
