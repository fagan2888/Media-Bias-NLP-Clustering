Circuit Court vacated one of the Burwell challenges to Obamacare, therefore eliminating the circuit split that would\u2019ve sent the case the Supreme Court. They took it up anyway.\n\nAbbe Gluck pointed out how Justice Scalia\u2019s own writing on how the court should interpret legal text actually concurs with the government\u2019s interpretation of the disputed section of Obamacare.\n\nRecently uncovered statements from an architect of the Affordable Care Act are complicating the case that the Obama administration is making about the meaning of the disputed section of the law.\n\nIn an address earlier this week, Obama called for the FCC to reclassify Internet service to treat it as a utility, which would allow the agency to ensure equal access for everyone.\n\nSome studies show that Europe has faster Internet upload and download speeds than the U.S., though there is actually some debate about this.\n\nNoam Scheiber recently wrote a lengthy piece in the New Republic that detailed Valerie Jarrett\u2019s rise to power within the Obama administration.\n\nA few days before the New Republic published Scheiber\u2019s in-depth piece, Carol Felthensal opined in Politico about Jarrett\u2019s weakness and how she is responsible for some of Obama\u2019s worst governing decisions.\n\nThomas \u201cMack\u201d Mclarty played a similar role to Jarrett in the Clinton administration, serving as the president\u2019s alter ego and sounding board.\n\nMatt Yglesias argues that Washington insiders don\u2019t like Jarrett because she wields an enormous amount of influence over the president without being a part of any party establishment.\n\nThe anger directed at Sen. Max Baucus\u2019 health care legislation was misplaced\u2014many of the goals of the bill were actually Obama\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEmily chatters about Beverly Gage\u2019s piece on the FBI\u2019s now un-redacted letter to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nJohn chatters about recent tweets and Instagram posts exchanged between Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.\n\nDavid Plotz chatters about Hanna Rosin\u2019s piece on her former New Republic colleague Stephen Glass.\n\nA Slate Plus Special Feature: The Slate Podcast Endorsement-O-Matic (Almost) every product recommended on every Slate podcast since the dawn of creation.\n\nTopic ideas for next week?
