One case demonstrated how progressivism\u2019s achievement, the regulatory state, manufactures social strife and can do so in ways politically useful to progressives. The other case arose from government coercion used to conscript unwilling citizens into funding the progressives\u2019 party.\n\nUnder the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), any government action that substantially burdens religious practices will be subject to strict judicial scrutiny to determine if it, rather than some less intrusive measure, is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest. The Affordable Care Act, as supplemented by regulations, requires for-profit employers to provide health-care coverage that includes all 20 Food and Drug Administration-approved birth control methods.\n\nThese include four that prevent a fertilized egg from being implanted in the uterus. Some persons consider this tantamount to abortion and oppose these abortifacients for religious reasons. Why did Congress, having enacted RFRA, write this clearly incompatible birth control mandate? Congress didn\u2019t.\n\nIn the ACA, Congress simply required health plans to provide \u201cpreventive care\u201d for women. An executive branch agency decided this meant the full menu of 20 technologies. So, during oral argument in March, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy asked: \u201cWhat kind of constitutional structure do we have if the Congress can give an agency the power to grant or not grant a religious exemption based on what the agency determined?\u201d\n\nThe answer is: The constitutional structure we have is the kind progressives prefer, wherein more and more decisions are made by unelected and unaccountable executive-branch \u201cexperts\u201d exercising vast discretion. In this instance, the experts were, to say no more, willing to provoke a predictable controversy that would be convenient for the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cwar on women\u201d trope. Today, this war consists of subsidizing only 16 of 20 birth control methods. The court has held that some \u201cclosely held\u201d businesses \u2014 often family-owned and adhering to religious practices \u2014 have a right under RFRA to wage this war.\n\nThe court\u2019s other end-of-term case arose from overreaching by government employees unions and their Democratic allies. At issue were the First Amendment rights of people herded into unions after being made into government employees by government\u2019s semantic fiat.\n\nIn the 1950s, about 35 percent of the private-sector workforce was unionized; today just 6.7 percent is. The labor movement and the Democratic Party\u2019s funding depend on government employees, 35.3 percent of whom are unionized. So, in Illinois, two Democratic governors manufactured government employees out of home health-care workers, a growing cohort \u2014 and a tempting target for dues-hungry unions \u2014 in a nation with an aging population and many infirm elderly.\n\nIn 2003, an executive order from Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich, of fragrant memory, decreed that thousands of home health-care workers are government employees, which resulted in the Service Employees International Union being recognized as their representative. In 2009, an executive order from the current Democratic governor, Pat Quinn, designated even more home-care providers, who essentially are independent contractors, as government employees. The tenuous theory was that they are government workers because their pay comes indirectly from government \u2014 from the Medicaid funds received by the people who hire them.\n\nUnder a 1977 Supreme Court decision, which 26 states take advantage of, government employees can be forced to pay certain fees to unions even if the employees do not wish to be in the union and disagree with its positions. In last week\u2019s case, the court carved out an exemption for people such as the home-care providers who are not \u201cfull-fledged\u201d government employees.\n\nThis certainly seems sensible as applied to the lead plaintiff, a woman caring for her severely disabled son. Because the court has now recognized her First Amendment freedom of association \u2014 which includes the freedom not to associate \u2014 and freedom from compelled speech, she no longer will be required to pay fees to a union she refuses to join. SEIU will have to look elsewhere for the approximately $10 million in fees it has siphoned annually from people like her. This is real campaign finance reform.\n\nToday\u2019s court \u2014 nine fine minds producing written explanations of their reasoning about important principles \u2014 has its own discord. It is, nevertheless, a lagoon of logic in the forest primeval of today\u2019s overheated politics and overbearing government. Twice this week the court played its indispensable role as constable, policing portions of this forest where progressivism has produced government guilty of gratuitous bullying.\n\nRead more from George F.
