A simple version of the site first launched in 2010.\n\nSince then the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has slowly been adding limited sets of data listing the various physician groups participating in a number of Medicare quality improvement initiatives. In 2015 the site will expand to include more recent and extensive information about physician performance and quality of care, in a format that\u2019s similar to the other ACA-generated websites \u2014 Hospital Compare, Nursing Home Compare, Home Health Compare, and Dialysis Facility Compare.\n\nThese sites, which encompass tens of thousands of facilities nationwide, are credited with advancing accountability and motivating improvements in care and quality. They are also faulted as poorly organized and inadequately audited when the data are submitted by facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, beyond CMS, the number of other physician rating sites online has exploded. Public interest and engagement has grown as well: According to a 2012 survey, conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), one in four Americans had consulted a rating site when selecting a primary care physician that year.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Background and the Law?\n\nThe brief describes recent proliferation of public reporting of physician performance \u201creport cards.\u201d According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\u2019s directory, there are now some fifty efforts underway to assess and report on physician performance. The brief also explains the provision of the ACA requiring CMS to develop a plan by 2013 to \u201cmake publicly available\u2026information on physician performance that provides comparable information on quality and patient experience measures,\u201d and outlines CMS\u2019s step-by-step approach in developing Physician Compare, gradually adding measures for different practices and specialties.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Debate?\n\nAs the brief states, CMS\u2019s main challenge, beyond the logistical challenges of aggregating billions of bits of data, is gaining the trust of physicians and their trade groups, who are arguing that much physician performance measurement is still not \u201cscientifically ready for prime time\u201d and should not be used prematurely. The criticism from physician accountability and quality improvement advocates is that the measurements focus too much on processes of care and not enough on patient outcomes. The brief examines the elements of these debates, as well as CMS\u2019s struggle to be a fair arbiter as it moves to honor the spirit and the letter of the law.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nAs consumer-backed review sites continue to dominate the market, research has shown that the public\u2019s trust in the data and information presented on many federal government websites is fairly high. Experts expect that consumers will accept the data on Physician Compare, although there is a risk that doctors could undermine that trust if they speak ill of the website to their patients. At the moment, Physician Compare remains a work in progress.\n\nABOUT HEALTH POLICY BRIEFS\n\nHealth Policy Briefs are aimed at policy makers, congressional staffers, and others who need short, jargon-free explanations of health policy basics.
