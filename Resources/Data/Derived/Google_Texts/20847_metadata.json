(J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)\n\nIn one of the great D.C. key-dangles (\u201clook over here, not over there!\u201d), congressional conservatives have everyone looking the other way while they try to defund the Internal Revenue Service. No question, recent IRS screw-ups are feeding right into their opponents\u2019 plans. But let\u2019s not lose sight of what\u2019s really going on here: This is just a different way to try to shrink government, accommodate tax evasion and even undermine the implementation of health reform.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the screw-ups. This all began with the revelation that the tax collection agency was allegedly targeting certain political groups, especially tea party types, based on their political ideology. I yield to no one in my contempt for such actions.\n\nBut what was really happening here looks to be less nefarious, though equally damning. This New York Times editorial incisively explains the issue. The agency was trying to determine whether certain \u201csocial welfare organizations\u201d were engaged in more political activities than their request for tax-exempt status would allow. But tax law in this area is vague to the point of unenforceable. As the Times points out, \u201cThere are no clear standards for how much political activity [these groups] can undertake, or even a clear definition of what political activity is.\u201d\n\nWhere the agency went very wrong was in its unbalanced searches, based mostly on names that tilted in one ideological direction. The fact that this was motivated by expediency as opposed to political targeting doesn\u2019t excuse it (though why any group engaged in political activities should get tax-exempt status remains a mystery).\n\nAnd, no question, for an information-gathering agency of this magnitude and importance to lose a bunch of e-mails is as preposterous as it is incompetent.\n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s going on behind the curtain of this political theater.\n\nEveryone loves to hate the IRS, but everyone also likes to drive on roads, be covered by Medicare and Social Security, and to enjoy the plethora of public goods \u2014 schools, medical research, safety nets, national parks and so on \u2014 that characterize advanced economies. So we need to levy and collect taxes to pay for these goods.\n\nTo collect taxes, we need an amply funded IRS, and therein lies the real scandal. The details are in this new Center on Budget and Policy Priorities paper by Chuck Marr and Joel Friedman, who document \u201c\u2026significant cuts that have occurred in IRS funding, which remains well below its 2010 level\u2026. The cuts have led the IRS to reduce its workforce, severely scale back employee training, and delay much-needed upgrades to information technology systems. These steps, in turn, have weakened the IRS\u2019s ability to enforce the nation\u2019s tax laws and serve taxpayers efficiently.\u201d\n\nBy cutting the IRS budget, Congress ensures that the $385 billion annual tax gap \u2014 that\u2019s the estimated difference between taxes owed and taxes paid \u2014 remains in place. According to Treasury Department estimates, each additional $1 spent on IRS enforcement yields $6 of additional revenue. In this regard, whacking the IRS budget works to preserve and potentially expand a big tax cut, albeit an illegal one. That gap represents 11 percent of this year\u2019s spending, implying that the failure to collect revenue that\u2019s owed adds significantly to the budget deficit, another reminder of how some of these alleged budget hawks are really chicken hawks.\n\nMarr and Friedman identify these additional facts of the real case:\n\nThe figures below show a 14 percent fall in the agency\u2019s inflation-adjusted budget (figure 1) along with an 11 percent decline in its staffing levels (figure 2), 2010-2014. IRS staff assigned specifically to enforcement is down 15 percent.\n\nChuck Marr and Joel Friedman\n\nThe president\u2019s 2015 budget proposes a $1.2 billion increase in IRS funding. While that increase would certainly help, it would still leave the agency 7 percent down in real terms from its 2010 funding level.\n\nAnd House appropriators are predictably pushing in the other direction, proposing a 2015 budget that would leave the agency\u2019s budget about 18 percent down from 2010 levels in real terms.\n\nAs these cuts have transpired, the IRS has two big, relatively new jobs: 1) implementing the Affordable Care Act, which has large and critical tax components (e.g., the IRS must administer the millions of health insurance premium tax credits) and 2) implementing the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which, according to Marr and Friedman, \u201cseeks to reduce illegal tax evasion by requiring filers and financial institutions to report more information to the IRS about assets held in offshore accounts. More than 77,000 financial institutions in 70 countries have already registered under FATCA.\u201d\n\nThe IRS, by failing to stop the ideologically tilted database searches and losing e-mails allegedly related to that case has unquestionably handed its attackers a huge ring of keys to dangle as they go about underfunding the agency and reducing its ability to do its job. But when someone the other day described these developments as \u201cOrwellian,\u201d I was compelled to correct him. They\u2019re \u201cPynchonian,\u201d as in this Thomas Pynchon quote I find myself recalling almost daily these days: \u201cIf they can get you asking the wrong questions, they don\u2019t have to worry about answers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hint: It's not about punishing administrative incompetence.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Hint: It's not about punishing administrative incompetence.", "title": "Why the GOP really wants to defund IRS", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/07/01/why-the-gop-really-wants-to-defund-irs/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/14/Production/WashingtonPost/Images/IRS_Investigations-0d1d3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@econjared"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/07/01/why-the-gop-really-wants-to-defund-irs/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "irs, gop, defund, taxes, lois lerner,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "irs, gop, defund, taxes, lois lerner,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca9f5\"", "article_summary": "In this regard, whacking the IRS budget works to preserve and potentially expand a big tax cut, albeit an illegal one.\nAccording to Treasury Department estimates, each additional $1 spent on IRS enforcement yields $6 of additional revenue.\nTo collect taxes, we need an amply funded IRS, and therein lies the real scandal.\nChuck Marr and Joel FriedmanThe president\u2019s 2015 budget proposes a $1.2 billion increase in IRS funding.\nThe cuts have led the IRS to reduce its workforce, severely scale back employee training, and delay much-needed upgrades to information technology systems."}
