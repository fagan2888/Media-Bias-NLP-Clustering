Dannel P. Malloy and Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman used Thursday\u2019s ceremonial opening of the New Britain insurance enrollment center as a chance to draw contrasts between Connecticut\u2019s relatively problem-free exchange, known as Access Health CT, and the problem-plagued federally run exchanges.\n\nWhile the federal exchanges have struggled, Access Health has had a relatively stable system and has enrolled close to 9,500 people in coverage -- private insurance and Medicaid -- so far.\n\nMalloy said he believes some potential Connecticut customers are avoiding Access Health because they think it has the same well-publicized problems of the federal exchanges.\n\n\u201cPeople are confused by national TV,\u201d Malloy said. \u201cAs great as our numbers are, I think it\u2019s hurting our numbers.\u201d\n\nThe exchanges were created by the federal health law commonly known as Obamacare. The private insurance plans they sell take effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe Access Health store on Main Street in New Britain, and a similar one in New Haven, offer state residents a place to explore their options and sign up for coverage, with assistance if they need it. Exchange officials think the stores are the first of their kind in the country.\n\n\u201cWe kind of ripped this idea off from Apple,\u201d Access Health CEO Kevin Counihan said.\n\nInitially, officials had planned to open several across the state, but that plan was scaled back after they realized how complicated it was to open a retail store. Counihan indicated that Access Health might consider opening additional enrollment centers in parts of the state with high rates of uninsured residents, based on the feedback from the first two stores.\n\nCounihan said about 50 people have signed up for coverage through the New Britain store, which opened last week. The store has an area for children to play while their parents talk to an Access Health staffer.\n\nMalloy praised the Access Health staff for their efforts to ensure the state's exchange was ready to launch Oct. 1, including testing the system a month before it went live and outsourcing many functions so the staff could focus on a smaller number of items. He said he was frustrated with the problems at the federal level, because, \u201cI\u2019m tired of sharing their bad news, interrupting our good news.\u201d\n\nAlthough Connecticut\u2019s exchange has run more smoothly than most in the country, it has had some glitches, and Counihan said more should be expected. \u201cThis is inevitable with an application this complicated,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, outages in the federal data hub used to verify information about applicants have caused periods during which Access Health was unable to process applications. Officials are trying to reduce the exchange's reliance on the federal data system.\n\nThe enrollment centers are located at 200 Main St., in New Britain, and 55 Church St., in New Haven. They are open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday; 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturdays; and noon to 4 p.m. on Sundays. Appointments are recommended and can be made by calling the Access Health call center at 855-805-4325.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Dannel P.
