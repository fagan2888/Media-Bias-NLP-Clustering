Sam Brownback\u2019s administration, the Kansas Hospital Association has introduced its expansion bill.\n\nRep. Don Hill, a Republican from Emporia, requested its introduction in the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe bill does not outline an expansion plan. Rather, it repeals language added to a budget bill in 2013 that prohibits the governor from pursuing expansion without the approval of the Legislature.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple bill that really just says to the governor and the administration that the Legislature is ready to get out of the way if the governor believes that moving ahead with KanCare expansion is the appropriate and prudent thing to do,\u201d Hill said.\n\nThe other two expansion bills are more prescriptive. One, introduced by Rep. Jim Ward, a Wichita Democrat, would simply expand Medicaid eligibility to the threshold set in the Affordable Care Act. The second, introduced earlier this week by the House Vision 2020 Committee, is modeled after alternative plans crafted by other red-state governors and includes an assessment on hospital revenues to cover the state\u2019s share of expansion costs.\n\nRep. Tom Sloan, a Republican from Lawrence and chairman of the 2020 committee, said even though the federal government is committed to covering most of the cost of expansion, supporters need to identify how the state can cover its portion of the costs without worsening its budget problems.\n\nWhile Republican leaders have blocked consideration of expansion for two years, Hill said Brownback has remained willing to listen to those wanting to negotiate a \u201cKansas plan\u201d with the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cFor almost a year now it\u2019s my understanding that members of the Kansas Hospital Association have been working very closely with members of the administration on what a Kansas plan might look like,\u201d Hill said.\n\nHill said he and some moderate Republican colleagues also recently met with the governor to discuss expansion. And while the governor didn\u2019t signal that he was ready to move forward, he remains open to talking about it.\n\n\u201cHe (Brownback) has been very careful not to say that he flat out opposes Medicaid expansion,\u201d Hill said, adding that recent efforts by Republican governors to pursue more private-sector approaches to expansion could be \u201ca game changer\u201d on the issue.\n\nEven though the bill backed by the state\u2019s hospitals doesn\u2019t lay out a plan, the association has drafted a list of principles that it believes any Kansas plan should embody. Those principles include helping low-income Kansans get private coverage when possible and requiring those made eligible for KanCare by expansion to pay a small portion of their health care costs.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said she is open to negotiating an expansion plan with the Brownback administration.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things I did as secretary is go to the National Governors Association and make sure the governors knew I\u2019m open to these conversations,\u201d Burwell said this week in an interview with KCUR, a partner with the KHI News Service in the Heartland Health Monitor reporting collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe know different states have different needs,\u201d Burwell said. \u201cThere are some fundamentals that are important to making health insurance work. Those we need. Beyond that, in terms of how people think about incentives and programs, are things we can have discussions about.\u201d\n\nKansas\u2019 privatized Medicaid program, KanCare, covers about 425,000 children and low-income, disabled and elderly adults. But that number includes relatively few able-bodied adults.\n\nAdults with dependent children can participate in KanCare, but only if they have incomes below 33 percent of the federal poverty level, or $7,770 annually for a family of four. Adults without children aren\u2019t eligible for coverage no matter how poor they are.\n\nExpansion would make all Kansans with incomes up to 138 percent of poverty eligible for KanCare. The eligibility cap would be set at $16,105 for an individual and $32,913 for a family of four.\n\nExpansion would make Marcillene Dover eligible for KanCare coverage.\n\nDover, a 21-year-old Wichita State University student, was diagnosed last year with multiple sclerosis. She talked about her illness earlier this week at the Statehouse, where she and others from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society were lobbying for Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cI wanted to crawl up into a little ball and give up on my life, but that\u2019s not what I did,\u201d Dover said. \u201cInstead I had to figure out how I was going to pay for this new and very expensive part of my life.\u201d\n\nDover is uninsured. As a full-time student, she was eligible for a Kansas Board of Regents health plan. But she couldn\u2019t afford the premiums of almost $1,500 a year and her complex medical needs still would have saddled her with large out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nDover falls into a coverage gap that affects people who don\u2019t meet current Medicaid eligibility requirements but earn too little to qualify for federal subsidies that help cover the cost of private coverage in the Affordable Care Act marketplace.\n\nProject Access, a charitable effort of the Central Plains Health Care Partnership and the Medical Society of Sedgwick County, is helping to pay for medications that otherwise would cost Dover $5,000 per month. But, she said, countless uninsured Kansans living with disabling diseases aren\u2019t getting any help.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to expand Medicaid in Kansas, and in every other state for that matter,\u201d Dover said. \u201cNo one should have to go through receiving this devastating diagnosis and then feel further devastation as they wonder how they will get the care that they need.\u201d\n\nHer story resonated with Sen. Dan Kerschen, a Garden Plain Republican, one of the lawmakers who will need to be convinced for any expansion plan to pass.\n\nKerschen, whose 34-year-old daughter suffers from multiple sclerosis, said Dover\u2019s story gave him flashbacks to his daughter\u2019s 2008 diagnosis. But when asked if it had persuaded him to support expansion, Kerschen hedged.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a direction we\u2019re probably going to have to take if we get the right combination,\u201d he said.\n\nGetting \u201cthe right combination\u201d would require lawmakers to schedule hearings and quickly start piecing together a compromise bill. That\u2019s not likely to happen unless Brownback makes it clear to legislative leaders he\u2019s ready to move forward, something he\u2019s given no indication he plans to do.\n\nEileen Hawley, Brownback\u2019s spokesperson, declined to comment when asked about the governor\u2019s intentions on Medicaid expansion except to say that she wasn\u2019t aware of the discussions involving the governor that Hill described.\n\nThe next step for supporters, Hill said, will be to convince Rep. Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican and chairman of the House Health and Human Services Committee, to schedule hearings on the expansion bill.\n\n\u201cI think there is quite a bit of support on that committee \u2013 bipartisan support \u2013 to at the very least have hearings,\u201d Hill said.\n\nKHI News Service reporter Andy Marso contributed to this story.\n\nJim McLean is executive editor of KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Now there are three.
