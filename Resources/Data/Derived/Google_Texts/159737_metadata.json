That\u2019s when it hit Thyfault, who was still standing in the road. The Honda stopped in a field, facing the opposite direction it had been heading.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, witnesses at the scene heard Gebers \u201ccomplain it was not his fault because his emergency brake locked up and his accelerator stuck.\u201d\n\nThe affidavit also said Gebers told this to police. The affidavit said that Gebers\u2019 criminal history includes 16 entries with an extensive history for drug violations and numerous weapon offenses. His driver\u2019s license had been canceled.\n\nGebers was treated and released from Longmont United Hospital and then taken to the Boulder County Jail. He is being held for investigation of first-degree murder with extreme indifference, attempted first-degree murder with extreme indifference, vehicular assault, vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment, reckless driving, eluding a police officer, driving vehicle while license canceled/denied and illegal use of blue lights, Longmont police said.\n\nGebers is expected to have a first court appearance at Boulder County Jail at 2 p.m. Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Man charged with fatally striking CSP cadet blames car malfunction", "title": "Man charged with fatally striking CSP cadet blames car malfunction", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/24/man-charged-with-fatally-striking-csp-cadet-blames-car-malfunction/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523__20150524_A1_CD24CADETp2-1.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523__20150524_A1_CD24CADETp2-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-24T17:08:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T09:35:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Then, shortly after 8 a.m., a Honda, driven by Gebers, sped west along Colorado 66 toward the earlier accident.\nChristopher Lee Gebers, 27, was arrested Saturday after leading police on a high-speed chase down Colorado 66 that ended in the death of 21-year-old State Patrol Cadet Taylor Thyfault.\nThe incident happened when Thyfault and Rushing were assisting with a separate crash around 7:45 a.m. near Colorado 66 and County Line Road, just northeast of Longmont.\nThe affidavit said that Gebers\u2019 criminal history includes 16 entries with an extensive history for drug violations and numerous weapon offenses.\nGebers is expected to have a first court appearance at Boulder County Jail at 2 p.m. Tuesday."}
