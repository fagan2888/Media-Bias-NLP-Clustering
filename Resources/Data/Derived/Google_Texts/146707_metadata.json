If a woman was sitting outside of Planned Parenthood in, for example, her OBGYN\u2019s office looking at this ultrasound at precisely the same point in her pregnancy, her doctor would be saying to her, \u201cLook at your baby. Look at it\u2019s heartbeat. Look at it\u2019s fingers and toes.\u201d This is an abomination that Planned Parenthood has lobbied against a woman\u2019s opportunity to look at an ultrasound before she makes an incredibly difficult choice to end the unborn life within her, and yet, they are using that same technology to harvest body parts \u2013 which they claim are not a life \u2013 in order to sell them to save another life.
