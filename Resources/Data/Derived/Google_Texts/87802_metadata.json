That probably helps the preservation process.\u201d\n\nPage beat out Jenna Dewan-Tatum, Kate Mara, Laura Prepon and Jessica Par\u00e9 for the Sexiest Vegetarian title; Leto won over Peter Dinklage, Woody Harrelson, Joaquin Phoenix, and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nNot only does Leto only eat vegan food \u2014 meaning no dairy or meat products \u2014 but he also has a tendency to highlight his vegan lifestyle on his Instagram by showing off \u201cvegan leather cuffs\" or flipping vegan pancakes.\n\nPage is 27 and enjoys the vegan lifestyle, noting that it makes her feel great. \u201cI really used to eat a lot of crap,\u201d she said in a TakePart interview in 2010. \u201cAnd now I don\u2019t, and I feel great, and I absolutely love healthy food.\u201d In 2011, Page tweeted her support for vegans: \u201cWhy are vegans made fun of while the inhumane factory farming process regards animals and the natural world merely as commodities to be exploited for profit?\u201d PETA describes Page as \u201ca feminist, an environmentalist, an activist, a pioneer, and a compassionate vegan. It doesn\u2019t get sexier than that!\u201d\n\nOn its Vegan Life website, PETA offers a full list of easy ways to go vegan \u2014 from buying mock meats like pig-free pork and faux chicken or turkey, to \u201cNon-Dairy Delights\u201d like vegan butter, frozen desserts and soy-cheese. Previously, PETA awarded the Sexiest Vegetarian titles to Kristen Wiig, Olivia Wilde, Carrire Underwood, Russell Brand, Jessica Chastain, Natalie Portman, and Leona Lewis.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sexiest vegetarian celebrities, ellen page, vegan celebrities, jared leto", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Jared Leto and Ellen Page have been spotlighted as two of the sexiest celebrities living a vegan lifestyle.", "title": "The Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrities Of 2014", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/petas-sexiest-vegetarian-celebrities-2014-are-jared-leto-and-ellen-page-290356", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/ellen-page.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jared Leto and Ellen Page have been spotlighted as two of the sexiest celebrities living a vegan lifestyle.", "title": "The Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrities Of 2014", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/petas-sexiest-vegetarian-celebrities-2014-are-jared-leto-and-ellen-page-290356", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/ellen-page.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/ellen-page.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-27T15:33:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-27T15:33:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Jared Leto and Ellen Page have been spotlighted as two of the sexiest celebrities living a vegan lifestyle."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd056d\"", "article_summary": "People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has named Jared Leto and Ellen Page as the \u201cSexiest Vegetarian Celebrities\u201d of 2014, touting their vegan and professional qualities as their reasons for winning.\nPreviously, PETA awarded the Sexiest Vegetarian titles to Kristen Wiig, Olivia Wilde, Carrire Underwood, Russell Brand, Jessica Chastain, Natalie Portman, and Leona Lewis.\nPage is 27 and enjoys the vegan lifestyle, noting that it makes her feel great.\nThat probably helps the preservation process.\u201dPage beat out Jenna Dewan-Tatum, Kate Mara, Laura Prepon and Jessica Par\u00e9 for the Sexiest Vegetarian title; Leto won over Peter Dinklage, Woody Harrelson, Joaquin Phoenix, and Samuel L.
