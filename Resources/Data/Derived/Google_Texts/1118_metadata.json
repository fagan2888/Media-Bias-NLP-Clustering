However, the 31-year-old said that though it may not be the perfect solution, it is movement.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of misconceptions,\" said Pittman. \"People don't research it. Some just hear 'Obamacare' and decide to go against it. Looking at the alternative, it's the best thing right now for me, and it terms of affordable healthcare, it works out perfectly.\"\n\nPittman said he has tried a variety of healthcare options in addition to simply going without coverage over the past few years, but feels the Affordable Care Act is the most useful and reasonably-priced at this time.\n\n\"I've tried everything,\" said Pittman. \"Once you work for yourself, it's on your shoulders. It can get really expensive paying for yourself without health insurance. If I didn't get it, my biggest expense right now would be healthcare so it's a relief to have it.\"\n\nPittman was unable to sign up due to heavy traffic, but plans to try again later. Open\n\nenrollment will be available until March 2014.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Montgomery Mayor Todd Strange also commented on the Affordable Care Act during a press conference this afternoon.\n\n\"I think you oughta get it started, and let it play itself out,\" Strange said. \"If it works, good. If not, that'll give us a chance to modify.\"\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act", "title": "After trying 'everything,' Montgomery videographer calls Affordable Care Act 'a relief'", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"After trying \\u0027everything,\\u0027 Montgomery videographer calls Affordable Care Act \\u0027a relief\\u0027\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/montgomery/2013/10/small_business_owner_in_montgo.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/wire/photo/healthcaregovpng-b378290b8defa002.png\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11347512\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-01T20:10:46Z\", \"author\": \"Amber Sutton | asutton@al.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\",\"@river-montgomery\",\"@river-state\",\"Affordable Care Act\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.al.com/wire/photo/13482371-thumb_square_large.png", "creator": "@AmberlaSutton/", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "While Pittman said he considers the coverage provided by President Obama&#8217;s healthcare law to be \"very comprehensive and thorough,\" he also acknowledged that it does have its flaws.
