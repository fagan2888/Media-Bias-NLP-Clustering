But his emphasis on protecting religious freedom is a recurring theme, whether in legal briefs, speeches or interviews on conservative talk radio, his preferred medium.\n\nPaxton\u2019s job as the state\u2019s chief lawyer, however, took a sharp turn when Collin County grand jurors issued indictments, unsealed this month, alleging that Paxton violated state securities laws in investment deals he brokered before becoming attorney general.\n\nOn Aug. 3, he was arrested, fingerprinted and released on bond. (Two fraud charges were dismissed and replaced with new indictments last week to clarify the charges.)\n\nPaxton, who isn\u2019t required to step down while he fights the charges, returned to work as attorney general, a job that has broad authority. In addition to providing legal advice and representation to state officials, his office investigates deceptive trade practices, enforces open-government laws, collects child support and helps local prosecutors with criminal cases. Investigators pursue fraud, election violations, online child predators and parole violations. More than 740 lawyers handle appeals and civil and criminal cases.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the criminal case against Paxton will prove to be a distraction.\n\nBut one week after his mugshot was published far and wide, Paxton filed a legal brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to accept a case involving Houston Baptist University, which is attempting to toss out a federal rule requiring religious nonprofits to provide employees with insurance coverage for \u201cmorning after pills\u201d and related birth control.\n\n\u201cThe continued assault on religious liberties in our nation threatens every single American and undermines the foundation of our Constitution,\u201d Paxton said about the brief. \u201cNo government should impose costly fines on its citizens for living in accordance with their convictions.\u201d\n\nThe brief followed a July letter urging Republican leaders in Congress to ensure that religious nonprofits cannot lose their tax-exempt status for acting on their opposition to gay marriage.\n\nAlso in July, Paxton praised a Texas Supreme Court ruling that repealed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, calling it a victory for the conservative Christian pastors who opposed the rule that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as on age, national original, marital status and more.\n\nReligion as trump card\n\nThe legal philosophy embraced by Paxton, who declined to be interviewed for this story, is based on an expansive view of the First Amendment, which says the government may not prohibit the free exercise of religion.\n\nWhen religious beliefs clash with another constitutional right, such as gay marriage, or with a government rule or policy, religion holds the trump card, Paxton believes.\n\n\u201cOur guiding principle should be to protect people who want to live, work and raise their families in accordance with their religious faith,\u201d he has said.\n\nFueled by the same-sex marriage ruling, religious liberty is an emerging theme in Republican politics. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has made it a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, courting Iowa\u2019s dominant evangelical voters with a rally this month featuring those \u201cvictimized by government persecution.\u201d\n\nBut the hard-line position isn\u2019t shared by the nation\u2019s legal system, which has long struggled with the intersection of religion and law \u2014 buffeted by a continuous churn of lawsuits and court rulings that produce ever-shifting legal ground.\n\nUnderstanding the legal struggle begins with one premise: \u201cFrom the beginning, we felt as a nation that religion was special and deserving of something extra,\u201d said Mark Goldfeder, director of the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at Emory University\u2019s Law School.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been an American value to let people live according to the dictates of their conscience,\u201d Goldfeder said. \u201cThe question is just how far do those accommodations go?\u201d\n\nThere are no hard rules, but religious freedom typically reaches its limit at \u201cthe point where it harms another,\u201d he said. When the courts dismantled racial segregation, for example, religious practice was rejected as an excuse for discrimination based on race.\n\nHow far religious accommodations go on same-sex marriage remains to be determined, but Goldfeder sees value in compromise \u2014 and the Texas attorney general\u2019s office could offer a lesson on how to draw the line, he said.\n\nDespite Paxton\u2019s incendiary language on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, his agency found a more temperate middle ground, issuing a more measured legal opinion telling clerks that they could decline to serve same-sex couples only if somebody else was available to provide a marriage license.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Until overshadowed by charges of felony securities fraud, Ken Paxton\u2019s tenure as state attorney general was defined by his passionate defense of religion, particularly on issues important to his fellow conservative Christians.", "author": "By Chuck Lindell - American-Statesman Staff", "og": {"url": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/ken-paxtons-defense-of-faith-as-a-guiding-principl/nnPgx/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/08/18/ea/4a/MyStatesman_OG_image_NEW.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Until overshadowed by charges of felony securities fraud, Ken Paxton\u2019s tenure as state attorney general was defined by his passionate defense of religion, particularly on issues important to his fellow conservative Christians.", "title": "Ken Paxton\u2019s defense of faith as a guiding principle"}, "twitter": {"description": "Until overshadowed by charges of felony securities fraud, Ken Paxton&rsquo;s tenure as state attorney general was defined by his passionate defense of religion, particularly on issues important to his fellow conservative Christians.\r\nIf there has been a defining principle, a Paxton Doctrine, established in his first 7&frac12; months in office, it was forged on same-sex marriage, contraceptives under &ldquo;Obamacare,&rdquo; Houston&rsquo;s anti-discrimination ordinance and other legal controversies.", "card": "summary", "title": "Paxton\u2019s defense of faith as a guiding principle"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myaas", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/ken-paxtons-defense-of-faith-as-a-guiding-principl/nnPgx/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3036330/news/news/ken-paxtons-defense-of-faith-as-a-guiding-principl/nnPgx/", "keywords": "texas-politics,Texas Legislature,statesman,Texas,news", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd94a\"", "article_summary": "John Cornyn, now a U.S. senator, promoted open government during his tenure as Texas attorney general from 1999 to 2002.\nUntil overshadowed by charges of felony securities fraud, Ken Paxton\u2019s tenure as state attorney general was defined by his passionate defense of religion, particularly on issues important to his fellow conservative Christians.\nA Ken Paxton Doctrine was forged by the gay marriage decision, and other issues seen as affronts on faith.\nFueled by the same-sex marriage ruling, religious liberty is an emerging theme in Republican politics.\n\u201cOur guiding principle should be to protect people who want to live, work and raise their families in accordance with their religious faith,\u201d he has said."}
