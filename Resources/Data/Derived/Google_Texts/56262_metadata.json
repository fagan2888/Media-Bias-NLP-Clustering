Tennessee is a natural paradise.\n\nHowever, the wonder of your state's natural beauty was in no way matched by the incomprehensible actions (or inaction) of your state government.\n\nWe understand that your veto-proof Republican Legislature has refused to expand Medicaid benefits for the past two years, despite its support by your governor, hospitals and general populace. But there were other oddities that were apparently more pressing, such as naming the Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifle as the official state gun; refusing to make the Bible the official state book; re-electing a representative who professes being anti-abortion but encouraged his girlfriend to get one; and letting your rural hospitals go broke. I suppose power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n\nThe bright spot is that by refusing the Affordable Care Act, you are letting $1 billion of your tax money go to other states, including ours.\n\nAnd we thank you. Up here in Minnesota, we practice true Christianity so our elderly and disadvantaged can (and do) put the health care money to good use. We don't have the mountains, but we'll gladly take our own natural beauty along with the Affordable Care Act for our needy citizens. We feel they deserve it.\n\nBarbara E.
