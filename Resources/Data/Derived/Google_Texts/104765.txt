The opening of Denverâ€™s Union Station is almost here, and there are multiple celebrations in the works.

A sold-out, black-tie gala will be from 6 p.m. to midnight Friday.

For that event, Denver police intermittently will stop traffic on Wynkoop Street to make way for party-goers.

At noon Saturday, new restaurants, bars, coffee shops and a couple of retailers will open their doors but with little fanfare.

Still, merchants and retailers are expecting a crowd, said Kate Davis, a spokeswoman for the facility.

If Union Station management feels the building is becoming too crowded, security temporarily will limit entrance, Davis said.

Union Station managers are throwing their big public to-do July 26. Live music, food and vendors will be on scene from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. for a grand opening celebration.

Visitors will need tickets to tour the building during the grand opening. Those will be available at booths at the festival or on unionstationindenver.com.

For the grand opening, Wynkoop Street between 16th Street and 18th Street will be closed. Also, 17th Street from Wykoop to Wazee streets will be closed.
