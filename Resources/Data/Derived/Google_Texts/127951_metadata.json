Check your credit reports. You\u2019re entitled to check your credit from each of the three major credit-reporting agencies \u2014 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2014 each year. If you haven\u2019t pulled them recently, do so now to make sure that your Social Security number isn\u2019t attached to unfamiliar credit accounts.\n\n2. Watch the mail carefully. If you\u2019re 1099s or a W-2 that\u2019s delivered by post, don\u2019t let your mail sit in the box this time of year. Such documents typically come with big letters announcing \u201cIMPORTANT TAX DOCUMENTS ENCLOSED.\u201d Those labels are great at making sure that you don\u2019t throw them away \u2014 and at alerting crooks who rifle through your mail that there\u2019s valuable info inside. \u201cThere are a lot of folks out there who troll mailboxes,\u201d says Adam Levin, chairman of Identity Theft 911.\n\n3. File early. In the classic tax-related ID theft, scammers use your personal information, including your Social Security number, to file a bogus claim for a tax refund, which they collect. Then, when you go to legitimately file your taxes, your claim gets rejected because the IRS thinks it already paid you. More than 20 percent of taxpayers wait until April to file, making them prime targets for ID thieves.\n\nRelated: 10 Important Tax Dates for 2016\n\nThere are procedures to undo the damage, but it\u2019s a paperwork nightmare, and it can take months to undo the damage. In 2013, it took an average 278 days for the IRS to resolve identity theft claims. \u201cBy filing early, you can not only get your refund more quickly, but you lock out your personal information so that the bad guys can\u2019t get to it,\u201d says Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service.\n\n4. Request an IP PIN if you have access to one. For those who have previously been the victim of identity theft, and for all residents of Florida, Georgia and the District of Columbia, the IRS provides Identity Protection Personal Identification Numbers \u2014 six-digit numbers that filers can use in place of their Social Security number when submitting their taxes. If you think you\u2019ve been a victim of ID theft, you can also request an IP PIN.\n\n5. Use a secure device and network. E-filing is the quickest and most secure way to send your returns to the IRS, and programs like TurboTax now allow anyone to do their taxes on a computer or tablet from virtually anywhere. That\u2019s incredibly convenient, but users should be careful where they decide to open such programs. Public Wi-Fi is incredibly insecure, and criminals can easily intercept anything sent using it. \u201cAnytime you\u2019re transmitting sensitive information over the Internet you want to be sure that you\u2019re on a private, secure network,\u201d says Maxim Weinstein, an advisor at security vendor Sophos.\n\nRelated: The 8 Most Common Tax Mistakes That Can Cost You Hundreds\n\n6. Dust off the fax machine. You may need a refresher course on how to use it, but for sending W-2 forms, 1099s and other tax-related documents to your accountant or anyone else, the 1990s technology is a safer bet than email. That way, if a hacker gets into your email account at any time in the future, a quick search for old tax documents won\u2019t yield anything. If you don\u2019t have access to a fax machine, sending valuable papers via FedEx or a similar delivery service is also a good option.\n\n7. Turn on two-factor authentication. All the big tax software providers now offer users two-factor authentication at log-in, which is a much more secure way to make sure no one but you enters your account. In addition to requiring a user name and password, two-factor authentication requires another level of security to compete the sign-on process, such as entering a code sent to your email or smartphone.\n\n8. Vet your tax preparer. It\u2019s common for fraudsters to set up shop as tax preparers, gathering documents from unsuspecting clients and then disappearing \u2014 with all the victim\u2019s info and without filing a return. Protect yourself by hiring a credentialed tax pro (look for a certified public accountant or an enrolled agent) who has been in business for at least several years. Ask if your preparer has procedures in place to safeguard client data. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t go to a doctor or dentist without first checking them out,\u201d says Todd Simmens, national managing partner of Tax Risk Management at BDO. \u201cYou have to do the same thing with your tax preparer.\u201d\n\nRelated: One Move You Can Still Make to Cut Your 2015 Taxes\n\n9. Consider a credit freeze. If you\u2019re really concerned about someone stealing your ID during tax season, you can ask the credit bureaus to temporarily freeze your credit. Doing so means that no one would be able to open an account in your name.\n\n10. Be skeptical of any tax-related calls or emails. Tax season is prime time for scammers impersonating the IRS to call or email with scary stories about audits or other problems with returns. The callers try to convince victims to provide their Social Security numbers, or to send money or credit card information to pay money supposedly owed to the IRS. Such callers are getting increasingly sophisticated and are often calling from a number that shows on caller ID as being from the IRS.\n\nKeep in mind that the IRS will never ask you over the phone for your identifying information, and you\u2019ll have a chance to respond to any audit if money is actually owed. Generally, if the IRS needs to contact you, they\u2019ll do it via regular old mail.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Tax season is also open season for identity thieves and time for consumers to be extra", "title": "10 Tips to Protect Yourself from Scammers This Tax Season", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/01/10-Tips-Protect-Yourself-Scammers-Tax-Season", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03212014_Call_Center_Scam.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/01/10-Tips-Protect-Yourself-Scammers-Tax-Season", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03212014_Call_Center_Scam.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Tax season is also open season for identity thieves and time for consumers to be extra", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Tax season is also open season for identity thieves and time for consumers to be extra cautious about safeguarding their data.\n\u201cThere are a lot of folks out there who troll mailboxes,\u201d says Adam Levin, chairman of Identity Theft 911.\nIn the classic tax-related ID theft, scammers use your personal information, including your Social Security number, to file a bogus claim for a tax refund, which they collect.\nTax season is prime time for scammers impersonating the IRS to call or email with scary stories about audits or other problems with returns.\nIf you think you\u2019ve been a victim of ID theft, you can also request an IP PIN."}
