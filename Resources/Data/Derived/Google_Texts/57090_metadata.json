It\u2019s certainly a snappier subject line than \u201cThe Gall\u201d or \u201cTemerity.\u201d And like Levy\u2019s Rye Bread, you don\u2019t have to be Jewish to love the word chutzpah.\n\n\u201cChutzpah\u201d has definitely entered the mainstream of American political discourse. Four years ago, Mitt Romney and Joe Biden were busy trading charges of chutzpah. The Massachusetts Mormon used the word to deride Biden\u2019s criticisms of his economic ideas, while our Irish-Catholic vice president accused Romney of chutzpah for calling Obama \u201cout of touch.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Obama\u2019s critics haven\u2019t been shy about accusing him of chutzpah. In 2011, GOP presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann famously mangled the difficult-to-pronounce Yiddishism in a televised attack on Obama\u2019s budgetary record. Earlier this year, current Republican hopeful Ted Cruz called it \u201cthe height of chutzpah for Obama to lecture the nation of Israel on Jewish values.\u201d\n\nEven Mr. Chutzpah himself, famed attorney Alan Dershowitz, has accused Obama of chutzpah, suggesting the president was taking too much credit for the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on same-sex marriage when he hadn\u2019t supported it in his run for office.\n\nThere is a danger, however, that with chutzpah becoming popular as a political insult, the word\u2019s nuances will be lost to the American public.\n\nObama at least understands the word\u2019s complexity. Just last month, Obama praised Barbra Streisand\u2019s chutzpah as he awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nLike Dershowitz, Obama knows that a little chutzpah can be a good thing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chutzpah has entered the mainstream of American political discourse.
