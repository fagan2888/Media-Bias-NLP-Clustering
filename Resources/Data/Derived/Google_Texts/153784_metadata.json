About 75 people registered, but more than 100 showed up, filling almost all seats in the room.\n\nPoliquin\u2019s off-the-cuff speech drew boisterous applause and shouts of agreement, especially when critical of President Barack Obama, and his keynote started and ended with standing ovations.\n\nThat support came in spite of strong criticism from some Republicans stemming from Poliquin\u2019s recent vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPoliquin raised eyebrows last week when he was one of only three House Republicans to vote against a bill to repeal the federal Affordable Care Act. Some conservatives viewed that vote as a broken promise. That vote lost him the endorsement of the National Board of the Republican Liberty Caucus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not about grandstanding, I\u2019m about fixing problems.\u201d Poliquin told the crowd. \u201cI knew I was going to take some flak on this.\u201d\n\nPoliquin explained that he voted against the repeal push because he didn\u2019t feel an adequate replacement to the ACA had been proposed.\n\n\u201cI want to get rid of [ACA] bigtime,\u201d Poliquin said, \u201cbut what\u2019s the plan?\u201d\n\nTwo days after he voted against most of his Republican colleagues, Poliquin\u2019s office issued a statement celebrating a Republican alternative.\n\n\u201cI hope all of you give me a little slack on this,\u201d Poliquin said. \u201cI know the headlines don\u2019t look good, but there are reasons I did what I did.\u201d\n\nThere had been chatter about potential protests or demonstrations at the Lincoln dinner by hardline Republicans, but no such action was apparent before or after Poliquin took to the lectern around 3:30 p.m.\n\nPoliquin spent much of his time highlighting his first few days in office, including a couple instances in which he pushed his way up to President Obama to urge him to support natural gas pipeline regulation reforms that could bring higher natural gas capacity to Maine and reduce energy prices.\n\nPoliquin discussed his support of the high-profile House vote favoring the Keystone XL Pipeline, drawing a big round of applause.\n\n\u201cEvery one of us who\u2019s been in the business community knows that if you increase the supply of a commodity, you decrease the price,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also touched on abortion, saying, \u201cWe need to make sure we\u2019re a party of life.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives on Jan. 22 backed a ban on taxpayer funding for abortion, with Poliquin among the supporters.\n\nThe Lincoln Day Dinner also featured a 50/50 raffle and silent auction to raise funds for the party, as well as meetings of the Student and College Republicans and Republican town chairs in Penobscot County.\n\nFollow Nick McCrea on Twitter at @nmccrea213.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BREWER, Maine \u2014 Freshman Congressman Bruce Poliquin explained himself to any Republicans in the room disgruntled by his recent vote against repealing Obamacare during a speech Sunday afternoon at Jeff\u2019s Catering in Brewer to highlight his first month in office.
