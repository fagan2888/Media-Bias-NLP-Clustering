But right around the corner, the league landscape is about to break apart.\n\nAs teams rush headlong toward the July 31 trade deadline, the Rockies sit in a holding pattern. They\u2019ve spent 83 days in last place. They\u2019ve trailed by at least 10 games in the National League West every day in July.\n\nJeff Bridich, the Rockies\u2019 first-year general manager, is working from this position. How will it affect trade decisions and call-ups over the next two-and-a-half weeks? Will Troy Tulowitzki wear a different uniform soon?\n\nBridich talked to The Denver Post last week from Coors Field about a range of issues facing the Rockies as their season moves forward:\n\nQ: Big picture, what is your assessment of the first half? What has gone well? What hasn\u2019t? Any surprises?\n\nA: Our start was fairly decent. It\u2019s been a season of fits and spurts. We came out of the gates playing pretty good baseball, in many facets of the team. Obviously we hit that very difficult patch of a losing streak. And we got through that, rebounded from it and put together a better month. The thing that defines us the most is, there\u2019s been times when our pitching has been very good in the first half, there\u2019s been times when our hitting has been very good, there\u2019s been times when our pitching has been pretty poor and there\u2019s been times when our hitting has been pretty poor. And a lot of times, those things aren\u2019t locked in step. (Wednesday\u2019s loss to the Angels) was a good example of that. We got pretty darn good pitching, and then our offensive performance was just embarrassing, it was abysmal. All that leads to us being 14 games under .500.\n\nQ: The Dodgers and Giants aren\u2019t running away with the division. Is there hope you cling to still? Enough to think you should be aggressive with player moves to get back into contention? Has your plan changed?\n\nA: Some of the injuries that have occurred certainly hurt. It would be nice to get a couple of the guys back, depth-wise, who we can have back. I\u2019m not sure what Justin Morneau\u2019s situation is quite yet, it\u2019s really more of a wait-and-see proposition right now. We\u2019re hopeful Corey Dickerson will be able to play again this year. Brooks Brown, Christian Bergman. There\u2019s depth there. That would be nice if we can get those guys healthy. In terms of other guys developing and coming up to contribute, that\u2019s the hope and goal for somebody like Eddie Butler. That the lessons he needs to learn at the Triple-A level, he\u2019s learning, and can come back in the second half and put together meaningful starts. If you\u2019re hedging toward the trade deadline, the line that I\u2019m going to continue giving is the same: We\u2019re basically open to discussing anything, any which way. If we feel like it makes us better, we\u2019ll consider it. There\u2019s not going to be some wholesale direction, one way of the other. That\u2019s not realistic for us. But we\u2019ve never stopped talking and engaging and keeping our minds open to possibilities.\n\nQ: At some point, you\u2019ll be faced with an opportunity to get better now at the expense of something next year. How do you make that decision?\n\nA: At some point in the next two-and-a-half weeks, we\u2019ll be put in position of, are we going to make trades or not? And what that comes down to is the quality of what we\u2019ll get back in return. And ultimately, with who we are and how we\u2019re built and how we\u2019ll be built moving forward, I don\u2019t think it will be wise to get short-term fixes on anything we do. No matter if it\u2019s perceived as a big trade or a little trade. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll acquire a bunch of guys like LaTroy Hawkins or Rafael Betancourt who are close to or at the end of their careers and on one-year, short-term deals. That doesn\u2019t make sense for us, especially where we\u2019re at right now. But also in general, I\u2019m not a huge fan of it, unless we\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat like the St. Louis Cardinals \u2014 which we\u2019re not.\n\nQ: You do have young, controllable players who, looking at your system, have replacements available in the minors who are at or near the big-league level. Charlie Blackmon or DJ LeMahieu, as examples. Are you any more or less willing to make that kind of trade?\n\nA: Those are hypothetical. That would take one of the 29 (other teams) coming in and being super aggressive for a player like that. We\u2019re in a position where we can never say never. But there would have to be somebody who really covets those types of guys and says, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s somebody who we\u2019ll make an incredible baseball deal for.\u201d I won\u2019t initiate that. Will I listen? Sure, but we won\u2019t aggressively initiate that.\n\nQ: What is the percentage chance that Troy Tulowitzki is on your team next year?\n\nA: (Laughs) I don\u2019t know. What do you think it is?\n\nQ: 95 percent chance? Wild guess?\n\nA: I really don\u2019t know. I think we\u2019ll know more over the next two weeks.\n\nQ: His situation has changed though. He\u2019s been healthy. He\u2019s hitting well.\n\nA: To this point, yeah. He\u2019s healthy. He\u2019s basically playing most of the time, like he should be. We\u2019ve given him regular rest, like we should, with any player who has played a lot in his career and plays a demanding position and has the injury history that he does. His surgery was successful. The rehab was successful. The maintenance he does has helped him. All that combined has helped him be a very productive, elite player.\n\nQ: Has interest increased with him since before the season?\n\nA: There was never anything in the winter time that got to be serious interest. Some teams were poking around. The injury was complicated. There was never anything that remotely came close to happening. But, I\u2019ve already had discussions with GMs. I plan on having 29 of those discussions, at least, before the deadline is over. So I imagine his name will come up. With some of that, it\u2019s partly who he is and the type of player he is and also the time of the year.\n\nQ: What about Carlos Gonzalez? There are teams, especially the Royals, as a recent example, who could use a player of his quality.\n\nA: His stats aren\u2019t as good as Tulo\u2019s or some of the other guys on our team, so if a team is just going off that, I don\u2019t know. But we\u2019ll certainly know more in 10 days to two weeks. Alex Gordon\u2019s injury happened just this week. I\u2019m sure the Royals are still figuring out what they want to do.\n\nQ: Trade activity has been slow so far. Are you waiting around for calls? Does it seem surprising how it\u2019s worked so far?\n\nA: The way the calls work is, some teams are more aggressive with that stuff because of the personality of the GM. Some teams lay back and try to figure things out. It\u2019s part of the complexity of the new wild-card playoff system. Some of the conversations I\u2019ve already had are, \u201cWe\u2019re kind of in a holding pattern, trying to figure ourselves out a bit.\u201d And they\u2019re taking their time to do it. But it\u2019s still relatively early. Certain teams are playing better the last few weeks, which give them hope. \u201cHey look, we\u2019re only X games out of the wild card. What should we do?\u201d It makes the decision-making this time of year probably deeper toward the deadline.\n\nQ: You had a good reputation when you were hired as GM, you\u2019ve been around awhile, and people had respect for you. But you are the new guy. Have you noticed GMs try to take advantage of you being new? Low-ball you, something that made you roll your eyes?\n\nA: Is that really somebody trying to pull the wool over your eyes? Or is that just a difference of opinion? Is it two groups of people trying to do their jobs and just have clear difference of opinion on a player? I would rather it be an easy plane back and forth without a lot of politicking or game-playing, and if there\u2019s ridiculous stuff or perceived ridiculous stuff, then so be it. It\u2019s not the end of the world. It\u2019s not like anybody has tried to deliberately take advantage of the new guy. I have enough faith in myself that I won\u2019t allow that to happen. And there are enough good people around me to say, \u201cHey look, if you\u2019re thinking about this idea, you\u2019re probably pretty stupid.\u201d\n\nQ: The Rockies have had a difficult time producing pitchers who last at the major-league level. Have you changed your viewpoint how that might be better approached since you\u2019ve taken over as GM?\n\nA: The reality of pitching, with Tommy John and injuries, we need a reality check. What does long-lasting mean? Does it mean superlative performance over a long time? I don\u2019t think any team has had that for awhile. I\u2019m not trying to say we\u2019ve done an excellent job of developing starting pitching. That\u2019s been a challenge for us. It\u2019s something we need to do better. But we have to be realistic about what that really means in this day and age. Depth is key. And to put a lot of eggs in one or two baskets, is not the best way to go. But then you have a guy like Jorge De La Rosa who basically has pitched to his contract every time we\u2019ve re-signed him. He\u2019s done it over multiple contracts. It\u2019s not easy for anybody. It\u2019s easier for some. This is an offensive ballpark and probably always will be. It doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t. But we definitely need to do a better job by creating depth for ourselves.\n\nQ: Has that shaded your approach with Jon Gray and Eddie Butler? Are you more likely to be patient with younger arms, trying to protect them?\n\nA: Honestly, I was the guy who pushed for Eddie Butler to come up last year. I felt like he was ready. In hindsight, maybe not the best recommendation in the world. It didn\u2019t go so well. He probably wasn\u2019t ready. But at the time, I felt he did enough to make that jump. I hope that the experience of it all will lead to a lot of learning and much better things for him at this level. The journey to the big-leagues as a player or a pitcher is an individual thing. There\u2019s no one way we\u2019re going to do things. It comes down to the individual. The growth of him as an athlete and a person, his maturity, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s formulaic. We\u2019re talking about human beings.\n\nQ: If a trade offer came to you that you were intrigued by, that you wanted to pull the trigger on, do you feel empowered enough to make that happen and to convince Dick Monfort it\u2019s the right idea?\n\nA: Dick and I are in constant communication. We have been since I was offered the job. Nothing will change at the deadline. We\u2019re constantly talking. We\u2019re always sharing ideas. And I\u2019m updating him, day-by-day, on the deadline and where we\u2019re at. That\u2019s always been part of the process. It won\u2019t change. Empowered? Yeah, I feel empowered as the GM to make trades. I was empowered in the offseason to do what I thought was necessary. Certainly, we all work within certain constraints and limitations. But within that, yeah, I feel empowered. It will be on me and Dick and everybody else to maintain quality communication throughout the process. Nobody should be surprised about anything.\n\nQ: You don\u2019t have the checkbook.\n\nA: It\u2019s not my money. If I had that much money, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d own a ballclub. I might own an island somewhere, sitting on it.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\n\nThe Rockies have struggled on the road and at home this season.
