The Defense Department has identified the three U.S. Marines killed on June 20 (along with a military working dog) by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan.

Killed were:

-Staff Sgt. David H. Stewart, 34, of Stafford, Va.

-Lance Cpl. Brandon J. Garabrant, 19, of Peterborough, N.H.

-Lance Cpl. Adam F. Wolff, 25, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa

All three Marines were assigned to 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Lejeune, N.C.

The New York Daily News reports Garabrant made headlines last year when ConVal Regional High School in Peterborough, N.H. denied his request to wear his Marine Corps dress uniform at graduation; Garabrant had already completed boot camp.
