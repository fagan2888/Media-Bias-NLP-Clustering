Hospitals linked to lower spending can earn bonuses.\n\n\u201cIt is a completely new way for hospitals to be paid,\u201d said Fred Bentley, a vice president for the consulting company Avalere. The company\u2019s analysis of the new payment system estimates that more than half of participating hospitals will face penalties.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to require them to think about not only the care they\u2019re delivering in the hospital, but what\u2019s happening to (patients) when they get discharged,\u201d Bentley said.\n\nThe Avalere analysis shows that on average, Medicare spending nationwide for knee or hip replacement totals $25,565. The hospital payment accounts for only a little over half of that.\n\nAccording to information provided by Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, average per-patient charges at hospitals in the state varied from just under $30,000 to almost $214,000 in 2014.\n\nNot counting doctor bills, 39 percent of Medicare\u2019s spending on joint replacement patients occurs after they leave the hospital. The largest part of that goes to nursing homes, followed by home health agencies, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and hospitals for re-admissions.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that most hospitals don\u2019t know where their patients go after they are discharged,\u201d Fred Bentley, a vice president at Avalere, said in the report.\n\nThe joint-replacement project will require participation by 800 hospitals nationwide in 67 metro areas. Of those, eight metro areas are in Florida, covering 19 counties:\n\n\u00b7 Gainesville area (Alachua, Gilchrist counties)\n\n\u00b7 South Florida, from Miami to West Palm Beach (Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach Counties\n\n\u00b7 Naples area (Collier County)\n\n\u00b7 Greater Orlando area (Lake, Orange, Osceola, Seminole Counties)\n\n\u00b7 Pensacola area (Escambia, Santa Rosa Counties)\n\n\u00b7 Port St. Lucie area (Martin, St. Lucie Counties)\n\n\u00b7 Sebastian and Vero Beach (Indian River County)\n\n\u00b7 Tampa Bay area (Hernando, Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas Counties)\n\nSee a detailed list of the participating hospitals here.\n\nCentral and South Florida have been targeted in this experiment for two reasons, Bentley said. One is obvious: there are millions of Medicare patients in these regions of the state. The other is that Florida has historically had a much higher than average level of spending per patient.\n\nHip and knee replacements are the most common inpatient procedure for Medicare beneficiaries, and they require a long period of recovery. According to the federal website that describes the project there were more than 400,000 such joint operations in 2014, at a cost to Medicare of more than $7 billion just for the hospital treatment.\n\nResearchers have shown that high per-patient spending levels often reflect an intensive, high-tech system of medical treatment even when it is too late, in the final months of life. Such spending levels have also been linked to fraud and abuse.\n\nIn health-care lingo, hospitals will receive \u201cbundled payments\u201d that cover an \u201cepisode of care,\u201d from the patient\u2019s check-in through 90 days after discharge. The change should not be visible to patients; it will show up only in money transfers between government contractors and hospitals. Independent physicians, home-health companies and others will still get their own Medicare payments.\n\nIn an interview with Health News Florida, Bentley said that in the first year of the project, participating hospitals will have to account for spending only in comparison to their own past performance. But in the second year, he said, hospital scores will be affected by the performance of others in the region.\n\nIt\u2019s very exciting,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of managing and delivering care.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, he said, the federal health-payment agency \u2013 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2013 \u201cis requiring hospitals to actually coordinate care much more effectively with physicians and with nursing homes and with home-health providers.\u201d\n\nThe Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model, the official name for the payment project, is being sponsored by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. The center was created under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in November that the focus on episodes of care rather than a piecemeal system should reduce confusion, duplication, and re-hospitalizations because of complications. The model will factor in quality measures as well as cost.\n\nNo repayment will be expected for the first year, Burwell said, but they will be in the second year. To reduce the downside risk, HHS agreed to limit the loss to a maximum of 5 percent for the second year, 10 percent for the third year, and 20 percent after that, with special protections built in for rural or Medicare-dependent hospitals.\n\nOne of the goals of the administration of President Barack Obama was to have 30 percent of Medicare fee-for-service payments shifted to value-based models by the end of this year.\n\nCarol Gentry is a special correspondent for WUSF in Tampa.
