On Wednesday, he told a crowd of 1,400 at the University of Michigan that he visited a local deli, Zingerman\u2019s. He proceeded to tell a long story about ordering the small Reuben sandwich, which he said was \u201ckiller.\u201d That description got a good laugh. Then he explained how he thought the sandwich was too big, so he shared it with his adviser, Valerie Jarrett.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished [my] half, I wanted [her] half back,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut it was too late, all she had was the pickle \u2013 so I took the pickle.\u201d\n\n\u201cTook the pickle\u201d was a huge laugh line.\n\nPickle is a funny word, but still; when an audience thinks this is a knee-slapper, you know it\u2019s not a rough crowd.\n\nBut Obama had a serious point to make as well. Zingerman\u2019s \u201cis a business that treats its workers well and rewards honest work with honest wages. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to talk about today.\u201d He then segued into a pitch for raising the minimum wage.\n\nNational Review\u2019s Andrew Johnson noted that Zingerman\u2019s is pretty expensive. That small Reuben cost $13.99 \u2013 pickle included! (Thank you! I\u2019m here all week. Please tip your servers.) The large goes for nearly $17. The irony might have been lost on the president that Zingerman\u2019s \u201chonest wages\u201d also lead to high prices.\n\nUsing Zingerman\u2019s as his comedic muse, the president transformed into Zinger-Man. According to the Washington Post, Obama hurled \u201ca series of zingers to draw a contrast with Republicans on the economy in an election year.\u201d\n\nBreaking slightly from the standard talking point that the GOP is out of ideas, Obama said, \u201cNow, to give them credit, they do have one original idea, which is to repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHe then turned to Representative Paul Ryan\u2019s budget proposal: \u201cIf they tried to sell this sandwich at Zingerman\u2019s, they\u2019d have to call it the Stinkburger, or the Meanwich.\u201d\n\nNot since the First Barbary War, when Thomas Jefferson proclaimed, \u201cI see London, I see France, I see John Adams\u2019 underpants\u201d has a president so successfully combined deep wit with biting criticism of a political opponent. (Yes, that was a joke, in case the absence of the word \u201cpickle\u201d threw you off.)\n\nIt should go without saying that an audience that thinks this is A-grade material will think Obama\u2019s \u201czingers\u201d hit the mark. The problem, for both Obama and his audience alike, is that the president is utterly incapable of arguing with anything other than a fictional opponent. In 2012, he had to turn Mitt Romney into a cancer-causing extremist who wants to declare war on binders full of women.\n\nNow, the focus-grouped line is that the GOP is \u201cthe party of no,\u201d has \u201cno agenda,\u201d and only wants to repeal Obamacare. Meanwhile, the president loves to say he\u2019s open to good ideas from anybody, including Republicans. But, alas, the GOP refuses to offer any. Last summer, Obama announced that if the Republicans \u201chad some better ideas\u201d on health care, he was \u201chappy to hear them. But I haven\u2019t heard any so far.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the supposedly agenda-less Republican-controlled House has passed more than 40 bills, all of which have gone on to die in the Democrat-controlled Senate (while Obama himself has unilaterally repealed vast swaths of his own law). In recent years, the GOP has offered no fewer than five comprehensive health-care reform proposals. Some honest liberals, like The New Republic\u2019s Jonathan Cohn, concede that \u201cRepublicans do have plenty of ideas.\u201d But, they won\u2019t achieve \u201cuniversal coverage, at least in the way most people understand it.\u201d\n\nNever mind that Obamacare fails that same test. When the president pitched the Affordable Care Act in 2009, there were roughly 30 million uninsured. The Congressional Budget Office projects that in ten years there will be . . . roughly 30 million uninsured under Obamacare. According to Gallup, more people are uninsured today than when Obama took office. Indeed, most of the alleged 7 million \u201cenrollees\u201d in Obamacare are people who lost their health insurance because of Obamacare.\n\nPerhaps the biggest irony is that the young people Obama had in stitches are being forced to pay too much for health insurance in order to subsidize health care for others. In other words, they\u2019re laughing at the pickle, but the joke is really on them.\n\n\u2014 Jonah Goldberg is the author of The Tyranny of Clich\u00e9s, now on sale in paperback.
