But in 2014, more than 15 percent of people who selected health plans in the public marketplaces failed to pay their share of premiums and were therefore not on the rolls at the end of the year. Officials said they thought that similar attrition could occur this year.\n\nSylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said that more than 7.1 million people had selected or been automatically re-enrolled in plans through the federal exchange, HealthCare.gov, and that 2.4 million were signed up in states running their own exchanges.\n\nFlorida had the largest number of sign-ups with nearly 1.3 million people enrolled for 2015, followed by California with 1.2 million, federal officials said. Florida uses the federal exchange, and California runs its own.\n\n\u201cWe still have a lot of work to do before Feb. 15, but are encouraged by the strong interest we\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d Ms. Burwell said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn federal and state exchanges, about 26 percent of those signing up were 18 to 34 years old. Insurers see younger customers as particularly desirable because they tend to be healthy and their premiums can help cover medical claims for older, less healthy subscribers. Roughly one in five Americans age 18 to 34 still have no health insurance, according to government data.\n\nIn September, the administration reported that 7.3 million people had coverage and had paid their premiums in 2014. The current open enrollment period began Nov. 15 and ends Feb. 15.\n\nThe White House predicts a surge of enrollments just before the deadline. But federal officials have a long way to go to meet projections by the Congressional Budget Office, which said on Monday that the number of people in the exchanges would rise to 12 million this year, 21 million in 2016 and 25 million for each of the three years after that.\n\nMs. Burwell said that 87 percent of people with coverage through the federal exchange had qualified for financial assistance in the form of tax credits to help pay their premiums.\n\nCritics of the Affordable Care Act are challenging the subsidies, saying the law does not authorize tax credits for premiums in states using the federal insurance exchange. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the challenge this year.\n\nHealth plans are classified in five categories, depending on the share of care costs covered by the insurance. The administration said that 70 percent of people in the federal marketplace had selected the midlevel silver plan, while 19 percent had chosen bronze plans, which typically have lower premiums but higher deductibles and more out-of-pocket costs.\n\nOf the people obtaining coverage for 2015 through the federal marketplace, 4.1 million selected or were assigned to the same plans they had in 2014, and three million were customers choosing plans for the first time.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government sets detailed standards for insurers offering coverage in the exchanges. The administration is proposing changes in Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance that would compensate doctors and hospitals according to their performances, cutting payments to those who provide inferior care while rewarding those who keep their patients healthy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Burwell said the government would move Medicare away from traditional fee-for-service medicine to \u201calternative payment models\u201d in which doctors and hospitals would be held accountable for the quality and cost of care.\n\n\u201cWe want to reward value and care coordination, rather than value and care duplication,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2014, officials said, about 20 percent of spending in the fee-for-service Medicare program \u2014 $72.4 billion of $362 billion \u2014 was linked to doctors\u2019 abilities to coordinate care. Ms. Burwell said the government wanted to increase this proportion to 30 percent by the end of 2016 and to 50 percent by the end of 2018.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t overstate the importance of this,\u201d said Dr. Andrew D. Racine, senior vice president and chief medical officer at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. \u201cThe secretary is pushing on an open door. The country is moving in this direction, regardless of what the government does, but she can add to the momentum. Fee-for-service is dying as a way to pay for medical care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150127195427, "twitter": {"description": "As a Feb. 15 deadline approaches, the Obama administration said 9.5 million people had signed up for insurance this year through public marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Health Care Enrollment Appears to Be Near Goal", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/us/politics/health-care-enrollment-appears-to-be-near-goal.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003476575"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/us/politics/health-care-enrollment-appears-to-be-near-goal.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003476575", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/us/politics/health-care-enrollment-appears-to-be-near-goal.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Health Care Enrollment Appears to Be Near Goal", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 27, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Health and Human Services Department", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health and Human Services Department,Obama  Barack,Burwell  Sylvia Mathews", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Burwell, Sylvia Mathews", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "As a Feb. 15 deadline approaches, the Obama administration said 9.5 million people had signed up for insurance this year through public marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "As a Feb. 15 deadline approaches, the Obama administration said 9.5 million people had signed up for insurance this year through public marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 27, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2015-01-28", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Burwell, Sylvia Mathews", "published": "2015-01-27", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "28health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150128155246, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/us/politics/health-care-enrollment-appears-to-be-near-goal.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "As a Feb. 15 deadline approaches, the Obama administration said 9.5 million people had signed up for insurance this year through public marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Health Care Enrollment Appears to Be Near Goal"}, "pdate": 20150127, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000003476575, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Health Care Enrollment Appears to Be Near Goal", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Florida had the largest number of sign-ups with nearly 1.3 million people enrolled for 2015, followed by California with 1.2 million, federal officials said.\nHealth plans are classified in five categories, depending on the share of care costs covered by the insurance.\n\u201cWe want to reward value and care coordination, rather than value and care duplication,\u201d she said.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government sets detailed standards for insurers offering coverage in the exchanges.\nIn September, the administration reported that 7.3 million people had coverage and had paid their premiums in 2014."}
