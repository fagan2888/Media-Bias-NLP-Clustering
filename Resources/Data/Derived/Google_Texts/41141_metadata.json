She\u2019ll be protesting this next Wednesday as part of the Fight for 15 movement. Advertisement\n\n\n\nImagine you\u2019re a 37-year-old woman, three months pregnant, living in the Arden-Arcade area, taking the bus to your job at Burger King, where every week you work 40 hours but only earn $9.25 for each. The proverbial burger-flipping and hot-oil frying. On more days than you like, the bus is late. You usually run out of money well before the first of the month. This sounds like a brutal reality. But it\u2019s everyday life for Holly Dias.\n\nYet Dias says she actually likes being in the fast-food industry. \u201cI\u2019m good at working with customers,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd if you are, then you can advance.\u201d\n\nBut advancing doesn\u2019t always mean earning more when it comes to corporate America. She\u2019s worked at Burger Kings since the day after Christmas in 2008 and still only earns 25 cents more than the state minimum wage. \u201cI\u2019ve been applying for other jobs, but they\u2019re not there,\u201d she explained.\n\nWelcome to post-recession America.\n\nDias and others are quick to point out that low-wage jobs are growing faster than any other paying gigs in the United States. The Department of Labor agrees with this. And it\u2019s not just fast-food gigs.\n\nJosephine Brown teaches preschool. You\u2019d think that she\u2019d at least earn a decent salary, perhaps like public-school teachers. Not quite: She makes $11.44 an hour.\n\nHow can a teacher, even one without a college degree, make that little money? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I ask the same question,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty heartbreaking that we don\u2019t make more than we do.\u201d She recently had to get a second job to make ends meet.\n\nBut the two women aren\u2019t giving up. They\u2019ve joined thousands of other low-wage workers as part of the \u201cFight for 15,\u201d a national labor movement demanding a higher minimum wage. This next Tax Day, on April 15, these activists will be going on strike in hopes of raising attention about their bottom-feeder pay.\n\nThe movement to up wages has caught fire during the past six months. In November of last year, five U.S. states elected to increase their minimum wages. In San Francisco, voters upped the minimum wage from then-$10.74 an hour to $15, following suit with Seattle.\n\nHere in Sacramento, there\u2019s traction to pass a similar citywide minimum-wage ordinance. Mayor Kevin Johnson has stated raising Sacramento\u2019s minimum wage as a goal this year, and he has some support on city council, including Councilman Jay Schenirer.\n\nBut there are legitimate worries that raising the minimum wage could have a negative impact on local businesses.\n\nSandra Lemos owns three boutique-style fitness studios with nearly 45 employees on payroll. She supports paying people higher than the minimum wage. But she also worries that if Sacramento were to up its lowest pay agrave; la what was done this past year in San Francisco or Seattle, local small businesses would have a hard time surviving.\n\n\u201cI do believe in a minimum wage increase, but no small business has that capability to overnight increase payroll by 30 percent,\u201d she said.\n\nYet low-wage workers like Dias are getting louder. \u201cI\u2019m here to demand that we get paid $15 an hour, because that\u2019s what we need to survive,\u201d she says. \u201cI make barely over the minimum wage, and that\u2019s not cutting it. As soon as I pay my bills\u2014if I can even pay my bills\u2014I\u2019m broke the very next day.\u201d\n\nThe wage wars\n\nLet\u2019s clear up some of the myths about minimum- and low-wage workers.\n\nMost people, for instance, believe that the majority of minimum-wage earners are young kids, summer-job high-schoolers or part-time teens. But according to the Department of Labor, 88 percent of minimum-wage earners are older than 20. About 53 percent of these workers are full time. And 55 percent of these workers are women.\n\nBrown has taught preschoolers for more than 10 years at Childtime, a child-care center in Natomas. She\u2019s not a minimum-wage worker, but a city ordinance that upped Sacramento\u2019s bottom wage would certainly impact her $11.44 hourly rate.\n\nUntil this happens, however, she\u2019s had to take up a second job, at WinCo in Elk Grove. She says she\u2019s now working nearly 70 hours a week. Plus, she\u2019s also studying early childhood education at Sacramento City College.\n\n\u201cI live paycheck-to-paycheck. I\u2019m scraping,\u201d she told SN&R. She receives no government assistance and isn\u2019t even eligible for Medi-Cal, she says. She doesn\u2019t have medical insurance now and is trying to figure out how to afford it through the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare.\n\nShe says her friends are \u201cshocked\u201d when they learn that she makes $11.44 an hour as a teacher. \u201cI do this for the kids, for the children,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m happy with what I do, even though it doesn\u2019t pay. I love what I do.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m joining this fight, so that I can earn more and keep doing what I love to do.\u201d\n\nBrown is one of many local child-care workers who\u2019ve joined the Fight for 15. She and her colleagues\u2019 stories resonate with the community, with voters\u2014and they\u2019re a big reason why people are electing to increase wages across the country.\n\nPHOTOS BY LISA BAETZ Many Dimple Records employees are part-time college students making low wages. But there are also veteran, essential employees making a decent living, according to owner Dilyn Radakovitz. What happens to a local small business\u2019 payroll if the minimum wage shoots up?\n\n\n\nIn Alaska, Alabama, Illinois, South Dakota and Nebraska, voters in this past election increased the statewide minimum wage. And this despite big wins for the Republican party in those states and elsewhere. One might think that the GOP and low-income workers are diametrically opposed. But that wasn\u2019t even the case in Wisconsin, where union-busting Gov. Scott Walker was re-elected, but multiple regional minimum wages also were voted up.\n\nPerhaps this new Fight for 15 movement is less about progressives versus the right and more about widespread disappointment with the economy\u2019s sluggish recovery and the downward trending of wages in general?\n\nPurchasing power has declined since the late 1960s, according to the Department of Labor. The issue of wages not keeping up with inflation is only exacerbated by exorbitant CEO salaries, as noted by new billboards promoting wage equality, paid for by The California Endowment, throughout the city.\n\nMayor Johnson clearly recognized this national trend to want to increase low wages and, during his State of the City speech in January, said that upping the city\u2019s minimum wage would be a priority.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s press secretary, Ben Sosenko, told SN&R that his office would be rolling out a minimum-wage task force \u201cover the next few months\u201d to meet with interested groups and see what makes sense for Sacramento. \u201cThe Mayor believes all working adults should be able to earn enough to support their families and make their way into the middle class,\u201d Sosenko wrote.\n\nHe noted also that, last year, Mayor Johnson oversaw a unanimous vote at the U.S. Conference of Mayors to call for a raise in the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.\n\nMeanwhile, labor\u2019s new focus on increasing minimum wages has even caught the attention of companies like McDonald\u2019s and Wal-Mart, who both employ millions of low-wage earners.\n\nThe nation\u2019s largest employer, Wal-Mart, announced earlier this year that it would raise the wages of its poorest workers to $10 an hour by next February. McDonald\u2019s also apparently felt the pressure and, last month, announced that it would be upping its wages to at least $1 over the federal minimum ($7.25 an hour).\n\nBut critics and even The New York Times were quick to point out that McDonald\u2019s move amounted to little more than a publicity stunt. The Times editorial board wrote that a fair wage would be one that paid McDonald\u2019s workers enough so as to not rely on government aid. \u201cResearch indicates that half of fast-food workers rely on public aid, with an estimated $1.2 billion a year in taxpayer dollars going to supplement low wages at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d Many argue that this money should come from corporate profits, not taxpayers.\n\nThe increase at McDonald\u2019s is only good for about 10 percent of the work force, who are employed by corporate stores and not franchises, and nearly all of the company\u2019s employees will earn less than $10 an hour. Many will only earn $8.25 an hour.\n\nAnd this is why, on April 15, Dias and hundreds of other workers throughout the country will be walking out on their gigs at fast-food restaurants in hopes of getting a raise to $15 an hour.\n\nWill they be willing to compromise on that number? \u201cThe fight clearly states $15 an hour,\u201d Dias pointed out.\n\n\u201cAnd I will not take any less.\u201d\n\nBad for small business?\n\nWhile most of the low-wage debate here in Sacramento and nationally is on fast-food powerhouses and corporate retailers, an increase in the local minimum wage would certainly have an impact on small businesses here in our backyard.\n\nDimple Records, for instance, is one of those prototypical local small businesses that would be impacted by wage increases. There are seven Dimple locations regionally, three of them in the city of Sacramento, and the company has more than 150 employees on its payroll. Business at these stores\u2014the sale of CDs, records, books, DVDs and more\u2014is very dependent on changes in the economy, according to owner Dilyn Radakovitz.\n\n\u201cAs gas prices went down recently, our sales went up,\u201d she explained. \u201cOur customer is in tune with the economy.\u201d To that end, wages presumably impact Dimple\u2019s bottom line in a big way.\n\nSo, what if Sacramento ups its minimum wage?\n\n\u201cIf the minimum wage increases [and wages go up], we\u2019ll have to make price adjustments,\u201d she said. Because of this, there will be things that customers \u201cwon\u2019t buy any more, or maybe they won\u2019t buy as much\u201d\u2014perhaps because they can purchase the items cheaper at Best Buy or on Amazon.com.\n\nBut will a minimum-wage increase hurt her business\u2014especially because she employs many low-wage college kids?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she answered. \u201cIf it\u2019s done across the board, everybody\u2019s involved, everybody\u2019s going to have to change their pricing structure to pay their bills.\n\nNot everyone in the business community agrees. Especially in the restaurant industry, where owners worry that they\u2019ll no longer be able to make ends meet if they have to give more money to bartenders and servers, many of of whom already take home generous pay via tips.\n\nOther restaurateurs point out that they\u2019ll need to raise prices if the minimum wage goes up\u2014even if it doesn\u2019t rise all the way to $15 an hour, but especially if it does. Higher prices, they argue, put them at a competitive disadvantage regionally. Who\u2019s going to drive in from Elk Grove to Midtown for a newly minted $18 cheeseburger when they can get one for $10 or less in the suburbs?\n\nThere have also been recent reports that the minimum-wage increases in cities such as Seattle and Oakland have had an adverse impact on minority communities. The Seattle Times reported on April 5 that customers at Vietnamese restaurants have rebuffed attempts to raise prices of pho soup. Same for the costs of dishes at restaurants in Oakland\u2019s Chinatown neighborhood.\n\nHere in Sacramento, small-business owners like boutique-fitness-studio owner Sandra Lemos worry that raising the minimum wage too quickly, and too steeply, would be a bad move. She owns three boutique yoga and pilates locations called The Daily Method, including one location in downtown Sacramento, and her employees, who are mostly part-time women looking for supplemental income, earn more than minimum wage. She competes with national chains like 24 Hour Fitness and California Family Fitness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an advocate of a higher minimum wage,\u201d she said\u2014but the city needs to be careful about how it implements a wage bump.\n\nFor instance: If Sacramento were to raise its minimum in one fell swoop, like what\u2019s happening in San Francisco, staying afloat would be hard. \u201cIf you think about increasing anybody\u2019s expenses 30 to 40 percent,\u201d she said, \u201cit really worries me.\u201d\n\nLemos pointed out that she can\u2019t pass along payroll costs to her customers, too, because they will only pay so much for yoga or fitness before they defect to companies like 24 Hour, who are better suited to absorb payroll hikes.\n\nRaising the minimum wage in the city also might put Sacramento at a competitive disadvantage with regional businesses. Lemos operates studios in Folsom and Roseville, too. \u201cFor me, it would be \u2019Well, I\u2019m just not going to do business here\u2019 if things got too tough,\u201d she said.\n\nUC Davis economics professor and director of the Center for Poverty Research Ann Huff Stevens says that when people are \u201ctalking about moving $9 an hour to $15 an hour, we know virtually nothing\u201d about how that will impact employment or small businesses. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know, and so there\u2019s a risk.\u201d\n\nShe agrees these new local, municipal low-wage ordinances could spur negative impacts, such as motivating companies to move across city-limit lines, as has been threatened in Los Angeles, where there are discussions to raise the county minimum wage to $15 an hour. This is \u201cworrisome,\u201d she says.\n\nThere are, of course, benefits to wage increases. For instance, \u201cby raising the minimum wage, we can dramatically improve dependence on the safety net,\u201d she explained. This means less people on food stamps and the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program.\n\nHer advice for Sacramento would be to carefully raise wages at the bottom, make small adjustments to the minimum wage, and also think about using the tax system to benefit low-income workers (such as lobbying for a statewide earned income tax credit, which would \u201ceffectively be a subsidy for low-income workers.\u201d)\n\nGeorge Jouganatos, a lecturer in economics at Sacramento State, says he\u2019s not too concerned about a minimum-wage increase harming local businesses.\n\nFor instance, some suggest that raising wages will lead to less jobs and inflation. \u201cThe reality is that unemployment hasn\u2019t risen\u201d where the minimum wage has gone up, he explained. He also said an increase in prices may not sustain if the costs are passed on to consumers, many of whom will have more to spend because of wage increases.\n\n\u201cThe folks making more money, what do they do with it? They\u2019re going to spend it. A higher minimum wage would be spent quite a bit in Sacramento,\u201d he said.\n\nJouganatos argued that a higher minimum wage could have positive economic impacts, such as higher productivity, happier workers, less employee turnover and, ultimately, lower costs to companies.\n\n\u201cIf we raise folks above poverty, then maybe we\u2019ll get rid of some of the misery,\u201d he explained, suggesting that the city and business interests would save money on anything from social services costs to crime enforcement to graffiti abatement.\n\nHe agreed with the business community, however, that there might need to be \u201cexemptions to minimum-wage laws,\u201d such as in the restaurant industry.\n\nIt seems most small-business owners support some kind of increase. A Department of Labor survey from last June found that \u201cmore than three out of five small business owners support increasing the [federal] minimum wage to $10.10.\u201d\n\nDream jobs and realities\n\nWhat would Holly Dias do with a raise? If her paycheck went from $1,100 a month to $2,400? How would she spend that extra money? A vacation? Disneyland? Maybe spoil herself a bit?\n\n\u201cI would get my bills caught up,\u201d she said, point-blank.\n\nDias is at least a couple of months behind on the electric bill. On top of that, it\u2019s $400 a month, at least, just to rent a room today. A Regional Transit bus pass is $100 a month. And, since she has a baby coming in October, she should probably be thinking about getting her own place, she says, which will more than double her rent and utilities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to take care of the baby now, and it\u2019s not going to be easy. I have to think about him. Or her.\u201d\n\nA lot of people say that low-wage jobs such as fast-food are supposed to be stepping stones to something else. Temporary. Beginner work. \u201cI would like to ask these people, these business people and politicians who condemn what we\u2019re fighting for, how many low-income jobs have they ever worked,\u201d Dias said. \u201cAre they aware of what\u2019s even happening? I don\u2019t feel like they care.\u201d\n\nShe wonders if they know that, for instance, she is on Medi-Cal for the baby, because Burger King does not offer affordable medical care. This essentially means that the public is subsidizing Burger King, since it can\u2019t offer competitive health care for its full-time workers. \u201cI work for a company that doesn\u2019t even care about their employees.\u201d\n\nJosephine Brown says she would definitely enroll at Sacramento State if she was earning $15 an hour. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to attend now,\u201d the 32-year-old explained.\n\nBut she\u2019s not hopeless. And neither is Dias. They\u2019re confident that this Fight for 15 will pay off in the end. Dias hopes she\u2019ll be able to save up not just for her kid, but to move on to another job someday.\n\nWhat would be her dream job? \u201cTo be a lawyer,\u201d she said, \u201cfighting for children\u2019s rights.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "By Nick Miller.
