It\u2019s not good for any of us taxpayers.\u201d\n\nIf you think the political debate over health care is over, think again. Conservative republican lawmakers such as Senator Patrick Colbeck are not expected to roll over on their opposition to Obamacare despite the high court ruling. In fact, there are predictions the political back and forth will ratchet up in the upcoming election cycle.\n\n\u201cThey are going to flog the Obamacare issue because it plays well with their base,\u201d said Adrian Hemond, Grassroots Midwest. \u201cIf you want to win are republican primary, Obamacare is a great issue and they will continue to use it.\u201d\n\nEven though the governor supported the expansion of health care to needy families, he ran into stiff opposition room his own party and one lawmaker predicts the republicans will not take this lying down.\n\n\u201cWe can make amendments or we can make bills that would create, I would say confusion, and or put up walls that would go ahead to retool Obamacare,\u201d said State Rep. Peter Lucido (R), Macomb County.\n\nBut this democrat counters, there\u2019s a political risk if the republicans goes there.\n\n\u201cIf the republicans want to demonize something that is a fundamental security for all of our citizens let them do that. The fact that republicans will continue to waste time and energy on this trying to repeal it is sending the wrong message that they\u2019re doing nothing to help the average Michiganders,\u201d said State Rep. Sam Singh (D), East Lansing.\n\nBottom line the high court decision has not settled the political fight over getting health care to needy families.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even though the nation's highest court has resolved the policy aspects of the president's health program, the political ramifications remain in play especially on the republican side of the ledger.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540518235", "og": {"site_name": "WLNS", "description": "Even though the nation\u2019s highest court has resolved the policy aspects of the president\u2019s health program, the political ramifications remain in play especially on the republican side of\u2026", "title": "Skubick: Supreme Court ruling on health care could jump start political fighting", "url": "http://wlns.com/2015/06/25/skubick-supreme-court-ruling-on-health-care-could-jump-start-political-fighting/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/3d2f4df29a7952a0f5fcf22e47169abe?s=200&ts=1464247795", "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even though the nation\u2019s highest court has resolved the policy aspects of the president\u2019s health program, the political ramifications remain in play especially on the republican side of\u2026", "title": "Skubick: Supreme Court ruling on health care could jump start political fighting", "image": "http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/3d2f4df29a7952a0f5fcf22e47169abe?s=240", "creator": "@WLNS", "site": "wlns", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "WLNS, 6 News, Michigan, ACA, Affordable Care Act, Obama Care", "msapplication-tooltip": "Your Local News Leader, providing up-to-date local news, weather and sports for Lansing and Jackson 24 hours a day.
