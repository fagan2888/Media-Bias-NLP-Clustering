She was homeless when she was diagnosed with HIV decades ago. ( Heidi de Marco/KHN )\n\nA major insurer said recently it would offer life insurance to HIV-positive people because of their rising life expectancies, prompting cheers from AIDS activists. But on the very same day, the nation\u2019s top disease control official described an America falling far short in its fight against AIDS.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to talk about HIV prevention with someone who is homeless or someone who isn\u2019t sure where they\u2019re going to find their next meal.\u201d Anthony Hayes, GMHC\n\nIt might seem a jarring disconnect \u2014 but it reflects very different realities dividing the estimated 1.2 million Americans living with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.\n\nWhile life expectancies are approaching the national norm among white, affluent gay men, about 66 percent of the 1.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States are not in treatment, imperiling their health and putting them at risk for infecting others.\n\nNearly half of the approximately 45,000 Americans infected with HIV each year are African-Americans, mostly they are gay or bisexual men. Both African-Americans and Latinos are less likely to remain in treatment than whites. Compared to white men, African American men were more than seven times and Latino men were almost twice as likely to die from HIV-related complications.\n\nHIV/AIDS activists and physicians say that despite the significant medical advances in treating the disease, many patients are being left behind because of their life circumstances. Groups that once held angry demonstrations against government agencies and pharmaceutical companies to speed access to affordable, life-saving HIV medications now emphasize the socioeconomic barriers that keep some people living with HIV from consistently obtaining and using those drugs to remain healthy.\n\n\u201cThere is an extreme disparity when it comes to treating HIV and AIDS,\u201d said Anthony Hayes, managing director of public affairs and policy for GMHC, formerly Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical, when we talk about ending the epidemic, to not just talk about the science. These are people who are incredibly vulnerable as it relates to all aspects of society. In contrast, more affluent HIV positive people \u2014 specifically gay white men \u2014 are able to access care, they have jobs, they have homes, they have access to life\u2019s basic necessities that many do not.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to talk about HIV prevention with someone who is homeless or someone who isn\u2019t sure where they\u2019re going to find their next meal.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a simple matter of financing care for those who can\u2019t afford it. Treatment and social services are currently available for low-income and uninsured or underinsured patients under the Ryan White Act. Once long waiting lists for free HIV medications have virtually been eliminated. But basic survival \u2013 money to live, a place to sleep \u2014 often takes precedence over seeking help and closely managing a disease that can be symptom-free in its early stages, doctors say.\n\nLoren Jones, 63, of Berkeley, was homeless when she was first diagnosed with HIV about 30 years ago. And for many years she wasn\u2019t symptomatic, so her diagnosis was rarely at the top of her list of worries, Jones said. \u201cIt actually sinks to the bottom. HIV becomes another thing on your, like, to-do list.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJones eventually was able to find a government-subsidized studio apartment in Berkeley and qualify for Social Security disability benefits. She recently had a bout with eczema, a serious skin rash that can be a marker for the progression of HIV-related disease. Her blood pressure spiked, leading to discovery of kidney disease, a common complication of HIV.\n\nNewer approaches to controlling HIV/AIDS focus on a \u201ccontinuum of care,\u201d from the very beginning. Federal health official are trying to track improvements or setbacks at every stage: testing, linking the newly diagnosed to care within three months, getting HIV-positive people to remain in treatment, prescribing them antiretroviral drugs, and suppressing HIV viral load \u2013 the amount of HIV in the blood \u2013 to a very low level.\n\nPeople fall out of care at every stage, with minorities generally faring worse than whites. The the goal is to keep them in treatment, not only for their sake but because research has shown that people with low or undetectable viral loads are far less likely to transmit the disease to others.\n\nDr. Edward Machtinger, director of the Women\u2019s HIV Program at the UC, San Francisco, said his clinic has been able to achieve viral suppression in up to 80 percent of its patients. But the focus on biomedical treatment of their HIV obscures the deep challenges many of his patients face: poverty, domestic abuse, addiction, mental illness, he noted.\n\n\u201cComplex trauma is what led many of my patients to get HIV in first place and gets them to remain depressed, stay addicted and have trouble adhering to their meds,\u201d Machtinger said. \u201cMedicine and HIV primary care has not considered these health issues to be in their domain and their responsibility. I\u2019ve heard many clinicians brag about having patients on crack be undetectable in their viral load, as if HIV was going to kill them in the first place. It\u2019s not. Crack is going to kill them.\u201d\n\nAddressing HIV patients\u2019 social and economic challenges \u2014 often referred to as \u201csocial determinants of health\u201d \u2014 is complicated and not reimbursable, Machtinger said. \u201cWhat we really need to do is find a way for patients to be safer, more empowered and healthy.\u201d\n\nDr. William Cunningham, a UCLA medicine and public health professor, is researching ways to help marginalized HIV-positive people stay in treatment and avoid infecting others. He\u2019s co-directing a $4.6 million, five-year study that pairs recently released Los Angeles County jail inmates who are HIV-positive with peer navigators who help them find medical care and new prescriptions of antiretroviral medications they received while incarcerated.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to survive outside \u2014 to get housing, to get a job. We just don\u2019t have a system that\u2019s designed for people who have those kinds of issues. It\u2019s designed for well-educated, well-informed consumers in a market type system,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cIt\u2019s the context of people\u2019s lives that is just so difficult that HIV is not their biggest problem. We haven\u2019t come up with any kind of magic bullet, but at the very least, we need to focus on these social barriers to a greater extent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite significant medical advances in treating HIV/AIDS, many patients are left behind because of their life circumstances.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"It's Not Hard to Treat HIV -- Unless You're Poor\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/12\\/28\\/its-not-hard-to-treat-hiv-aids-unless-youre-poor\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-28 09:22:06\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-12-28 09:38:24\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":131112,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"HIV\\/AIDS\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/12\\/loren-jones-3-e1451322539238.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Despite significant medical advances in treating HIV/AIDS, many patients are left behind because of their life circumstances.", "title": "It\u2019s Not Hard to Treat HIV \u2014 Unless You\u2019re Poor", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/12/28/its-not-hard-to-treat-hiv-aids-unless-youre-poor/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/12/loren-jones-4-400x267.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "hiv/aids,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Compared to white men, African American men were more than seven times and Latino men were almost twice as likely to die from HIV-related complications.\nCrack is going to kill them.\u201dAddressing HIV patients\u2019 social and economic challenges \u2014 often referred to as \u201csocial determinants of health\u201d \u2014 is complicated and not reimbursable, Machtinger said.\n\u201cMedicine and HIV primary care has not considered these health issues to be in their domain and their responsibility.\nNearly half of the approximately 45,000 Americans infected with HIV each year are African-Americans, mostly they are gay or bisexual men.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the context of people\u2019s lives that is just so difficult that HIV is not their biggest problem."}
