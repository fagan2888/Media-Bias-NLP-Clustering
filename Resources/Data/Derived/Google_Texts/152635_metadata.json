(Photo: Submitted Photo)\n\nHe died a hero's death, throwing himself on a grenade to save the lives of his squad in Vietnam.\n\nFor his selfless act on June 7, 1970, near Hiep Duc in South Vietnam, Army Staff Sgt. Robert C. Murray, of Tuckahoe, was posthumously awarded the nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor.\n\nForty-five years later to the day, more than 100 family members, veterans, friends and strangers gathered Sunday at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in a somber graveside ceremony to remember him.\n\n\"We just know it was the right thing to do,\" said Debra Palazzo, of Daughters of Liberty's Legacy, which organized the event along with Eastchester's VFW Post 2285. \"It was our obligation to give voice to Robert Murray and to share his story of sacrifice with the next generation.\"\n\nSection 43 of the cemetery was lined with U.S. flags for the remembrance, which began with the presentation of colors by a color guard accompanied by the Westchester County Police Emerald Society Pipes and Drums. Nearby, a huge flag flew from a Thornwood Volunteer Fire Department tower ladder truck.\n\nPalazzo and Daughters of Liberty co-founder Cynthia Kaufman made brief remarks, as did Chaplain Capt. Robert Donnelly of American Legion Post 135, VFW Post 2285 Commander Robert Foster, Deputy Westchester County Executive Kevin Plunkett and Robert O'Donnell, a 1964 classmate of Murray's at Fordham Prep.\n\nBuy Photo Grave at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne of Tuckahoe native Robert C.

A third sister, Tricia Wunsch, was unable to be there. Murray's mother, Frances Murray, died a few weeks ago.\n\nThe ceremony ended with a rifle salute, the playing of \"Taps\" and the singing of \"God Bless America.\"\n\n\"It was wonderful to see everyone here to pay tribute to my brother,\" Jim Murray, of Bronxville, said after the hour-long tribute. \"He was a wonderful guy, and his death was a terrible loss for our family, especially for our mother and father.\"\n\nTwitter: @RichLiebson\n\nBuy Photo Graveside ceremony at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne for Tuckahoe native Robert C.
