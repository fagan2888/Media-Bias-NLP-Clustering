(CNS) \u2014 As a native Philadelphian, I\u2019m proud of the city\u2019s Independence Hall, the Pennsylvania Statehouse that became the birthplace of the United States when the Founding Fathers approved the Declaration of Independence there in 1776.\n\nThe lightning of history struck the building again, in 1787, when during what\u2019s been called the \u201cMiracle at Philadelphia,\u201d a federal convention there produced the resilient Constitution of the United States.\n\nWhen Pope Francis spoke Sept. 26 at Independence Hall about religious liberty, he mentioned Philadelphia\u2019s founding by the Quakers, led by the Society of Friends\u2019 William Penn, who established religious tolerance in his colony.\n\nPenn anticipated the First Amendment of the Constitution when he wrote in the Pennsylvania Charter of Liberties, \u201cNo people can be truly happy, though under the greatest enjoyment of civil liberties, if abridged of the freedom of their conscience as to their religious profession or worship.\u201d\n\nWith the pope spoke on religious freedom at Independence Hall, it was easy to wonder how many Founding Fathers would have been appalled by the \u201cpope of Rome\u201d being welcomed to speak to the U.S. Congress or in front of the hall.\n\nWhen Al Smith, a Catholic governor of New York, ran for president in 1928, and even when John F. Kennedy ran in 1960, anti-Catholic bigotry was stirred.\n\nBut Francis spoke to Congress and even uttered a prayer, \u201cGod bless America,\u201d and the country did not become a Vatican state.\n\nSpeaking of the pope, religious liberty and Independence Hall, I was privileged to attend a prayer service at Independence Hall in 1983. That\u2019s when members of Catholic Press Association gathered for a convention in Philadelphia and we were welcomed into an \u201cupstairs room\u201d in the Hall by the National Park Service. The prayers were led by Archbishop Stephen Sulyk, then head of the Ukrainian Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia.\n\nThe park\u2019s service representative told Msgr. John P. Foley, the editor of The Catholic Standard & Times back then, that the journalists\u2019 prayers in the long gallery marked the first time in its history that Independence Hall had been used for a prayer service.\n\nNext time I accompany friends from out of town to Independence Hall, I\u2019ll glance at those stairs up to the now off limits second floor and credit the Catholic Press Association for paving the way for another Catholic event at the Hall\u2019s front door 32 years later \u2014 Pope Francis\u2019 address.\n\nThe pope last week echoed both Penn and the First Amendment during his speech when he stated, \u201cI would like to reflect with you on the right to religious freedom. It is a fundamental right, which shapes the way we interact socially and personally with our neighbors whose religious views differ from our own.\n\n\u201cReligious freedom certainly means the right to worship God, individually and in community, as our consciences dictate. But religious liberty, by its nature, transcends places of worship and the private sphere of individuals and families.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. bishops have been concerned about religious liberty for several years because they want to maintain the right of faith to be exercised in the public square beyond church walls and private spheres.\n\nIf the pope addressing Congress is a milestone of religious tolerance on a large federal stage, it becomes diminished, the bishops would note, when religious exercise appears thwarted by public policy, such as the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhen Pope Francis visited with the Little Sisters of the Poor in Washington last week, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that visit was a sign of support for the sisters\u2019 lawsuit against the Obama administration\u2019s mandate that employers offer contraceptive coverage in health plans or participate in a religious \u201caccommodation\u201d that the sisters have refused.\n\nSo U.S. courts are now deciding if religious liberty \u201ctranscends places of worship,\u201d and if the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition against restriction on the free exercise of religion applies to the imposed contraception mandate.\n\nReligious freedom has an impressive history in the United States; it will be interesting to see what happens next.\n\nMaybe there should be a prayer service at Independence Hall.\n\n***\n\nRyan, editor/general manager of The Dialog, newspaper of the Diocese of Wilmington, is a former president of the Catholic Press Association.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Catholic Philly", "description": "As a native Philadelphian, I'm proud of the city's Independence Hall, the Pennsylvania Statehouse that became the birthplace of the United States when the Founding Fathers approved the Declaration of Independence there in 1776.", "title": "Pope Francis, religious freedom and Independence Hall", "url": "http://catholicphilly.com/2015/10/think-tank/commentaries/pope-francis-religious-freedom-and-independence-hall/", "image": "http://catholicphilly.com/media-files/2015/10/independence-hall-commentary-300x200.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 108085326801}, "robots": "index,follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://catholicphilly.com/media-files/2016/05/cropped-cplogo-fav-270x270.png"}, "article_summary": "Speaking of the pope, religious liberty and Independence Hall, I was privileged to attend a prayer service at Independence Hall in 1983.\nReligious freedom has an impressive history in the United States; it will be interesting to see what happens next.\nWhen Pope Francis spoke Sept. 26 at Independence Hall about religious liberty, he mentioned Philadelphia\u2019s founding by the Quakers, led by the Society of Friends\u2019 William Penn, who established religious tolerance in his colony.\nMaybe there should be a prayer service at Independence Hall.\n\u201cReligious freedom certainly means the right to worship God, individually and in community, as our consciences dictate."}
