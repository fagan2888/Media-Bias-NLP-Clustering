Obama: ACA doesn't reflect W.H. style\n\nPresident Barack Obama said Thursday that problems with the Obamacare rollout don\u2019t mean he needs to change his White House management style.\n\nInstead, the health care mess is indicative of broader problems with the federal bureaucracy that he hasn\u2019t been able to solve, Obama told Chris Matthews during an MSNBC interview.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe challenge, I think, that we have going forward is not so much my personal management style or particular issues around White House organization,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt actually has to do with what I referred to earlier, which is we have these big agencies, some of which are outdated, some of which are not designed properly.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Why Chris Matthews' Barack Obama interview matters)\n\nObama said \u201cit was obvious that we needed additional controls in place\u201d before Affordable Care Act enrollment began Oct. 1. Yet he said none of those controls center around the structure and style of his White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a strong chief of staff, but I\u2019m holding every cabinet member accountable,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd I want to have strong interactions with them directly. Number two is, I have an open door policy, where I want people to be bringing me bad news, on time, so that we can fix things.\u201d\n\nThe White House has been reluctant to publicly assign blame to individuals responsible for mangling the health care rollout. Obama and top aides have said firing officials responsible for the mess would be counterproductive because they were needed to help fix the system.\n\nDuring the interview, recorded at American University hours before the announcement of Nelson Mandela\u2019s death, Obama cited acquiring a driver\u2019s license, an anecdote from state governments, to illustrate people\u2019s regular problems with bureaucracies.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear hits Mitch McConnell on Obamacare)\n\n\u201cThe more we can just reorganize the guts of how these agencies work, the easier it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the White House is just a tiny part of what is a huge, widespread organization with increasingly complex tasks in a complex world.\u201d\n\nObama reiterated his wish to consolidate federal government agencies that work with small businesses. And as is his custom, he placed the blame on Congress for standing in the way of his efforts to streamline government.\n\n\u201cThe challenge we\u2019ve got is that that requires a law to pass,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd frankly, there are a lot of members of Congress who are chairman of a particular committee. And they don\u2019t want, necessarily, consolidations where they would lose jurisdiction over certain aspects of certain policies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He says the mess shows bureaucracy problems.", "title": "Obama: ACA doesn't reflect W.H. style", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/barack-obama-affordable-care-act-obamacare-health-care-management-style-100759.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/12/05/131205_chris_matthews_barack_obama_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Chris Matthews (57),Affordable Care Act (606),Barack Obama (11780),Obamacare (1140)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He says the mess shows bureaucracy problems.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3c35\"", "article_summary": "stylePresident Barack Obama said Thursday that problems with the Obamacare rollout don\u2019t mean he needs to change his White House management style.\nObama: ACA doesn't reflect W.H.\nYet he said none of those controls center around the structure and style of his White House.\nStory Continued Below\u201cThe challenge, I think, that we have going forward is not so much my personal management style or particular issues around White House organization,\u201d Obama said.\nSteve Beshear hits Mitch McConnell on Obamacare)\u201cThe more we can just reorganize the guts of how these agencies work, the easier it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said."}
