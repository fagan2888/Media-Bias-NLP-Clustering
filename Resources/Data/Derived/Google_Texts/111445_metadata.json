But first: Congress bails on a Zika funding deal.\n\nCONGRESS LEAVES, BUT ZIKA PROBLEM WILL STAY UNRESOLVED \u2014 The Senate's already gone. The House leaves for recess today. And that\u2019s why there's virtually no chance of a breakthrough on the long-awaited Zika funding package \u2014 more than two months after the White House's emergency $1.9 billion request, and a week after senators hinted that a bipartisan deal was close.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhat happened? Democrats pushed for the full White House funding request, while Republicans said they wouldn't budge from $1.1 billion. And the brief moment of comity descended into partisan and even bicameral bickering, with Senate Republicans blasting their counterparts in the House for dragging their heels.\n\n\"It's clear that those Republicans interested in working with us have been beaten back by the extreme right wing, who don\u2019t want to do anything at all,\" Democratic Sen. Patty Murray told reporters this week.\n\n\u2014 Rubio says state officials are 'freaked out' and demand action. The Florida senator warned his colleagues on Thursday that there's no time to waste by going through the usual appropriations process.\n\n\"There is no such thing as a Republican position on Zika or Democrat position on Zika because these mosquitoes bite everyone,\" Marco Rubio said on the Senate floor. \"And they\u2019re not going to ask you what your party registration is or who you plan to vote for in November.\"\n\n\u2014 'On Zika Preparedness And Response, The US Gets A Failing Grade.' Georgetown University experts argue in Health Affairs that Congress is making a public health blunder and a \"political mistake\": http://j.mp/1SOiVc9\n\n\u2014 Where Zika virus could spread next. A new study from NASA researchers projects how temperature and climate could help mosquitoes spread the virus, suggesting that some parts of the southern United States will face year-round threats from the virus.\n\nThey also warned that several cities \u2014 including Washington, D.C. \u2014 would face a medium level of risk from Zika this summer.\n\nSee the study: http://bit.ly/1Z2UKsC\n\nSee the map: http://bit.ly/1TzsHz3\n\nMeanwhile: Scientists say Zika virus is worse than expected. New scans and autopsies reveal that the virus eats away at fetal brain development by destroying lobes that control basic functions like thought and vision.\n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t just microcephaly, like a slightly small head,\u201d Jeanne Sheffield, an expert in fetal medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, told the Wall Street Journal. \"The brain structure is very abnormal.\"\n\nTHANK GOODNESS IT'S FRIDAY PULSE \u2014 And thank you for the wonderful reaction to our new \"Pulse Check\" podcast.

Tips to ddiamond@politico.com or @ddiamond on Twitter.\n\nTHE NEXT BIG ISSUE COULD BE DRUG COSTS \u2014 That's according to CMS acting administrator Andy Slavitt, who told POLITICO's new \"Pulse Check\" podcast that the cost of drugs may well be the number one health policy challenge facing the next administration \u2014 of either party.\n\n\"If we don't address this problem in the next four or five years, and prescription drug costs grow as they've been growing,\" Slavitt warned, \"this will be one of the top three issues for my successor, if not the No. 1 issue.\"\n\nAnd that\u2019s one reason why CMS is contemplating new value-based pilots to address drug costs across the next nine months, he told our podcast. Because if not, he added, \"my successor will say, 'What the heck was Slavitt thinking?'\"\n\nMore: http://politi.co/1XXrS49\n\nICYMI: How the man in charge of Medicare plans to win back doctors' hearts and minds.

Yesterday's PULSE featured immediate reactions to Medicare's proposed new physician payment system \u2014 with the American Medical Association applauding the rule and the American Hospital Association blasting it \u2014 and here's a quick roundup of other voices.\n\nOn the Hill\n\n\u00b7 House W&M Chair Kevin Brady: \"I\u2019m pleased to see the Administration move forward with implementing this important law, and urge them to work with doctors, patients, and health care providers as they finalize the proposed rule.\" More.\n\nSpecialty groups\n\n\u00b7 The American College of Rheumatology: \"Initial review of the proposed rule suggests that CMS has been listening to the rheumatology community\u2019s concerns.\"\n\n\u00b7 The American Medical Group Association: \"We remain concerned that qualifying as an APM remains challenging at best, even for AMGA members, many of whom are very experienced with risk-based payment models.\n\n\u00b7 The American Osteopathic Association: \"These changes respect the kind of quality care osteopathic physicians provide to their patients and give DOs flexibility to pick the payment system and quality measures that actually reflect how they practice.\"\n\nOther analysis\n\n\u00b7 The Advisory Board Company: \"The significant incentives to move towards downside-risk models as well as the amount of payment at stake for providers participating in MIPS reminds physicians that the development of care management and quality reporting strategies is no longer optional.\" More.\n\n\u00b7 The National Committee for Quality Assurance: \"We are particularly pleased that the proposed rule supports independent validation that clinicians are providing patient-centered care in Patient-Centered Medical Homes and Patient-Centered Specialty Practices.\" More.\n\nCNN: PRINCE HAD OPIOIDS ON HIM WHEN HE DIED \u2014 Prescription opioid medication was found on the deceased music legend and in his home, a source told CNN. http://cnn.it/1N53hKf\n\nIt's still early in the investigation into Prince's sudden death at age 57, but several reports have now linked the artist's recent health problems with a potential opioid overdose. And if that turns out to be true, that could make Prince the most visible symbol of America's growing opioid crisis.\n\n\u2014 Stars, they're sadly just like us. \"Prince's alleged story [is] like many of my VA patients,\" primary care doctor Jeremy Sussman tweets. \"A pious man [with] work-related pain who was prescribed medicine.\"\n\n\"Why the opioid crisis is so insidious,\" Sussman added, is that it sweeps up people with no addiction history and severe pain who are just \"doing the 'right' thing, initially.\"\n\nMEET THE NEW HEAD OF AHRQ: ANDREW BINDMAN \u2014 Bindman is a primary care physician and health policy researcher at the University of California at San Francisco, and he'll become the new director of AHRQ on May 2.

That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190.
