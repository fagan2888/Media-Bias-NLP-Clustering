Republican Jeb Bush will resign from his board position with a healthcare company that profits from the Affordable Care Act.

Tenet Healthcare said in its filing Wednesday that Bush informed the board that he would step down from the board of directors by the end of the year, according to PBS.

Bush has been a director since 2007. Tenet said Bush did not decide to step down because of disagreements with the company.

Tenet Healthcare has promoted and supported the Affordable Care Act, but Bush has opposed it since its beginnings, CBS News reported.

Bush's ties to different businesses could become a liability for him later on as he considers running for president in 2016.

Last week, a Bush spokesman said Bush will leave his advisory role with the British banking giant Barclays by Dec. 31.

Other business ties Bush could review include Rayonier, Empower Software Solutions and CorMatrix Cardiovascular.

Tenet reported that its third quarter revenue increased $4.18 billion in the previous year. The corporation has attributed 40 percent of that to the Affordable Care Act.

Tenet's CEO, Trevor Fetter, has credited the Affordable Care Act for the growing business, and said he expects every state to embrace the expansion of Medicaid, a core aspect of the Affordable Care Act.
