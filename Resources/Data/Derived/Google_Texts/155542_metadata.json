By 2020, more than 895,000 people could be on the rolls, including 257,000 who will be covered by the expansion. Based on current projections, total general fund dollars needed to cover the state\u2019s Medicaid program by fiscal year 2020 will be $1.1 billion, including $268 million caused by the expansion.\n\nDavid Abbey, director of the state\u2019s Legislative Finance Committee, says other parts of the budget are going to have to shrink to accommodate the rapidly expanding Medicaid spending.\n\nBehind the Eight Ball\n\nPaul J. Gessing, president of the Rio Grande Foundation, a think tank based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, says New Mexico\u2019s budget is always in doubt because it is highly reliant on oil and gas tax revenues and the state\u2019s economy is not very diversified.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been described as a two-legged stool with one leg being the federal government and the other being oil and gas,\u201d Gessing said.\n\n\u201cWe have not recovered like many other states have from the 2008 economic recession,\u201d Gessing said. \u201cAnother thing is New Mexico\u2019s population declined during that period. Population loss is unheard of in a Western state.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s chronically bad economy makes it difficult to imagine how the state can find a way to pay for the huge expenses of the Medicaid expansion, Gessing says.\n\n\u201cBecause of the politics in the state, Republican Gov. Susana Martinez faced a very difficult decision to expand the program,\u201d Gessing said. \u201cI\u2019m sure she felt like she had no choice and she had to do it, but it\u2019s a bit ironic a government program designed to alleviate poverty is going to spread it widely.\u201d\n\nTax Burden Will Grow\n\nMichael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, says New Mexico\u2019s officials should have listened to critics who warned the state\u2019s motto, \u201cIt grows as it goes,\u201d applies to the tax burden Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is imposing on New Mexicans.\n\n\u201cThat tax burden will grow further still, because both Congress and President Obama have proposed to renege on the federal government\u2019s commitment to pay 90 percent of the cost,\u201d Cannon said.\n\nMeanwhile, the expansion creates a huge incentive for officials to protect able-bodied, childless adults at the expense of pregnant women and children, Cannon says.\n\nMedicaid delivers only 40 cents of benefits to enrollees for every dollar spent, and it appears to have little if any impact on enrollees\u2019 health, Cannon says. Under Medicaid expansion, the federal government pays 90 percent of the cost and the state pays 10 percent. New Mexico\u2019s regular Medicaid match is about 70 percent, so the federal government pays two-thirds of the cost, and the state pays one-third.\n\nWith New Mexico facing a budget gap, its officials want to reduce its Medicaid outlays by one dollar. The state can then cut Medicaid services for pregnant women and children by three dollars, which saves the state one dollar while inflicting just three dollars of political pain. Or it can cut services to able-bodied, childless adults by 10 dollars, inflicting $10 of political pain, Cannon says.\n\n\u201cYou can see the incentive this creates,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cStates get much more bang for their buck by cutting services for pregnant women and children.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico needs to opt out of the Medicaid expansion and enact real reforms that bring quality health care within the reach of more low-income residents,\u201d Cannon said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Health Care News.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Under Medicaid expansion, the federal government pays 90 percent of the cost and the state pays 10 percent.\nNew Mexico\u2019s regular Medicaid match is about 70 percent, so the federal government pays two-thirds of the cost, and the state pays one-third.\nWith New Mexico facing a budget gap, its officials want to reduce its Medicaid outlays by one dollar.\nBased on current projections, total general fund dollars needed to cover the state\u2019s Medicaid program by fiscal year 2020 will be $1.1 billion, including $268 million caused by the expansion.\n\u201cNew Mexico needs to opt out of the Medicaid expansion and enact real reforms that bring quality health care within the reach of more low-income residents,\u201d Cannon said."}
