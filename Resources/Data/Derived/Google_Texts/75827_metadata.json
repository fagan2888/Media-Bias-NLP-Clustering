It's national. Human resource folks are now joined by government officials \u2013 up to and including the president \u2013 in the attempt to make open enrollment sound like a positive or fun experience instead of the confusing, expensive pre-holiday purgatory that it is.\n\nThis less-than-magical annual opportunity to choose a new (or stick with your existing) health insurance plan is made even more festive by a backdrop of political news around Obamacare \u2013 including its many shortcomings and Republicans' use of Obamacare as a way to turn out angry, frustrated conservative voters.\n\nObamacare's co-ops are going bankrupt left and right, leaving about three-quarters of a million people unsure of what the heck they need to do this open enrollment season. Meanwhile, Kentucky's governor-elect successfully leveraged the health care law's bad reputation to soar to his state's highest office as an outsider candidate. (Like several top presidential candidates, Kentucky Gov.-elect Matt Bevin has never before served in public office.)\n\nFeeling festive yet? Don't worry! There's more.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nThose shopping for insurance in the individual or small-group market \u2013 especially the self-employed and small-business owners \u2013 have a new treat this time of year, too: notices from their insurance companies that their premiums will be increasing exponentially in 2016. My own Blue Cross Bronze Plan (the cheapest available to me and my husband in the individual market) premiums will go from $734 to $939 a month as of January 1. That's an increase of 28 percent and preserves the, ahem, privilege of the Bronze's $11,000 deductible. Merry Christmas! Blue Cross made sure to tell me that this increase wasn't their fault (or mine) but simply \"reflect(s) the actual costs of providing care to you and all other individuals who have bought coverage under the ACA.\"\n\nTranslation: The individual mandate inspired a lot of expensive, older and/or sick people to join insurance risk pools. Younger and healthier people are staying out and paying the government's tax penalty instead. So the math sucks. And we pay more!\n\nNow, mine is the smallest sort of business \u2013 a sole proprietorship \u2013 so the impact of my premium increase is entirely personal, but this type of added expense has serious economic consequences for small businesses that employ people. A recent poll of small-business owners by the Stop the HIT Coalition found that \"eight in ten small-business owners say increased health insurance costs will force them to make changes to their business, including layoffs or delays in hiring, fewer health insurance offerings, and delay in other business investments.\"\n\n\n\n[READ: Immigration Is the New Obamacare]\n\nAt a time when our economic recovery is still tepid, this is all very bad news. But the thing that worries me most of all this open enrollment season is how much people still don't understand about the law governing health insurance coverage. I met a woman the other day who intended to turn down her employer's health plan because her own share of the cost was higher than she thought it should be. \"I'll just apply for Obamacare,\" she said. While I certainly don't know her personal financial details, the fact that she has a full-time, salaried, white-collar job probably means that she won't qualify for Medicaid or the various subsidies available under Obamacare. I have a feeling she will end up paying huge out-of-pocket premiums that are paired with a terribly high deductible (like my Bronze plan) because she mistakenly thought \"Obamacare\" meant free, cheap or affordable health insurance for all.\n\nOpen enrollment season \u2013 with all of its bad news, cost increases and political point scoring \u2013 needs to also become open-our-minds season. If Obamacare isn't working, what should replace it? Just calling for the repeal of Obamacare is no longer a viable substitute for real ideas. Republicans need to come up with some innovative and achievable policy proposals that maintain some of the goals of the Affordable Care Act that have been widely embraced by the public, such as reducing the uninsured number to as close to zero as possible and protecting people who have pre-existing conditions.\n\nAs with so many other issues, America is desperate for a leader who can really explain \"health care\" to us and empower us to drive health care policy in a direction that really does result in affordability and individual empowerment.\n\nPresidential candidates take note: If you want to lead, you'd do well to brush up on your human resource skills, because open enrollment isn't just for human resources anymore.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Thanks to Obamacare, Open Enrollment Season Is Everybody's Problem", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Obamacare makes open enrollment season, already a&nbsp;pre-holiday purgatory, even worse.", "title": "Season's Greetings, From Obamacare", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2015/11/05/thanks-to-obamacare-open-enrollment-season-is-everybodys-problem", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/e7/29/b3a8de694052a733dd9b4970e16d/151023-obamacare-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Obamacare makes open enrollment season, already a&nbsp;pre-holiday purgatory, even worse.", "card": "summary", "title": "Thanks to Obamacare, Open Enrollment Season Is Everybody's Problem"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Nov. 5, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jean Card,health care,health care reform,Affordable Care Act,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion],Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Obamacare makes open enrollment season, already a&nbsp;pre-holiday purgatory, even worse."}, "article_summary": "Open enrollment season \u2013 with all of its bad news, cost increases and political point scoring \u2013 needs to also become open-our-minds season.\nObamacare's co-ops are going bankrupt left and right, leaving about three-quarters of a million people unsure of what the heck they need to do this open enrollment season.\nBut in today's Obamacare world, open enrollment is much bigger \u2026 but not better.\nBut the thing that worries me most of all this open enrollment season is how much people still don't understand about the law governing health insurance coverage.\nMeanwhile, Kentucky's governor-elect successfully leveraged the health care law's bad reputation to soar to his state's highest office as an outsider candidate."}
