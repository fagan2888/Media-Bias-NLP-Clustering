Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenAn all-female ticket? Not in 2016 Trump sticks by 'Pocahontas' nickname after being challenged Trump: Warren \u2018as Native American as I am\u2019 MORE (D-Mass.) is warning against lifting the U.S. ban on exporting crude oil.\n\nWarren said doing so without first considering the environmental consequences would be a \"dangerous\" move at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the issue Tuesday.\n\nShe said lifting the ban would increase worldwide carbon emissions by almost 22 million metric tons per year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd the senator expressed skepticism of studies she said were funded by big oil companies to push the proposal.\n\n\"Big oil may not like that, but the Massachusetts voters didn\u2019t send me here to work for them,\" she said.\n\nWarren's comments come as lawmakers consider bipartisan legislation introduced in May by Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) to lift the 40-year old export ban in place since 1975.\n\nThe bill is co-sponsored by nine other senators, and Murkowski, the chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has said her panel will vote on exports before the August recess.\n\nThe Energy committee is also weighing a broader energy reform bill that does not include measures on oil exports, but the bills could be combined.\n\nThere is also movement on lifting the ban in the House.\n\nRep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) is backing similar legislation, and earlier in July, House Agriculture Committee Chairman Michael Conaway (R-Texas) said he finds no \"downside\" to lifting the ban.\n\nWhile lifting the ban has supporters on both sides of the aisle, many Democrats are balking at the proposal.\n\nSen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) also expressed concerns at the hearing on lifting the ban. He said U.S. gas prices would increase by 18 cents per gallon as a result.\n\nBenjamin Zycher, a scholar at the non-partisan American Enterprise Institute, countered worries about rising gas prices.\n\n\"Exports of U.S. crude will increase the supply of crude, therefore reducing the price internationally,\" he said. \"Low prices internationally will lower U.S. prices.\"\n\nRick Muncrief, president and CEO of oil and gas producer WPX Energy, also said more oil would decrease market volatility.\n\n\"This is the first time that the oil industry is lobbying for something that would lower their prices,\" Menendez said.\n\n\"Sensibility does not seem to extend to our crude oil export policy.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Warren said lifting the ban would increase carbon emissions by almost 22M metric tons a year.", "description": "Warren said lifting the ban would increase carbon emissions by almost 22M metric tons a year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lauren Aguirre", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Warren said lifting the ban would increase carbon emissions by almost 22M metric tons a year.", "title": "Warren: Lifting oil export ban 'dangerous' for environment", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/249499-warren-lifting-oil-export-ban-dangerous-for-environment", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/elizabethwarren_051215getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-28T15:50:00-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-28T15:50-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/249499-warren-lifting-oil-export-ban-dangerous-for-environment", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-28T15:50-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Meghashyam Mali", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "oil export ban,Elizabeth Warren,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-28T15:50:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-28T15:50:00-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/249499-warren-lifting-oil-export-ban-dangerous-for-environment", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Warren said lifting the ban would increase carbon emissions by almost 22M metric tons a year.", "card": "summary", "title": "Warren: Lifting oil export ban 'dangerous' for environment"}, "dcterms.title": "Warren: Lifting oil export ban 'dangerous' for environment"}, "article_summary": "is warning against lifting the U.S. ban on exporting crude oil.\n\"Sensibility does not seem to extend to our crude oil export policy.\"\nRick Muncrief, president and CEO of oil and gas producer WPX Energy, also said more oil would decrease market volatility.\nShe said lifting the ban would increase worldwide carbon emissions by almost 22 million metric tons per year.\nBenjamin Zycher, a scholar at the non-partisan American Enterprise Institute, countered worries about rising gas prices."}
