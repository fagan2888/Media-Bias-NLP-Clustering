The legislature scheduled the program to sunset in 2016, the last year the Affordable Care Act (ACA) binds the federal government to pay 100 percent of Medicaid expansion costs for newly eligible enrollees.\n\nHouse Bill 1696, which was passed March 9, would extend the program for two years. The federal share of Medicaid expansion costs will drop to 94 percent in 2018, on its way to 90 percent in 2020. The bill would require recipients to perform 30 hours per week of work-related activity.\n\nProponents claim the $25.2 million state share of covering 47,500 eligible individuals in 2018 would be paid for by a premium tax on insurance companies and voluntary contributions from insurers and hospitals.\n\nHandshake Agreement\n\nState Rep. Allen Cook (R-Rockingham County) says the claim taxpayers will not have to foot the bill is ridiculous.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to pay for it,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThe truth is there is nowhere in writing from one single hospital or one single insurance company that they\u2019ll pay for it. We were told it was a handshake. It\u2019s symbolically an agreement, a handshake done behind closed doors. That\u2019s the terminology we were told, but nothing is in writing.\u201d\n\nCook says the state share of Medicaid expansion, which the bill\u2019s fiscal note estimates as $47.2 million in 2020, puts the notable tax advantage New Hampshire\u2019s citizens now enjoy at risk.\n\n\u201cThis will ultimately be the first taxation that we have in New Hampshire,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe pride ourselves on being tax-free, except for land tax, but there\u2019s going to be taxes to pay for this. The hospitals say they are going to help. The insurance companies say they are going to help. Where are they going to get the money? They\u2019re going to up your premiums and your expenses.\u201d\n\nWork Requirements \u2026 Won\u2019t\n\nGreg Moore, New Hampshire state director of Americans for Prosperity, says the bill\u2019s weak work requirements leave taxpayers vulnerable to exploitation.\n\n\u201cThey keep on saying that there is a work requirement,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWith the severability clause that\u2019s in the bill, all it takes is anyone at the court level or federal level\u2014anyone who files a lawsuit\u2014to basically block the work requirement. By keeping that severability clause, New Hampshire does not have a real work requirement.\u201d\n\nMoore says in a state with an unemployment rate of 3.8 percent and \u201c\u2018help wanted\u2019 signs jumping out at you,\u201d it doesn\u2019t make sense to provide \u201ca new welfare benefit to people, 57 percent of whom are unemployed.\u201d\n\nIn addition to reducing incentives to work, Medicaid expansion lowers incentives to make sound personal health care decisions, Moore says.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of these folks on Medicaid over-utilize emergency care because there\u2019s no disincentive for them not to,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIf you\u2019re on Medicaid, there are no copays and deductibles, and if there are, there are no consequences if you don\u2019t pay them. There isn\u2019t a deductible or copay, in reality.\u201d\n\nHB 1696 requires newly eligible adults to make $8 copayments for their first emergency room visit for non-emergency purposes and $25 for subsequent non-emergency visits. The state\u2019s Senate is expected to pass the bill this session, which ends June 30.\n\nKimberly Morin (kimberlyamorin@gmail.com) writes from Brentwood, New Hampshire.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nMichael Hamilton, \u201cPost-Op Policy Debrief: \u2018Nontraditional\u2019 Medicaid Expansion,\u201d Health Care News, The Heartland Institute, March 1, 2016: http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2016/03/01/post-op-policy-debrief-nontraditional-medicaid-expansion\n\nImage via Thinkstock\n\nThis story was updated March 14, 2016.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "The federal share of Medicaid expansion costs will drop to 94 percent in 2018, on its way to 90 percent in 2020.\nInternet Info:Michael Hamilton, \u201cPost-Op Policy Debrief: \u2018Nontraditional\u2019 Medicaid Expansion,\u201d Health Care News, The Heartland Institute, March 1, 2016: http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2016/03/01/post-op-policy-debrief-nontraditional-medicaid-expansionImage via ThinkstockThis story was updated March 14, 2016.\nThe Republican-controlled New Hampshire House of Representatives voted 216\u2013145 to extend the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid program through 2018, provided the federal government pays its share of the expansion costs.\nThe legislature scheduled the program to sunset in 2016, the last year the Affordable Care Act (ACA) binds the federal government to pay 100 percent of Medicaid expansion costs for newly eligible enrollees.\nNew Hampshire lawmakers first expanded Medicaid in 2014, but they did not write their decision in stone."}
