Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has cut into or completely erased her once astronomical lead in national and early primary state surveys, Clinton\u2019s campaign is making \u201cnew efforts to bring spontaneity to a candidacy that sometimes seems wooden and overly cautious,\u201d The New York Times reported last week.\n\nHer appearance with Jimmy Fallon may have checked all the boxes for the presumed Democratic frontrunner, but it won\u2019t convince anyone that her campaign is done being overly cautious.\n\nRelated: Sanders Pulls Ahead in Iowa, but a Tougher Clinton Aims to Even the Score\n\nIt began with a skit in which host Jimmy Fallon donned a wig and makeup to imitate GOP frontrunner Donald Trump and called Clinton to discuss women, immigration and Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cI haven't seen you since my last wedding,\u201d Fallon joked.\n\n\"Well, I'm sure I'll see you at the next one,\u201d Clinton replied. She reached for a glass of white wine mid-skit as the fake prep talk dragged on.\n\nClinton eventually moved to the show\u2019s couch, where she and Fallon reminisced about parenting advice the former secretary of state had given him.\n\nClinton also addressed the months-long scandal over her use of a private email server while acting as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. She acknowledged fault for the unique arrangement, but attributed the controversy over whether she sent classified information via the system to in-fighting among government agencies.\n\nRelated: Trump Walks Into an Ambush in Second GOP Presidential Debate\n\n\u201cThe most significant one that has come to light \u2014 this was a really important issue and I had to talk about it on the email \u2014 was I was asked if I could get gefilte fish into Israel \u2026 to be used in time for Passover,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe stuff that\u2019s in it is really boring people, which kind of hurts my feelings,\u201d Clinton added.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s unclear if the interview will win Clinton any new supporters. The appearance wasn\u2019t a gamble for her, given the receptive audience.\n\nThe light-hearted conversation, which has been drowned out by coverage of the second GOP presidential debate of the season, couldn\u2019t have been more different than the one Vice President Joe Biden had last week on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d\n\nRelated: Joe Biden Just Gave the Most Optimistic Speech of the 2016 Campaign\n\nBiden won tremendous praise for speaking openly and movingly about the impact the recent death of his son Beau has had on him and family and how he isn\u2019t sure he\u2019s emotionally ready to run for the White House.\n\nClinton\u2019s stop on the late night talk show circuit also stood in stark contrast to the speech Sanders delivered earlier this week at Liberty University, a hotbed for conservative activism.\n\nThe Vermont lawmaker, a self-described democratic socialist, stood by his left-leaning positions and urged any hardliners to keep their minds open to finding common ground with liberals on moral issues such as poverty.\n\nA recent CNN/ORC poll shows that Sanders has cut Clinton\u2019s national lead to 10 percentage points, and he\u2019s topped Clinton in a handful of Iowa and New Hampshire polls.\n\nClinton jokingly addressed the tightening race during her sketch with fake Trump.\n\n\u201cDo you have any idea what it's like to work so hard for something, to be so close to getting it, then someone pops out of nowhere and tries to take it all away?\" she asked.\n\n\u201cAre you talking about Bernie Sanders? I hate to say this but I think he\u2019s losing his hair,\u201d Fallon as Trump replied.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Unwilling to cede all of Wednesday night to Republican presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton took her charm offensive to the friendly confines of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in a bid to revive her standings in the polls.", "title": "Spontaneous or Scripted?
