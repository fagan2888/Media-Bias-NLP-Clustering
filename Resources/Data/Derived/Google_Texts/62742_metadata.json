The Redskins have been at the center of an intense debate for years, but in May, 10 members of Congress sent a letter to team owner Dan Snyder and National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell requesting the name be changed because it is offensive to Native Americans. And President Obama agrees.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real legitimate concerns that people have about these things,\u201d the President told The AP.\n\nHe continued, saying he would \u201cthink about changing\u201d the team name because it offends a \u201csizable group of people.\u201d\n\nThe President has long praised himself as an avid sports fan, welcoming championship-winning teams into the White House and broadcasting his penchant for basketball often, especially during March Madness.\n\nObama did cut Redskins\u2019 fans some slack, though, saying he didn\u2019t think they were purposely trying to offend Native Americans.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to detract from the wonderful Redskins fans that are here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey love their team and rightfully so.\u201d\n\nBut, he did note that Native Americans \u201cfeel pretty strongly\u201d about both mascots and team names.\n\nIn addition to Congress attempting to sway Snyder and Goodell to change the Redskins\u2019 name, several members of the media have protested it, saying they will no longer use the term \u201cRedskins\u201d in stories about the Washington, D.C.,-based team.\n\nSnyder, though, said he would never abandon the name. However, Goodell did say the league should pay more attention to those offended.\n\nAccording to NBC, Lanny Davis, an attorney and spokesman for the Redskins responded to the President\u2019s suggestion.\n\n\u201cAs a supporter of President Obama I am sure that [Goodell] is not aware that in the highly respected Annenberg Institute poll (2004) with a national sample of Native Americans, 9 out of 10 Native Americans said they were not offended by the name the \u2018Washington Redskins,'\u201d Davis told NBC.\n\n\u201cWe at the Redskins respect the feelings of Native Americans and others who might be offended. But like devoted fans of the Atlanta Braves, the Cleveland Indians and the Chicago Blackhawks (from President Obama\u2019s hometown), we love our team and like those fans do not intend to disparage or disrespect a racial or ethnic group. It\u2019s an 81 year history and tradition and we sing \u2018hail to the Redskins\u2019 every Sunday as a word of honor not disparagement.\u201d\n\nBut the Redskins aren\u2019t the only professional sports team with references to Native Americans, including the Kansas City Chiefs, Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians. President Obama did not comment on any of these names, and failed to propose a potential name change for his hometown hockey team, the Chicago Blackhawks, as well, though little controversy surrounds it.\n\nThis piece has been updated to include new information.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "In addition to the debate surrounding the debt ceiling, government shutdown and continuing resolution to fund the government, President Barack Obama waded into yet another divisive debate Friday, saying the Washington Redskins should consider changing its name.", "title": "President Obama: Redskins should consider changing name - Red...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 533, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/03/Washington-Redskins-533x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/10/05/obama-redskins-should-consider-changing-name/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "washington-redskins-fans", "published_time": "2013-10-05T12:31:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-05T14:13:44+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce81c\"", "article_summary": "President Obama spoke with The Associated Press discussing a wide range of issues from Iran and Obamacare to the Washington Redskins.\nObama did cut Redskins\u2019 fans some slack, though, saying he didn\u2019t think they were purposely trying to offend Native Americans.\nIn addition to the debate surrounding the debt ceiling, government shutdown and continuing resolution to fund the government, President Barack Obama waded into yet another divisive debate Friday, saying the Washington Redskins should consider changing its name.\nAnd President Obama agrees.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to detract from the wonderful Redskins fans that are here,\u201d he said."}
