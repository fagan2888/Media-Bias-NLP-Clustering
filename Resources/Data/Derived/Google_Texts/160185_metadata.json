Wow, I thought, maybe there\u2019s hope! Maybe this next generation has the entrepreneurial fire in the belly!\n\nHow very optimistic of me. And how very wrong.\n\nAs it turns out, the piece was written by a millennial who shares feelings of envy and inadequacy with other millennials when they realize they aren\u2019t running some cool tech startup. No, they are just working in some typical job. Sigh. Earning a living. What a bummer.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nTurns out, this generation \u2013 who claims to be \u201cvery entrepreneurial\u201d (I\u2019ve heard many, many of them say it, and the Internet is chock full of this assertion, if short on data, so it must be true!) suffers from something called the \u201centrepreneurial effect\u201d \u2013 where one gets terribly caught up in the idea of running their own business, sometimes to the point of neglecting the job they actually have.\n\nThe data in the New York Post piece are interesting. The writer proudly proclaims that the entrepreneurial \u201cgrass is particularly green\u201d among her generation \u2013 with 29 percent of entrepreneurs coming from the 20-34 year-old cohort!\n\nWow, right?\n\nOh, wait, that means that 71 percent of risk-taking, economy-building, community-leading, inspiring entrepreneurs are not of that generation.\n\nIn fact, according to the Kauffman Foundation (which has a relatively optimistic view on entrepreneurship that is actually backed up by research):\n\n\n\n\n\nMost empirical studies find a peak age for business creation: entrepreneurs tend to be individuals in their thirties and forties. The general consensus of research findings is that \u201centrepreneurship is concentrated among individuals in mid\u00adcareer, i.e. between thirty-five and forty-four years of age.\u201d This differs from the conventional belief that entrepreneurship is mostly the province of the very young, who are presumably unfettered, willing to take risks, have low discount rates, and are undeterred from challenging established ways of doing things.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Millennials Dream of Entrepreneurship Without the Work", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Entrepreneurship is easy to dream about, but very hard to do", "title": "Millennials Need a Reality Check", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2014/05/15/millennials-dream-of-entrepreneurship-without-the-work", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/35/abd93aa08ff6a60f268f0330c5f80d/48651WideModern_Entrepreneur_101813.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Millennials Dream of Entrepreneurship Without the Work", "description": "Entrepreneurship is easy to dream about, but very hard to do", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "May 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jean Card,Generation X,entrepreneurship,business,picks,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Entrepreneurship is easy to dream about, but very hard to do"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f09\"", "article_summary": "The data in the New York Post piece are interesting.\nThe general consensus of research findings is that \u201centrepreneurship is concentrated among individuals in mid\u00adcareer, i.e.\nAs it turns out, the piece was written by a millennial who shares feelings of envy and inadequacy with other millennials when they realize they aren\u2019t running some cool tech startup.\nOh, wait, that means that 71 percent of risk-taking, economy-building, community-leading, inspiring entrepreneurs are not of that generation.\nHaving just written on this page last week about the alarming drop in entrepreneurship in the U.S., you can imagine my interest was piqued when I came across a New York Post article about the phenomenon of (and jealousy about) entrepreneurship in the millennial generation."}
