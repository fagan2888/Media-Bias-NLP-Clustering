Now, it seems, she has gone full-on \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d and wants to resurrect her career by revisiting the specter of Christmas \u201cChrissy\u201d Snow in the sitcom world of \u201cThree\u2019s Company.\u201d Not only that, but she wants the son of her deceased co-star, John Ritter, to play her son on the show.\n\nVia E! Online:\n\n\u201cI said to my husband the other day, \u2018You know what would make a great sitcom? If Chrissy Snow\u2019s son was Jason Ritter!\u2019 It would mean that ultimately, Jack [John Ritter\u2019s character] and Chrissy got married and they had Jason. It is the first acting idea I\u2019ve had that has made my heart flutter.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, no. That totally didn\u2019t happen, Suzanne. Chrissy left in Season 5 because you, Suzanne Somers, were apparently demanding way more money than everyone else\u2013 after which she was replaced by her cousin Cindy, and then by another blonde chick. Then, in the spinoff of \u201cThree\u2019s Company,\u201d \u201cThree\u2019s a Crowd,\u201d Jack moved in romantically with some lady named Vicky Bradford. So there\u2019s that.\n\nEven if you just want to ignore sacred \u201cThree\u2019s Company\u201d canon, it doesn\u2019t seem like Jason Ritter is too hot on the idea.\n\nAlso via E! Online:\n\n\u201cI did just hear that,\u201d Jason told us last night at the TV Guide Hot List party in Hollywood. \u201cIt\u2019s so wild. It\u2019s very sweet.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he thinks it\u2019s something that will ever happen with him, he dished, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d \u201cTo be honest, there are probably actors who are much better,\u201d the humble 33-year-old actor said. \u201cIt sounds weird, it sounds like I\u2019m not telling the truth, but I think there would be actors better suited to do that, who are funnier and better. I would feel like I was just getting the part for a stupid reason.\u201d \u201cMaybe a new person,\u201d he added. \u201cDiscover someone incredible.\u201d\u2018\n\nHe\u2019s very polite. In fact, I am probably going to use these lines the next time some weird dude asks me out and I feel badly about saying no.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of rude, in my opinion, that she did not include Miss Joyce Dewitt in her brilliant fever dream revitalization of \u201cThree\u2019s Company.\u201d After all, at least she was on the show through the whole run\u2013 not to mention that everyone sitting within five feet of me right now is Team Janet all the way.
