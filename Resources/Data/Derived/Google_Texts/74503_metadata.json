Just when it looks like you\u2019re the solution to every health problem, some doctors come along and burst your bubble. Now it\u2019s happening to vitamin D.\n\nThe supplement has been widely promoted to prevent osteoporosis and fight a host of other ills. But recent studies haven\u2019t found much benefit, for bones or for general health.\n\nThis latest review looks at 23 randomized controlled trials involving more than 4,000 people to study vitamin D\u2019s effect on bones. Vitamin D, which is converted into a hormone by the body, makes it easier for us absorb calcium in the intestines. So it\u2019s easy to presume that more \u201cD\u201d would lead to stronger bones.\n\nBut this review found that for middle-aged people, taking vitamin D supplements for two years didn\u2019t affect bone mineral density in the spine, hip, arm bone and skeleton overall. They did find increased bone density in the neck of the femur bone, where it often breaks in the elderly. The review also found no relation between bone density and taking calcium supplements, people\u2019s overall vitamin D levels, length of treatment or age.\n\nThe conclusion? \u201cContinuing widespread use of vitamin D for osteoporosis prevention in community-dwelling adults without specific risk factors for vitamin D deficiency seems to be inappropriate,\u201d the researchers wrote. The review was published online in The Lancet.\n\nIt could be that bone mineral density in middle-aged women is a poor predictor of who will eventually have osteoporosis, according to an accompanying commentary by Dr. Clifford Rosen, an osteoporosis researcher at the Maine Medical Institute. But two other recent analyses also found that vitamin D didn\u2019t help prevent fractures.\n\nOr it could be that vitamin D and calcium need to be taken together, and that they help only when a person is really low on either or both.\n\nRecent research on vitamin D\u2019s role suggests that as long as there\u2019s enough calcium circulating in the body, adding D doesn\u2019t send more calcium to the bones. It\u2019s only when someone\u2019s lacking circulating calcium, from food or supplements, that the body steals it from the bones.\n\nThat finding, Rosen writes, suggests that supplementing both vitamin D and calcium could help prevent hip fractures in the elderly, but probably doesn\u2019t build up bones in healthy middle-aged people.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much the tack taken by the Institute of Medicine. In 2010, the independent body, which sets federal guidelines for dietary intake, determined that children and adults need 600 international units of vitamin D daily. People over age 70 need 800 IU, the institute recommended.\n\nThe body makes its own vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight. Some foods \u2014 notably fatty fish \u2014 contain vitamin D, and others like milk, are routinely fortified with D.\n\nBut advocates of high-dose vitamin D say that taking high doses of supplemental D \u2014 1,000 to 4,000 IU a day \u2014 can prevent cancer, heart disease and other chronic diseases. The Institute of Medicine said there\u2019s no evidence that\u2019s true.\n\nThe panel also found no evidence of widespread vitamin D deficiency in Americans.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group that advises the government on evidence-based medical treatments, is looking into the broader health effects of vitamin D supplements, so stay tuned.\n\nEarlier this year, the task force said that there\u2019s no evidence that taking calcium supplements and up to 400 IU of vitamin D daily protect bones in healthy people. That recommendation didn\u2019t apply to people who already have osteoporosis or people over 65 who are at risk of falls.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But this review found that for middle-aged people, taking vitamin D supplements for two years didn't affect bone mineral density in the spine, hip, arm bone and", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\" Vitamin D Not So Great for Building Bones in Middle Aged Adults After All \",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2013\\/10\\/14\\/vitamin-d-not-so-great-for-building-bones-after-all-osteoporosis-supplements\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-14 09:29:17\",\"mod_date\":\"2013-10-16 11:24:30\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":15657,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/10\\/152162758-e1381760302826.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "But this review found that for middle-aged people, taking vitamin D supplements for two years didn't affect bone mineral density in the spine, hip, arm bone and skeleton overall.
