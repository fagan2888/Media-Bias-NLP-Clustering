Jordan Smith said she and her colleagues prayed over our meal, and the waitress came over at the end of the meal and said, \u201cJust so you know, we gave you a 15 percent discount for praying.\u201d\n\nA Facebook image of a receipt with the prayer discount posted by a Florida radio station has received over 8,300 likes.\n\nThe restaurant owner, Mary Haglund, told Fox News that the discount was given to those who took the time to appreciate their food.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the whole idea of gratitude,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a religious thing; it\u2019s a spiritual thing.\u201d\n\nMs. Haglund, 60, the daughter of a preacher and a missionary, said that any person who comes to the diner and is seen \u201chaving a moment\u201d can get the discount.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of craziness going on in regard to the 15% discount,\u201d Ms. Haglund posted on the restaurant\u2019s Facebook page on Friday. \u201cI will say that it is not a \u2018policy.\u2019 It\u2019s a gift we give at random to customers who take a moment before their meal. I have lived in a Third World country [where] people are starving. We live in a country with an abundance of beautiful food. I NEVER take that for granted. It warms my heart to see people with an attitude of gratitude.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A North Carolina restaurant is offering a 15 percent discount to customers who publicly give thanks for their meal with prayer.", "Author": "Kellan Howell", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A North Carolina restaurant is offering a 15 percent discount to customers who publicly give thanks for their meal with prayer.", "title": "North Carolina restaurant surprises customers who give prayer of thanks with 15% discount", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/2/north-carolina-restaurant-surprises-customers-who-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/02/prayer-ap.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/02/prayer-ap.jpg", "title": "North Carolina restaurant surprises customers who give prayer of thank", "description": "A North Carolina restaurant is offering a 15 percent discount to customers who publicly give thanks for their meal with prayer.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0347\"", "article_summary": "A North Carolina restaurant is offering a 15 percent discount to customers who publicly give thanks for their meal with prayer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of craziness going on in regard to the 15% discount,\u201d Ms. Haglund posted on the restaurant\u2019s Facebook page on Friday.\nThe restaurant owner, Mary Haglund, told Fox News that the discount was given to those who took the time to appreciate their food.\nOne customer told the news agency that she visited the restaurant during a business trip.\nMary\u2019s Gourmet Diner in Winston-Salem has been offering the discount for four years, but a recent Facebook post showing a receipt with the discount has gone viral, drawing special attention to the restaurant, Fox News reported Friday."}
