Cheryl Footit, of Wallingford, went to the Access Health Connecticut store in New Haven to figure out what the best insurance plan would be for her and her daughter.

She said she attended informational meetings and logged onto the website, but still had questions about the different plans.

“They don't really bring up doctors that I use. And another thing is, my daughter is in college out of state, so I wanted to come down and speak with someone face-to-face,” said Footit.

Tom Hudson from Hamden came to sign up, as well.

“I got the letter that my insurance is being discontinued, so I went ahead, I need to do something, so I came down here,” said Hudson.

Access Health Connecticut says in the past three days it's signed up more people than it has in the past few weeks, and it expects the surge of enrollments to continue till the new December 23 deadline. Right now, there are more than 35,000 people signed up of the more than 300,000 uninsured in the state.

“I really think that we're going to make good progress this year,” said Kevin Counihan, who is the CEO of Access Health CT.

Even more progress will be made with a brand new store in New Haven. On Friday, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro and State Senator Chris Murphy attended the grand opening and touted the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. However, the problems with signing up on the federal level has had an effect on the people signing up in Connecticut.

“We get confused phone calls every day. Gee, I understand your site just reopened, or are all the bugs worked out? Connecticut has been the only state whose state-exchange site has never been down,” said Counihan.

Connecticut, unlike many other states, has not had problems with signing people up. Access Health CT hopes to continue that for the rest of the year and beyond.
