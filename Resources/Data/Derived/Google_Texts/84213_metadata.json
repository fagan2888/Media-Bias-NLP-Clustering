It is not known who did this to the five cartel members.\n\nGiven the constant state of insecurity in Mexico, vigilante justice is becoming increasingly common. The Nuevo Juarez Cartel is known to take credit for their crimes, and one of the men had a sign with the gang\u2019s name on it.\n\nAuthorities are considering the possibility that fellow gang members handed in the five men as punishment for carrying out an unsanctioned hit job. Authorities have been searching for the cab driver\u2019s killers since Dec. 7, when he was killed.\n\nAnother theory being pursued by the authorities is that a rival cartel handed over the 5 gangsters to be arrested. El Chapo\u2019s outfit, the Sinaloa Cartel, is one of the largest rivals of the New Juarez Cartel.\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration recently reported the Nuevo Juarez Cartel makes at least $200 million per week. This cartel is one of many involved in the multibillion dollar drug trafficking business.\n\nFollow JP on Twitter\n\nClick here for reuse options!
