Now a new report from the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general shows that DEA agents have been participating in similar events since at least 2001.\n\nRelated: Sex Parties and Drug Cartels: Federal Agents Busted Again\n\nIn one instance, funding for a DEA official\u2019s farewell party in 2013 \u2013 in which prostitutes were present \u2013 was included in the agency\u2019s budget. Also, no agents involved in the sex parties (while on assignment) have been fired.\n\nDuring a House Oversight Committee hearing Tuesday, DEA administrator Michele Leonhart told lawmakers her agency has taken steps to prevent such things from occurring in the future. Some of the steps apparently include adding new slides to an agency PowerPoint presentation that describe why it\u2019s not permissible to hire prostitutes while working abroad.\n\nThe allegations were a result of an IG probe into claims of sexual harassment at the agency. The IG also said that the DEA had interfered and blocked its investigation, delaying the probe\u2019s results.\n\n\u201cIn many of these cases, recommended punishments were reduced without explanation,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe internal report does not discuss punishments for DEA supervisors who may have known about these allegations and failed to report them.\u201d\n\nThe IG said 10 agents were ultimately reprimanded. Their punishments ranged from a warning to a two-week suspension.\n\nLawmakers, however, expressed extreme dissatisfaction with how the agency dealt with those agents and said they should face more consequences. \u201cThese agents compromised our national security and then essentially got a vacation,\u201d Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz said during the hearing. \u201cThere is no accountability and that is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Federal watchdogs released a scandalous report last month accusing 10 officers from th", "title": "Prostitute Partying by DEA Goes Way Back", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/14/Prostitute-Partying-DEA-Goes-Way-Back", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03142014_Prostitute_Sex_Worker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/14/Prostitute-Partying-DEA-Goes-Way-Back", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03142014_Prostitute_Sex_Worker.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Federal watchdogs released a scandalous report last month accusing 10 officers from th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Now a new report from the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general shows that DEA agents have been participating in similar events since at least 2001.\nAlso, no agents involved in the sex parties (while on assignment) have been fired.\nThe IG also said that the DEA had interfered and blocked its investigation, delaying the probe\u2019s results.\nRelated: Sex Parties and Drug Cartels: Federal Agents Busted AgainIn one instance, funding for a DEA official\u2019s farewell party in 2013 \u2013 in which prostitutes were present \u2013 was included in the agency\u2019s budget.\n\u201cThe internal report does not discuss punishments for DEA supervisors who may have known about these allegations and failed to report them.\u201dThe IG said 10 agents were ultimately reprimanded."}
