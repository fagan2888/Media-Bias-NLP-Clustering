Khorasan, closely linked to al Qaeda, is thought by some American officials to present even more of a threat than ISIS, which is why Pentagon spokesperson Rear Admiral John Kirby said the group was targeted in Syria last night by strikes from the U.S. and several Middle East partners.\n\nKhorasan is not after huge swaths of land in Iraq, Syria or elsewhere in the Middle East. It wants another 9/11.\n\nRelated: New ISIS Audio Urges U.S. Muslims to Kill Americans\n\nThe members of this Syria-based group are from Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan. The group is creating a new sense of urgency among intelligence experts, lawmakers and others because it\u2019s combining \u201cthe threat of Western imports\u201d into this country with the \u201cthreat of advanced bomb-making,\u201d CBS News reports.\n\nThis terror group\u2019s leader is a 33-year-old named Muhsin al-Fadhli, who was \u201cbarely more than a boy [of] 19 when the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred,\u201d though even then he was one of the few top commanders who knew about the terror plot in advance, The Washington Post is reporting. In 2012, the State Department identified him as an al Qaeda leader in Iran, the country he subsequently left for Syria.\n\nJames R. Clapper, Jr., the director of national intelligence, said late last week that \u201cin terms of threat to the homeland, Khorasan may pose as much of a danger as ISIS,\u201d The New York Times reported.\n\nThe group\u2019s \u201crepeated efforts to conceal explosive devices to destroy aircraft demonstrate its continued pursuits of high-profile attacks against the West, its increasing awareness of Western security procedures and its efforts to adapt to those procedures that we adopt,\u201d Nicholas Rasmussen, deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said recently, according to The Independent.\n\nRelated: Obama's ISIS Strategy Will Be His Jimmy Carter Moment\n\nKhorasan is believed to be developing new plots targeting aircraft in this country because they see the aviation industry \u201cas a symbol of the West,\u201d former CIA deputy director Mike Morell said on CBS This Morning recently.\n\n\u201cThe fear is that U.S. and European passport holders could more easily smuggle explosives onto airplanes,\u201d reports CBS News, which adds:\n\nAt two dozen foreign airports, U.S.-bound passengers are undergoing enhanced security screening. Agents are searching for hidden explosives. Laptops and phones with dead batteries have been banned from flights. Great Britain raised its national terror threat level, and the FBI is tracking American jihadists who may return home. Sources say it\u2019s due to the emerging threat in Syria, where hardened terrorists loyal to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri are working on new, hard-to-detect bombs.\n\nFormer president George W. Bush mentioned Fadhli by name during a speech in Brussels in February 2005 when he was thanking European countries for their counterterrorism assistance. Bush said, \u201cJust last week, the United Nations added Muhsin al-Fadhli to its al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions committee list.\"\n\nRelated: 20 Facts About Baghdadi, the Elusive ISIS Leader\n\nHe continued, \"This man is a known al Qaeda operative and Zarqawi associate; provided support to the terrorists who conducted the 2002 bombing of a French oil tanker. Working together, America, France and other nations will bring him to justice. For the sake of the security of our people, for the sake of peace, we will be relentless in chasing down the ideologues of hate.\u201d\n\nThis article was updated at 8:30 a.m.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Never mind ISIS \u2013 there\u2019s yet another terror group to worry about.", "title": "The New Terror Group Khorasan Is Plotting a 9/11 Attack", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/23/New-Terror-Group-Khorasan-Plotting-911-Attack", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05022011_WTC_1_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/23/New-Terror-Group-Khorasan-Plotting-911-Attack", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05022011_WTC_1_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Never mind ISIS \u2013 there\u2019s yet another terror group to worry about.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca27d\"", "article_summary": "Great Britain raised its national terror threat level, and the FBI is tracking American jihadists who may return home.\nNever mind ISIS \u2013 there\u2019s yet another terror group to worry about.\nBush said, \u201cJust last week, the United Nations added Muhsin al-Fadhli to its al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions committee list.\"\nIn 2012, the State Department identified him as an al Qaeda leader in Iran, the country he subsequently left for Syria.\nSources say it\u2019s due to the emerging threat in Syria, where hardened terrorists loyal to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri are working on new, hard-to-detect bombs."}
