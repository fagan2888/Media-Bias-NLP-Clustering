To begin at the beginning, it is instructive to review the U.S. District Court\u2019s 2009 decision on Rule 151A.\n\nAs you recall, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an order vacating Rule 151A under the Securities Act of 1933. The U.S. District Court\u2019s final decision in the 151A lawsuit was predicated on the SEC\u2019s failure to complete its market analysis.\n\nSpecifically, the court ruled that the SEC failed to properly consider the effect of Rule 151A on the efficient, competition and capital formation and remanded the rule to the SEC. In its decision, the court found that the SEC \u201ccannot justify the adoption of a particular rule based solely on the assertion that the existence of a rule provides greater clarity to an area that remained unclear in the absence of any rule.\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nThis is very similar to the DOL\u2019s two main arguments that the Fiduciary Rule was necessary: 1). to give a \u201cmakeover\u201d to a 42-year-old law; and, 2). because consumers were \u201cconfused about which standard applied to them.\u201d\n\nOther than old age, they never adequately proved that annuity consumers were being harmed under the rule nor did they demonstrate any confusion by annuity consumers with reliable studies or research. As Maurice Chevalier famously said, \u201cold age isn't so bad when you consider the alternative.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. District Court in 2009 also found that the analysis failed because the SEC did not make any findings on the existing level of competition in the marketplace under the state law regime. The court further determined that the SEC\u2019s analysis was incomplete because the SEC failed to determine, whether, under the existing regime, sufficient protections existed to enable investors to make informed investment decisions and sellers to make suitable recommendations to investors\n\nLikewise, in creating the Fiduciary Rule, the Department of Labor never analyzed the impact on the fixed annuity marketplace, including the fixed indexed annuity marketplace. Also, by their own admission, in the flawed impact analysis they did conduct, they did only a cursory review of variable annuities (which were noted in a short footnote).\n\nAs a result, they failed in their primary duty to Congress to provide a thorough analysis of both the costs and the benefits the rule will provide in the marketplace(s) it will affect. The department used selective and inconclusive analysis and arrived at their predetermined justification ignoring the multibillion dollar marketplace of IRA annuities.\n\nBut don\u2019t take our word for it. Craig M. Lewis, a finance professor at Vanderbilt\u2019s Owen School of Business and formerly the SEC\u2019s chief economist, explains it best in a Forbes article:\n\nTo drum up support for the proposal, the White House and the DOL have repeatedly claimed that conflicted advice from brokers costs investors $17 billion a year \u2014 despite a number of significant concerns about the reliability of the estimate and the results-oriented process that produced it.\n\nTo reach its estimate, CEA asserts that several academic studies show that assets subject to broker commissions underperform similar products sold directly to investors (that is, without a broker and without a sales load) by approximately 1%.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be an economist [or even a kindergartner] to recognize the Administration\u2019s $17 billion talking point significantly overestimates the costs, if any, to investors relying on the \u201cconflicted advice\u201d of brokers. And you don\u2019t have to be a regulator to recognize that an independent and objective economic analysis should be performed during the public comment process, especially when the regulatory agency making the decision is not a subject matter expert. This is particularly true here given the significant impact that the rulemaking will have on tens of millions of investors.\n\nIn a recent column for InsuranceNewsNet we discussed the court decision on the government\u2019s determination of Met Life\u2019s SIFI status. The reasons the judge ruled in the courts favor were strikingly similar to the department\u2019s actions (or lack of actions like their inadequate and prejudiced impact analysis).\n\nSo the potential for successful litigation is strong. Also, we believe, including the non-security fixed indexed annuity with security products while carving-out their fixed annuity brethren is extremely problematic for the department and a boon to litigation efforts.\n\nLet the litigation begin! AAP supports it and we\u2019re engaged.\n\nKim O\u2019Brien is the vice chairman and CEO of Americans for Annuity Protection . She has 35 years of experience in the insurance industry.
