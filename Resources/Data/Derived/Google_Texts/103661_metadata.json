It\u2019s not too hot outside and the ocean is still pretty usually warm. There\u2019s much less traffic, yet there\u2019s still plenty going on.\n\nHere we share a few tips and a few events to keep on the radar as you enjoy your pumpkin spiced food or beverage of choice and look for things to do.\n\n\u2022Restaurant specials: It\u2019s time for some locals to emerge from hibernation and check out what they\u2019ve missed over the course of the summer at their favorite local restaurants. Many offer specials that can\u2019t be beat in the fall.\n\n\u2022Coast Day: The annual celebration of our maritime culture, hosted by the University of Delaware at its Hugh R. Sharp Campus in Lewes, takes place Sunday, Oct. 4.\n\n\u2022Events for the dogs: October brings a pair of dog-friendly events to coastal Delaware, just days apart from each other. Greyhounds Reach the Beach is set for Oct. 8-11, while the fifth annual Bark on the Boards in Rehoboth Beach is Saturday, Oct. 17.\n\nBuy Photo Randy Donze, left, and Mark Scheper cook up scrapple in the Bridgeville Senior Center tent at a previous Apple-Scrapple Festival.
