Casey Foundation.\n\nThis is the 25th annual Kids Count report, which examines issues facing children across the country. Since 1990, Kentucky has improved in other categories analyzed in the report, such as child health, according to the report.\n\nThe economic issues may be holding the state back in making real strides in child well-being, Brooks said. He said economics have a broad impact on the other areas Kids Count studies\u2014health, education and family/community.\n\n\u201cMy hypothesis is that until and unless we address the issue of poverty, those other indicators such as education are simply not going to move at a sufficient pace,\u201d Brooks told WFPL.\n\nKids Count ranks Kentucky 35th overall in children\u2019s well-being. Kentucky also ranks 35th overall in economic well-being. Among the other Kids Count findings:\n\n35 percent of children have parents who lack secure employment\u2014up from 33 percent in 2008\n\n29 percent of Kentucky children live in households with high housing cost burdens\n\nPolicy changes can make the difference on the children\u2019s well-being rankings, Brooks said, pointing to the only of the four measures to show clear improvement over the past 25 years: health. Six percent Kentucky kids didn\u2019t have health insurance in 2012\u2014that\u2019s half of what it was in the 1990 Kids Count report, according to information from KYA.\n\nBrooks said the state Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, initiated in 1997, is a large part of the improvement. The state\u2019s steps to expand healthcare access under the Affordable Care Act should further those gains in the future, he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful example that smart policies, whether that\u2019s from Washington or Frankfort, can make a difference,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nTo a lesser extent, Brooks said, education is another area of improvement since 1990, which he attributed in part to the 1990 Kentucky Education Reform Act.\n\nThe Kid\u2019s Count rankings for Kentucky (against the other states) in each of the four areas were:\n\n35th in economic well-being\n\n30th in education\n\n28th in health\n\n40th in family and community\n\nBrooks said the economic well-being ranking\u2014which, again, Brooks ties to the other three\u2014could be addressed through some policy changes. As he has in the past, Brooks said a state earned income tax credit would help families who live in poverty. Tax reform has been on the state legislature\u2019s docket in recent years, but has failed so far to move much in the legislative process.\n\nIndiana\u2019s overall ranking was 27th.
