So facilities without RWHAP funding would need to find another way to pay for them, he noted.\n\nFor the new study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, Weiser\u2019s team looked at data from 2009 and 2011 covering a sample of 8,038 HIV-infected adults receiving medical care at 989 outpatient health care facilities across the U.S.\n\nThey found that 34 percent of facilities received RWHAP funding and 72.8 percent of patients were treated at one of these facilities.\n\nPatients getting care at RWHAP-funded facilities were more likely to be young, female and black or Hispanic, to have less than a high school education, be at or below the poverty level and to lack health insurance.\n\nNonetheless, almost 75 percent of patients at RWHAP funded facilities achieved viral suppression, only slightly less than the 79 percent at other facilities.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have an increase in the number of cases, we\u2019re going to have to increase the proportion of people who are virally suppressed,\u201d said commentary author Stephen F. Morin of the University of California, San Francisco, who worked on the authorization of the Ryan White program as part of congresswoman Nancy Pelosi\u2019s staff in the 1980s.\n\nRyan White-funded programs are \u201cstretched to the limit\u201d in states that did not expand Medicaid, like Alabama, Morin told Reuters Health.\n\nMany states are having trouble financing important case management services, he said.\n\nRyan White died in 1990 at age 18, just months before Congress passed the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1N36uXJ and bit.ly/1JNOA5Q JAMA Internal Medicine, online August 31, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKCN0R22DZ20150902", "sailthru.author": "Kathryn Doyle", "Author": "Kathryn Doyle", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "(Reuters Health) -
