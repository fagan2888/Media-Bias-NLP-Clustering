Chris Wallace, off to work every day to Kansas City Fire Department's Station No. 29.\n\n\u201cAs a child, he was always the hero, big guy, big red truck, hose,\u201d Daniel Wallace, 17, said. \u201cBut as we got older and matured more, we could see that there's more risk he has to take than just being a hero.\u201d\n\nAs Daniel Wallace, and his sister, Erin Wallace, 14, have grown older, they\u2019ve seen more and more of their father's fellow firefighters die in the line of duty.\n\n\u201cIt's kind of hard to talk about it at home because it's so close to our hearts, but we make sure we're praying for them every day,\u201d Erin Wallace said.\n\n\u201cIt's more real, the presence of the risk that he could just not come home one day,\u201d Daniel Wallace said.\n\nThe siblings said during their father\u2019s 30-year career, the fire department has become their family.\n\n\u201cI know what they're doing is the right thing, and they're helping people that need it,\u201d Daniel Wallace said.\n\nDaniel and Erin Wallace said they make sure to cherish every second they get with their dad.\n\n\u201cI don't really get to see him until that night, but I always make sure I give him a hug,\u201d Erin Wallace said.\n\n\u201cSome people take it lightly and think if you're a firefighter, you're a macho man, you get all the ladies, all that, but you have to risk your life every day,\u201d Daniel Wallace said. \u201cThese firefighters are making a big sacrifice to do it.\u201d\n\nDaniel and Erin Wallace said their father has inspired them to become public servants as well.
