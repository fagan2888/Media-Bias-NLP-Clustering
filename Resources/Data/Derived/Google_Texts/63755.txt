An Evansville baseball league for children with disabilities gets another financial boost from the community after AT&T steps up to the plate.

The Challenger Baseball League Program had all of its grant funding cut earlier this year after deep cuts were made to the Evansville city budget.

Shortly after that news broke, several area business pitched in to help the area's only league that facilitates children with disabilities.

“It is donations like these that will help us achieve our short term and long term goals and projects,” said Matt Pokorney, league president, Challenger Baseball League. “The future is bright for Challenger Baseball in Evansville and we appreciate the funding and volunteerism from AT&T and its Evansville employees.”

AT&T is one of the largest employers in the Evansville area.

Highland Baseball/Challenger Evansville was also recently awarded a Leadership of Evansville Award for Sportsmanship.
