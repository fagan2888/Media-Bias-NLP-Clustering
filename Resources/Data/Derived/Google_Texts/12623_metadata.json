If we call it imitation, they will not buy our product,\" Mary Lou Wesselhoeft said after the court hearing. \"To me it's degrading and a slap in the face because it's pure, unadulterated skim milk.\"\n\nWebster's dictionary defines skim milk as simply \"milk from which cream has been removed,\" with no mention of added vitamins. But Department lawyer Ashley Davis told a judge consumers expect whole milk and skim milk to have the same nutritional value and that the Wesselhoefts' skim milk is nutritionally inferior because vitamins are removed when the milk fat is removed.\n\n\"Ocheessee's product is imitating \u2014 literally imitating \u2014 skim milk,\" Davis said.\n\nJudge Robert Hinkle said he's not so sure consumers expect skim milk to have the same nutritional value as whole milk.\n\n\"You know something's been removed in order to make it skim milk,\" he said.\n\nHinkle also seemed to have problems with the word imitation.\n\n\"It's hard to call this imitation milk. It came right out of the cow,\" Hinkle said. \"Anyone who reads imitation skim milk would think it didn't come out of a cow.\"\n\nThe creamery needs to remove the milk fat to produce cream and butter, and skim milk is the result. Some people, especially those on low-cholesterol diets, prefer skim milk because it has little fat. When the couple bought the dairy six years ago, the state tested the product for fat content, Paul Wesselhoeft said.\n\n\"They told us we had to call it skim milk,\" he said. Then three years later they ordered them to stop selling the skim milk unless they labeled it imitation.\n\nAnd that's hurt the couple's business plan. The dairy was selling 200 to 300 gallons of skim milk a week at $5 a gallon before the state ordered them to relabel it or stop selling it.\n\nThe Institute for Justice is suing the state on behalf of the couple.\n\n\"The creamery sold its skim milk for three years without anyone being confused or harmed,\" said lawyer Justin Pearson.\n\nBoth sides asked Hinkle to rule on the case before a trial, currently scheduled for November. Hinkle has not decided whether to do so.\n\nDavis and other lawyers representing the state refused to comment after the hearing.\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nThis story has been corrected to include the correct name of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, not the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The Ocheesee Creamery in the Florida Panhandle produces all-natural skim milk from grass-fed cows with absolutely nothing added, yet the state says they", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/fl-creamery-continue-skim-milk-fight", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/milk_glass.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Ocheesee Creamery in the Florida Panhandle produces all-natural skim milk from grass-fed cows with absolutely nothing added, yet the state says they", "title": "FL, Creamery Continue Skim Milk Fight"}, "story_id": 432997676, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Associated Press", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "FL, Creamery Continue Skim Milk Fight"}, "nid": 11690, "datePublished": "2015-08-20", "keywords": "skim milk, Ocheesee Creamery, \"imitation\" milk, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Institute for Justice", "wordCount": 557, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Webster's dictionary defines skim milk as simply \"milk from which cream has been removed,\" with no mention of added vitamins.\nThe creamery needs to remove the milk fat to produce cream and butter, and skim milk is the result.\nBut Department lawyer Ashley Davis told a judge consumers expect whole milk and skim milk to have the same nutritional value and that the Wesselhoefts' skim milk is nutritionally inferior because vitamins are removed when the milk fat is removed.\nAnd while they argue about it, the dairy is dumping hundreds of gallons of skim milk down the drain each week.\n\u2014\u2014-This story has been corrected to include the correct name of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, not the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs."}
