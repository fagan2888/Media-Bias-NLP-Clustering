That measure examines nearly all health spending, while the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, looks only at expenditures for consumers and suggests medical costs are rising at a faster pace.\n\nHe says low inflation could linger because insurers have been basing their reimbursement rates on Medicare. But those Medicare cuts came about due to sequestration measures initiated in April that will soon fall out of year-on-year comparisons. Further, the effect of Medicare payment reductions initiated under Obamacare won\u2019t be as great this year as they have been in the past two years, Phillips says.\n\n\u201cMedical price inflation has been unusually restrained over the last several months, reaching a near-record low 1.1% year-on-year increase in August, and hovering just above that level since. While some of this reflects low inflation in the broader economy and it is possible that some of the slowing could signal an easing of medical price inflation for other reasons, we believe that much of the recent trend is also clearly due to exogenous policy influences,\u201d such as the sequestration impact, Phillips says.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nThe Obamacare tax that few seem to want\n\nNo \u2018death spiral\u2019 for insurers from Obamacare\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Obamacare program close to enrollment goal", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-01-22T11:40:05-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Medicare reimbursement cuts have kept medical inflation to a minimum, says Alec Phillips.
