Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was to be awarded the uncoveted early-Thursday speaking slot at CPAC Thursday morning.\n\nBecause though kicking things off at a three-day event like CPAC means speaking to smaller audiences and fewer cameras, it also means that there are three days of intensifying stagecraft ahead of you to distract attention from whatever errors you might make.\n\nAnd Paul Ryan made a doozy of an error. It attracted plenty of coverage anyhow, but probably would\u2019ve attracted more if it hadn\u2019t happened before all the jousting began. In case you missed it, Ryan recounted a story he heard secondhand about a poor child who felt bad about being on a subsidized school lunch program while other kids brought their lunches to school in brown bags, to serve the argument that parents who can\u2019t afford to bag their children\u2019s lunches for them don\u2019t care about their kids as much as better-off parents do.\n\nThe view he expressed is strange enough. Being an impoverished parent isn\u2019t actually coterminous with being a \u201cpoor\u201d parent, in the normative sense of the word. And even though children on school lunch programs are surely stigmatized by their peers in some communities, the solution is to combat the stigma, not to moot it by just letting those kids go hungry.\n\nBut as you\u2019ve probably heard by now, the story he told never happened. He recapitulated the erroneous testimony of a fellow social spending scold without vetting her story, which she had taken from some pro-social spending literature and tortured beyond recognition.\n\nFor someone like Ryan who often treats politics as a contest of character, that\u2019s a pretty epic blunder. He\u2019s since apologized for not checking his facts, which undoes some of the damage. But that mainly just changes the frame of the story. In addition to making an incredibly questionable moral argument, he also exposed the depths of his most politically problematic ideological fixation. Either he doesn\u2019t care about truth, or his faith in the ubiquity of poverty traps and dependency and so on is so strong that he sees no reason to doubt any corroborative anecdotes, no matter how apocryphal.\n\nThis is a familiar epistemic problem, but I\u2019m bringing it up now because it has metastasized into a national campaign strategy.\n\nIf you\u2019re sure your ideas are correct and confident your solutions are the right ones you\u2019ve already erected a significant barrier to self-examination. And when admitting error carries enormous financial, personal and ideological risk, it feels easier not to check. You\u2019re shocked when your candidate loses, because none of your friends voted for the other guy. And you just pass along stories they tell you about the soul-crushing nature of welfare, or the horrors of the Affordable Care Act, without bothering to apply a smell test.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why does the right keep falling for false stories about poverty and social programs?
