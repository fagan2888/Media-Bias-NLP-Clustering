GREEN BAY, Wis. â€” Aaron Rodgers threw for two touchdowns and the Green Bay Packers outlasted the Seattle Seahawks for a 27-17 win Sunday night in a rematch of last season's NFC title game.

Rodgers orchestrated a 10-play, 80-yard scoring drive, capped by a 5-yard scoring pass to Richard Rodgers. A 2-point conversion made it 24-17 with 9:28 left.

Jayrone Elliott made a lunging, one-handed interception of a short pass from Russell Wilson with 6:50 left, one of the rare mistakes in the second half for Seattle's dual-threat quarterback. The Packers cashed in with one of Mason Crosby's four field goals on the night for a 10-point lead with 2 minutes remaining.

The Packers blew a 16-0 lead against the Seahawks in the playoffs last year. They held on after giving up 13-3 lead at halftime on Sunday.

The Seahawks, who fell to the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl last year, dropped to 0-2 for the first time since 2011.
