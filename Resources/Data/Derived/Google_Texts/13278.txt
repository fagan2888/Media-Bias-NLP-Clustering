BEIJING (AP) — China has created three new military bodies as part of reforms to modernize its military — the world’s largest standing force — and improve its fighting capacity.

State television on Saturday showed President Xi Jinping giving military flags to the leaders of the three new units — a general command for the People’s Liberation Army, a missile force and a strategic support force. At the ceremony, which took place Thursday, Xi and PLA officers and soldiers sang the national anthem.

Xi said the three new units were created as part of a modernization reform and “to realize the Chinese dream of a strong military.”

He has promulgated the idea of a “Chinese dream” involving “the great renewal of the Chinese nation” and sees a strong military as key to this.

The military reform comes as China has become more assertive in pressing its claims to territory in the East China Sea and South China Sea, increasing tensions with its neighbors.

In a bid to show China poses no expansionist threat, Xi announced in September that he would reduce China’s 2.3 million-strong army by 300,000 troops. However, it will still remain the world’s largest.
