The fund plans to update those findings with 2016 numbers later this year.\n\n\u201cThis [report] doesn\u2019t mean that the law is working well for every single person,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBut in general, it seems to be enabling people to get the healthcare that they need.\u201d\n\nMore than eight in 10 people said their ability to get needed care has either improved or stayed the same since they enrolled in coverage through the health law.\n\nThe law allows Americans who don't get health benefits at work to shop among plans on state-based exchanges operated by the federal government or by the states themselves.\n\nConsumers making less than four times the federal poverty level \u2014 about $47,000 for a single adult or $97,000 for a family of four \u2014 qualify for subsidies. Insurers must provide a basic set of benefits and cannot turn away consumers, even if they are sick.\n\nVery low-income Americans in most states can enroll in the government's Medicaid program at virtually no cost, an option provided by the health law that leaders in 31 states and the District of Columbia have elected to make available to their residents.\n\nThe dual coverage expansions have led to the largest drop in the nation\u2019s uninsured rate in at least half a century, surveys show.\n\nThe new Commonwealth Fund survey found that 45% of adults enrolled in a marketplace plan in 2016 and 62% of adults newly covered by Medicaid were previously uninsured.\n\nMore state leaders are now considering Medicaid expansions, including in very conservative states such as Oklahoma.\n\nAnd enrollment in the marketplaces has been increasing, albeit at a slower rate than initially forecast; there are about 12 million people in marketplace plans.\n\nBut the law remains a political hot button, with Republican congressional leaders and presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump promising full repeal.\n\nAt the same time, many insurers are seeking significant premium increases next year, in part because enrollees in marketplace plans are sicker and more expensive than they anticipated.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund survey was conducted between Feb. 2 and April 5 among a random, nationally representative sample of 4,802 adults ages 19 to 64. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nSee the most-read stories this hour >>\n\nALSO\n\nTwo L.A. councilmen want you to vote for $1-billion measure to house the homeless\n\nDid a billionaire Silicon Valley investor fund Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker?\n\nWhy Obama's overtime rule may barely dent the economy\n\nTwitter: @noamlevey", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obamacare is helping millions get needed healthcare, new survey finds", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "More than 60% of working age Americans who are using Medicaid or a health plan purchased through the Affordable Care Act are getting healthcare they couldn\u2019t get before, a new nationwide survey indicates. 20 inches", "title": "Obamacare is helping millions get needed healthcare, new survey finds", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fi-obamacare-satisfaction-20160525-snap-htmlstory.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5745a83b/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-satisfaction-20160525-snap", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obamacare, healthcare, Affordable Care Act, Commonwealth Fund", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-05-24", "Description": "More than 60% of working age Americans who are using Medicaid or a health plan purchased through the Affordable Care Act are getting healthcare they couldn\u2019t get before, a new nationwide survey indicates. 20 inches", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, healthcare, Affordable Care Act, Commonwealth Fund"}, "article_summary": "The Commonwealth Fund survey was conducted between Feb. 2 and April 5 among a random, nationally representative sample of 4,802 adults ages 19 to 64.\nAmericans with employer-provided health plans \u2013 which have lower premiums and deductibles than many marketplace plans \u2013 are the happiest, with 90% reporting satisfaction with their coverage.\nAnd enrollment in the marketplaces has been increasing, albeit at a slower rate than initially forecast; there are about 12 million people in marketplace plans.\nThe fund plans to update those findings with 2016 numbers later this year.\nNearly half of consumers in marketplace plans reported difficulty paying premiums in 2015."}
