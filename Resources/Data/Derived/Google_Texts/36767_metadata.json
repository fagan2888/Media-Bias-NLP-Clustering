Jerry Brown when asked why he thinks a Republican has a shot in the race to succeed outgoing Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer.\n\n\u201cThe issue cuts across all demographics, all political lines,\u201d Del Beccaro said. \u201cAnd I mean you literally had Jerry Brown come out and say to people, you have to give up your front lawn. Which is equivalent to giving up the American dream.\u201d\n\nSpeaking by phone from the road in San Diego, Del Beccaro said: \u201cThe arrogance of, \u2018you have to give up your lifestyle\u2019 versus government having a responsible plan presents an opening that probably has never existed in the last 20 years for Republicans.\u201d\n\nThe Republican also argued that the \u201cunemployment caused by a lack of water hits the Latino community the hardest.\u201d He also spoke of the impending \u201ccollision course between our immigration policies and our water policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough water for the people here,\u201d he said. \u201cYet they expect over the next 20 years or so another 15 to 17 million people will come\u2026You can\u2019t ration your way to 17 million more people.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Kamala is the most high-profile Democrat in the race. Another Republican, Rocky Ch\u00e1vez, is also running.\n\nDel Beccaro is painting Ch\u00e1vez, who said he would vote to repeal Obamacare, as not sufficiently conservative.\n\n\u201cSo obviously, someone who supports Obamacare isn\u2019t going to do well among Republicans and someone who supports the flat tax and a common sense solution to our water problems will,\u201d Del Beccaro said.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "Tom Del Beccaro says he thinks the drought affecting residents in his state will cause voters to turn to the GOP.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Tom Del Beccaro, the former chairman of the California Republican Party running for an open U.S. Senate seat, says he thinks the drought affecting residents in his state will cause voters to turn to t", "title": "California Drought \u2018Presents An Opening\u2019 For Republicans, Senate Candidate Says", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/04/27/california-drought-presents-an-opening-for-republicans-senate-candidate-says/", "image": {"width": 742, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-21T072253Z_1_LYNXMPEB3K08L_RTROPTP_4_USA-CALIFORNIA-DROUGHT-e1430169116432.jpg", "height": 318}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tom Del Beccaro is running for U.S. Senate", "title": "California Drought \u2018Presents An Opening\u2019 For Republicans, Senate Candidate Says Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/04/27/california-drought-presents-an-opening-for-republicans-senate-candidate-says/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-21T072253Z_1_LYNXMPEB3K08L_RTROPTP_4_USA-CALIFORNIA-DROUGHT-e1430169116432.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-27 18:48:58", "sailthru.title": "California Drought \u2018Presents An Opening\u2019 For Republicans, Senate Candidate Says", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "jerry-brown,alex-pappas", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "jerry brown,kamala harris", "sailthru.description": "Tom Del Beccaro, the former chairman of the California Republican Party running for an open U.S. Senate seat, says he thinks the drought affecting residents in his state will cause voters to turn to t", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-21T072253Z_1_LYNXMPEB3K08L_RTROPTP_4_USA-CALIFORNIA-DROUGHT-e1430169116432.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1e7\"", "article_summary": "In an Monday interview with The Daily Caller, Del Beccaro cited the drought and blasted the policies of Democratic Gov.\n\u201cThe issue cuts across all demographics, all political lines,\u201d Del Beccaro said.\nDel Beccaro is painting Ch\u00e1vez, who said he would vote to repeal Obamacare, as not sufficiently conservative.\n4549196Tom Del Beccaro, the former chairman of the California Republican Party running for an open U.S. Senate seat, says he thinks the drought affecting residents in his state will cause voters to turn to the GOP.\n\u201cSo obviously, someone who supports Obamacare isn\u2019t going to do well among Republicans and someone who supports the flat tax and a common sense solution to our water problems will,\u201d Del Beccaro said."}
