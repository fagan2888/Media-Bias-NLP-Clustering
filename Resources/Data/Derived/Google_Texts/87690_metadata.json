The gain is attributed to construction employment being revised by an additional 8,600 jobs in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cThat is the sector that signals the strength of other areas of the economy,\u201d the labor department\u2019s chief economist, Alexandra Hall, said. \u201cAnother remarkable aspect (of construction) being revised by 8,600 is just how harsh of a quarter we had weather-wise.\u201d\n\nThe employer reports, made available through the 2014 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages Program, show fluctuation in the various work sectors.\n\nWhat\u2019s important, Hall said, is whether each sector\n\nis demonstrating solid growth over the year, and most are. The over-the-year payroll jobs growth statewide is being revised to 2.9 percent from 2.7 percent, Hall said.\n\n\u201cAnd when you start looking at average growth rates, like the 12-month moving average, Colorado has been consistently, month-after-month, showing a 3 percent rate of growth,\u201d she said.\n\nThe segments making the biggest gains for the quarter included trade, transportation and utilities, up 3,900 jobs, and financial activities, up 1,600. The segments with the greatest downward revisions were professional and business services, down 5,100 jobs, leisure and hospitality, down 3,900, and government, down 1,500.\n\nIn metro Denver, the jobs roster is expected to be revised up by about 5,900 jobs, compared with increases of 700 in Grand Junction and 200 in Colorado Springs.\n\nIn Greeley, where the fastest job growth has been reported, the total will be revised up by 1,500 jobs, Hall said.\n\nGary Horvath, a private economist in Broomfield, said there may be a dark cloud trailing the otherwise sunny report: too few skilled workers available for openings in key occupations may drive labor costs up.\n\nFor example, oil and gas, construction and food manufacturing are competing for a relatively meager pool of manpower in northeastern Colorado. Along the Front Range, high-tech companies are having to import skilled workers from other states.\n\n\u201cThe industries that are going to win out are going to pay higher wages,\u201d Horvath said.\n\nHoward Pankratz: 303-954-1939, hpankratz@denverpost.com or twitter.com/howardpankratz", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado jobs growth revised up, but pain in the payroll may loom", "title": "Colorado jobs growth revised up, but pain in the payroll may loom", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/27/colorado-jobs-growth-revised-up-but-pain-in-the-payroll-may-loom/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140827__CD09RTDJOBS__2AO2092xp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140827__CD09RTDJOBS__2AO2092xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-27T09:18:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T04:56:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef2b\"", "article_summary": "The over-the-year payroll jobs growth statewide is being revised to 2.9 percent from 2.7 percent, Hall said.\nIn Greeley, where the fastest job growth has been reported, the total will be revised up by 1,500 jobs, Hall said.\nThe gain is attributed to construction employment being revised by an additional 8,600 jobs in the first quarter.\nIn metro Denver, the jobs roster is expected to be revised up by about 5,900 jobs, compared with increases of 700 in Grand Junction and 200 in Colorado Springs.\nBased on employer reports, which include worker head counts, the nonfarm payroll estimate through July will be revised upward to 2,456,200."}
