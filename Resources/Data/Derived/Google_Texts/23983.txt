One person was killed and four others injured late Sunday night when at least one gunman opened fire following an altercation outside a club in upper Manhattan, police said.

The shooting took place around 11:15 p.m. outside a deli at 137th St. and Broadway, near City College. Investigators were hunting for two gunmen, officials said on Monday. Police were reviewing surveillance video footage from the club and area businesses for clues.

A preliminary investigation determined the five people, three men and two women, all in their 20s, had just left 137 Club Restaurant, a law-enforcement official said.

As the group exited the club, Graham Shadale, 28 years old, appeared to turn around and have a discussion with two men inside the club, the official said.

The group then began walking away, stopping in front of a nearby deli and engaging “in some horseplay,” when two men carrying guns approached the five from behind, the official said. At least one of the gunmen opened fire, the official said.

Mr. Shadale was shot once in the head, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 24-year-old man suffered a gun-shot right arm and ankle, police said. He was in stable condition at Harlem Hospital. A 22-year-old male was shot in the torso and leg, police said. He was also listed in stable condition at Harlem Hospital.

Two women, both 21, were each shot once in the shoulder and subsequently transported her to St. Lukes Hospital where they are listed in stable condition.
