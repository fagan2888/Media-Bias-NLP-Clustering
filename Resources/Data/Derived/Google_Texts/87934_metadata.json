In 2016, through the generosity of the Lefkofsky Family Foundation, a team of volunteers led by Dr. Noah Siegel will be traveling to Antigua, Guatemala to provide cleft and microtia (absence of the outer ear) surgeries and dental care to needy children. MMFC is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that sends qualified doctors and surgeons to different locations across the world to treat children and young adults for facial deformities and illnesses.\n\nLiz and Eric Lefkofsky are long-time supporters of MMFC, as their foundation has supplied similar grants to fund missions in previous years. MMFC sends surgeons, dentists, anesthesiologists, nurses and speech therapists to countries with poor access to medical care. The organization travels all over the world and has previously visited areas in China, Ecuador, Guatemala, India, Peru, the Philippines, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Ukraine. The MMFC continues to grow and is continually identifying new sites where impoverished children are in need of its services.\n\nMedical Missions For Children helps approximately 1,000 people every year. Each team supplies its own operating rooms, recovery clinics, and suitable medications to ensure that children receive the highest quality care upon arrival.\n\nAbout Lefkofsky Family Foundation The Lefkofsky Family Foundation is a private charitable foundation that was established in 2006 by Liz and Eric Lefkofsky.
