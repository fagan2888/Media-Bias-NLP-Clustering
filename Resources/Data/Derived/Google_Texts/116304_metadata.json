Today, most across the political spectrum are lauding the African leader, although some on the right are still critical of him.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nMourners celebrate the life of Nelson Mandela in the street outside his old house in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa. Flags were lowered to half-staff and people in black townships, in upscale mostly white suburbs and in South Africa's vast rural grasslands commemorated Mandela with song, tears and prayers while pledging to adhere to the values of unity and democracy that he embodied.\n\nThe world press is filled with encomiums for South African leader Nelson Mandela, laudatory statements by President Obama and other world leaders, editorials praising his courage in fighting against and then leading his country out of racial oppression.\n\n\u201cMy first political action, the first thing I ever did that involved an issue or a policy or politics was a protest against apartheid,\u201d Mr. Obama said when Mr. Mandela died this week. \u201cLike so many around the globe, I cannot fully imagine my own life without the example that Nelson Mandela set.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t that long ago that many elected officials and political leaders in the United States \u2013conservatives, mainly \u2013 were outspoken in their opposition to what Mandela represented, which to them was socialism (or worse yet, communism) and borderline terrorism since Mandela had advocated armed resistance to South Africa\u2019s white minority regime.\n\nRecommended: Remembering Nelson Mandela: How much do you know about his legacy?\n\nWith Soviet influence spreading to parts of Africa, the stability of South Africa had become a Cold War issue related to US national security. In 1981, President Reagan described it as \u201ca country that has stood by us in every war we\u2019ve ever fought, a country that, strategically, is essential to the free world in its production of minerals.\u201d\n\nLater during the Reagan administration, the debate centered on the effort to impose tougher economic sanctions on South Africa because of apartheid. Mr. Reagan argued against sanctions, advocating instead \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d with the white regime.\n\nReagan vetoed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, but Congress \u2013 Republican moderates as well as Democrats \u2013 overrode that veto.\n\nDick Cheney, then a congressman from Wyoming, voted against sanctions. But it was another Republican \u2013 southerner Mitch McConnell of Kentucky \u2013 who saw things in the context of America\u2019s own history of racial oppression and inequality.\n\n\"In the 1960s, when I was in college, civil rights issues were clear,\" Sen. McConnell said in explaining his vote to override Reagan\u2019s veto. \"After that, it became complicated with questions of quotas and other matters that split people of good will. When the apartheid issues came along, it made civil rights black and white again. It was not complicated.\"\n\nWithin a few years, apartheid officially ended in South Africa, and Nelson Mandela walked away from the prison that had held him for 27 years to become the country\u2019s first freely-elected president.\n\nIn retrospect, writes Peter Beinert on thedailybeast.com, it\u2019s important not to \u201csanitize\u201d Mandela\u2019s history. \u201cMandela\u2019s leftist ties did sometimes blind him to communism\u2019s crimes,\u201d Beinert writes.\n\nAt the same time, he could be unsparing in his criticism of the United States \u2013 on the US invasion of Iraq, for example, just as Martin Luther King, Jr. was on the Vietnam War.\n\n\u201cAs with King, it is this subversive aspect of Mandela\u2019s legacy that is most in danger of being erased as he enters America\u2019s pantheon of sanitized moral icons,\u201d Beinert writes. \u201cBut it is precisely the aspect that Americans most badly need.\u201d\n\nCommentators on the right have been taking a decidedly unsanitized view of Mandela\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cThe bulk of his adult life, Nelson Mandela was a failed Marxist revolutionary and leftist icon, the Che Guevara of Africa,\u201d begins the Wall Street Journal editorial noting Mandela\u2019s passing.\n\nAfter a detailed review of Mandela\u2019s accomplishments and failings, the editorial concludes: \u201cMandela became the biggest of African men by refusing to act like a typical African \u2018Big Man.\u2019 He transcended his party's history of Marxism, tribalism and violence. The continent and world were fortunate to have him.\u201d\n\nWriting in the Atlantic, senior editor Ta-Nehisi Coates finds such phrasing condescending and racist.\n\n\u201cIt is certainly true that \u2018most African rulers\u2019 do not willingly hand over power,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat is because most human leaders do not hand over power. What racism does is take a basic human tendency and make it the property of ancestry. As though Franco never happened. As though Hitler and Stalin never happened. As though Pinochet never happened. As though we did not prop up Mobutu. As though South Carolina was not, for most of its history, ruled by Big Men as nefarious and vicious as any \u2018African ruler.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome prominent conservatives have used Mandela\u2019s passing to score domestic political points \u2013 former US Senator and Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum likening the \u201cgreat injustice\u201d of apartheid to the \u201cgreat injustice\u201d of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut almost without exception, Republican elected officials have been as laudatory of Mandela as have Democrats. \u201cFrom prisoner to president, Mr. Mandela demonstrated a lifelong commitment to justice and human rights, and his legacy should serve as an example for all of us,\u201d said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R) of Virginia.\n\nBut the problem for many of them (as noted in blog post comments here and here) \u2013 and it\u2019s a problem for the Republican Party generally as it seeks to attract black voters \u2013 is that many of their supporters come across as racist in their comments about Nelson Mandela.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "a8551ee1c560cbebfbb92025136c68eb", "sailthru.author": "Brad Knickerbocker", "description": "Conservatives once saw Nelson Mandela as a communist and a terrorist.
