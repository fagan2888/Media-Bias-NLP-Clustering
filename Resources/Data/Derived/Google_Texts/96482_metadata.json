Elsewhere on his family\u2019s modest property at the end of a rural, dead-end dirt road are penned-in goats and chickens that roam free.\n\nFarm animals in the yard are hardly rare in Maine, but Eves starting every day with a feed bucket in hand might be hard for some to imagine. As the Democratic speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, Eves is more well-known for his polished appearance and the carefully measured demeanor he brings to the House rostrum.\n\nDuring the past year, he also has emerged as Public Enemy No. 1 for combative Republican Gov. Paul LePage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the people of Maine want fighting at the State House,\u201d Eves said recently, sipping coffee on the porch of his family\u2019s cozy two-story home. \u201cI have decided to focus my efforts on working with people who are willing to be good-faith negotiators. I think people appreciate a relaxed leadership style that\u2019s more in line with the people of Maine.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees, with some Democrats suggesting Eves\u2019 measured responses to LePage\u2019s personal attacks and condemnation of the Legislature could be interpreted as weakness.\n\n\u201cHis temperament is such that he doesn\u2019t want to create havoc with anyone, and I think that is one of the reasons that the governor probably saw him as a pushover,\u201d Rep. John Martin, D-Eagle Lake, who was speaker of the House for 19 years ending in 1994, said. \u201cWhat Mark should have done at some point is go into the governor\u2019s office one on one and told him exactly what he thought of him.\u201d\n\nRocky roads\n\nDespite his usually mild-mannered demeanor, Eves has found himself at the receiving end of bitter public clashes with LePage, especially after Republicans in 2014 won a majority in the Maine Senate, effectively pushing one of LePage\u2019s other chief foils, former Democratic Senate President Justin Alfond of Portland, into the background.\n\nAfter innumerable clashes on policy issues, LePage made his attacks on Eves personal earlier this year, when the governor publicly ransacked Eves\u2019 reputation and forced Good Will-Hinckley, which runs a charter school for at-risk children in Fairfield, to rescind a $120,000-per-year contract to Eves to be the organization\u2019s president.\n\nIn a letter to the Good Will-Hinckley board in early June, LePage said Eves\u2019 skills in conflict resolution, leadership, negotiation and reconciliation were \u201csadly deficient.\u201d In a now-infamous handwritten letter LePage wrote to Hinckley board Chairman John Moore, which Moore said he threw away, LePage called Eves a \u201chack.\u201d\n\nThe controversy, in which LePage threatened to withhold state funding for Good Will-Hinckley unless it fired Eves, has grown since it erupted. LePage is under investigation by the Legislature\u2019s Government Oversight Committee, and Eves has filed a federal civil lawsuit against the governor, which seeks unspecified financial damages. Some House members are threatening to launch impeachment proceedings against LePage.\n\nMeanwhile, Eves said he is struggling on one hand to maintain enough decorum in the sharply divided House for there to be hope of consensus while on the other trying to earn a paycheck to help his wife, Laura, support their three children.\n\n\u201cI lost a job I was really looking forward to doing, which would have changed our family\u2019s life for the better,\u201d Eves said. \u201cI never thought [LePage] would follow through on his threat to withhold that money, but he did.\u201d\n\nEves\u2019 lawsuit and any legislative action against LePage would take months or years to unfold, and Eves says he knows his family is in this fight \u201cfor the long haul.\u201d\n\nOn the defensive\n\nAlthough Eves criticized LePage in the past, for the most part the arrows in this battle are flying in one direction. That\u2019s largely the way it has been between LePage and legislators during the three years of LePage\u2019s tenure that Democrats, led by Eves, have controlled the House: LePage keeps his foes on the defensive.\n\nSome lawmakers and political observers have quietly questioned whether Eves should strike a more aggressive tone. While well-liked and respected, Eves at times has frustrated members of his caucus as LePage\u2019s fiery demeanor has overshadowed his careful and measured public responses, regardless of the issue. This approach, in the Legislature as well as the Maine Democratic Party, has fueled criticism that Democrats lack the tenacity or will to stand up to LePage.\n\nOn the other hand, Eves is firm at the House rostrum, adhering astutely to procedural rules and at times loudly gaveling down outbursts from members of both parties in an effort to maintain decorum and order.\n\nBehind the scenes, he has found a way to command loyalty \u2014 or at least solidarity when it comes time to vote \u2014 from House Democrats, a group whose ideology runs the gamut from Portland progressives to social conservatives such as Martin.\n\nOutside the chamber \u2014 and especially in public confrontations with LePage and House Republicans \u2014 Eves\u2019 sterner side has been less evident. While there have been few public criticisms of Eves from members of his party, Martin said Democratic ideals might be better served by a more bombastic approach from party leadership.\n\nMartin said as speaker \u2014 such as when he and Democrats battled with Republican Gov. John McKernan over workers\u2019 compensation reform, which led to a government shutdown in 1991 \u2014 he tried to maintain a balance between a calm public persona and a fierce negotiator in private.\n\n\u201cI would say Mark Eves is too nice of a guy,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThat was not my style, and it would not be my style now.\u201d\n\nRep. Robert Nutting, R-Oakland, who was House speaker for two years preceding Eves, said he views Eves as fair in running the House\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the key spokesmen for the state\u2019s Democratic Party, and as a result his ideas and my ideas about how to run the state vary greatly,\u201d Nutting said. \u201cGov. LePage has his positions as well, and for reasons of their own the two of them don\u2019t seem to get along. It makes it hard to come to compromise on issues, but I don\u2019t think you can put all of the blame for that on the speaker.\u201d\n\nEves for governor?\n\nThere are some who look to Eves as the Democrats\u2019 next candidate for governor, though it would be an uphill battle because candidates for statewide office from York County have historically fared poorly \u2014 especially in the more conservative and provincial 2nd Congressional District. Eves won\u2019t talk much about his gubernatorial ambitions but does not deny the possibility.\n\n\u201cJust hearing people saying that is a little surreal for me,\u201d said Eves, who will be term-limited out of his House seat in 2016. \u201cIf an opportunity came up that made sense for my family, I\u2019d love to continue to serve in public office.\u201d\n\nAfter moving from state to state as a child and earning a master\u2019s degree in marriage and family counseling from Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, Eves moved to Maine in 2003, where he started a career working with at-risk children and their families. In the early days, that involved visits to homes where family dysfunction and mental illness were often of epic and multigenerational proportions. Much of the time, his presence wasn\u2019t welcome.\n\n\u201cA lot of these kids knew their parents had some serious issues,\u201d Eves said. \u201cSome of them were suicidal. You never know when you leave that house whether that kid would take their life that night. I can\u2019t even relate to that.\u201d\n\nIt was in those difficult circumstances that Eves began to recognize that what some see as a weakness he sees as his strength.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that just having some basic human dignity goes a long way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have the ability to connect with people. That\u2019s also true in the Legislature.\u201d\n\n\u2018Look out for one another\u2019\n\nAfter winning his House of Representatives seat by about 500 votes in 2008, Eves became a fierce advocate for Maine\u2019s health care safety net and one of the leading proponents for expanding Medicaid under the provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act. As speaker, he has made supporting senior citizens his marquee issue.\n\n\u201cMy parents always taught me, and now I\u2019m instilling it in my own kids, the responsibility we all have to look out for one another,\u201d Eves said. \u201cWe are our brother\u2019s keeper and have a responsibility to work with one another.\u201d\n\nHeading back to Augusta in January and possibly to the ballot in 2018, Eves said voters should expect more of his low-key leadership. As he has said and written, he carries with him daily what his mother said every morning before he left for school: \u201cGod loves you and so do I, and remember who you are.\u201d\n\nJo Ann Eves said recently it has been difficult watching her son engage in this battle with LePage.\n\n\u201cAs a mom you want what is always good and shiny for your children,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe he is remembering who he is. I\u2019ve seen a lot of growth and wisdom in him.\u201d\n\nMark Eves said his immediate goals involve supporting his family. After being let go by Good Will-Hinckley, he accepted another job offer at Woodford\u2019s Family Services, which serves children and families with special needs and where Eves worked previously. Eves is one of the organization\u2019s development officers, which means, among other things, that he is responsible for fundraising, building partnerships and soliciting grants.\n\nEves said he was worried his controversy with LePage would make it difficult for him to find another job, but Woodford Executive Director Paul Nau said that\u2019s not the case.\n\n\u201cWe brought Mark back because he did a great job for us before,\u201d Nau said. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to have him back.\u201d\n\nAs for his relationship with LePage, Eves said he\u2019s still hopeful the governor and Legislature can forge a constructive working relationship. But \u201chopeful\u201d and \u201coptimistic\u201d aren\u2019t the same thing.\n\n\u201cThe governor is still marching forward with this behavior,\u201d said Eves, who added he will not participate in any impeachment proceedings if they arise. \u201cI think the people of Maine are expecting the governor to be held accountable. You shouldn\u2019t be able to use taxpayer money and your elected position to get someone you don\u2019t like fired.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "NORTH BERWICK, Maine \u2014 Of all the decisions Mark Eves has made as a father and elected official, one of the hardest was what to tell his son after a pig scramble when the boy asked if he could take the pig home. \u201cGood grief,\u201d Eves thought to himself, though [...]", "title": "Battered by LePage, \u2018pushover\u2019 speaker Mark Eves urged to fight back", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2015/11/07/the-point/battered-by-lepage-pushover-speaker-mark-eves-urged-to-fight-back/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10039321_H16246773-600x400.jpg?strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NORTH BERWICK, Maine \u2014 Of all the decisions Mark Eves has made as a father and elected official, one of the hardest was what to tell his son after a pig scramble when the boy asked if he could take the pig home. \u201cGood grief,\u201d Eves thought to himself, though [...]", "title": "Battered by LePage, \u2018pushover\u2019 speaker Mark Eves urged to fight back", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2015/11/07/the-point/battered-by-lepage-pushover-speaker-mark-eves-urged-to-fight-back/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10039321_H16246773-250x250.jpg?strip=all", "site": "@bangordailynews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re glad to have him back.\u201dAs for his relationship with LePage, Eves said he\u2019s still hopeful the governor and Legislature can forge a constructive working relationship.\nOutside the chamber \u2014 and especially in public confrontations with LePage and House Republicans \u2014 Eves\u2019 sterner side has been less evident.\nAs the Democratic speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, Eves is more well-known for his polished appearance and the carefully measured demeanor he brings to the House rostrum.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the people of Maine want fighting at the State House,\u201d Eves said recently, sipping coffee on the porch of his family\u2019s cozy two-story home.\nThat\u2019s largely the way it has been between LePage and legislators during the three years of LePage\u2019s tenure that Democrats, led by Eves, have controlled the House: LePage keeps his foes on the defensive."}
