We reviewed your submissions, did our own research, and came up with a list of 32 characters across four different categories, who\u2019ll go head to head over the next four weeks until one of them is crowned as the most despicable, unlikeable, flat-out awful (fictional) person on the small screen.\n\nSee the bracket in its entirety here.\n\nThe Case for Jamm (Parks and Recreation)\n\nNBC Why this character is the actual worst: An orthodontist by trade and a lover of satin bowling jackets by nature, Jeremy Jamm is best known as Leslie Knope\u2019s loyal opposition on the Pawnee City Council. In that capacity, he is effectively an agent of chaos: He tries to defeat Leslie\u2019s (usually extremely sensible) initiatives simply to keep progress from coming to Pawnee. You could look at him as a ridiculous rendering of the Tea Party caucus, or of Congress itself, or really of anyone who sees \u201ccompromise\u201d as a kind of surrender: Stupidly obstinate and reflexively arrogant, he is a one-man proponent of the theory of Jamm Exceptionalism. Which is another way of saying that Jeremy Jamm is pretty much a distillation of everything that is currently wrong with the American political system. Worst moment/s: Any time he uses the phrase \u201cyou just got Jammed.\u201d Worst trait/s: His weird, and mostly unexplained, obsession with defeating Leslie\u2014an obsession that often borders on creepiness. (Remember when Jamm literally stink-bombed Leslie\u2019s wedding, just because he could?) Redeeming moments/qualities: None. \u2014Megan Garber\n\nThe Case for Fitz (Scandal)", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bracket to find the most terrible person on television", "author": "The Editors", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A bracket to find the most terrible person on television", "title": "Vote for the #ActualWorst Character on TV: Jeremy Jamm vs. Fitzgerald Grant", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/11/JermeyVFitzgerald/facebook.jpg?1446835348", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/11/actualworst-round-one-jeremy-jamm-vs-fitzgerald-grant/414705/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Throughout the month of November, we\u2019re soliciting readers\u2019 help to definitively answer an age-old question: Who is the actual worst character on television?\nWhich is another way of saying that Jeremy Jamm is pretty much a distillation of everything that is currently wrong with the American political system.\nThe Case for Jamm (Parks and Recreation)NBC Why this character is the actual worst: An orthodontist by trade and a lover of satin bowling jackets by nature, Jeremy Jamm is best known as Leslie Knope\u2019s loyal opposition on the Pawnee City Council.\n(Remember when Jamm literally stink-bombed Leslie\u2019s wedding, just because he could?)\nWorst moment/s: Any time he uses the phrase \u201cyou just got Jammed.\u201d Worst trait/s: His weird, and mostly unexplained, obsession with defeating Leslie\u2014an obsession that often borders on creepiness."}
