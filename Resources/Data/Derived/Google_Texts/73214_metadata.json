Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nPresident Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. economy \u201chas been moving and continues to grow.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in New Orleans where he marked the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Obama tried to allay worries about a potential global economic slowdown, saying the U.S. \u201cremains an anchor of global strength and stability in the world\u201d despite fears of slowing growth in China.\n\nGlobal stock markets have been jittery this week over the state of the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second-largest. Markets plunged earlier this week after China devalued its currency, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed sharply up Wednesday and Thursday \u2014 erasing some of those losses.\n\nMr. Obama pointed to job creation, low unemployment and overall economic growth as signs that the U.S. economy remains healthy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to remember that strength,\u201d the president said.\n\nHe repeated his call for Congress to pass a budget for the new fiscal year before the current year ends on Sept. 30. A bloc of conservative lawmakers has threatened to shut down the government unless the new budget cuts off federal funds to Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "President Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. economy \"has been moving and continues to grow.\"", "title": "Obama Touts U.S. Economy\u2019s Strength", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/08/27/obama-touts-u-s-economys-strength/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KB093_ObamaE_P_20150827183738.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Obama Touts U.S. Economy\u2019s Strength", "description": "President Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. economy \"has been moving and continues to grow.\"", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Byron Tau", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "President Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. economy \"has been moving and continues to grow.\"", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-08-27T22:41:54-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/08/27/obama-touts-u-s-economys-strength/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-57578", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "President Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. economy \"has been moving and continues to grow.\"", "title": "Obama Touts U.S. Economy\u2019s Strength", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/08/27/obama-touts-u-s-economys-strength/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KB093_ObamaE_P_20150827183738.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-57578", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-08-28T12:28:42-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Obama pointed to job creation, low unemployment and overall economic growth as signs that the U.S. economy remains healthy.\nPresident Barack Obama speaks during an event to mark the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina on Aug. 27, 2015 in New Orleans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to remember that strength,\u201d the president said.\nGlobal stock markets have been jittery this week over the state of the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second-largest.\nHe repeated his call for Congress to pass a budget for the new fiscal year before the current year ends on Sept. 30."}
