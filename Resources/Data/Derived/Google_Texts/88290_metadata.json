Burwell, was brought by religious groups that object to providing insurance coverage for contraception to their female employees.\n\nLess than a week after the case was argued in March, the court issued an unusual unsigned order asking the parties to submit supplemental briefs on a possible compromise. In Monday\u2019s ruling, the court said those briefs suggested that a compromise was possible, but that it should be forged in the lower courts.\n\n\u201cGiven the gravity of the dispute and the substantial clarification and refinement in the positions of the parties, the parties on remand should be afforded an opportunity to arrive at an approach going forward that accommodates petitioners\u2019 religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners\u2019 health plans receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage,\u201d the court said, quoting from a brief filed by the government.\n\nThe Supreme Court urged the lower courts to \u201callow the parties sufficient time to resolve any outstanding issues between them.\u201d\n\nThe justices emphasized that they were deciding nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe court expresses no view on the merits of the cases,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cIn particular, the court does not decide whether petitioners\u2019 religious exercise has been substantially burdened, whether the government has a compelling interest, or whether the current regulations are the least restrictive means of serving that interest.\u201d\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor filed a concurrence, which was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, underscoring the limited nature of the court\u2019s action and cautioning lower courts not to read anything into it.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s opinion does only what it says it does: \u2018affords an opportunity\u2019 for the parties and courts of appeals to reconsider the parties\u2019 arguments in light of petitioners\u2019 new articulation of their religious objection and the government\u2019s clarification about what the existing regulations accomplish, how they might be amended and what such an amendment would sacrifice,\u201d Sotomayor wrote.\n\n\u201cAs enlightened by the parties\u2019 new submissions, the courts of appeals remain free to reach the same conclusion or a different one on each of the questions presented by these cases,\u201d she stated.\n\nThe case was the court\u2019s second encounter with the contraception requirement and the fourth time it considered an aspect of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt built on a case from 2014, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, which said a regulation requiring family-owned corporations to pay for insurance coverage for contraception violated a federal law protecting religious liberty.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for the majority in 2014, said there was a better alternative, one the government had offered to nonprofit groups with religious objections.\n\nThe case was brought by religious groups that object to providing insurance coverage for contraception to their female employees.\n\nThat alternative, or accommodation, was at issue in the new case. It allowed nonprofit groups like schools and hospitals that were affiliated with religious organizations not to pay for coverage and to avoid fines if they informed their insurers, plan administrators, or the government that they wanted an exemption.\n\nMany religious groups around the nation challenged the accommodation, saying that objecting and providing the required information would make them complicit in conduct that violated their faith.\n\nThe groups added that they should be entitled to the outright exemption offered to houses of worship like churches, synagogues, and mosques. Houses of worship are not subject to the coverage requirement at all and do not have to file any paperwork if they choose not to provide contraception coverage.\n\nAt the arguments in March, several justices indicated that they thought the accommodation violated the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act because it allowed the government to \u201chijack\u201d the insurance plans of the religious groups that are the petitioners in the case.\n\nDays later, the court called for more briefs in an order that asked the parties to \u201caddress whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners\u2019 employees through petitioners\u2019 insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees.\u201d\n\nThe order sketched out how this might work, asking the two sides to address whether it would be acceptable for the groups to do no more than to buy insurance plans for their workers that do not include contraception coverage.\n\nOn Monday, the court said both sides \u201cnow confirm that such an option is feasible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.3739434714", "eomportal-id": 846010, "description": "The ruling was the latest indication that the eight-member Supreme Court is trying to avoid deadlocks.", "eomportal-instanceid": 17, "og": {"city": "Washington", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "The ruling was the latest indication that the eight-member Supreme Court is trying to avoid deadlocks.", "title": "Justices, seeking compromise, return contraception case to lower courts - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2016/05/16/justices-seeking-compromise-return-contraception-case-lower-courts/3VARSzGzGBbpLQrU1UEKBN/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg-small-square.jpg", "longitude": "-77.0363658", "state": "DC", "latitude": "38.8951118", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 01:31:00 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Justices return contraception case to lower courts, Adam Liptak, Sonia  Sotomayor, Ruth Bader  Ginsburg, Samuel A Jr  Alito,Supreme Court, New York Times, Police Department (NYC)", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "eomportal-uuid": "0540c90c-1baf-11e6-bf39-60d1d8e36ac7", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Justices return contraception case to lower courts, Adam Liptak, Sonia  Sotomayor, Ruth Bader  Ginsburg, Samuel A Jr  Alito,Supreme Court, New York Times, Police Department (NYC)"}, "article_summary": "AdvertisementThe case, Zubik v.
