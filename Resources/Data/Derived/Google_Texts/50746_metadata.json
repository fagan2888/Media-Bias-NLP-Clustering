That same night, though, Walker said Herkert still was working for the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a personnel issue, we are working through some things,\u201d Walker told the Telegraph at about 8 p.m., after the Aug. 12 City Council meeting. \u201cHe is still employed with the city as of this moment.\u201d\n\nHerkert later answered a reporter\u2019s text message saying, \u201cI have parted ways with the city as of August 12th.\u201d He did not answer a question as to whether Walker fired him in that text or after a second, subsequent message from the reporter.\n\n\u201c(I) am very much looking forward to, and excited about, pursuing other opportunities as the \u201816 election cycle continues to heat up,\u201d Herkert continued in his response to the Telegraph. \u201cI remain on good terms with the mayor and will continue to advise him politically.\u201d\n\nHerkert did not attend that Aug. 12 council meeting, as he usually does. Friday, Herkert still had not cleared out his second-floor office, one of three in the mayoral space.\n\nWalker has declined to discuss personnel issues publicly since taking office. He did not return a reporter\u2019s telephone call on the matter Friday; the reporter subsequently filed a Freedom of Information request with the city with questions about Herkert\u2019s employment.\n\nState statute allows a public body five business days to respond to an FOI request.\n\nThe Telegraph had not received a response as of late Monday afternoon.\n\nMultiple sources connected with the city, though, have told the Telegraph that Walker and Herkert have been arguing recently and disagreeing on the handling of some issues. Sources said the mayor fired Herkert after he returned from a trip to Las Vegas, with only the two men present at the firing. One source said Walker made Herkert \u201cresign.\u201d\n\nSeveral sources also said Walker plans to hire Herkert\u2019s replacement in October, an unidentified woman. Herkert reportedly will be compensated for unused sick days and vacation pay.\n\nHerkert, a Hardin native, was in charge of Walker\u2019s unsuccessful run for mayor in 2009 and his write-in race in 2013.\n\nReach Linda N.
