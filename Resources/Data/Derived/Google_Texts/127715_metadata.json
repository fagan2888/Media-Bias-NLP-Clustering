The calculator helps people figure out how large their tax penalty will be if they fail to obtain required health-insurance coverage.\n\nThe deadline for obtaining health insurance to avoid the penalty is March 31. According to the Tax Policy Center, the penalty is \u201calmost always more than the $95 that news stories frequently cite.\u201d\n\nThe Tax Policy Center \u2013 a joint venture of the left-leaning Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute \u2013 created the calculator to help people figure out their actual penalty. For a single person, the penalty could be as much as $3,600, if they had adjusted gross income, subject to certain tweaks, of $370,000 or more. For a family with income over $1 million, the penalty could top $10,000 in the first year.\n\nIn a more common case \u2014 a married couple with two kids making $50,000 a year on the adjusted basis \u2014 the penalty for not having insurance could run about $300 a year. The same couple making $100,000 a year on this basis could be subject to a fine of about $800.\n\nRoberton Williams, a TPC fellow, explained that the fixed dollar penalty of $95 applies only for relatively low-income households. For higher-income families, the penalty is 1% of their income, minus certain adjustments, up to the average national cost for getting basic insurance coverage, known as \u201cbronze\u201d coverage. That will cost about $3,600 per adult plus $1,900 per child in 2014, Mr. Williams said. The penalty will be still higher in subsequent years\u20142% of taxable income with a minimum of $325 in 2015, and 2.5% of income but at least $695 in 2016 (again capped at the average annual premium for bronze plans).\n\nMore\n\nObama Says Delays Don\u2019t Mean Health Law Was a Mistake\n\nMore Uninsured Buy Coverage Under Health Law", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "For many families, the penalty for not having health-insurance coverage will run a lot higher than the $95 figure often cited -- and it could run into the five figures in some cases.", "title": "Obamacare Penalty to Exceed $95 for Many Americans", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/03/06/obamacare-penalty-to-exceed-95-for-many-americans/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Obamacare Penalty to Exceed $95 for Many Americans", "description": "For many families, the penalty for not having health-insurance coverage will run a lot higher than the $95 figure often cited -- and it could run into the five figures in some cases.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "John D.
