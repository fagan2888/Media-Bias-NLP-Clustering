NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Not many people have heard of Lewy body dementia, yet it’s the second most frequent cause of progressive dementia, and there are more people with Lewy body dementia than Parkinson’s disease.

The cost of caring for someone with this different kind of dementia also differs. In 2008, the average cost of caring for an individual with Lewy body dementia was $35,000 a year compared with $25,000 for a person with Alzheimer's, according to research led by Carolyn W. Zhu of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York that was published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia. Direct costs included drugs, hospitalizations and home health care. Indirect costs included lost wages, unpaid caregivers and stress.

An estimated 1.3 million people in the U.S. suffer from Lewy body dementia while as many as 1 million people are thought to have Parkinson’s and more than 5 million people are thought to have Alzheimer’s disease.

Lewy body dementia is the most commonly misdiagnosed form of dementia, and it takes an average of more than 18 months and three doctors for people who have the disorder to get a proper diagnosis, according to the Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA). As a result, most people are already at moderate or severe stages when diagnosed with the disease, and patients have been left vulnerable to potentially deadly side effects of certain drugs.

Lewy body dementia is so unheard of that the LBDA enlisted the aid of Whoopi Goldberg to launch its “Lewy Who?” awareness campaign.
