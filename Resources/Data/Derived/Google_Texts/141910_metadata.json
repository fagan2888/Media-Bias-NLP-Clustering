Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.03, missing the FactSet consensus of $1.05. Revenue rose 2% to $1.13 billion, just shy of the FactSet consensus of $1.13 billion, as lower-than-expected pod sales offset better-than-expected sales of brewers, accessories and other products. For the full fiscal year, the company expects sales to grow in the flat-to-up-low-single-digit range, and adjusted EPS to decline in the mid-single digits, while the current FactSet consensus estimates imply sales growth of 5.9% and EPS growth of 4.3%. \"Although we are lowering our guidance to reflect the impact of near-term challenges related to this complex product transition, we remain highly confident in our long term strategy for the Keurig hot system and continue to believe there is a significant runway of opportunity,\" said Chief Executive Brian Kelley.
