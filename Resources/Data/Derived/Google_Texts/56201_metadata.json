Associated Press\n\nConservatives have long argued that \u201cfirst dollar\u201d insurance coverage helps raise the cost of health care, as people tend to overconsume services they perceive as free. Implementation of state insurance exchanges appears to confirm that hypothesis: Several states that used \u201cfree\u201d federal dollars to build complicated exchanges may end up scrapping them.\n\nWould Massachusetts officials still have wanted to create \u201cthe absolute Rolls-Royce of any health exchange\u201d had they been required to pay its costs\u2014which could approach nearly $300 million? Would the Bay State have chosen to redesign the state portal while also exploring a backup move to the federal exchange had federal dollars not been funding its Plan B and Plan C?\n\nIn Oregon, would officials have tried to re-create the \u201centire\u201d computer infrastructure of the state Department of Human Services had such efforts come out of the state social services department\u2019s budget?\n\nIt is, of course, impossible to answer these questions definitively. But state officials almost certainly would not have been stingier with federal dollars than with their own funds. And constraining their ambitions might have produced more functional exchanges.\n\nChris Jacobs is policy director of America Next, a conservative think tank.
