A big hospital in the nearby city of York is making a play to take over the Downton Cottage Hospital next to the posh estate.\n\nOr as Maggie Smith\u2019s character, the Dowager Countess of Grantham, sees it, \u201cThe Royal Yorkshire county hospital wants to take over our little hospital, which is outrageous!\u201d\n\nThe battle lines have been drawn between the Dowager Countess, who wants the hospital to stay a small community endeavor, and the rest of the family, who hope the merger will turn the dinky open-ward affair into a first-rate modern medical institution.\n\nHealth care historian Howard Markel, who runs the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan, said the conceit is actually fairly accurate.\n\n\u201cThe 1920's really begins the golden age of medicine,\u201d he explained. Before then, hospitals didn\u2019t have much to offer in the way of treatment.\n\n\u201cThey were really based on old time 19th century medicine, and what that entails is basically nursing. You feed people, you make them comfortable,\u201d he said.\n\nThere weren\u2019t many medications available \u2014 antibiotics, insulin or even intravenous fluids.\n\nBut in the early 20th century, all sorts of new medical technologies came onto the scene \u2014 new ways to peer into the body, new medications and pathogen-free surgeries.\n\nTo provide modern care, \u201cyou need X-ray machines of all kinds, you need a chemistry laboratory and you need special operating rooms,\u201d said Markel, all of which cost much more than the gauze and broth of the past.\n\nCities started to build bigger, grander hospitals, which in turn started to absorb the smaller, old-fashioned hospitals in the surrounding towns and villages. Those mergers did have some benefits for local populations.\n\n\u201cIf we form such a partnership, our patients would have more access to more modern equipment, to more advanced treatments,\u201d Downton Abbey\u2019s Lord Merton noted on the show.\n\nMany of his real-life contemporaries agreed, making the golden age of medicine a heyday for hospital consolidation on both sides of the pond.\n\nNowadays, we appear to be in another Downton-like consolidation surge here in the U.S., said Kathy McDonald, who directs the Stanford University Center for Health Policy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been since about 2010 that there's been sort of an uptick in terms of consolidations,\u201d said McDonald. About 100 mergers and acquisitions occur each year right now, about twice as many as there were before 2010, she said.\n\nBut this time around, it\u2019s not about technology \u2014 it\u2019s about finances. Hospitals need to be part of larger networks to flex their muscles in negotiations for profitable contracts with insurers. And thanks to the Affordable Care Act, they are now often paid based on the quality and efficiency of the care they provide, rather than for each test or procedure. Actually tracking how good their quality is turns out to be very expensive. And it can be more economical to team up to manage care and track quality.\n\n\u201cThey might be providing perfectly good quality, but if they can't prove it, then they're not going to get paid as well,\u201d said McDonald.\n\nThose mergers can have real consequences for communities, which may see a local hospital transform or even disappear entirely.\n\n\u201cJust like on Downton Abbey, the local hospital is a resource that people care about. They employ people in a community and they take care of people,\u201d said McDonald. So the debates continue, now as then.\n\nAnd true to form, the indomitable Dowager Countess tells us exactly what she thinks about all this so-called progress: \u201cFor years, I\u2019ve watched governments take control of our lives and their argument is always the same: fewer costs, greater efficiency. But the result is the same too. Less control by the people, more control by the state.\u201d\n\nSo whose side are the experts on in this Downton debate?\n\n\u201cPersonally I love Maggie Smith and have loved her since i was a young boy, so I\u2019m on her side as a fan,\u201d said Markel.\n\nBut, he adds, the other side is probably right.\n\nMcDonald is also on the side of progress. But even for health care policy experts, it\u2019s hard to argue against the Dowager Countess.\n\nThere are plenty of Downton fans who say the whole hospital plot line is kind of a snoozer. Maybe it\u2019s no surprise \u2014 the wonks love it.\n\n\u201cHealthcare just matters to people, so even though we might not be paying attention to this plot line, we probably should,\u201d said McDonald.\n\nAnd with an audience of nearly 10 million viewers for the season premiere, there\u2019s a good chance at least a few people are.\n\nThis story is part of a collaboration between Marketplace and Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2016/02/11/health-care/health-reform-roils-downton-abbey", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/Dowager%20Countessweb.jpg?itok=CEVewRMb", "type": "article", "description": "Hospital consolidation plot is historically accurate, and has parallels today.", "title": "Health reform roils Downton Abbey"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "Ur/vqzCdZ9aqHdrDNKPafE4EjhwxzbB1GJwBRARd3ILpmKVJtJJTW5gmmjYSk5caYrfMQX5OjCwRoVlqOnxAAg==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "There are plenty of Downton fans who say the whole hospital plot line is kind of a snoozer.\nBut even for health care policy experts, it\u2019s hard to argue against the Dowager Countess.\nHospitals need to be part of larger networks to flex their muscles in negotiations for profitable contracts with insurers.\nHealth care historian Howard Markel, who runs the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan, said the conceit is actually fairly accurate.\nHealth policy wonks may not all agree with Maggie Smith's Dowager Countess of Grantham on Downton Abbey when it comes to hospital policy, but they're fans of her character and this season's plotline."}
