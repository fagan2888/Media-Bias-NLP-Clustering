The DSMB reviewed liver biopsy data from roughly half of all trial patients and noted that the primary endpoint \u2013 a decrease in the NAFLD Activity Score of at least two points with no worsening of fibrosis \u2013 was met.\n\nNow what: In my 15 years of investing, I can recall but a handful of instances where I've seen a non-micro-cap or small-cap company explode higher by 320% in a single session \u2013 and certainly none of them moved higher by $230 per share! There are obviously huge implications here for OCA given that an estimates 12% of the U.S. population has NASH and some 6 million people in the U.S. are projected to have advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, which is where OCA could be of incredible benefit. Then again, I am a realist, and a $200-plus move higher better come with absolutely utopian clinical data and execution from here on out or it will be clobbered. As much as today's move is exciting and reminds investors of the potential of the biotech sector, I'm sticking to the sidelines.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "13:12", "description": "Intercept shares more than quadruple following positive clinical data for its chronic liver disease drug.
