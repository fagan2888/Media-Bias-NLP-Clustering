The bloodied and semi-conscious woman fell on her hands and knees and begged deputies for help.\n\nVenteroso, who lived on the woman\u2019s property, had a restraining order that barred contact with the woman, the sheriff\u2019s office said. But he entered her house Tuesday and assaulted her multiple times.\n\nHe also allegedly damaged her phone to keep her from calling 911 and refused to allow her to leave or seek medical attention, the sheriff\u2019s office reported.\n\nThe woman was admitted to a hospital with head and ear injuries, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Noelle_Phillips", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "La Plata man charged with using skillet to beat woman", "title": "La Plata man charged with using skillet to beat woman", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/26/la-plata-man-charged-with-using-skillet-to-beat-woman/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141226__MugShot-Ed-Venterosop1.jpg", "height": 640}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141226__MugShot-Ed-Venterosop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-26T11:56:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:13:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A La Plata County man is in jail after repeatedly beating a woman with a cast iron skillet while holding her captive in her house for two days, the sheriff\u2019s office reported.\nVenteroso, who lived on the woman\u2019s property, had a restraining order that barred contact with the woman, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\nEdward Venteroso, 46, is being held on $25,000 bail on first-degree assault, violation of a protection order, false imprisonment and obstructing telephone service, according to a La Plata County Sheriff\u2019s Office report.\nThe woman was admitted to a hospital with head and ear injuries, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\nThe bloodied and semi-conscious woman fell on her hands and knees and begged deputies for help."}
