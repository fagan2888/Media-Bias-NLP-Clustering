Little did those fans\u2014or millions of other Americans\u2014know that the National Guard had actually paid the Atlanta Falcons for this display of patriotism as part of a $315,000 marketing contract.\u201d\n\nThe two senators go on to reveal that the DOD has spent $10.4 million on sports marketing and advertising contracts since the fiscal year 2012.\n\nThey say that the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer have all partaken in these contracts. Seventy-two of 122 contracts between the DOD and sports leagues were exposed to have contained some form of what has been termed \u201cpaid patriotism,\u201d meaning taxpayers, and not teams, foot the bill for these appearances.\n\nSix point eight million dollars\u2019 worth of the DOD\u2019s sports marketing contracts were found to contain some form of paid patriotism.\n\n\u201cBy paying for such heartwarming displays like recognition of wounded warriors, surprise homecomings, and on-field enlistment ceremonies, these displays lost their luster,\u201d Flake\u2019s and McCain\u2019s letter to the taxpayer goes on to say. \u201cUnsuspecting audience members became the subjects of paid-marketing campaigns rather than simply bearing witness to teams\u2019 authentic, voluntary shows of support for the brave men and women who wear our nation\u2019s uniform.\u201d\n\nAt least 50 teams were found to have been paid by the DOD for patriotic gestures.\n\n\u201cDOD has indicated the purpose of these contracts is to support recruiting,\u201d reads the joint oversight report.\n\nPaid acts of patriotism have included on-field color guard (flag spinning), performances of the national anthem, and ceremonial first pitches.\n\nFlake and McCain claim that this casts an \u201cunfortunate shadow over the genuine patriotic partnerships\u201d like the National Football League\u2019s Salute to the Service campaign.\n\nThe report also notes that some of the marketing funds appear to be legitimate, such as those used for recruiter\u2019s booth space at games.\n\nWhile the senators support the recruitment intent, they \u201cfind the tactics used by the military services questionable and the benefit to taxpayers undefined.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the most compelling message about military service we can deliver to prospective recruits and influencers is the promise of game tickets, gifts, and player appearances, we need to rethink our approach to how we are inspiring qualified men and women to military service,\u201d states the report, which took months of investigative work to put together.\n\nAccording to ABC15 Arizona, Flake does not blame pro sports teams for their part in the controversy.\n\n\u201cThe blame is with the DOD, not the teams,\u201d Flake told ABC15. \u201cThese teams do a lot for the veterans, do a lot for the troops. The problem is when you see items like this, it kind of just cheapens the lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaid patriotism\u201d was first criticized earlier this year, when Fox News reported that a dozen NFL teams had been paid by the DOD to honor soldiers.\n\n\u201cIt is incredible that, during a time of budget constraints and limited resources, the DOD is paying professional sports teams to \u2018support the troops,\u2019\u201d says John Cooper, spokesperson for Concerned Veterans for America. \u201cInstead of devoting resources to ensuring our warfighters have the tools they need to keep the United States safe, the DOD has seen fit to use taxpayers\u2019 dollars to support the PR efforts of these organizations.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch waste is unacceptable and highlights the need for spending reform at the department,\u201d Cooper told the The Daily Signal.\n\nWhile the DOD has banned paid patriotism, and the NFL has issued a ban on all clubs accepting payments for patriotic gestures, Flake and McCain say there is still more work to be done.\n\nThe senators are pushing for an amendment to next year\u2019s defense authorization bill that would halt the practice. They have also encouraged sports teams to donate the questionable taxpayer dollars received to organizations that support of the Armed Forces, veterans, and their families.\n\n\u201cFans should have confidence that their hometown heroes are being honored because of their honorable military service, not as a marketing ploy,\u201d McCain said in a press release.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senators Flake and McCain say the DOD paid NFL and MLB teams for patriotic acts, an exchange they've deemed \"paid patriotism.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senators Flake and McCain say the DOD paid NFL and MLB teams for patriotic acts, an exchange they've deemed \"paid patriotism.\"", "title": "What You Should Know About \u201cPaid Patriotism\u201d", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/VeteransFlagatLionsGame.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-10T21:27:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Y2gHrv"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senators Flake and McCain say the DOD paid NFL and MLB teams for patriotic acts, an exchange they've deemed \"paid patriotism.\"", "title": "What You Should Know About \u201cPaid Patriotism\u201d", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/VeteransFlagatLionsGame.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "sports", "published_time": "2015-11-10T13:23:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-10T21:27:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Paid Patriotism, NFL, Department of Defense"}, "article_summary": "Six point eight million dollars\u2019 worth of the DOD\u2019s sports marketing contracts were found to contain some form of paid patriotism.\nPaid acts of patriotism have included on-field color guard (flag spinning), performances of the national anthem, and ceremonial first pitches.\nWhile the DOD has banned paid patriotism, and the NFL has issued a ban on all clubs accepting payments for patriotic gestures, Flake and McCain say there is still more work to be done.\nSeventy-two of 122 contracts between the DOD and sports leagues were exposed to have contained some form of what has been termed \u201cpaid patriotism,\u201d meaning taxpayers, and not teams, foot the bill for these appearances.\n\u201cThe blame is with the DOD, not the teams,\u201d Flake told ABC15."}
