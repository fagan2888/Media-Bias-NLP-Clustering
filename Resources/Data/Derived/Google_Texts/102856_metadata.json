Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Benghazi committee. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nEven the network that ran almost 1,100 segments on Benghazi in the 20 months after the attack appears to be conceding that today\u2019s marathon congressional hearing on the topic is going nowhere. In the 5 p.m. hour, when competing networks CNN and MSNBC stuck closely to live coverage of the all-day hearing, the Fox News program \u201cThe Five\u201d started to drift.\n\nWhile the Benghazi committee was churning along, the flamboyant co-hosts of the roundtable program \u2014 Eric Bolling, Greg Gutfeld, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Kimberly Guilfoyle \u2014 were trading thoughts not about what former secretary of state Hillary Clinton was doing on that fateful night; not about why on earth her private e-mail account did so much business with an e-mail account of friend Sidney Blumenthal; not about whether this whole special Benghazi committee is a \u201cpartisan witch hunt,\u201d as some partisan has said at one point or another. They were talking about Donald Trump!\n\nWhere was he on the night of Sept. 11, 2012?\n\nActually, the roundtablists were discussing a Twitter insult propagated by Trump \u2014 or, as he said, an \u201cintern\u201d \u2014 against the entire state of Iowa. \u201cWhat kind of candidate trusts their Twitter account to an intern?\u201d asked Gutfeld, who also offered \u201cGreg\u2019s Diet Tips\u201d during the program. \u201cThe Five\u201d also talked a bit about Wikileaks, climate change, the Cubs and a homecoming queen kicking an extra point.\n\nMeanwhile, what was happening on Capitol Hill? Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) was lecturing about the importance of preventing another Benghazi, and Clinton was nodding. It was just the sort of moment that Fox News had apparently had enough of: Democrats on the Benghazi committee setting up Clinton to explain herself against Republican attacks; and Republicans scrounging for lines of attack that somehow hadn\u2019t been attempted in Clinton\u2019s also prolonged 2013 congressional hearings or in the mountains of media coverage over the years.\n\nWe\u2019re with Fox News here: \u201cThe Five\u201d on Trump is far preferable to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on Clinton on Benghazi. Or Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) on Clinton on Benghazi. Or whoever on Clinton on Benghazi. It\u2019s just a little precious that this network, the Benghazi network, made the call to move away. Just goes to show that the ideology of Fox News may appear to be Benghazi and Kill Obamacare, but it\u2019s really ratings.\n\nFriday night, Fox News will air a special on Benghazi:\n\n13 Hours at Benghazi \u2013 @BretBaier FRI 10pm ET Just the facts from men who were the \u201cboots on the ground.\u201d @foxnews pic.twitter.com/DXRHVJ2ini \u2014 Fox News Reporting (@FNReporting) October 21, 2015\n\nThat\u2019s a special based on the book \u201c13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi,\u201d which was written by Boston University professor Mitchell Zuckoff and security operators who were on the ground that night. The special first aired about a year ago; it\u2019s a rerun, a fitting term for most of this \u201cnew\u201d Benghazi material.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The Five\" talks about regular old issues.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "\"The Five\" talks about regular old issues.", "title": "Fox News all but acknowledges the Benghazi hearing is a snooze", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/10/22/fox-news-all-but-acknowledges-the-benghazi-hearing-is-a-snooze/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/22/Others/Images/2015-10-22/___hrc_121445540352.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ErikWemple"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/10/22/fox-news-all-but-acknowledges-the-benghazi-hearing-is-a-snooze/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Benghazi, Fox News, hillary rodham clinton, the five, greg gutfeld, dana perino,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Benghazi, Fox News, hillary rodham clinton, the five, greg gutfeld, dana perino,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bbb\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s just a little precious that this network, the Benghazi network, made the call to move away.\nWe\u2019re with Fox News here: \u201cThe Five\u201d on Trump is far preferable to Rep.
