The healthcare sector doesn\u2019t get a dispensation from the basic laws of economics.\n\nThis seems abundantly clear in an important new study that substantiates the intuitive thought that hospital mergers create monopoly power and drive up prices. More from Marketplace:\n\nOver his career, Carnegie Mellon economist Martin Gaynor has been published 69 times \u2013 papers like \u201cEquilibrium Misperceptions,\u201d \u201cEfficient Efficiencies Analysis,\u201d and \u201cProductivity Consequences of Alternative Land Division Methods in China\u2019s Decollectivization.\u201d \u201cMost of one\u2019s work is read by other academics, and my mother. But not by many other people,\u201d he said. Gaynor thinks his latest \u2013 a paper out Tuesday called \u201cThe Price Ain\u2019t Right\u201d\u2013 will be different. Three of the nation\u2019s largest insurance companies \u2013 Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealth \u2013 have let researchers have a look at the negotiated prices they pay for services and procedures like C-sections, MRIs and hospital stays.\n\nAll told, we\u2019re talking about claims data for 88 million customers, some $682 billion of healthcare bills. No one has ever had such exhaustive access to real price data before. \u201cWe have this large body of evidence covering many, many years that consistently shows if you happen to live in an area with only one hospital you are going to pay a lot more,\u201d Gaynor said.\n\nThat helps explain why a C-Section in one Oregon market costs more than $15,000 and can run for as little as $3,000 in St. Louis, where there\u2019s lots of competition. For years, hospital executives have defended these prices saying it\u2019s about quality, or that they see sicker patients, or lots of folks on Medicare. \u201cThat\u2019s just not true,\u201d said co-author Yale economist Zack Cooper.\n\nCooper said the team, including John Van Reenen from the London School of Economics and the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Stuart Craig, controlled for all those factors. And Cooper said market power matters more than the rest. The report found after decades of mergers, nearly a third of U.S. markets have monopolies, or are close to having monopolies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Turns out that Mr. Market is also Dr. Market.
