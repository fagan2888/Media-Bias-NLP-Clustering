Robin Williams' apparent suicide underscores just how important it is to seek help if you or someone you know is suffering from depression.

The Centers for Disease Control estimates one-in-ten adults in the U.S. suffers from depression. That's around 19 million people, and yet the majority don't receive proper treatment.

Matthew Gallagher, a Wichita therapist, says depression can be caused by biological factors, or it can be situational. The key is recognizing the symptoms, then getting help.

"If we experience increased irritability, sleeplessness, change in appetite, if we have trouble finding joy in the same things, we lose our motivation, our energy," Gallagher said. "In general, people don't want to die. They just are tired of hurting and tired of suffering. And that's why nobody needs to fight that alone. They need to ask for help from friends and family and see their doctor, visit a counselor or therapist."

Gallagher says anxiety is also often a part of depression.
