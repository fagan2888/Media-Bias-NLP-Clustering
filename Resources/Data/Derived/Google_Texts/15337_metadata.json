Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), but if nothing else, it has certainly introduced some interesting ideas into America\u2019s political debate. Considering that the most recent polls show Hillary Clinton with a nearly five-to-one lead over her nearest rival, this can only be viewed as a positive thing.\n\nAs Reddit\u2018s favorite politician, Bernie Sanders has enormous influence on our political discourse, and his recent policies have been making huge headlines on the Internet. Here are seven ways in which our national discussion on a wide range of issues could be transformed by the Sanders campaign.\n\n1) Guaranteeing free college\n\nIn a press conference on Monday, Sanders advocated that the government fund tuition at four-year public colleges and universities through a so-called Robin Hood tax on Wall Street, one that would set a 50 cent tax on every $100 of stock trades on stock sales, as well as lesser amounts on other financial transactions.\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201cThis death metal band fronted by a parrot is real and it\u2019s amazing\u201d\n\nWhile Sanders\u2019 critics are expected to denounce the plan as socialistic, the Vermont Senator is quick to point out that similar proposals are already in effect and successful elsewhere. \u201cCountries like Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and many more are providing free or inexpensive higher education for their young people,\u201d Sanders points out. \u201cThey understand how important it is to be investing in their youth. We should be doing the same.\u201d\n\nAlthough Obama promised free community college for students who qualify, Bernie Sanders\u2019 proposed policy shows that with America\u2019s burgeoning debt crisis, we need to go even further.\n\n2) Addressing income inequality\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press confirming his presidential run, Sanders cited America\u2019s growing income inequality as one of the chief motivators behind his campaign, a well-timed stance given the recent #FightFor15 on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen is that while the average person is working longer hours for lower wages, we have seen a huge increase in income and wealth inequality, which is now reaching obscene levels,\u201d Sanders argued. \u201cThis is a rigged economy, which works for the rich and the powerful, and is not working for ordinary Americans.\u201d\n\nSanders has proposed a number of reforms to solve this problem, from legislation that would close corporate tax loopholes to raising the minimum wage above $7.25 an hour, a rate Sanders describes as a \u201cstarvation wage.\u201d For the working poor, getting by continues to be a daily struggle, and Sanders is fighting to change that.\n\n3) Regulating Wall Street\n\nIf you think Sanders\u2019 free college plan has Wall Street concerned, you can only imagine how they feel about Sanders\u2019 proposed bill for breaking up banks that are considered \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d In fact, polls show 58 percent of likely voters agreewith his basic argument that \u201cif an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist,\u201d indicating that merely denouncing Sanders as a radical won\u2019t necessarily work for this measure.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, banking lobbyists are concerned that anti-bank sentiment within the Democratic grassroots could push Clinton to the left on this issue. \u201cThe prospects of it becoming law are nil,\u201d reported one banking lobbyist to the Hill. \u201cBut we care about whether this impacts Hillary and whether she\u2019ll try to pander to the far left.\u201d\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201c\u2018The Crow\u2019 is recasting its supervillain as a woman\u201d\n\nBut for the millions who continue to be affected by the 2008 crash and the effects of the American banking bubble on our Great Recession, it\u2019s not just about pushing Hillary to the left. It\u2019s about pushing America forward.\n\n4) Legalizing marijuana\n\nAlthough Sanders told Time magazine that he doesn\u2019t consider marijuana legalization to be \u201cone of the major issues facing this country,\u201d his sympathies on the subject are pretty clear.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He may not capture the Democratic nomination, but the Vermont senator still has a chance to reshape the party VIDEO", "title": "7 ways Bernie Sanders could transform America", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "He may not capture the Democratic nomination, but the Vermont senator still has a chance to reshape the party VIDEO", "title": "7 ways Bernie Sanders could transform America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/7_ways_bernie_sanders_could_transform_america_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/bernie_sanders4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He may not capture the Democratic nomination, but the Vermont senator still has a chance to reshape the party VIDEO", "title": "7 ways Bernie Sanders could transform America", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/bernie_sanders4.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Matthew Rozsa", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bernie Sanders, Denmark, Germany, Hillary Clinton, Sweden, the daily dot, Video, Wall Street", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1d3\"", "article_summary": "As Reddit\u2018s favorite politician, Bernie Sanders has enormous influence on our political discourse, and his recent policies have been making huge headlines on the Internet.\nHere are seven ways in which our national discussion on a wide range of issues could be transformed by the Sanders campaign.\nWe should be doing the same.\u201dAlthough Obama promised free community college for students who qualify, Bernie Sanders\u2019 proposed policy shows that with America\u2019s burgeoning debt crisis, we need to go even further.\nTopics: Bernie Sanders, Denmark, Germany, Hillary Clinton, Sweden, the daily dot, Video, Wall Street, Business News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on The Daily DotSay what you will about the presidential candidacy of Sen.
