The DJ, twitchy Huey Calhoun (Jim Hogan), recognizes Felicia\u2019s potential and is besotted with her, determined to make her a star despite the reservations of his boss.\n\nThe local African-Americans who frequent the Beale Street nightclub owned by Felicia\u2019s intimidating brother (Keith L. Hatten) know Felicia is gifted, too. Their displeasure is clear when Huey walks into the club, but softens when he makes his case with \u201cMusic of My Soul.\u201d\n\nHuey\u2019s street cred solidifies when, during a tryout at a radio station, Huey yanks a smarmy Perry Como tune and replaces it with \u201cScratch My Itch,\u201d a hot-blooded number by Wailin\u2019 Joe (Sidney Dupont, channeling both Prince and Little Richard).\n\nThe infectious music, by Bon Jovi founding member David Bryan, pays homage to the gospel and blues roots of rock. \u201cMake Me Stronger\u201d is such a siren call that you almost expect converts to approach the preacher.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s got the beat. Huey\u2019s mother (Melissa Swift-Sawyer, whose magnificent voice is showcased in the transformative \u201cChange Don\u2019t Come Easy\u201d) is a bigot who can\u2019t grasp her son\u2019s fascination with \u201crace music,\u201d and is even more appalled upon learning of his romance with Felicia. And the radio station owner (a pompous, avaricious Robert Michael Sanders) tolerates Huey\u2019s playlists only because the music rakes in the advertising dollars.\n\n\u201cMemphis\u201d tackles race more directly and honestly than, say, \u201cHairspray.\u201d The N-bomb drops a couple of times in Act I, but the story also pulls some punches. Felicia and Huey survive a vicious encounter with some racist thugs.\n\nBut it\u2019s left to the audience to imagine other slights, like venues that require \u201ccolored\u201d acts to use a back door, or whether the big-city producer actually cuts a fair deal with Felicia. (One example: The white producers famously cheated songwriters Herman Santiago and Jimmy Merchant out of royalties for \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d)\n\nIn the wake of the shootings and riots in Ferguson, Mo., it\u2019s a little hard to accept a finale that seems to tidily unite everyone through music. Indeed, the last number, \u201cSteal Your Rock N\u2019Roll\u201d suggests more than one meaning, especially when Huey can\u2019t resist grabbing the microphone for one more chance to broadcast his name.\n\nKitty Skillman Hilsabeck\u2019s crisp choreography shows off Chris Campbell\u2019s dynamic costumes to advantage, as well as the nimble cast. Mathenee Treco\u2019s gymnastic flexibility made the audience gasp.\n\nIf you see \u201cMemphis,\u201d try to attend one of the two performances featuring a post-show talkback (Sept. 19 and 24). The cast was in its last weeks of rehearsal when a white policeman killed Michael Brown , and the cast and crew members\u2019 thoughts on that confluence should be riveting.\n\nClaire Martin: 303-954-1477, cmartin@denverpost.com or twitter.com/byclairemartin\n\nMEMPHIS Book and lyrics by Joe Dipietro, music and lyrics by David Bryan, based on a concept by George W.
