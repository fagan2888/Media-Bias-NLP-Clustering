Note that it does not alter existing pension agreements. Here\u2019s how DeMaio summarizes what the \"Voter Empowerment Act of 2016\" would demand:\n\nRequire voter approval of any defined benefit pensions for new government employees;\n\nRequire voter approval of any increase in pensions for existing government employees;\n\nProhibit any taxpayer subsidy of government retirement benefits in excess of 50% of the cost \u2013 unless voters expressly approve a higher contribution, and\n\nProhibit politicians and government agencies from delaying, impeding, or challenging any voter-approved state and local ballot measures regarding compensation and retirement benefits.\n\nThe full ballot initiative may be read here (pdf). Unfortunately, last time Reed attempted to push through pension reform, Attorney General Kamala Harris gave the initiative what would could easily be seen as a very negative summary, leaving casual readers with the suggestion that it meant pensions could be eliminated. Reed challenged the description but was rejected, and thus he abandoned the effort. We\u2019ll have to see what happens this time.\n\n(Disclosure: DeMaio has previously worked with the Reason Foundation as an independent contractor on pension reform.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Citizens would have to agree to new or expanded plans", "title": "New Initiative Filed in California Puts Pensions in Voters\u2019 Hands", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/06/04/new-initiative-filed-in-california-puts", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14334522014175.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Citizens would have to agree to new or expanded plans", "title": "New Initiative Filed in California Puts Pensions in Voters\u2019 Hands", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14334522014175.jpg", "creator": "@sshackford", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-06-04T21:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/scott-shackford"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad16\"", "article_summary": "The full ballot initiative may be read here (pdf).\n(Disclosure: DeMaio has previously worked with the Reason Foundation as an independent contractor on pension reform.)\nThe way the initiative works is that voters will be giving themselves the power to vote on whether to take on future additional pension obligations.\nUnfortunately, last time Reed attempted to push through pension reform, Attorney General Kamala Harris gave the initiative what would could easily be seen as a very negative summary, leaving casual readers with the suggestion that it meant pensions could be eliminated.\nReed challenged the description but was rejected, and thus he abandoned the effort."}
