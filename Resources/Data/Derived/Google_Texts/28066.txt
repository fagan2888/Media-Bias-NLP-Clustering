There’s never a bad time for a good practical joke. The Nuggets, more than most teams, are acutely aware of this.

That’s why Randy Foye’s return on Saturday night after missing 26 straight games with a quad injury was the perfect time for one of the oldest tricks in NBA players’ books: The Fake Substitution.

Randy, you have the floor.

“Gallo said ‘Randy! Coach called you.’ So I took off running,” Foye said, a grin rising on his face. “Then coach looked at me when I ran up. He was like ‘What are you doing?’ I said, ‘You didn’t call me?’ And then I ran back to the bench and I looked and everybody was in tears (laughing).”

Classic.

“They got me,” Foye said. “I’m usually the prankster on the team. But, it was so truthful coming from Gallo, because Gallo doesn’t play around like that. So when Gallo said, ‘Go ahead Randy, coach called you,’ I sprinted. I was ready to go.”

And so, of course, Foye was extra cautious when he was actually called to sub in.

“I didn’t move until I looked and was like ‘You sure?’

“Alright.'”
