But the discovery of data \u201clost\u201d on backup tapes may expose the extent of administration guilt.\n\nWe recently noted how former White House senior economics adviser Austan Goolsbee had been identified as the official who had told reporters \u201con background\u201d that the Koch brothers \u201cdo not pay corporate income tax\u201d through their company, Koch Industries.\n\nGoolsbee could not have made his claim without access to the Kochs\u2019 private tax data, something a White House official is not supposed to have.\n\nWe\u2019ve also noted peculiarities in redacted emails provided by the IRS to Rep. Darrell Issa\u2019s House Oversight and Government Reform Committee between Sarah Hall Ingram, who served as commissioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division from 2009 to 2012, and White House officials, including health policy adviser Ellen Montz and Jeanne Lambrew, deputy assistant to the president for health policy.\n\nSome of the redactions were marked \u201c6103,\u201d referring to private taxpayer information.\n\n\u201cSo it was OK for (a) political White House to get the un-redacted version from the same entity that targeted groups who came into existence because they opposed the Affordable Care Act, but Congress can\u2019t get it?\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, pointedly asked Ingram, who went on to run the IRS office responsible for enforcing ObamaCare. \u201cThat\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, as Matthew Boyle has reported at Breitbart News, Obama\u2019s re-election campaign co-chairmen used a leaked document from the IRS to attack Mitt Romney during the 2012 election, according to the National Organization for Marriage, a targeted conservative group that opposes the president on gay marriage.\n\nNow, the Treasury Inspector General For Tax Administration (TIGTA) has announced that 30,000 of the lost emails of Lois Lerner \u2014 the person at the heart of the tax collectors\u2019 culture of corruption and author of Tea Party-targeting by the IRS \u2014 found on 744 disaster recovery tapes, include some that seem to indicate these incidents were the tip of a corruption iceberg.\n\nThis discovery came from a lawsuit by the group Cause of Action, which has sought release of all documents related to IRS targeting of conservative groups.\n\nUnder court pressure, some of the documents were scheduled to be released Dec. 1 and the rest by Dec. 15.\n\nIn an email from the Department of Justice\u2019s tax office requesting a delay in the delivery date of the formerly \u201clost\u201d documents, it noted that TIGTA \u201chas located 2,500 potentially responsive documents\u201d and needed extra time \u201cto make any necessary withholdings.\u201d\n\n\u201cPotentially responsive\u201d means they could relate to the release of private taxpayer information by the IRS to administration officials, including the White House. As Vice President Joe Biden might say, this could be a very big deal indeed.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s insistence there was not even \u201ca smidgeon of corruption\u201d at the IRS may have been spot on. There may in fact be a mountain of it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scandal: Leaking taxpayer information to the White House isn't new, just as the email shell game in the IRS fiasco no longer shocks.
