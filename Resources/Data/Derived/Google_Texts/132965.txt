SILOAM SPRINGS (KFSM) -- Benton County law enforcement agencies will be holding two safety sessions for local senior citizens this week.

The SALT Council, which stands for Seniors and Law Enforcement Together, will host two senior safety academies on Tuesday, Sept. 22 and Thursday, Sept. 24 from 1 p.m. until 5 p.m. at the Siloam Springs Senior Activity & Wellness Center.

The center is located at 750 Heritage Court in Siloam Springs.

To register, call (479) 228-0552 or email policedept@siloamsprings.com.

"This council was created decades ago to bridge the gap between law enforcement and senior citizens to really take care of them," Sgt. Mike Lira with the Benton County Sheriff's Office said. "I think in this world, in this area, really throughout the United States, seniors are targeted, they truly are, and I think it is our job and our responsibility to take care of them."
