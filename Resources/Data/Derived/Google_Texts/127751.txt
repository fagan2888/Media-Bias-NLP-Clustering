A high speed chase that started in Oklahoma City ends in Moore with two people arrested Saturday afternoon.

Police say it happened at S.E. 15th St. and S. Bryant Ave. around 2:00 p.m.

A deputy patrolling the area saw a white pickup truck blow through a stop sign. The deputy tried pulling over the driver, but that person refused and took off.

The deputy chased the suspects southbound on I-35 into Moore.

Officers from Moore, Oklahoma City, and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol were called into help with the pursuit. The suspect vehicle crashed on I-35 and S.W. 19th St., but the driver kept going westbound on S.W. 19th St.

Police say the suspect vehicle then crashed into another car at S. Telephone Rd. and S.W. 19th. The chase ended just south of S.W. 25th St. and Telephone Rd. when the suspects took off running.

Police arrested one of the suspects right away. The second suspect ran into a nearby business and was arrested around 2:20 p.m.

The driver has been identified as Ben Dodson, 21 and his passenger, Michael Mullikin, 21. Both men were booked into the Oklahoma County Jail on multiple charges including, possession of drugs, possession of drug paraphernalia, and resisting arrest.

Dodson was also booked for possession of a firearm after felony conviction, and Mullikin for carrying a loaded firearm.

No one was hurt in the chase.
