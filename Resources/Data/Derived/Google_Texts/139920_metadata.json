The Friars, who added two empty-net goals after breaking a 1-1 tie with 5:01 left, advance to their first Frozen Four since 1985.\n\nProvidence defenseman Tom Parisi scored the game-winning goal on the power play at 14:59, and in the last minute of senior Joey LaLeggia\u2019s major penalty for contact to the head. LaLeggia, the Pioneers\u2019 best player who scored their lone goal, made a big center-ice hit on Steven McParland and was ejected with 9:23 to go in a 1-1 game at the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Center.\n\nJust before the game-winning goal, DU\u2019s Evan Janssen clanged a shorthanded shot off the Friars\u2019 goal post. Providence called its timeout and scored off the ensuing offensive faceoff.\n\nPHOTOS: Denver vs. Providence in NCAA hockey tournament\n\n\u201cI was just trying to impede him from getting to the middle of the ice,\u201d LaLeggia said of McParland, who was shaken but not seriously injured. \u201cI stepped up, definitely didn\u2019t intend to hit him in the head. I don\u2019t know what the referees saw but all I know is I did not intend to hit him in the head. But I haven\u2019t seen the replay. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever got a hit to the head before.\u201d\n\nLaLeggia, a 2014 All-American who won every major individual National Collegiate Hockey Conference award for a defenseman, and was the NCHC player of the year, is expected to sign with the Edmonton Oilers this week. Oilers general manager Craig MacTavish and president Kevin Lowe were at the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible but I\u2019m extremely proud to be a Pioneer,\u201d LaLeggia said of his final college game. \u201cI can\u2019t thank the school for what they\u2019ve done for me over the last four years, and I can\u2019t thank my teammates, my brothers who I love, enough. It\u2019s a tough one to swallow but I love Denver.\n\nThe Friars (24-13-2) will join Boston University and North Dakota at the nearby TD Garden in Boston April 9-11. Denver finishes with the same record and is denied its first Frozen Four berth since winning back-to-back national titles in 2004 and 2005.\n\nSecond-year DU coach Jim Montgomery is 1-2 in the NCAA Tournament but his most recent team had the makings to win it all.\n\n\u201cReally proud of the team I was able to coach this year. From day one they gave me everything a coach could ask for, and our staff. It was a pleasure to coach,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cAnd to our seven seniors, I can\u2019t thank them enough. They won a NCHC championship (2014) and have added to the great tradition of Denver hockey. We played hard right through (the end).\u201d\n\nMontgomery did not agree with LaLeggia\u2019s penalty, and will continue to teach his defenseman to make hits in the neutral zone as a counter attack. The NCAA has cracked down on any hits that lead to head contact.\n\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re supposed to back off and let a guy come attack you, instead of angling the puck like I\u2019ve taught them,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cJoey LaLeggia did everything I asked of him on that play and unfortunately there was head contact.\u201d\n\nFreshman Tanner Jaillet finished with 20 saves for Denver. Junior Jon Gillies had 23 for Providence, the No. 4 regional seed that upset No. 1 Miami (Ohio) 7-5 on Saturday after the Pioneers beat Boston College 5-2.\n\nArnold, a junior forward and emotional leader, had his first two goals of the season against BC. \u201cAnytime you lose a game to end your season, it\u2019s hard. We played hard for 60 minutes and were attacking like Coach Montgomery said. I thought we could have done a little better job in front of Gillies. \u2026 The seven seniors made my job a lot easier, being a junior captain. I\u2019m not lying when I say I\u2019d go to war with any of those guys. Those guys are warriors.\u201d\n\nDU took control early but Providence had the two best chances of the second period. First, Friars winger Trevor Mingoia put a shot off the crossbar during a stretch DU couldn\u2019t win a faceoff. And in their ensuing power play, center Noel Acciari back-handed the puck on net from beside it, and it trickled in off Jaillet.\n\nDenver\u2019s penalty was to senior wing Larkin Jacobson, who was called for elbowing. DU outshot PC, 18-15, after two periods, but nearly all of Gillies\u2019 saves were relatively easy. Getting shots through were a problem; PC blocked 13 through 40 minutes and 24 for the game.\n\nLaLeggia scored a power-play goal midway through the third period to tie it, banking a shot off the glass and Gillies in dramatic fashion.\n\nLaLeggia is considered one of DU\u2019s best defenseman in the past 20 years.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver falls to Providence College in NCAA East Regional final", "title": "Denver falls to Providence College in NCAA East Regional final", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/29/denver-falls-to-providence-college-in-ncaa-east-regional-final/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150329__du-pcp1.jpg", "height": 467}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150329__du-pcp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-29T17:52:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T20:39:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NCAA hockey, University of Denver"}, "article_summary": "DU gave it all it had Sunday in a 4-1 loss to Providence College in the NCAA Tournament East Regional final.\nIt was a pleasure to coach,\u201d Montgomery said.\nWe played hard for 60 minutes and were attacking like Coach Montgomery said.\nPHOTOS: Denver vs. Providence in NCAA hockey tournament\u201cI was just trying to impede him from getting to the middle of the ice,\u201d LaLeggia said of McParland, who was shaken but not seriously injured.\nJust before the game-winning goal, DU\u2019s Evan Janssen clanged a shorthanded shot off the Friars\u2019 goal post."}
