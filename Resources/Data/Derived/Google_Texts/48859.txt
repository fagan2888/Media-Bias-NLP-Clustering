Karen Finney joins Media Matters

Karen Finney, the former DNC spokesperson-turned-MSNBC commentator, has joined the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America as a senior fellow and consultant, MMFA told POLITICO on Tuesday.

Finney, who left MSNBC earlier this month, "will write regular commentary pieces for Media Matters in addition to continuing her independent consultancy and other projects," according to a forthcoming news release.

"Media Matters does indispensable work exposing lies, misinformation, and vitriol from conservative media. I'm thrilled to be working with them," Finney said in a statement.

Finney formerly worked in the Clinton White House and on Hillary Clinton’s first New York Senate race and was the first African-American spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. She became an MSNBC commentator and guest host in 2009 and hosted her own weekend program from June 2013 to June 2014. She is now a freelance commentator.

"As the media looks ahead to 2016, we are excited to have Karen's voice and considerable experience contributing to that conversation," Media Matters founder David Brock said in a statement. "Her extensive background in political and communications strategy will be crucial as Media Matters continues to look for new ways to push back on misinformation from the right."

Correction: Finney is no longer an MSNBC commentator.
