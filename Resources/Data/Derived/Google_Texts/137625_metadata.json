Currently, certified nurse midwives who have their nursing degree as well as additional midwifery training, are able to practice legally in Illinois. Officials with AAP's Illinois chapter said both groups of midwives should be held to the same standards of doctor supervision.\n\nBut proponents of the bill contend there are far too few certified nurse midwives and that the certified professional midwives meet standards set by a national group.\n\nLicensing certified professional midwives would meet the rising need of women who want to deliver at home in a safe environment while putting an end to the \"black market of maternity care,\" said Michelle Breen, spokeswoman for the Coalition for Illinois Midwifery.\n\n\"We have a home-birth maternity care crisis in Illinois,\" said Breen, who estimated that 30 states license certified professional midwives.\n\nThe debate is not new, with different versions of the bill making their way to Springfield through the years.\n\nMedical groups, including AAP's Illinois chapter and the Illinois State Medical Society, have opposed the bill.\n\nDr. Barbara Bayldon, president of the executive committee of the AAP's Illinois chapter, said the primary concern with this version of the proposed legislation is that it does not outline a formal collaboration between certified professional midwives and doctors.\n\n\"As pediatricians, we know firsthand that even a routine birth can unexpectedly become complicated putting both the infant and mother in danger,\" Bayldon said in a statement. \"Physicians with experience in identifying high risk births, such as obstetricians, need to be an integral part of the midwifery team through a written collaborative practice agreement to provide guidance and support to (certified professional midwives) when needed to reach the mutual goal of a healthy birth, healthy mother and healthy infant.\"\n\ndeldeib@tribune.com\n\nTwitter @deldeib", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Group wants midwives to be able to practice without nursing degrees", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Facing opposition to a bill that would allow more midwives to practice legally in Illinois, advocates on Tuesday staged a protest complete with colorful signs, baby carriers and cozy blankets.", "title": "Group wants midwives to be able to practice without nursing degrees", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-illinois-midwife-bill-met-20160412-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-570d80ee/turbine/ct-illinois-midwife-bill-met-20160412", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp01.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "American Academy of Pediatrics, Illinois State Medical Society, Coalition for Illinois Midwifery, Home Birth Safety Act, certified professional midwives", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/86530667", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-04-12", "Description": "Facing opposition to a bill that would allow more midwives to practice legally in Illinois, advocates on Tuesday staged a protest.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "American Academy of Pediatrics, Illinois State Medical Society, Coalition for Illinois Midwifery, Home Birth Safety Act, certified professional midwives"}, "article_summary": "But proponents of the bill contend there are far too few certified nurse midwives and that the certified professional midwives meet standards set by a national group.\nOfficials with AAP's Illinois chapter said both groups of midwives should be held to the same standards of doctor supervision.\nCurrently, certified nurse midwives who have their nursing degree as well as additional midwifery training, are able to practice legally in Illinois.\n\"We have a home-birth maternity care crisis in Illinois,\" said Breen, who estimated that 30 states license certified professional midwives.\nMedical groups, including AAP's Illinois chapter and the Illinois State Medical Society, have opposed the bill."}
