No candidate has challenged the normalized, covert operations of American Empire. No candidate has rethought the basic assumptions underlying the supremacy of U.S. military power.\n\nAnd no candidate has discussed the continuities between George W. Bush\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s war on terror \u2014 or proposed any meaningful alternative.\n\nGiven a political climate of increasing jingoism and hostility, it\u2019s not surprising that no presidential candidate has felt comfortable advocating a cohesive anti-war position. Rightly or wrongly, the November attacks in Paris confirmed in the eyes of many Americans that President Obama\u2019s airstrikes against the Islamic State \u2014 otherwise known as Daesh, ISIL, or ISIS (pick your acronym) \u2014 have been inadequate.\n\nThere\u2019s a great case to be made that military intervention in Iraq and Syria is only fueling the ISIS crisis. But more fundamentally, there\u2019s a huge opening to critique the economic foundations of America\u2019s wars \u2014 one that fits perfectly with the populist anger fueling the rise of Bernie Sanders.\n\nFrom Right to Left\n\nFirst, a word on the right.\n\nOn the right, well, we\u2019ve entered into what Rod Sterling called the Fifth Dimension, the Twilight Zone of 1950s America \u2014 where Donald Trump\u2019s outrageous racism and xenophobia are only matched by Ben Carson\u2019s absurd myopia (remember, this candidate claimed the Affordable Care Act was the worst thing since slavery). The deep-seated racial prejudice, sexism, and homophobia of the Republican Party are unraveling the conservative establishment from within.\n\nSo I wouldn\u2019t expect anything substantive from the war party on Daesh besides calls for re-militarization, along with mocking provocations about Obama\u2019s alleged weakness. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing with increasingly bad policy proposals. For example, Republican Iowa caucus winner Ted Cruz had the vacuous idea of \u201ccarpet bombing Daesh\u201d \u2014 a plan, if we can call it that, which has been categorically dismissed by Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland as inconsistent with American values as well as strategically inept. Others have called it a war crime.\n\nKentucky senator Rand Paul, before recently dropping out, did speak about some of the pitfalls of the war machine with his isolationist strand of foreign policy. But like most libertarians, he completely avoided any discussion of the harder questions about American power \u2014 what ethical engagement looks like, how America\u2019s global empire of military bases might be dismantled, and especially what the role of American capital in foreign policy should be. That\u2019s the invariable weakness of any libertarian anti-war position.\n\nOn the left, Bernie Sanders has fumbled the Daesh question during the Democratic debates because he can\u2019t fundamentally distinguish himself from Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. His form of argumentation goes something like this: First carefully deflect Clinton\u2019s criticism by discussing her 2002 endorsement of the Iraq War, and then refocus the debate on domestic military concerns. His work on veterans\u2019 issues in Congress becomes a substitute for astute commentary on the Middle East.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Sanders is outmatched on foreign policy, even by his own admission. But he doesn\u2019t need to be.\n\nCapitalism and American Empire\n\nSanders could win foreign policy debates by challenging the foundation of American Empire.\n\nBill Williams had something to say about that in his seminal book The Tragedy of American Diplomacy, where he traced the emergence of American Empire to Secretary of State John Hay\u2019s \u201cOpen Doors Notes\u201d in 1899 and 1900. If Sanders read and followed Williams\u2019s lead, he\u2019d realize that at its core the American Empire runs on commercial expansion. This was the key assumption animating the Open Door Notes, which became the Open Door Policy.\n\nWilliams argued that the Open Door Policy relied on two fundamental beliefs: (1) that American businesses would out-compete foreign companies given the free flow of direct investment, which was and is a form of Americanization; and (2) that American corporate capitalism would continuously expand the world\u2019s economic pie and thereby secure world peace.\n\nThe Open Door Policy, Williams argued, guided American foreign relations over the course of the 20th century, turning military power into an agent of economic expansion. The two world wars in this sense resulted from the Open Door Policy working too well \u2014 that is, Japan and Germany realizing that they were being out-competed and marginalized in world affairs. Elsewhere, James Livingston has usefully applied Williams\u2019s understanding of the Open Door Policy to explain President Obama\u2019s pivot to Iran.\n\nWhy does all this matter for Sanders?\n\nBernie recognizes that American capitalism is defunct: It stopped serving the American people in 1973, when wages flatlined even as productivity soared. Yet he doesn\u2019t incorporate this rudimentary critique of capitalism to explicate American foreign policy. Why not?\n\nOil and the Middle East\n\nUnderlying all the problems the United States faces in the Middle East is the black tar of modernity: oil.\n\nIt\u2019s the reason we\u2019ve spent $7.3 trillion since 1976 patrolling the oceans, invading countries, and toppling leaders. That reliance on oil \u2014 along with complex Cold War politics and ideological support for Israel \u2014 put U.S. foreign policy on a collision course with the Muslim world. Since 1980, Andrew Bacevich calculates, the U.S. has invaded, bombed, and occupied 14 Islamic countries.\n\nSeen this way, the contemporary problems of U.S. foreign policy are not political. They\u2019re economic. The ideology of corporate capitalism is to blame.\n\nIn a sense, the Open Door Policy has worked too well again \u2014 American corporations have become too powerful and parasitic as multinational corporate oil interests guide, not follow, American foreign policy. In other words, Sanders loses these foreign policy debates because he doesn\u2019t challenge the foundation of American Empire; he doesn\u2019t represent a coherent anti-war position.\n\nThe Meaning of \u201cAnti-War\u201d\n\nWhat does it mean to be anti-war, anyway? To be anti-war isn\u2019t to be against engagement, and it\u2019s certainly not uncritical pacifism. It\u2019s a way of thinking that demands a paradigm shift away from airstrikes, military advisers, and covert operations and toward understanding the systemic issues underlying American foreign policy.\n\nIt\u2019s what Bill Williams started half a century ago when he reinvented the field of American diplomatic history.\n\nA comprehensive anti-war position looks at Daesh as the logical conclusion of the worst failures of global capitalism \u2014 namely the global lack of opportunity in the marketplace that imprisons and marginalizes people, especially young Muslim men. Enshrouded with gluttonous wealth \u2014 and often supporting friendly neoliberal dictatorships that quash domestic opposition \u2014 Western countries become the symbol to destroy in order to reclaim agency against American and Western modernity. When Thomas Piketty blamed Daesh on burgeoning inequality in the Arab world, he was right.\n\nThe problem comes into clearer focus when it\u2019s wed to military power. Then the dominant world players start to look like their old colonial archetypes, with their military bases around the world (662 in 38 countries for the United States, and that\u2019s just counting the big ones) and neoliberal trade policies that sap wealth, resources, and people from the so-called Third World.\n\nMeanwhile at home, war culture becomes the source and product of a permanent war economy \u2014 or military capitalism \u2014 from the video games Americans play to the Jack Bauer TV shows they watch.\n\nAnti-war Engagement\n\nBut defending an anti-war platform doesn\u2019t mean saying the United States can\u2019t lead the world. If anything, the United States is in the best position of any country to make lasting changes.\n\nIt could start by restructuring the United Nations so that the world body becomes more than simply a pawn of Washington\u2019s interests or a resolution to be singlehandedly blocked. Furthermore, an anti-war America could use its dominant position to globally redistribute wealth through more equitable trade policies and a global minimum wage. It could finally curtail the bloated $46 billion it collects from foreign arms sales each year.\n\nAnd Bernie Sanders can lead the way. His domestic critique of capitalism needs global awareness: He can and should explain America\u2019s current military adventurism in the Middle East as an artifact of its oil addiction and a product of corporate capitalism. If he\u2019s got the guts to say it out loud, Sanders could very well be the anti-war leader this country needs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's a huge opening to critique the economic foundations of America's wars \u2014 one that fits perfectly with the populist anger fueling the rise of Bernie Sanders.", "og": {"site_name": "Foreign Policy In Focus", "description": "There's a huge opening to critique the economic foundations of America's wars \u2014 one that fits perfectly with the populist anger fueling the rise of Bernie Sanders.", "title": "The Anti-War Position Bernie Sanders Can Represent - FPIF", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://fpif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/funding-war-lords-military-capitalism1.jpg", "height": 683}, "url": "http://fpif.org/anti-war-position-bernie-sanders-can-represent/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's a huge opening to critique the economic foundations of America's wars \u2014 one that fits perfectly with the populist anger fueling the rise of Bernie Sanders.", "creator": "@FPIF", "image": "http://fpif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/funding-war-lords-military-capitalism1.jpg", "title": "The Anti-War Position Bernie Sanders Can Represent - FPIF", "site": "@FPIF", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "robots": "noodp", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"admins": 1678676594}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fpif.org/wp-content/themes/fpif/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Foreign-Policy-In-Focus/126648970682757", "section": "Democracy & Governance", "tag": "United Nations", "published_time": "2016-02-22T08:42:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5fd3\"", "article_summary": "This was the key assumption animating the Open Door Notes, which became the Open Door Policy.\nIn other words, Sanders loses these foreign policy debates because he doesn\u2019t challenge the foundation of American Empire; he doesn\u2019t represent a coherent anti-war position.\nBernie recognizes that American capitalism is defunct: It stopped serving the American people in 1973, when wages flatlined even as productivity soared.\nElsewhere, James Livingston has usefully applied Williams\u2019s understanding of the Open Door Policy to explain President Obama\u2019s pivot to Iran.\nIt\u2019s clear that Sanders is outmatched on foreign policy, even by his own admission."}
