Burwell, cutting off certain payments to insurers under the health law, insurers would face a major adjustment and have to hike premiums, but government subsidies would increase to help make up the difference and the system would likely not face major negative consequences.\n\nThe House is challenging ObamaCare\u2019s \u201ccost sharing reductions,\u201d which are payments to insurers to reimburse them for picking up more of the cost for lower-income ObamaCare enrollees. Even if the House wins the lawsuit, insurers would still be mandated to give extra help to lower-income people, they would just no longer get reimbursed by the government for doing so.\n\nTherefore, the Urban study projects that insurers would hike premiums to make up the lost money. However, a corresponding increase in government subsidies would shield people from paying the cost of these higher premiums.\n\nIn fact, the study projects that there would be some benefits in the eyes of ObamaCare supporters from a ruling for the Republicans.\n\nThe study projects that the premium increases would largely come on \u201csilver\u201d-level insurance plans, but the subsidies would be going up for all plans. Therefore, the study projects that 700,000 people who previously did not enroll in ObamaCare coverage because they weren\u2019t getting enough financial help would now be getting a better deal and could enroll in high quality \u201cgold\u201d plans.\n\nIn other words, the court ruling could have the unintended effect of increasing financial assistance under the law. The study projects that 400,000 fewer people would be uninsured as a result.\n\nThe main losers from a ruling, the study suggests, would be insurers, who would face an upheaval, and the government, which would have to pay out $47 billion more over ten years in higher subsidies to make up for the higher premiums.\n\nBut overall, the stakes are not incredibly high, said Linda Blumberg, one of the authors of the study.\n\n\u201cThis is not a case that raises the same kind of specter of undermining the main tenets of the law that King v. Burwell did,\u201d Blumberg said, referring to a Supreme Court case that could have crippled the law last year.\n\nShe said she wasn't sure what the point of the lawsuit was, since that the study indicates it would not have a major negative or positive effect on ObamaCare but would cause a disruption as the marketplace adjusts to the new rules.\n\n\u201cYou're risking some significant disruption with no real gain, from my perspective, on either side,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, she said that while the study projects no major long-term effects, the disruption of cutting off the cost-sharing reductions could have unforeseen consequences, especially if it was not delayed to give insurers time to adapt.\n\nInsurers, for example, could just get fed up with participating in the ObamaCare marketplaces.\n\n\u201cInsurers might get tired of this constant changing of the rules and uncertainty and court cases,\u201d she said.\n\nRepublicans say that the lawsuit is needed to check President Obama's executive overreach. They argue in the case that Obama overstepped his constitutional powers by making the cost sharing reduction payments even though Congress did not appropriate the money.\n\nThe administration counters that it did not need a yearly appropriation from Congress because the funds were permanently appropriated under ObamaCare.\n\nThe case is making its way through U.S. District Court in Washington. A ruling in that lower court could come in the middle of this year, though the ruling is expected to be appealed either way.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The study finds that it would not cripple the law as a whole, though.", "description": "The study finds that it would not cripple the law as a whole, though.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The study finds that it would not cripple the law as a whole, though.", "title": "Study: GOP win in ObamaCare suit would hike spending", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/267084-study-gop-win-in-obamacare-suit-would-hike-spending", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamacare101615_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/267084-study-gop-win-in-obamacare-suit-would-hike-spending", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-27T03:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, King v.
