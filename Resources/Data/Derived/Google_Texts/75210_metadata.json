People learn from TV,\" says Marty Kaplan, the director of the Norman Lear Center. \"Even if they know it is fiction, even if they know if writers can make stuff up, especially in the realm of medicine and public health, if a doctor says something to a patient, people tend to think that someone has checked that, that it\u2019s true,\u201d Kaplan says.\n\nKaplan\u2019s group works to make sure that at least some of what comes out of doctors' mouths is real, or at least real-ish. Hollywood Health & Society has worked with nearly 100 TV shows -- everything from \"Mad Men\" to \"Desperate Housewives\" to \"Dr. Vegas\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful.\" The Center has access to the megaphone that is Hollywood.\n\nAnd that\u2019s appealing to The California Endowment, which gave the $500,000 grant. Hollywood Health & Society will reach out to TV writers and editors says Daniel Zingale, Senior V.P. of Healthy California at The California Endowment. \u201cThey\u2019ll be giving them content, storylines, information, so that people watching those programs will learn about Obamacare and useful information about how to get enrolled.\u201d\n\nYou might think this this sounds like propaganda and politics and terrible television. But, it doesn\u2019t have to be any of those, says Neal Baer, executive producer of \"Under the Dome\" and former writer for \"ER\" and \"Law and Order SVU.\" \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between actors talking about what their political views are and a television show taking seriously all the strands of the conflict,\u201d says Baer.\n\nThe health insurance law takes away a few of writers\u2019 favorite plotlines, like the evil insurance company that denies coverage. But it\u2019ll add others -- good and bad. \u201cAlways what\u2019s important is to explain the story through the characters and what the characters are going through,\u201d says Baer, \u201cnot just do a lesson in what the Affordable Care Act is.\u201d\n\nBaer thinks our politicians have failed to teach that lesson, failed to tell stories that help us understand. Which sets up a political drama that may also become fodder for TV writers.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this online story misstated the amount of the grant to the Hollywood Health & Society. It is $500,000.
