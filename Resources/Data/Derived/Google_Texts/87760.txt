COEUR D’ALENE, Idaho (AP) - Hydroplanes won’t be racing on Lake Coeur d’Alene again this summer. The race organizer has canceled for the third year in a row because of a lack of sponsorships.

The Coeur d’Alene Press reports (http://is.gd/VMWkFf ) the general manager of the Coeur d’Alene Silver Cup Unlimited Hydroplane race is working toward hosting races in 2017.

Keith Allen says he needs $300,000 in sponsorships before he can launch the next races. Only about $100,000 in pledges have been secured.

This year’s race had been tentatively planned for Silver Beach on the east side of the lake for mid-July.
