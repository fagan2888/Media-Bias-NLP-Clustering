Americans for Prosperity, the powerful conservative group backed by brothers David and Charles Koch, on Tuesday announced a $1.4 million ad buy in North Carolina attacking Sen. Kay Hagan's support of the 2010 health care law.

The group released spots against Hagan and also Rep. Nick J. Rahall II, D-WVa., who is facing a competitive re-election bid . The ads can be viewed here and here .

“Families in North Carolina and West Virginia are suffering from the many consequences of ObamaCare, which include cancelled plans, lost access to doctors, and rising costs. Kay Hagan and Nick Rahall have chosen to stand with President Obama, instead of the American people. They must be held accountable for supporting a law that has brought so much hardship to their constituents," AFP President Tim Phillips said in a statement.

The Hagan ad features a woman looking straight into the camera, talking in soft tones and concluding that "Obamacare doesn't work" and that health care should not be political, never mind that she is saying so in a political ad.

The Rahall spot, which the group said was released "to accompany the launch of Americans for Prosperity’s newest state chapter in West Virginia," is more traditional, with video and audio of both Obama and Rahall saying that Americans who liked their health care policies could maintain them after the law was enacted.

The North Carolina Senate race is rated Tossup/Tilts Democratic by Rothenberg Political Report. Rahall's race is rated Leans Democratic .
