In addition, the would-be spies will demand \"exceptional access\" to data and communications by mandating the installation of \"backdoors\" in the products and services of telecommunications and data companies.\n\nFortunately, a group of prominent technologists have just released their counter-report, \"Keys Under the Doormat: Mandating Insecurity by Requiring Government Access to All Data and Communications,\" that explains why this is a stupidly terrible idea. As the New York Times reports, federal government fears of \"going dark\" do ...\n\n...not justify putting the world\u2019s digital communications at risk. Given the inherent vulnerabilities of the Internet, they argued, reducing encryption is not an option. Handing governments a key to encrypted communications would also require an extraordinary degree of trust. With government agency breaches now the norm \u2014 most recently at the United States Office of Personnel Management, the State Department and the White House \u2014 the security specialists said authorities cannot be trusted to keep such keys safe from hackers and criminals. They added that if the United States and Britain mandated backdoor keys to communications, it would spur China and other governments in foreign markets to do the same.\n\nThe code specialists in their report note:\n\nThere are three general problems. First, providing exceptional access to communications would force a U-turn from the best practices now being deployed to make the Internet more secure. These practices include forward secrecy\u2014 where decryption keys are deleted immediately after use, so that stealing the encryption key used by a communications server would not compromise earlier or later communications. A related technique, authenticated encryption, uses the same temporary key to guarantee confidentiality and to verify that the message has not been forged or tampered with. Second, building in exceptional access would substantially increase system complexity. Security researchers inside and outside government agree that complexity is the enemy of security \u2014 every new feature can interact with others to create vulnerabilities. ... Third, exceptional access would create concentrated targets that could attract bad actors. Security credentials that unlock the data would have to be retained by the platform provider, law enforcement agencies, or some other trusted third party. If law enforcement\u2019s keys guaranteed access to everything, an attacker who gained access to these keys would enjoy the same privilege. ... Recent attacks on the United States Government Office of Personnel Management (OPM) show how much harm can arise when many organizations rely on a single institution that itself has security vulnerabilities.\n\nThey also observe that even if users could trust the U.S. government to protect and respect the privacy and free speech rights of citizens, the same cannot be said of other governments (China?, Russia?, Iran?) who would also demand access to communications of people they wish to watch, e.g., political dissidents and journalists.\n\n\u201cSuch access will open doors through which criminals and malicious nation-states can attack the very individuals law enforcement seeks to defend,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe costs would be substantial, the damage to innovation severe, and the consequences to economic growth hard to predict. The costs to the developed countries\u2019 soft power and to our moral authority would also be considerable.\u201d\n\nAs cryptologist and co-author of the new report Bruce Schneier said in 2013 at the Cato Institute's conference on NSA surveillance:\n\n\u201cA secure Internet is in everyone\u2019s interests. We are all better off if no one can do this kind of bulk surveillance. Fundamentally, security is more important than surveillance.\u201d\n\nCorrect then and correct now.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Experts oppose government mandated backdoors and urge widespread encryption to increase Internet security for all.", "title": "Encryption is Vital to Protecting Internet Security: New Report Opposes Government Mandated \"Backdoors\"", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/07/07/encryption-is-vital-to-protecting-intern", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14362951871154.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14362951871154.jpg", "title": "Encryption is Vital to Protecting Internet Security: New Report Opposes Government Mandated \"Backdoors\"", "description": "Experts oppose government mandated backdoors and urge widespread encryption to increase Internet security for all.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Internet", "published_time": "2015-07-07T19:41:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9c6\"", "article_summary": "First, providing exceptional access to communications would force a U-turn from the best practices now being deployed to make the Internet more secure.\n...
