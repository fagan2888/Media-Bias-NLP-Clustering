After five minutes, the surfaces in one part of a hospital room are completely disinfected, thanks to a robot named Max.\n\nIt sounds like something out of a science fiction movie. In fact, Max sort of looks like R2D2\u2019s bulkier, germophobic cousin. It\u2019s one of two robots (the other is named \u201cZappy\u201d) recently purchased by St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital in Belleville to combat \u201csuperbugs,\u201d a term for bacteria that have evolved to be resistant to antibiotics.\n\nMax and Zappy use a xenon lamp to send ultraviolent rays throughout a room. When the light hits bacteria, viruses and spores, it damages their DNA so badly they can no longer replicate. According to the robot\u2019s supplier, San Antonio-based Xenex, 99.6 percent of these microorganisms die in the process. That snags some of the more determined superbugs, like clostridium difficile, that wouldn\u2019t be washed away during a normal cleaning.\n\n\u201cWe originally saw this in Russia, [where xenon bulbs were] being used to disinfect the air for (tuberculosis),\u201d said Rachael Sparks, a Xenex technical director who visited Belleville on Tuesday. \u201cWe need to focus not just on hand hygiene, and not just antibiotic stewardship, but also cleaning better and being more thorough in our cleaning.\u201d\n\nSuperbugs tend to thrive in places like hospitals, where they become particularly dangerous, said Gautam Dantas, who leads a superbug research lab at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re potentially immuno-compromised, one of these bugs that\u2019s living on a surface or living in a ventilator could jump into you and, in some cases, prove lethal,\u201d Dantas said.\n\nThrough the Affordable Care Act, hospitals now have a financial incentive to reduce hospital-acquired infections, and stopping superbugs is a big part of that. A big piece, Dantas said, is prevention, but it\u2019s important to consider what happens to the bugs they don\u2019t kill.\n\n\u201cThat 0.001 percent that\u2019s remaining can still be tens of thousands of bacterial cells. What\u2019s the property you\u2019re enriching for for those bugs that survive the treatment?\u201d Dantas said.\n\nAudio: Gautam Dantas explains why superbugs are getting harder to fight.\n\nThe robots cost $79,000 each and were paid for by the foundation for St. Elizabeth\u2019s parent network, HSHS. They disinfect patient rooms and surgical areas after they\u2019ve been cleaned and have been on rotation throughout the hospital since May. Spokespeople for the hospital said they\u2019re still crunching the numbers for whether they\u2019ve seen a substantial reduction in hospital-acquired infections since they started using the robots.\n\nFollow Durrie on Twitter: @durrieB.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health, Science, Environment", "description": "A whirr, a few beeps and an intense, sustained flash of light.
