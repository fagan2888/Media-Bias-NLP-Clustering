That group is also the least likely to make retirement contributions, often because they\u2019re strapped after making their student loan payments.\n\nAmong workers who would like to see student loan repayment assistance at work, nearly two-thirds say that they\u2019d use the money to make additional principal payments on their loans, rather than to offset their monthly payments.
