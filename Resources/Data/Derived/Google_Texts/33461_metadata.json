The term \u201cbare minimum,\u201d after all, implies that some reasonable threshold has been reached, a pressing need satisfied.\n\nBut don\u2019t blame federal lawmakers. For once, they aren\u2019t the ones trampling over the District\u2019s sovereignty and forcing senseless policies on the city. In this case, it\u2019s 12 members of the D.C. Council who are doing so \u2014 with the foolishness led by chairman Phil Mendelson (D). Last year, they voted to oppose not only the mere possibility of relatively small changes to the Height Act but also a process that would put the decision about changing height restrictions in the hands of city leaders, rather than leaving the call to federal authorities. The council\u2019s dereliction of sense left Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), the best friend the city seems to have on this issue, with few options but the one his committee endorsed.\n\nInstead of lifting any of the height limits that have restrained the city since 1910, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is proposing merely to ease restrictions on what property owners can put on their roofs. Current regulations allow machinery for elevators or ventilation systems; the new rule would allow penthouse apartments in that space, as long as they aren\u2019t obtrusive. The reform might not add up to much new development, since the demand among property owners for penthouses is likely to be limited.\n\nThe Height Act is only one example, though a glaring one, of the irrational policies that restrain sensible growth in Washington. The National Capital Planning Commission points out that, federal height rules or no, there would be opportunities for creating a denser, more vibrant city if local zoning regulators would allow flexibility, particularly around major public transportation corridors. Simplifying the punitively complex process that developers must go through to get building approvals is also crucial.\n\nWashington is changing, a process that is not always easy or comfortable, but one that is on balance very good. Among the side effects of the welcome revitalization of the urban core have been staggering housing costs, pricing all sorts of people out of homes and apartments and unnecessarily taxing the quality of life of those who decide to pay up. Affordable housing policies can only do so much to alleviate the pressure, and they don\u2019t help middle-income residents. The obvious answer is to let the city become denser, with care to ensure that it is walkable and bikeable, allowing more people to live and work where and how they want to. With more supply of square footage, upward pressure supporting outrageous housing and office costs will abate. Neither foggy-eyed nostalgia for a skyline frozen in 1910 nor cynical NIMBYism can justify opposing policies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the District changes, so must its policies restraining smart growth.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "As the District changes, so must its policies restraining smart growth.", "title": "As D.C. changes, so must its policies restraining smart growth", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/as-dc-changes-so-must-its-policies-restraining-smart-growth/2014/03/23/bae2b40e-ae16-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/23/Editorial-Opinion/Images/2013-04-25T203955Z_01_TOR901_RTRIDSP_3_USA-REALESTATE-WASHINGTON-2112.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "postopinions"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/as-dc-changes-so-must-its-policies-restraining-smart-growth/2014/03/23/bae2b40e-ae16-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "d.c. height act, height act, dc skyline, darrell issa dc height, dc height restrictions, dc growth, dc density", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions"}, "eomportal-uuid": "bae2b40e-ae16-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "d.c. height act, height act, dc skyline, darrell issa dc height, dc height restrictions, dc growth, dc density"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd10\"", "article_summary": "Affordable housing policies can only do so much to alleviate the pressure, and they don\u2019t help middle-income residents.\nThe Height Act is only one example, though a glaring one, of the irrational policies that restrain sensible growth in Washington.\nFor once, they aren\u2019t the ones trampling over the District\u2019s sovereignty and forcing senseless policies on the city.\nNeither foggy-eyed nostalgia for a skyline frozen in 1910 nor cynical NIMBYism can justify opposing policies.\nIn this case, it\u2019s 12 members of the D.C.
