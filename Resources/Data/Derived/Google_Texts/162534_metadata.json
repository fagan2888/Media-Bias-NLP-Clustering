Prosecutors allege that Rowland conspired to hide work for a two political campaigns by trying to get paid through a private business. In one case, he succeeded.\n\n\"What was he getting paid for? What was he getting paid for?\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Mattei asked repeatedly. \"Ladies and gentlemen, you know what happened here. Use your common sense. That\u2019s what this is all about. You know what happened here. Mr. Rowland was selling one thing: his ability to get someone elected.\"\n\nBecause it couldn\u2019t be publicly known, Mattei said, \"that\u2019s why he was paid in secret.\u201d\n\nReid Weingarten, Rowland\u2019s attorney, took the opposite approach. His client was \u201clarger than life,\u201d an \u201c8,000 pound gorilla\u201d whose actions it was impossible to keep secret. And, more importantly, Weingarten said the campaign work Rowland did for Lisa Wilson-Foley in 2012 was strictly volunteer, while the work for which he got paid by her husband Brian Foley was legitimate, real-deal consulting.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that Brian Foley wanted him at the campaign helping Lisa [Wilson-Foley],\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cBut he can work for Apple and do real work at the same time.\u201d\n\n\"Mr. Rowland was selling one thing: his ability to get someone elected,\" argued prosecutor Christopher Mattei.\n\nThe morning started off with lengthy instruction from Judge Janet Bond Arterton. \u201cAs members of the jury, you are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts,\u201d she told jurors as Rowland, members of his family, and a packed courtroom listened.\n\nThe judge instructed the jury on the conspiracy charges he faces. She told the jury that the conspiracy didn\u2019t have to be expressly discussed or agreed upon. \"In the context of conspiracy cases, actions often speak louder than words,\" she said.\n\nThe prosecution made its closing arguments first. In them, Mattei, the prosecutor, told the jury that this case was about basic civics.\n\n\"This is a case that goes to the very heart of the most basic right we have as American citizens, and that's the right to vote,\" Mattei told jurors. In both 2010 and 2010 and an earlier election, he said, Rowland tried to deprive voters of the information they need to exercise that crucial right by hiding his campaign work.\n\nHis most valuable asset was his political experience and expertise, his strategic mind, and his knowledge of the district, Mattei said. Because of his prior federal conviction, \"Mr. Rowland couldn\u2019t sell his most valuable asset in the open market,\" Mattei told jurors. \"But if he could keep it hidden, well, then, maybe he could. That\u2019s what he tried to do in 2010 and 2012.\"\n\n#2867996 / gettyimages.com\n\nRowland's attorney asked for a verdict of not guilty on all counts, saying, \"It was John trying to work, and that\u2019s not a crime.\"\n\nBy faking contracts to hide his campaign work, Mattei said, Rowland was trying to ensure that \u201cthe public would never know that Mr. Rowland was steering these campaigns with an invisible hand. That\u2019s what this case is about.\u201d\n\nThe government also alleges that Rowland broke the law by making false entries in a contract with Greenberg, who is now running again for that same congressional seat. Rowland wanted to be paid through Greenberg\u2019s animal shelter for work on the campaign.\n\nDuring trial, Greenberg told the court that he never entered into the agreement, because he thought it was illegal. He also thought it was expensive because Rowland wanted $35,000 a month.\n\n\"This whole thing is a sham, because who is going to pay somebody $35,000 a month to raise a little money for an animal shelter? Please,\" Mattei said during closing arguments. \"Mr. Rowland is proposing to be paid over the course of this contract three quarters of a million dollars. To raise money for an animal shelter? Or to capitalize on his most valuable asset: his political expertise?\"\n\nMattei then walked through, day-by-day, event-by-event, each of the two campaigns. With Greenberg\u2019s campaign, Mattei said witnesses characterized the former governor as \"begging\" for work and \"desperate.\"\n\nCheck out our newest TV ad.

The email volume shot through the roof. The meetings with staff went from almost none to almost daily.\n\nMeanwhile, Mattei said, the work Rowland did for Brian Foley\u2019s nursing home business was negligible.\n\nThe Defense Presents Its Case\n\nAfter lunch, Reid Weingarten, Rowland\u2019s attorney, addressed the jury. He pressed a very simple point: Rowland could do two things at once.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that Brian Foley wanted him at the campaign helping Lisa [Wilson-Foley],\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cBut he can work for Apple and do real work at the same time.\u201d\n\nWeingarten brought up various emails between Rowland and people at Apple. In one email, Brian Foley and executive Brian Bedard talk about scheduling a meeting with Rowland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like, \u2018Oh my god, do we have to deal with this phony? Do we have to deal with this fake anymore?\u2019\u201d Weingarten said, imagining what Bedard could have been thinking. \u201cThat\u2019s not what this contract says, and you know that\u2019s not what he thought. ...When you look through the emails, and you see substantive information being exchanged, ask yourself, \u2018Why would they be doing it if this was all a fake?\u201d\n\nThe same, Weingarten said, was true with Rowland\u2019s emails about helping the company.\n\n\u201cAsk yourself this. If this is a sham, all fake, all b.s., why are they bothering sending information back and forth about the guts and substance of their business?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd the only explanation is there was a bonafide, legitimate interest on Apple\u2019s part for him to be kept up to speed on the issues.\u201d\n\nRowland's attorney said Brian Foley was a liar who set out to have Rowland do real work at Apple. He said once federal prosecutors realized Foley had potentially broken laws by funneling money to his wife's campaign, they had him in a bind.\n\nWeingarten also took aim at Brian Foley himself. First, he said he was controlling and manipulative. \u201cInteresting guy, puppet master, completely capable of doing whatever he thinks he wants to do,\u201d Weingarten said.\n\nMore to the point, Weingarten said Foley was a liar. In fact, he said, Foley set out to have Rowland do real work at Apple, but once federal prosecutors realized that he had potentially broken various campaign finance laws by funneling money to his wife\u2019s campaign through friends, family, and employees, they had him in a bind. Weingarten said that\u2019s when Foley \u201cflipped.\u201d\n\nWhen he did, Foley became a pawn of the government, Weingarten said. \u201cHe was so scripted,\u201d he said. \u201cHe spent more time with prosecutors than a trained seal spends with a trainer before he goes on the show. He was so scripted.\u201d\n\nRowland\u2019s own pitch for Lisa Wilson-Foley, Weingarten said \u2013 pages of handwritten notes on her campaign and his political assets \u2013 was proof that he wasn\u2019t trying to hide anything.\n\n\"He\u2019s larger than life,\" Weingarten said. \"You love him or hate him. That\u2019s just the deal. He has phenomenal value politically, and there are huge down sides... he can\u2019t make a move in Connecticut without everybody knowing it. That\u2019s just the truth. The idea that he\u2019s Mr. Stealth, and he goes from one campaign to another to sneak gigs, is completely belied by this.\"\n\nAgain, he said Rowland is a guy you can\u2019t hide.\n\n\u201cAgain, this idea that you\u2019re hiding John Rowland absolutely makes no sense,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cAnd the idea that you\u2019re going to hide it through a contract... runs into reality, and it\u2019s the reality of John Rowland.\u201d\n\nAs he wrapped up, Weingarten told jurors that he hopes they don\u2019t hold the nastiness of politics against Rowland. \u201cThis is hardcore fighting, right-wing, hardcore stuff, and I\u2019m guessing not everyone in the courtroom supports this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s politics, and some of you may find it hideous. But that\u2019s not this case.\u201d\n\nIn the end, he said the government hadn\u2019t proven its case. What Rowland did wasn\u2019t criminal. It was just a guy trying to get by.\n\n\u201cIt was John trying to work,\u201d Weingarten said, \u201cand that\u2019s not a crime.\u201d He asked for a verdict of not guilty on all counts.\n\nProsecutor Christopher Mattei had a few minutes to respond.\n\n\"This is just politics, that\u2019s what he says,\" Mattei said, recalling Weingarten\u2019s closing. \"This isn\u2019t politics. This is about hiding from the public [what] the public has a right to know... That\u2019s not politics. That\u2019s a crime.\"\n\nThe jurors are deliberating.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Closing arguments ended on Thursday afternoon in the federal criminal trial of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, and now the case is in the hands", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/closing-arguments-end-rowland-trial-jury-begins-deliberation", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201409/rowland_court.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Closing arguments ended on Thursday afternoon in the federal criminal trial of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, and now the case is in the hands", "title": "Closing Arguments End in Rowland Trial; Jury Begins Deliberation"}, "story_id": 349523780, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jeffcohenwnpr"}, "author": "Jeff Cohen, Tucker Ives, Heather Brandon", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Closing Arguments End in Rowland Trial; Jury Begins Deliberation"}, "nid": 28715, "datePublished": "2014-09-18", "keywords": "corruption, The Daily, courts, Connecticut, ethics, governors", "wordCount": 2029, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfdd4\"", "article_summary": "Because of his prior federal conviction, \"Mr. Rowland couldn\u2019t sell his most valuable asset in the open market,\" Mattei told jurors.\nIn one email, Brian Foley and executive Brian Bedard talk about scheduling a meeting with Rowland.\nBy faking contracts to hide his campaign work, Mattei said, Rowland was trying to ensure that \u201cthe public would never know that Mr. Rowland was steering these campaigns with an invisible hand.\nClosing arguments ended on Thursday afternoon in the federal criminal trial of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, and now the case is in the hands of the jury.\nMeanwhile, Mattei said, the work Rowland did for Brian Foley\u2019s nursing home business was negligible."}
