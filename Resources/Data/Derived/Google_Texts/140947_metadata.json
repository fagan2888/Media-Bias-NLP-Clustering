The Des Moines Register offered an editorial that I can mostly agree with. They write:\n\nAnd this particular prohibition on churches engaging in certain political activities shouldn\u2019t exist anyway. While churches should follow current law, Congress should make nixing this provision part of a comprehensive and long-overdue revision of the tax code related to nonprofits. It\u2019s unclear why then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson introduced this amendment in 1954. It is not even clear he intended to target churches. At the time he was doing battle with two nonprofit groups calling him a closet communist. The result is some tax-exempt organizations have their speech stifled while others don\u2019t. It\u2019s unfair. Nonprofits from political action committees to social welfare groups can engage in political activities. Congress should allow all organizations to do so. Everyone in this country should be free to express their opinions, regardless of their tax status.\n\nI\u2019m sure that the Des Moines Register understands the necessity for civil disobedience in some cases. I can\u2019t believe they think that civil disobedience exercised during the civil rights movement to protest unjust laws is inappropriate. Personally, I\u2019m not a fan of churches endorsing candidates mainly because I don\u2019t want to see the pulpit used for politics. I definitely am a fan of pastors speaking boldly on issues of the day in light of a Christian worldview and encouraging their members to vote according to their worldview. That\u2019s preaching the whole counsel of God.\n\nIf pastors as individuals want to do that as individuals go for it. Now that is personal preference, but churches should be able to exercise this kind of speech however.\n\nThe Register\u2019s editorial board also addressed Pulpit Freedom Sundays sponsored by Alliance Defending Freedom:\n\nFor several years, hundreds of churches have intentionally delivered political sermons on \u201cPulpit Freedom Sunday,\u201d an annual event organized by an Arizona-based group. They make a point to flout the law and thumb their nose at the Internal Revenue Service. The underfunded agency doesn\u2019t have the staff to pursue such violations and also likely fears the conservative backlash if it \u201ctargets\u201d churches.\n\nThe IRS is underfunded? Please! These pastors do this because they want the IRS to act. They reference Pastor Cary Gordon of Sioux City who said a few years ago that he wants the IRS to come after him so he can sue them all the way to the Supreme Court. The IRS doesn\u2019t go after churches because the threat is enough to cow some churches into avoiding what is deemed \u201cpolitical\u201d speech altogether so they avoid crucial worldview discussions. The people at the IRS know that there is no way this law would stand if challenged in court as it is clearly unconstitutional.\n\nSo the Register got this issue half-right at least. We agree that the law does need to be changed. We disagree that churches should wait for Congress to act.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/05/law-stifling-free-speech-in-churches-should-be-repealed/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/church_and_state_montage2-1024x617.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2015-05-07T21:32:02+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "alliance defending freedom, cary gordon, first amendment, free speech, internal revenue service, irs, political endorsements, pulpit freedom sunday, the des moines register, cultural issues", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "The law that prohibits churches from endorsing should be repealed, but churches should not have to wait on Congress to exercise First Amendment rights.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "The law that prohibits churches from endorsing should be repealed, but churches should not have to wait on Congress to exercise First Amendment rights.", "title": "Law Stifling Free Speech in Churches Should Be Repealed | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/church_and_state_montage2-1024x617.jpg", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/05/law-stifling-free-speech-in-churches-should-be-repealed/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The law that prohibits churches from endorsing should be repealed, but churches should not have to wait on Congress to exercise First Amendment rights.", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/church_and_state_montage2.jpg", "title": "Law Stifling Free Speech in Churches Should Be Repealed | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "section": "Cultural Issues", "tag": "The Des Moines Register", "published_time": "2015-05-07T16:32:02-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "While churches should follow current law, Congress should make nixing this provision part of a comprehensive and long-overdue revision of the tax code related to nonprofits.\nThe IRS doesn\u2019t go after churches because the threat is enough to cow some churches into avoiding what is deemed \u201cpolitical\u201d speech altogether so they avoid crucial worldview discussions.\nNow that is personal preference, but churches should be able to exercise this kind of speech however.\nThey write:And this particular prohibition on churches engaging in certain political activities shouldn\u2019t exist anyway.\nPersonally, I\u2019m not a fan of churches endorsing candidates mainly because I don\u2019t want to see the pulpit used for politics."}
