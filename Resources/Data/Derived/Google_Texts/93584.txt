ORO VALLEY - The Oro Valley Citizens for Open Government have organized an effort to recall Oro Valley's mayor and three council members.

The people driving the effort are upset over the deal the Town Council brokered to buy the El Conquistador Golf Course and Country Club. For some, $1 million dollars to buy the 324 acres is a "swinging" deal. However, opponents of the sale say it's a bad deal that Oro Valley residents will have to keep paying for.

"This golf course, it needs a lot of work, it's not supposed to be financially profitable until four or five years from now, on top of that a half cent sales tax begins in Oro Valley to pay for this, there's no sunset clause which means the sales tax goes on forever," said Ryan Hartung, a member of Oro Valley Citizens for Open Government.

A call for a referendum was thrown out after petition signatures were ruled invalid. The Town Council then approved the deal, along with a half cent sales tax on all retail purchases in Oro Valley.

Despite the opposition, councilwoman Mary Snider believes the property is good for the community.

"Personally, I believe if it would have gone to vote it would have easily passed, there is a great deal of public support out there, in spite of some voices who are not, and I respect those voices," said Snider.

Hartung and the Oro Valley citizens for Open Government disagree. As a response, they have launched a recall to oust Mayor Satish Hiremath, as well as council members Lou Water, Joe Hornat, and Mary Snider.

"It's the Mayor and the same three people that ran with him in the same previous election, they ran as one block, saying they knew what was best for Oro Valley, and there is another three council members and although they have good ideas, if they don't want those ideas through, they won't go through, and that's just not a good way for local government to function," said Hartung.

If enough signatures are collected a special recall election will take place in November.
