Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has revealed he may be permanently blind in one eye.The Nevada Democrat told CNN that he will "probably not" be able to see in his right eye again, following an injury he sustained while exercising last New Year's Day."You know in life, you don't always get what you want. And I wish I hadn't hurt myself," Reid said.The Capitol Hill powerhouse has worn a pair of pitch-black, Roy Orbison-style sunglasses since the mishap.He told CNN that surgery which could correct the blindness may be available someday.But, he added, "We're not there yet."Reid's accident occurred when a resistance band on an exercise machine snapped, causing him to fall. He broke ribs and bones in his eye.Reid said it has taken some adjustment to function with just one eye."I can read now. Don't read nearly as fast as I used to. I had world-class speed reading ability. I don't have that anymore. But I'm doing just fine," he told CNN.He said the accident has also "affected my stability," but that "I'm getting better."
