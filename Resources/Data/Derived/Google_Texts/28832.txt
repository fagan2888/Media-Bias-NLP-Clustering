UPDATE, 8 PM ET:

In an email to TheBlaze Sunday evening, Handler confirmed she sent the tweet out from her account on Saturday night.

Handler said “the comment has nothing to do with her work for the University of California, San Francisco” and that she has “reached out to that institution’s Human Resources department to discuss the matter.”

She added that “the comment was made in jest” and “did not intend to imply that anyone should die.”

A University of California — San Francisco official, working in the department of development and alumni relations, reportedly tweeted on Saturday night that she thinks those in opposition to Obamacare should be denied healthcare all-together.

“At this point we should deny #Obamacare nonbelievers access to care at all,” Stephanie Handler tweeted, according to Twitter news-outlet Twitchy. “Let them eat their McDonalds, drink 18-oz sodas.”

The tweet, as well as Handler’s Twitter and LinkedIn accounts, has since been deleted.

However, a cached version of Handler’s account also depicts rhetoric in opposition to conservative viewpoints.

In one Tweet, Handler skewered former President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney as “foolish.”

Her Twitter background image says “we used to be” Americans before the “tea party,” “Koch brothers,” “Rush Limbaugh” and “birthers.”

A spokesperson for the University of California — San Fransisco was not immediately made available for comment to TheBlaze on Sunday. However, a university official confirmed that Handler does work in the school’s department of development.
