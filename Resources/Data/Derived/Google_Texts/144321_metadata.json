Mark Udall\u2019s terms.\n\nWith Udall\u2019s campaign hitting the airwaves with a second TV ad attacking Gardner on women\u2019s health issues this week, Planned Parenthood Votes joined the fight on Thursday dropping its own web ad arguing that Gardner \u201ccan\u2019t be trusted\u201d on personhood.\n\nGardner, who supported personhood amendments in 2008 and 2010 that were rejected by three of four Colorado voters, disavowed the Colorado personhood amendment shortly after joining the Senate race in February and being immediately subjected to withering attacks on the issue.\n\nBut he continues to be a co-sponsor to federal personhood legislation, the Life Begins at Conception Act.\n\n\u201cColorado voters won\u2019t be fooled by Cory Gardner\u2019s cynical attempts to whitewash his dangerous record on women\u2019s health issues,\u201d said Planned Parenthood Votes Colorado Vice President of Public Affairs, Cathy Alderman.\n\n\u201cWhen he went to Washington, Gardner continued his long-standing support for extreme measures that would interfere with a woman\u2019s personal medical decisions \u2014 including the \u2018Life at Conception Act,\u2019 a nationwide so-called \u2018personhood\u2019 measure.\u201d\n\nLast year, Planned Parenthood actually lavished praise upon Gardner and 32 other House Republicans who voted against a watered-down Violence Against Women Act and helped ensure passage of the bill that included protections for Native Americans, undocumented immigrants and gays.\n\nGardner responded Thursday with an Op-Ed in the Denver Post charging Udall and Washington Democrats with using women\u2019s health issues as a wedge to divide voters and offered his idea: allowing women to buy birth control pills over the counter without getting a prescription from a doctor, something he says can save families time and money\n\n\u201cDriving the price down for a safe medicine is a better way to provide access to adults who want it than President Obama\u2019s insurance mandate,\u201d Gardner writes. \u201cMany women don\u2019t have access today in spite of the Obamacare mandate, and it violates religious liberty in the process. If a new generation of senators puts partisanship aside, we can protect the liberties of women to have easy access to affordable oral contraception at the same time we protect the rights of those with conscience objections.\u201d\n\nGardner\u2019s well-written Op-Ed is smart politics but it did not include any promise to sponsor legislation or take other action to spur the Food and Drug Administration to re-classify birth control pills to be available over the counter.\n\nAnd it opened the floodgates for Udall\u2019s campaign and Democrat-leaning organizations to stay on their favorite subject, to remind voters about Gardner\u2019s past votes, including a 2007 vote as a state lawmaker against requiring hospitals to inform survivors of a sexual assault of the availability of emergency contraception. The bill exempted health care professionals who objected on religious grounds and would not require a hospital to provide emergency contraception to a survivor not at risk of becoming pregnant.\n\nIn 2011, he cast a vote in support of the Respect for Rights of Conscience Act, which declares that \u201cnothing in the Affordable Care Act shall be construed to authorize a health plan to require a provider to provide, participate in, or refer for a specific item or service contrary to the provider\u2019s religious beliefs or moral convictions.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongressman Gardner has a disturbing record of supporting radical measures to limit, and even outlaw, women\u2019s access to contraception. His flailing efforts to remake his image serve as an admission that his extreme beliefs and reckless agenda are out-of-step with mainstream Colorado values,\u201d said State Rep. Angela Williams in a statement blasted out by Udall\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cCory Gardner is trying to re-write history and erase his record on women\u2019s access to contraception,\u201d said Karen Middleton, Executive Director of NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado. \u201cHe voted against contraceptive access time and time again in Colorado. In Congress, he\u2019s still a co-sponsor of the Personhood bill, which would outlaw many forms of contraception.\n\n\u201cColorado women know the truth. We can\u2019t trust Cory Gardner to stand with us and protect out rights on contraception and reproductive health.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- So far, the campaign against Republican U.S. Senate candidate Cory Gardner is largely a one-note effort -- hammering the congressman for his stance on personhood.
