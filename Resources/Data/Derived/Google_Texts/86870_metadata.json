At an estimated 160 years of age, the community elder is significantly older than the current Guinness World Record-holder Jeanne Clament as well as the recent challenger Carmelo Flores. While he cannot prove his age with a birth certificate, he claims to remember the transfer of power between all five Gadaa Oromo parties in four rotations \u2013 a process that dates back to the mid-19th century, according to estimates made by OPride.\n\nIn a recent interview, the elder spoke with local TV reporters about his fascinating century-and-a-half. He remembers a time when the Ethiopian empire still expanded south; when Abyssinian conquerors invaded the land; and when it took eight days on horseback to cover the 150 miles between his village and the nation\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa.\n\n\u201cWhen Italy invaded Ethiopia, I had two wives and my son was old enough to herd cattle,\u201d he said, referring to Italy\u2019s 1895 invasion of his country. \u201cNot even one of my peers is alive today.\u201d\n\nThe average lifespan in Ethiopia is 60 years. If his story is true, Ebba would have reached that age during World War I.\n\n\u201cEbba speaks with a firm, articulate voice while recounting his life story. He may no longer be able to see but his memories of historical facts seem sharp,\u201d interviewer Mohammed Ademo said. \u201cGiven that the Oromo like many African cultures are an oral society, \u2018each time an elder dies, a library is lost.\u2019 Ebba\u2019s is one such library from which much can still be preserved.\u201d\n\nA similar story surfaced earlier this summer, when the Bolivian retiree Carmelo Flores allegedly turned 123. At that point, the supercentenarian was thought to have outlived Jeanne Clament \u2013the French 122-year-old who entered the Guinness Book of Records in 1988. However, lack of proper documentation and other red flags led the record committee\u2019s investigation team to reject his claim.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "world's oldest man, oldest living person, dhaqo ebba, mohammed ademo, ethiopia oromo", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Dhaqo Ebba claims to remember Abyssinian conquerors, Italian invaders, and other mid- to late 19th century events.", "title": "Ethiopian Farmer 'At Least 160 Years Old,' Reporter Estimates", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ethiopian-farmer-least-160-years-old-reporter-estimates-dhaqo-ebba-could-be-worlds-oldest-person", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/09/old.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dhaqo Ebba claims to remember Abyssinian conquerors, Italian invaders, and other mid- to late 19th century events.", "title": "Ethiopian Farmer 'At Least 160 Years Old,' Reporter Estimates", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ethiopian-farmer-least-160-years-old-reporter-estimates-dhaqo-ebba-could-be-worlds-oldest-person", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/09/old.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/09/old.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-09T22:01:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-09T22:06:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Dhaqo Ebba claims to remember Abyssinian conquerors, Italian invaders, and other mid- to late 19th century events."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0454\"", "article_summary": "At an estimated 160 years of age, the community elder is significantly older than the current Guinness World Record-holder Jeanne Clament as well as the recent challenger Carmelo Flores.\nEthiopian farmer Dhaqo Ebba could break the current longevity record by half a century.\nIf his story is true, Ebba would have reached that age during World War I.\nHowever, lack of proper documentation and other red flags led the record committee\u2019s investigation team to reject his claim.\nIn a recent interview, the elder spoke with local TV reporters about his fascinating century-and-a-half."}
