Check.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s first presidential commercial, dubbed \u201cI\u2019ve Delivered,\u201d looks and feels almost identical to lesser-known Republican candidate Marilinda Garcia\u2019s campaign ad called \u201cTrust.\u201d Ms. Garcia lost her bid last year for a House seat from New Hampshire, but her commercial, it seems, lives on \u2014 repackaged for Mr. Bush.\n\nAs the former Florida governor struggles to cut through the crowded 2016 GOP presidential field, analysts say he\u2019s running a campaign that\u2019s too formulaic, echoing a broader critique of him as a throwback candidate at a time when many voters are looking to move on.\n\nSEE ALSO: Jeb Bush unveils plan to repeal and replace Obamacare\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lethargy certain people have with his campaign \u2014 like we\u2019ve heard this before, we\u2019ve seen this before, we\u2019ve been there before\u201d said Brian Murphy, a GOP chairman in New Hampshire who is unaffiliated with any Republican contender. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly challenges related to his legacy and last name, and some preconceived ideas from voters who think they know him already and are asking, \u2018Do we really want a fourth term for the Bush family?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile some of his competitors are strategizing for the world of the modern primary \u2014 where candidates can stay relevant by saturating the news programs and low-cost by relying on the Internet \u2014 Mr. Bush is sticking with the old-style strategy, confident that media ads, strong finances and an established ground game will propel him through the finish line.\n\nBut in a race dominated by a reality show personality who provides media sound bytes daily, candidates deploying nontraditional YouTube productions meant to go viral, and one contender starring in a feature film meant to showcase her talent, Mr. Bush\u2019s tried-and-true tactics are seeming a bit stale by comparison.\n\n\u201cWhen he entered the race, because of the money he raised and his last name, he was the established front-runner, so he didn\u2019t have much incentive to run a crazy campaign and to really be out there,\u201d said Ray La Raja, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. \u201cBut now, after a few gaffes on the campaign trail and uninspired debate performances, his donors are getting worried. Now he\u2019s going to have to be more aggressive and get out of his comfort zone.\u201d\n\nSince January, Mr. Bush\u2019s poll numbers have been cut almost in half as Republican primary voters shift to political outsiders like real estate mogul Donald Trump, neurosurgeon Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina.\n\nStill, Bush insiders say not to worry. Although he\u2019s not the flashiest candidate on the campaign stage, he is the one who is built to last.\n\nUnlike others in the field, Mr. Bush amassed an $11.4 million war chest 15 days after entering the race, and his super PAC took in a record-setting haul of $103 million in the first six months of 2015. This cash will allow him to flood the market with pricey television ads in the weeks prior to the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries. The goal is to introduce voters to Mr. Bush\u2019s conservative record when voters are ready to listen.\n\n\u201cWith so many in the field right now, it\u2019s just difficult to stand out unless you\u2019re a circus clown like Donald Trump,\u201d said Mac Stipanovich, an adviser to Mr. Bush during his 1994 campaign for governor. \u201cRight now, Trump and the angry people are having their moment, but I do believe it will end, and when it ends, Jeb\u2019s the best-positioned to win the nomination.\u201d\n\nEven the Bush family name will end up being a positive for conservative Republican voters, said Mr. Stipanovich, a Florida lobbyist and Republican strategist.\n\nPlus, the field will start to winnow as other candidates make their own mistakes and media scrutiny on everyone\u2019s records begins to intensify.\n\nTelevision will play a central part in Mr. Bush\u2019s strategy. Last month he announced $500,000 in ads targeting New Hampshire, and a super PAC backing him has booked about $6 million worth of ads in Iowa leading up to the caucuses, with another $24 million earmarked for New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a muscular buy for a muscular story,\u201d Mike Murphy, who runs the Right to Rise super PAC, told The Des Moines Register.\n\nWhether such a commitment to television makes as much difference in the modern primary is hotly debated, what with viewers gravitating online and the sheer number of other political ads that will be drawing attention.\n\n\u201cAds can make a difference, no doubt about it, but our market really does get saturated,\u201d said Will Rogers, GOP Chairman in Polk County, Iowa. \u201cBut terrific original ads can cut through the clutter, like Joni Ernst\u2019s last cycle. That ad really got a lot of people talking and excited.\u201d\n\nMr. Rogers was referring to the ad in which Ms. Ernst, who is now a sitting U.S. Senator, referenced how she grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm, so when she got to Washington she\u2019d know how to \u201ccut pork.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen Mr. Bush\u2019s ads, and they\u2019re not cutting through, in my point of view. The vast majority of people \u2014 if they even see it, because people aren\u2019t watching TV anymore \u2014 they won\u2019t be convinced to vote for Bush based on that ad,\u201d said Alan Glassman, a GOP representative in New Hampshire. \u201cJeb really just needs to be here more and not rely on the advertisements as much as the retail politicking.\u201d\n\nAsked earlier this month if he was concerned about his lag in the polls, Mr. Bush, who last ran a campaign in 2002, didn\u2019t flinch.\n\n\u201cWe just started to advertise \u2014 the campaign is well organized,\u201d Mr. Bush said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in for the long haul. We filed first in Kentucky. All this stuff may not matter in October or September, but it matters getting on the ballot every place and doing all the things necessary to win a majority of the delegates, ultimately, is what this is about.\u201d\n\nIt may not be sexy, but a commitment to retail politics, touting your experience and driving home your record are keys to winning New Hampshire, said David Carney, a Republican strategist in the state.\n\n\u201cThis idea you have to have some dancing monkey in your media, to give the political pundits or reporters something to talk about, it\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Mr. Carney. \u201cPeople go to tried-and-true and proven strategies like television because they work. There you can talk about your record and what you\u2019ve done as a candidate, and that holds weight with voters.\u201d\n\nBut that message can\u2019t be stale \u2014 not with today\u2019s electorate.\n\nAccording to a September poll from Pew, just 29 percent of GOP voters say it\u2019s more important for their candidate to have \u201cexperience and a proven record\u201d than \u201cnew ideas and a different approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, we may end up nominating the candidate with the big money, establishment connections and organized campaign, but this year just seems different,\u201d said Bill O\u2019Connor, the Strafford County GOP chair in New Hampshire. \u201cWe just keep hearing the same stuff over and over again \u2014 politicians saying they\u2019ll go to Washington and change it and then come back empty-handed. This cycle, people really are just hating anyone who is in Washington or associated with it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Voicing disgust with D.C. politicians and insiders? Check.
