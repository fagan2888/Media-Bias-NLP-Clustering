They declined to say how many people had enrolled in health insurance plans. A section of the Web site where people apply for coverage will be taken down for several hours a day over the weekend so technicians can upgrade its capabilities, the administration said.\n\nThe law is at the center of the stalemate that has blocked funds for many federal programs.\n\nRepublicans want to repeal or delay it or make major changes, but Mr. Obama refuses to negotiate over the future of the law, which converts coverage from a privilege to a right, starting in January.\n\nLawmakers and lobbyists say the law\u2019s Republican opponents may have overplayed their hand this week, making it easier for supporters to brush aside criticism.\n\nE. Neil Trautwein, a vice president of the National Retail Federation, said the standoff had \u201chardened the positions\u201d of House Republicans, Senate Democrats and the White House, reducing the chances for changes that could make the law more workable for employers.\n\nIn general, the law requires larger employers to offer coverage to full-time employees, those who work, on average, at least 30 hours a week. Many employers are lobbying for legislation that would alter the definition and reduce the number of businesses subject to the employer mandate.\n\nSenators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, both Republicans, have led the campaign to strip money from the Affordable Care Act, although many Republican senators have expressed deep reservations about the tactic, saying it is unlikely to succeed.\n\n\u201cThis was a self-inflicted wound,\u201d said one Republican on Capitol Hill, who spoke candidly on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThe push to defund the health care law was ludicrous from the beginning. It had no chance of success. But it became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the hard right and obscured all the work we had done to investigate and highlight problems with the law.\u201d\n\nOn one point, many liberals and conservatives agree. It will be hard to take away government-subsidized coverage once people have it.\n\nAt a Tea Party gathering in Texas in August, Mr. Cruz said the president wanted to get people \u201chooked on the subsidies, addicted to the sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we get to Jan. 1, this thing is here forever,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, according to The Texas Tribune.\n\nRonald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group, said: \u201cI agree with Senator Cruz. Once people experience the benefits and protections of the Affordable Care Act, it will be hard, if not impossible, to take them away.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration had promoted its Web site for weeks as the best source of information on health insurance. But insurance agents, like consumers, were often stymied when they tried to use it.\n\n\u201cI am president of the National Association of Health Underwriters, and I could not get on the Web site,\u201d said Thomas M. Harte, a New Hampshire insurance broker who wanted to help clients. \u201cI have tried more than a dozen times, in the middle of the day and the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nMany users found they could not create the online accounts needed to see what health plans were available.\n\n\u201cThe president calls these glitches, a nice poll-tested, fairly benign-sounding word,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. \u201cBut these were systemic failures of the Obamacare exchanges \u2014 obviously, not ready for prime time.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, by contrast, were ecstatic. They said the problems were caused by the unexpectedly high number of visits to the Web site, which showed huge public demand for more affordable insurance.\n\nA few persistent people said they had cleared the hurdles.\n\nEmily R. Wright, 28, a student at East Tennessee State University, said she had signed up for a Blue Cross and Blue Shield policy in about a half-hour, after repeated efforts to get on the Web site. She said she had a painful gynecological condition, endometriosis, and qualified for a subsidy that would halve her premium, to $125 a month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled I can get treatment now,\u201d Ms. Wright said.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131004213758, "twitter": {"description": "Members of both parties say the federal shutdown may give the Obama administration time to work out the kinks in the insurance exchanges under its health care law.", "title": "Shutdown Din Obscures Health Exchange Flaws", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/04/shutdown-din-obscures-health-exchange-flaws/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "creator": "@ropear", "card": "summary"}, "hdl_p": "Shutdown Din Obscures Health Exchange Flaws", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 4, 2013", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Shutdowns (Institutional),United States Politics and Government,Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Robert Pear", "SCG": "affordable-care-act", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Robert Pear", "byl": "Robert Pear", "BN": "affordable-care-act", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/affordable-care-act/post", "description": "Members of both parties say the federal shutdown may give the Obama administration time to work out the kinks in the insurance exchanges under its health care law.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 4, 2013", "article": {"section": "U.S.", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1380937078, "modified_time": "2013-10-07T20:04:16-04:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20131007200416, "PUD": 20131004, "pdate": 20131004, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Shutdowns (Institutional);United States Politics and Government", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "In Practice", "description": "Members of both parties say the federal shutdown may give the Obama administration time to work out the kinks in the insurance exchanges under its health care law.", "title": "Shutdown Din Obscures Health Exchange Flaws", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/04/shutdown-din-obscures-health-exchange-flaws/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/../../packages/images/nytdesign/2013/national/inPractice/inPractice-75.png", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Shutdown Din Obscures Health Exchange Flaws", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf283\"", "article_summary": "They declined to say how many people had enrolled in health insurance plans.\nMillions of people were still frustrated Friday when they tried to #GetCovered, as instructed on Twitter by Mr. Obama, Lady Gaga and other celebrities.\nSince the federal exchanges opened Tuesday, 8.6 million people have visited its Web site, and its telephone call center has received 406,000 calls, officials said Friday.\nA section of the Web site where people apply for coverage will be taken down for several hours a day over the weekend so technicians can upgrade its capabilities, the administration said.\nThey said the problems were caused by the unexpectedly high number of visits to the Web site, which showed huge public demand for more affordable insurance."}
