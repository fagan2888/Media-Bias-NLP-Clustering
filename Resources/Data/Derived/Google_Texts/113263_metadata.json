I never thought I\u2019d find myself at this altitude doing this, riding a river,\u201d said Kai Lenny, the 21-year-old world champion race and big wave stand-up paddler.\n\nLenny arrived in Vail this week for his first-ever foray into whitewater. His participation in Saturday\u2019s GoPro Mountain Games downriver sprint showed the nascent sport of whitewater stand-up paddling gaining legitimacy in the major-league realm of coastal paddling, where athletes for generations have raced across raging seas and ridden huge waves.\n\n\u201cJust to change it up and have this different scenery is rad. That\u2019s why I like doing all these other sports too,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Red Bull-sponsored big wave paddle surfer, kite surfer and last year\u2019s overall world champion in both race and surf disciplines spent the week learning the intricacies of high altitude river-running. He struggled with the lack of oxygen as well as the swirling nature of narrow, shallow swiftwater.\n\nHe\u2019s a quick learner. He took second place out of 33 racers Saturday, behind stand-up pioneer Dan Gavere. Whitewater veteran Mike Tavares finished third a mere three-tenths of a second behind the Hawaiian superstar.\n\nThe race serves as a precursor for the Payette River Games in Cascade, Idaho in two weeks. With a $50,000 stand-up prize purse \u2014 the largest in the history of whitewater stand-up paddling \u2014 the event is expected to draw more coastal stand-up racers, including Lenny.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing new heights for the whitewater world for sure. People are looking at whitewater stand-up and seeing that it\u2019s actually viable and legitimate and super fun,\u201d Tavares said.\n\nWhile Lenny\u2019s presence in the GoPro Mountain Games race \u2014 along with several Japanese and California coastal stand-up athletes \u2014 certainly raises whitewater\u2019s profile in the historically salty stand-up scene, Gavere said he was more impressed the race drew so many different paddlers. There were moms, dads, kids and first-timers competing in the downriver race alongside seasoned athletes. Surfers and kayakers are joining the swelling ranks of whitewater stand-up too. Sunday\u2019s stand-up cross races on Gore Creek are expected to draw many of the kayakers who competed in the GoPro Mountain Games freestyle and creek contests.\n\n\u201cI think we are looking at chronic growth over the next few years,\u201d Gavere said. \u201cI think freshwater and whitewater growth is going to outpace saltwater growth big time.\u201d\n\nKen Hoeve, a stand-up who has pushed the sport\u2019s growth in recent years, was tasked by GoPro Mountain Games sponsors to show Lenny the ropes of the river. He took the surfer down to Glenwood Springs\u2019 huge wave on the Colorado River, where Lenny surfed lengthy rides, spinning tricks and revealing his true prowess even though he\u2019d never surfed a river wave.\n\n\u201cI ended up learning from him,\u201d Hoeve said.\n\nLike Gavere, Hoeve was celebrating diversity more than big names on Gore Creek on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe have so many walks of life and so many styles of paddler here and everyone is having an equal amount of fun. Everyone is on a level playing field with the creek,\u201d Hoeve said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2f3f\"", "article_summary": "People are looking at whitewater stand-up and seeing that it\u2019s actually viable and legitimate and super fun,\u201d Tavares said.\nWith a $50,000 stand-up prize purse \u2014 the largest in the history of whitewater stand-up paddling \u2014 the event is expected to draw more coastal stand-up racers, including Lenny.\nSurfers and kayakers are joining the swelling ranks of whitewater stand-up too.\nThe race serves as a precursor for the Payette River Games in Cascade, Idaho in two weeks.\nVAIL \u2014 The long-standing distinction between the river-surfing mountain waterman and the island-hopping, wave-riding waterman is blurring."}
