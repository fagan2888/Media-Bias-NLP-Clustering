Estes Park Medical Center offers a wide range of surgical services to inpatients and outpatients on an elective, urgent and emergent basis. Estes Park Medical Center's surgical team provides each patient with the highest quality surgical care in a supportive environment.\n\nA multidisciplinary approach is used to assess and care for patients. Nursing care services cover all phases of the perioperative experience. After you and your surgeon have decided on surgery, nursing staff will coordinate the assessment, education and other processes and information necessary for your surgery.\n\nLouis Strong, MD\n\nThe medical center's surgery team utilizes various surgical methods, including endoscopic and laparoscopic procedures, to minimize pain and recovery time. Many procedures are now offered as outpatient surgery, minimizing the patient's time at the facility and promoting a quick return to their normal routine.\n\nNearly all patients who have surgery require testing beforehand. Most of the pre-surgery tests will be ordered by your physician and can be completed at Estes Park Medical Center, including cardiac clearance. Giving care givers all the vital medical information they need to know before your procedure makes your registration on the day of your surgery smoother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter reviewing the feedback from a community survey, Estes Park Medical Center completed an analysis of its surgery charges and compared them with the other facilities in the Front Range area. As a result of the review, prices were lowered not only in surgery but in diagnostic imaging and the birthing center. The goal is to keep healthcare close to home by keeping prices competitive.\n\nDr. Michael Grant\n\nThe highly trained and board certified surgeons work in collaboration with services throughout Estes Park Medical Center. Not only can you have your surgery here, but you can begin the healing process close to home. The Estes Park Medical Center Transitional Care Program provides nursing care for patients who require medically supervised nursing care on a continuous basis but no longer require their previous level of acute care. In additional patients receiving care at other hospitals and are in need of skilled nursing services can transfer their care to Estes Park Medical Center's Transitional Care Unit.\n\nEstes Park Medical Center surgeons work in conjunction with other ancillary services departments to begin the healing process which includes Physical Rehabilitation and Home Health Care.\n\nScott Woodard, MD\n\nSurgical Services at Estes Park Medical Center include:\n\n\u2022 General surgery - Scott Woodard, MD\n\n\u2022 Orthopaedics - Aaron S.
