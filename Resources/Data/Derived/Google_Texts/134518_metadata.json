Those youngsters will turn 50 in 2016.\n\nTo quote a rock band that was just hitting its stride in 1966, \u201cWhat a long, strange trip it\u2019s been.\u201d\n\nFew of us look forward to the Big Five-O \u2014 but perhaps we should. After all, 50 is the age when we can join AARP \u2014 for a mere $16 \u2014 and finally qualify for great money-saving discounts at countless stores and restaurants.\n\nWe\u2019ve even included a few price breaks that begin at age 50 for people who are not AARP members.\n\nSo instead of sitting around wondering when all those wrinkles arrived \u2014 or where all that hair disappeared to \u2014 celebrate your birthday by taking advantage of the following types of price breaks you can enjoy after turning 50.\n\nRemember: You\u2019ve earned \u2019em.\n\nDining discounts\n\nWith age comes the ability to appreciate a fine meal. And you can save all over town as a card-carrying member of AARP.\n\nDiscounts include 15 percent off meals at restaurants such as Outback Steakhouse, Bonefish Grill and Carabba\u2019s Italian Grill. Or perhaps you prefer a free doughnut with the purchase of a large beverage at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. Either way, scrumptious savings abound for those ages 50 and over. Bon app\u00e9tit!\n\nEntertainment deals\n\nYou\u2019ve worked hard for a half-century \u2014 now\u2019s the time to start reaping rewards in the form of discounted entertainment!\n\nAARP members can \u201csave up to 25 percent off movie tickets\u201d and enjoy snack discounts from Regal Entertainment Group.\n\nRegal also offers these price breaks to people who are not members of AARP, but you\u2019ll need to be patient \u2014 discounts for nonmembers do not begin until you turn 60.\n\nMembers can also save at least 25 percent on a \u201cticket 4-pack to great events\u201d including \u201csome of the biggest live performances, your favorite sports teams or artists at venues and arenas around the U.S.\u201d through Ticketmaster/Live Nation.\n\nRetail savings\n\nWith age comes wisdom, and hopefully you\u2019re smart enough to avoid paying full price whenever you shop. If you are 50 or older, you can join AARP and catch a price break at many popular national retailers.\n\nMembers can save on apparel from leading brands, such as Reebok (20 percent off at Reebok.com), floral deliveries from companies like 1-800-Flowers.com, gift baskets and more.\n\nThere are even discounts on monthly phone services and accessories from industry leaders. For example, you can get a 10 percent discount on the monthly service charge from AT&T.\n\nTravel perks\n\nDon\u2019t put off that vacation you desperately need and deserve. AARP makes it easier for you to get away by offering discounts at leading hotel chains, including Hilton, Sheraton, Wyndham and W hotels. You can even save 5 percent off your room at Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg! Members can also save on flights and cruises.\n\nAnd though you\u2019ll have to wait a little while, you can also get reduced admission at national parks. U.S. citizens and permanent residents who turn 62 qualify for a lifetime pass to the parks, all for the cost of just $10 \u2014 no AARP membership necessary.\n\nAutomotive savings\n\nHaving an AARP membership pays off big time when it comes to wheels. In addition to rental savings from companies like Avis Rent A Car and Budget Rent-A-Car, members can enjoy services such as discounted oil changes as well as deals on automobile, motorcycle and RV insurance. Sounds like it\u2019s time to hit the road!\n\nEnhanced retirement tax breaks\n\nTax Day is approaching, a reminder of how much we love our money \u2014 and how we hate handing it over to the government. But if you are turning 50 this year, you can reduce next year\u2019s tax bill through \u201ccatch-up contributions\u201d to your 401(k) or IRA.\n\nPeople age 50 and older are able to contribute an additional $6,000 to their 401(k), or an additional $1,000 to their IRA. Best of all, the money you contribute to a 401(k) or traditional IRA is tax-deferred, meaning you won\u2019t have to pay taxes on the cash until you withdraw it in retirement.\n\nDo you know of other great price breaks that arrive with your 50th birthday?
