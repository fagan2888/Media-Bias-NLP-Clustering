REUTERS/Rick Wilking\n\n4046220\n\nHundreds of people \u2014 if not thousands by the end of the day \u2014 braved cold temperatures and intermittent snowfall on New Year\u2019s Day to make history in Colorado by legally buying recreational marijuana.\n\nLines formed well before dawn at most pot shops, but many said that it was worth the lack of sleep and discomfort to be among the first in the world to buy marijuana in state-sanctioned stores. Across the state, 37 shops opened for business and dozens more are expected to open in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe trip was more arduous for some customers than for others. Neal Pepper and two friends drove through the night from Arkansas, a 12-hour trip, to be among the first in line at The Medicine Man dispensary in east Denver.\n\n\u201cIt just felt like I was coming out of the closet,\u201d Pepper said after buying a quarter ounce of marijuana, the legal limit per transaction for non-Colorado residents; residents can purchase up to an ounce. \u201cI just asked the guy to suggest something. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nAt least half of those in the long line at The Medicine Man were from outside Colorado, said Benjamin Little, spokesman for Blue Line Protection Group, a private security company whose armed guards checked IDs. He said customers had come from as far as New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a vacation.\u201d\n\nWhile that may be, the Denver Convention and Visitors Bureau isn\u2019t going out of its way to promote the historical new industry, said spokesman Rich Grant.\n\n\u201cOur main concern is that people know the law,\u201d he said, noting that it\u2019s too early to tell, from a marketing perspective, whether being the pot capital of the world will help or hurt Colorado\u2019s reputation.\n\nStore owners seem to be doing their part to ensure that everyone is informed about what is and isn\u2019t allowed. At 3-D Dispensary, staff members handed out informational brochures to those in line and another flyer upon making a purchase.\n\nThe first sales also came with a word of caution from 3-D owner Toni Fox, who advised out-of-town tokers to take it slow.\n\n\u201cOur cannabis in Colorado is very potent and we want you to enjoy it and not overindulge,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough Gov. John Hickenlooper and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock avoided the spotlight Wednesday \u2014 both campaigned against Amendment 64, the legalization measure passed by voters in 2012 \u2014 other state officials were on hand to witness the beginning of this first-of-its-kind industry.\n\n\u201cConsidering the ambitious timeline we\u2019ve had, I\u2019m really impressed,\u201d said state Rep. Jonathan Singer, one of only two state legislators to publicly endorse Amendment 64 before it was passed. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like the launch of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nSinger credited the smooth opening to business owners, many of whom helped craft regulations and worked to pass a taxing scheme for recreational marijuana.\n\n\u201cThe industry showed up to the table ready to work,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThey put their money, and their effort, where their mouth is.\u201d\n\nSinger said there are still tweaks to be worked out of the system, the most obvious of which are federal laws that prohibit banks from working with marijuana sellers. Therefore, the new industry \u2014 which is expected to generate approximately $400 million in annual sales \u2014 is strictly cash-only.\n\nSinger said state legislators will continue to pressure Congress to amend banking regulations so that customers can use credit and debit cards and marijuana shops can open business accounts. Another option is to open a state-chartered bank.\n\n\u201cIf the feds can\u2019t do it, we know Colorado can,\u201d he said.\n\nBrian Vicente, one of the co-authors of Amendment 64 called the grand openings \u201ca watershed moment\u201d in U.S. history and said Colorado will serve as a model for other states preparing to legalize marijuana.\n\n\u201cColorado is charting a path for the rest of the country to follow,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
