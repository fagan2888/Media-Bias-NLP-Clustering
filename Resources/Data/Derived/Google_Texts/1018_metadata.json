After Huckabee, who\u2019d parlayed a strong showing in 2008 into publishing deals and his own Fox News show, declined to run again, some wags snickered that his new livelihood must have been too hard to give up. Now all three seem to be proving the cynics right. They\u2019re not just cashing in on their candidacies the way some predecessors have, by translating increased visibility to higher speaking fees, more generous book advances, extra board appointments, and so on. Collectively, Cain, Gingrich, and Huckabee are pioneering a new, more direct method for post-campaign buckraking. All it requires is some digitally savvy accomplices\u2014and a total immunity to shame.\n\nCampaigns are very much in the lists business: lists of donors to call, lists of likely voters, lists of identified supporters, sub-lists of the addresses of the friendly voters needing rides to the polls. When the race is over, some of those databases become hot commodities as brokers peddle them to other candidates and like-minded interest groups willing to pay for access to their contents. A master file of the names and contact information collected during Alan Keyes\u2019s perennial candidacies, for instance, remains \u201ctop performing,\u201d according to direct-marketing clearinghouse NextMark, thanks to the highly engaged constituency it reaches: \u201cThese conservative individuals are passionately pro-life and pro-family and will do what it takes to ensure that their voices are heard!\u201d The asking price is $100 per 1,000 names, with surcharges for pulling out targets by congressional district, gender, and other variables.\n\nE-mail lists can be especially valuable, since the people on them have effectively asked to be contacted (not so with lists of phone numbers) and can be reached more reliably and more cheaply than they can through bulk snail-mailings. But there are specific rules governing how e-mail addresses are handled by office seekers. Generally, someone running for president enters the race with an existing list of e-mail followers\u2014in Cain\u2019s case, from the Atlanta talk-radio show he hosted and the syndicated column he wrote in the years leading up to the 2012 contest\u2014which can be transferred to his or her campaign organization. That initial roster grows as supporters and fence sitters subscribe to the candidate\u2019s bulletins. \u201cObviously, the size of the list expanded quite a bit,\u201d says Best of Cain editor-in-chief Dan Calabrese. After Cain dropped out, he donated his enlarged list to Cain Connections, a newly formed super PAC, which then gave it to his new media company. Federal election statutes bar candidates from using campaign resources for personal use, but by passing the e-mail list through his PAC, Cain kept things inbounds. The maneuver, says Matt Sanderson, an election-law expert at the Washington, D.C., firm Caplin & Drysdale, was a means \u201cto indirectly do what you otherwise couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnother route enterprising political figures can take is to keep their campaign and personal lists separate but use names from the former to bulk up the latter, and vice versa. This is the tactic pursued by Gingrich, who has sent sponsors\u2019 e-mail ads from accounts maintained by both his production company and his old presidential campaign. Or, as Huckabee has done, a former candidate can wall off his campaign e-mail list while building a second, commercial database from scratch. Whichever approach is taken, the result is a potentially lucrative asset.\n\nMarketers who rent a campaign\u2019s postal mailing addresses are free to send those people brochures for their natural testosterone boosters, or any other form of constitutionally protected communication, without revealing how they got the addressees\u2019 information. With e-mail, the opposite is true. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to receive the e-mail under the auspices of the list proprietor,\u201d says Richard Viguerie, the Republican direct-mail pioneer. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s spamming.\u201d Similarly, the purveyors of natural testosterone boosters, looking to maximize its potential customer base, can\u2019t just pitch people through bogus accounts. They need a Herman Cain to send the e-mail for them.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to suggest that Cain is personally taking meetings with the sales team at Natural Breakthroughs Research\u2014or those at Franklin Prosperity Report and fixyourbloodsugar.com, to cite two other companies whose ads he has e-mailed. That\u2019s why middlemen were invented. Cain, along with Huckabee, uses Newsmax, the right-wing media conglomerate. (Gingrich Productions opts for a firm called TMA Direct.) Founded a little more than 15 years ago as a single fringe website and built with early funding from Richard Mellon Scaife, Newsmax now publishes a main, free site that sometimes ranks as the most trafficked political URL on the Internet, as well as a suite of smaller, paid newsletters. To leverage its reach and pad its balance sheet, it also places ads for e-mail lists like Cain\u2019s and Huckabee\u2019s (National Review and Rasmussen Reports are clients as well), whose members fit comfortably into Newsmax\u2019s demo: staunchly conservative and \u201cmostly men, mostly 50-plus,\u201d says Matt D\u2019Lando, a vice president for business development.\n\nRepresentatives for Cain, Huckabee, and Newsmax all declined to disclose how much the ads are bringing in for the former candidates. But a back-of-the-envelope tally using rates Newsmax posts on its site works out as follows: At $36 per thousand list members for an ad filling an entire e-mail, and no fewer than 33 such ads sent last year, Cain made more than $420,000 from e-mail ads in 2013\u2014minus Newsmax\u2019s cut and the costs of maintaining his list. For Huckabee, whose list is nearly twice as long as Cain\u2019s and commands a rate of $43.25 per thousand, the rough haul is north of $900,000. And those figures don\u2019t include the separate, lower fees that Cain and Huckabee collect for embedding smaller sponsored teasers in editorial messages.\n\nCalabrese argues that questioning the dubious nature of the products and services relayed through the promotions amounts to elitism. \u201cI have no reason to think [an advertiser] is not a legitimate company just because it falls into a category a lot of people would snicker at,\u201d he says, putting the onus on skeptics to prove that there is, in fact, no \u201c1 WEIRD SPICE THAT DESTROYS DIABETES\u201d and that recipients who respond hopefully to \u201cTHIS UNCLAIMED $20,500 CHECK YOURS? (SEE IF YOU QUALIFY)\u201d will inevitably be disappointed.\n\nThough the owners of e-mail lists can reject an advertiser that Newsmax sets it up with, Calabrese, who holds that veto power at Best of Cain, can\u2019t recall a time he has needed to. Newsmax \u201cdoes a really good job of vetting,\u201d he says. D\u2019Lando adds that, while the company makes efforts to screen out blatant fraudsters, any transaction that results between the e-mail subscriber and the advertiser is, of course, buyer beware. \u201cOnce somebody clicks on it,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s not our legal responsibility.\u201d\n\nNot every Cain, Gingrich, or Huckabee e-mail subscriber is a dyed-in-the-wool supporter. There must be some Republican voters who signed up out of curiosity and haven\u2019t bothered to unsubscribe. (There is definitely at least one left-leaning reporter.) But if you\u2019re a true believer, you are probably on your guy\u2019s list. You bought into his message during the campaign. You thought he should be president! And so maybe you\u2019re just a little more likely to buy something that you learn about through him. Especially if the \u201cconsistent income for life\u201d or \u201cfinancial transaction the gov\u2019t can\u2019t track\u201d might alleviate some of the apprehension that Cain, Gingrich, and Huckabee\u2014always talking about how the whole country is falling apart\u2014seem so attuned to. It\u2019s not a coincidence that these e-mail schemes have taken off on the right wing, where anxiety is a widely traded commodity and where Rush Limbaugh\u2019s frequent on-air plugs of various advertisers and Glenn Beck and his gold coins have already blurred the line between authority figure and pitchman.\n\nCain, Gingrich, and Huckabee almost always take care to include caveats in the e-mail ads they send, spelling out that the sponsors\u2019 statements and claims \u201cdo not necessarily reflect my views.\u201d That specific language comes from Huckabee\u2019s disclaimer, which is more extensive than the others\u2019, perhaps because he\u2019s now thinking about running for the White House again. (This may also help account for why Rick Santorum just uses his 2012 campaign e-mail list to send out press releases and announcements about upcoming speeches he\u2019s happening to give in Iowa\u2014the only improbable pitch he can be caught delivering is a Santorum presidency.) Yet, for all the feints toward propriety, the e-mail ads keep coming, and boundaries keep getting pushed.\n\nAmong marketing wizzes, there is a lot of excitement these days over so-called native advertising, which, in short, are digital ads that manage not to feel like ads at all. For example, a onetime White House contender might write his followers about a meeting he recently had with a \u201clongtime friend and investment guru,\u201d a man named John Mauldin, who publishes a financial newsletter under the banner \u201cYIELD SHARK.\u201d It costs $99 a year to subscribe to the tip sheet. At the time, its latest edition advised snapping up shares of Sturm, Ruger & Co., confident in the knowledge that even as wide-scale gun control was doomed, the mere threat of it was driving up firearms sales. The ex-candidate told his e-mail list that he\u2019d done them a favor. He\u2019d convinced Mauldin to give them a copy of \u201cYIELD SHARK\u201d for free, so they could check it out for themselves.\n\nThe e-mail, which carried no disclaimer, landed in inboxes on September 7. \u201cI\u2019M DOING SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE,\u201d read Newt Gingrich\u2019s subject line. Here\u2019s betting it won\u2019t be the last time an ex-candidate does the same, so long as the money is there.\n\nBen Adler, a reporter for Grist and correspondent for Columbia Journalism Review, covered the 2012 Republican campaign for The Nation.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "When failed presidential candidates become spam kings", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "B-list Republican presidential candidates are now making money off internet spam.", "title": "Why Is Herman Cain Trying to Cure Your Erectile Dysfunction?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/fdb8c35c92d41e9fd26f3edeb2c1840f1e16cffa.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/116237/newt-gingrich-herman-cain-are-now-making-money-spam", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/fdb8c35c92d41e9fd26f3edeb2c1840f1e16cffa.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Why Is Herman Cain Trying to Cure Your Erectile Dysfunction?", "description": "B-list Republican presidential candidates are now making money off internet spam.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newrepublic"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/fdb8c35c92d41e9fd26f3edeb2c1840f1e16cffa.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Why Is Herman Cain Trying to Cure Your Erectile Dysfunction?\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/116237/newt-gingrich-herman-cain-are-now-making-money-spam\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-27T01:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":116237,\"author\":\"Ben Adler\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"GOP\",\"Republicans\",\"Herman Cain\",\"Mike Huckabee\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-01-27"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9405\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOnce somebody clicks on it,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s not our legal responsibility.\u201dNot every Cain, Gingrich, or Huckabee e-mail subscriber is a dyed-in-the-wool supporter.\nCollectively, Cain, Gingrich, and Huckabee are pioneering a new, more direct method for post-campaign buckraking.\nYet, for all the feints toward propriety, the e-mail ads keep coming, and boundaries keep getting pushed.\nRepresentatives for Cain, Huckabee, and Newsmax all declined to disclose how much the ads are bringing in for the former candidates.\nOr, as Huckabee has done, a former candidate can wall off his campaign e-mail list while building a second, commercial database from scratch."}
