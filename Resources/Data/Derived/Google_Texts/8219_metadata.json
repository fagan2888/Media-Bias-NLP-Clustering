I've been several times, starting in 1969 when it was held on the Tulare Fair Grounds with horribly muddy aisles. And I can't remember to call it the World Ag Expo. It'll always be the \"Farm Show\" to me.\n\nHome from military duty in the Coast Guard, I was working on my family's cattle ranch. Dad was cooking beans for a food booth so off we went for my first trip to this new event called the Farm Show. One of the images I remember most poignantly is walking through the mud in the aisles. This was not just a few mud puddles here and there. This was a real mess.\n\nSlogging my way through the grounds in many places the muck came up eight inches on my rubber boots. I wore jeans so it wouldn't have been disastrous if mud went over the top of my often-used boots.\n\nBut I was fascinated by the salesmen. At that time, most wore two or three-piece suits, pantlegs wrapped carefully and stuffed into their obviously brand new rubber boots.\n\nHave you ever watched a cat walk through snow or across a frosty lawn, picking their feet up high then pausing before putting them down again, sort of \"mincing along\" as they walked? That's what these guys were doing. It was quite entertaining to follow a group down the sloshy aisles. Because they were not familiar with wearing boots to walk in mud, it wasn't unusual to see someone walk right out of a boot stuck in the muck.\n\nThis year however, it was dry and very warm. I spent the entire day in shirtsleeves and was quite comfortable. The aisles were hard and dry. Not one salesman in rubber boots could be seen anywhere on the grounds.\n\nTo describe my day I might relate to you the amazing technology being presented from various vendors. You would also expect me to tell you about the huge pieces of equipment, not \"working dirty\" but spit-and-polish clean.\n\nI could regale you with tales and pictures of monstrous tractors. Well, I will show you a couple of those, for we have a grand-nephew who absolutely loves the green-and-yellow of John Deere. I took a couple of shots of my best girl beside these behemoths. But that was only to send to him, of course.\n\nIf you've read other reports from the World Ag Expo (WAE), you have a good idea what the exhibitors present in their various indoor and outdoor booths. I don't think it is necessary for me to recap what I saw as walked through the grounds.\n\nIn fact, I think you might even be a bit bored with \"golly-gee-whiz\" descriptions. I want to share with you WAE 2015 through the eyes of a few young people.\n\nThursday, the final day, the management of WAE encouraged the schools to bring their Ag Department students, and especially their Future Farmers of America (FFA) chapters. Once the students arrived at school, they were transported to Gate 12 on the far eastern end of the grounds. By mid-late morning we began to see groups of FFA members touring the show.\n\nAs we walked along, I checked the school names on the kids' shirts. Exeter FFA was one of the first groups we saw as they trooped around a corner. Strathmore, Corcoran, Porterville, and Golden West are a small sampling of the many other schools present. Some advisors chose to keep their charges together, while many let the individual kids split up and decide what they wanted to see.\n\nI was very impressed to see these young people, especially the groups of two or three together, walking the aisles and chatting. They were not talking about the good-looking girls or the handsome guys. They weren't even talking about sports or trucks. They were discussing what they were seeing. These kids were absorbing and learning about exactly what their school and advisors had brought them to see.\n\nI stopped two clean-cut young men, obviously part of the high school crowd. Jared Vass, a senior at Westmont High, is the current secretary of their FFA chapter. Walking with Jared was his friend, Anthony Goo, a junior and as he put it, \"... just a member.\"\n\nI didn't recognize the name Westmont so I asked what town it was near. I expected to hear something near Fresno, or maybe in the Merced area. I was startled when Jared said they were from the community of Campbell. This is a very residential community in the Silicon Valley area. They are surrounded by San Jose on the northeast, Los Gatos on the southwest, and Cupertino on the northwest.\n\nI am very impressed the school even has an FFA chapter. I was even more interested to find they have 400 members in their organization in this high-tech area. The Boosters chartered busses for the kids, loaded them up at Westmont High at 6:00 AM, and were not expecting them home until 7:00 PM that evening.\n\nJared was quick to point out he and Anthony were having a great time, and were on their way to see the irrigation exhibits. When I asked what they hoped to get out of the day, they weren't certain, but agreed they enjoyed seeing the \"new stuff.\"\n\nBoth boys said they were very impressed with the agriculture industry, even though neither was planning to make it their first choice of occupation. Jared said he might like to get into some form of agriculture \"when he retires.\" Even though neither boy will go into agriculture as their first occupation, their knowledge of, and familiarity with the many aspects of the industry is sure to affect their way of thinking and understanding.\n\nAnthony, though only a junior, said he was applying to each of the military academies, hoping to get a chance to fly. He was also quick to point out he had earned his Eagle Scout rank. I was most impressed with his project. He installed three or four book kiosks around his community.\n\nJared jumped in, obviously proud of his friend's accomplishment, \"You can check out books to read, or bring books back to the kiosk to turn them in again.\"\n\nAnthony nodded, \"I want people to know the feeling of holding a book in their hands and reading and learning from them.\" In this age of digital books, Anthony has a perception far beyond his years.\n\nThe high schools were not the only ones to bring students to the WAE, however. I was pleased to see a large group of young folks wearing shirts sporting the name \"Ducor School.\" Ducor is a very small rural community, surrounded by agriculture. A majority of the students live in homes where one or both of the parents are employed by a local farm.\n\nI approached a staff member, and learned the school administration had sent 35 seventh and eight-graders to the show. Not only had they elected to send the group on a school-owned bus, but had paid the $5 entry fee for each student.\n\nSince elementary schools don't have FFA chapters, I was curious about the purpose of sending their entire two upper grades to this event. The staff member explained they were relating this experience and the knowledge they gained to their science program on their return to the classroom.\n\nTwo young ladies sat down across from us as we ate lunch. One of the girls wore a shirt declaring she was a member of VTEC High FFA. Brooklyn Dieter is a sophomore at Visalia Technical Early College, housed on the grounds of the old College of the Sequoias School Farm. She explained they are able to take ag classes as well as conventional subjects. They also work at various tasks around the farm. In addition they are allowed to take a few early college courses. Brooklyn definitely wants to go into agriculture and is planning to major in livestock business management. She is already taking a few college level classes toward that end.\n\nThe other young woman was Sierra Wesala, also a sophomore at VTEC. One of the men in her family is serving on a district water board. Hearing of his experiences and problems on this board she has made an important life decision. She has a very ambitious goal of becoming a lawyer specializing in water law.\n\nSierra described how the VTEC students work on projects and tasks relevant to the current shortage of ground water. Though it may sound a bit simplistic, the students are learning how to determine how many animals can be supported by a limited-production water well. They also mentioned they were studying how to alleviate drought and how difficult that will be.\n\nBy the time my wife and I were on our way home, I was convinced I'd met some very good kids. I'd spoken to high school aged students who could answer a question with something other than a shrug, and a mumbled, \"I dunno.\" I had also spoken to youngsters who were not farm kids looking at equipment they saw every day. There were certainly students on the grounds who live on farms. But when we can educate both farm and non-farm kids of both the value and benefits of a life in agriculture, as well as the problems, the future looks a bit more encouraging.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "California, Central Valley, business, San Joaquin Valley, Great Central Valley, news, urban sprawl, rural, real estate, housing, farming, dairy, agribusiness, cotton, oil, gasoline, ethanol, biodiesel, alternative fuels, prices, Kern, Tulare, Kings, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Mariposa, Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Stockton, Modesto, Merced, Visalia, Portervile, Bakersfield, Schwarzenegger", "distribution": "global", "description": "Central Valley Business Times.
