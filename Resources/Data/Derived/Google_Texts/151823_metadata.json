So, when our friends in the press ran headlines about how most Americans had heard \u201cnothing at all\u201d about President Obama\u2019s recent surveillance reforms, I would have been surprised by exactly the opposite.\n\nLet\u2019s take a trip down the rabbit hole of America\u2019s civic knowledge and whether it matters to a functioning democratic state.\n\nMost Americans Haven\u2019t Heard Of [Insert Issue Here]\n\nPew surveys released fresh stats about the number of Americans who approve of the National Security Agency\u2019s dragnet program, along with a pie chart showing that 50% had heard \u201cnothing at all\u201d about President Obama\u2019s proposed reforms.\n\nTo political pollsters, results like this would be a regular Tuesday. Indeed, it was almost embarrassingly easy to find the exact same results for any given issue.\n\n\u2013Fewer than 25% of Californians knew \u201cmuch at all\u201d about the massive healthcare overhaul, the Affordable Care Act, that impacts every single American.\n\n\u2014Fewer than half of parents with children in public schools knew anything about the Common Core Standards, arguably one of the most radical overhauls of education in at least 50 years.\n\n\u2014A measly 39% of Republicans who think the 2012 attacks on an embassy in Benghazi was the \u201cbiggest political scandal in American history\u201d could identify that event took place in a country called Libya.\n\n\u2013For kicks, 41% of Americans cannot ID their folksy deputy commander-in-chief, Vice President Joe Biden\n\nPolls Get More Disturbing/Hilarious\n\nIn truth, polls may be radically overestimating Americans\u2019 knowledge. Respondents are known to offer strong feelings for policies that do not actually exist. To test the extremes of this fact in the most disturbing/hilarious possible fashion, I conducted a national poll to see how Americans thought about military intervention in an imaginary country. This was around the time when the president was debating forceful humanitarian intervention in Syria.\n\nA whopping 63% of Americans polled had an opinion, either for or against, helping out the good people of \u201cGuavastan\u201d. Guavastan, not yet an actual place, is a luxury island I hope to inhabit after striking it rich in the field of journalism.\n\nSome folks got our little joke. One respondent quipped, \u201cguavastan\u2026is that near papaya ville\u201d. Others just had a knee-jerk reaction, \u201cwho can prove if they used biological weapons some news sources say pictures are a hoax?\u201d The results were dispiriting to say the least.\n\nHere\u2019s the point: mathematically speaking, Americans are bigger fans of believing things than knowing things.\n\nDoes It Matter?\n\nIt\u2019s nice rhetorical fodder to call for greater American civil involvement, but it\u2019s not entirely clear that an informed America is a different America. In 1998, two Political Scientists, Arthur Lupia and Mathew McCubbins found the beliefs of politically ignorant Americans correlate nicely with their more informed counterparts. Indeed, this is exactly how a representative democracy is supposed to function.\n\nThey write:\n\n\u201cThe assumption is that people can make reliable predictions about the consequences of their actions only if they know a detailed set of facts about these actions. If this assumption is true, then it must also be true that reasoned choices can be made only by ambulatory encyclopedias\u2013people who can store and quickly retrieve a detailed set of facts about every decision they make. If, however, the assumption is false, then even individuals who cannot answer simple survey questions or explain the details of proposed legislation may nevertheless be capable of reasoned choice.\u201d\n\nExperimental evidence seems to (partly) corroborate this finding. One of my favorite Political Scientists, Alan Gerber, randomly assigned a group of citizens to receive a free subscription to the Washington Post. In the depressingly titled paper \u201cDoes The Media Matter\u201d, his team found no effect of either paper on political knowledge, stated opinions, or turnout in post-election survey and voter data.\u201d\n\nGerber and others [PDF] have found that informed people tend to shift their favor towards the Democratic Party, which may lead to increased to support for laws focusing on lower socioeconomic status individuals.\n\nTo be sure, other democracies around the world are more engaged and civil, but it\u2019s largely because they either have a multi-party system or a robust informal civil society. No country on earth is an informed Utopia\u2013or anything close.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m more optimistic that information does matter. So, TechCrunch is also conducting its own experiment, partnering with Reframe.it and the Knight Foundation on a so-called \u201cdeliberative poll.\u201d Deliberative polls are a snapshot of what Americans would think about an issue if they were educated. A random, representative sample of the population is intensively educated about an issue and then we record how opinions shift.\n\nIn previous deliberative polls conducted by Stanford, there have been some shifts in opinion which suggest that yes, information does matter.\n\nWhen it comes to tech issues, TechCrunch will find out, hopefully soon.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/gregory-ferenstein/\" title=\"Posts by Gregory Ferenstein\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Gregory Ferenstein</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ferenstein\" rel=\"external\">@ferenstein</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "Let\u2019s face it: a disturbingly large portion of the American electorate are not-so-knowledgable\u00a0about their world.
