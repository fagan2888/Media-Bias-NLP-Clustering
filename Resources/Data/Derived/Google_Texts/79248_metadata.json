BT stuns Sky and ITV after bidding \u00a3900million to screen live Champions League games\n\n\n\nBT says it wants to make football more 'accessible and affordable'\n\nWill screen a number of matches involving British teams for free\n\nFirst time a single UK broadcaster has won exclusive rights\n\nBritish Telecom yesterday delivered the biggest shake-up in football broadcasting in two decades.\n\n\n\nBT Sport left rivals BSkyB and ITV stunned after bidding almost \u00a3900 million for the rights to screen live Champions League and Europa League matches.\n\n\n\nThe telecoms giant will show a number of matches for free, including the finals of both competitions, in a deal that will cost the channel \u00a3299 million per season for three seasons from 2015-16.\n\n\n\nArsenal's Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey (right) celebrates scoring the opening goal with Arsenal's German midfielder Mesut Ozil (left): Champions League and Europa League matches will now be screened by BT\n\nBT has already secured the rights to show 38 live Premier League games a season and is now hoping that the new deal will greatly increase its subscribers and encourage more customers to buy broadband, phone and television services from them.\n\n\n\nLive Champions League matches are currently shared between ITV and Sky Sports, but from 2015 they will only be shown on BT Sport.\n\n\n\nBT promised to make football \u2018more accessible and affordable\u2019 and said it will show a match involving each participating British team for free every season.\n\n\n\nWhile BT said it was the first time a single UK broadcaster had won the exclusive live rights to all matches from the two tournaments, BSkyB said the deal was \u2018far in excess\u2019 of its own valuation.\n\n\n\nBT chief executive Gavin Patterson said: \u2018I am thrilled BT Sport will be the only place where fans can enjoy all the live action from the Champions League and Europa League.\u2019\n\n\n\nBayern Munich's Arjen Robben with the Champions League trophy\n\nJohn Petter, head of BT\u2019s consumer division, said: \u2018Our research showed that half of all homes in the country would like to watch more premier sport but one in five will not pay the \u00a340 or so that Sky charges.\u2019\n\n\n\nBT\u2019s victory is the most significant event in football broadcasting since 1992, when BSkyB acquired the rights to broadcast live fixtures from the newly formed Premier League in a deal worth \u00a3304 million over five years\n\n\n\nIn a statement, BSkyB said BT had \u2018overpaid\u2019. \u2018We bid with a clear view of what the rights are worth to us. It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation,\u2019 it said.\n\n\n\n\u2018There are many ways in which we can invest in our service for customers. We take a disciplined approach and there is always a level at which we will choose to focus on something else. If we thought it was worth more, we\u2019d have paid more.\n\n\n\n\u2018Nothing changes until 2015 and we look forward to 18 more months of live Champions League on Sky Sports. We will now redeploy resources and continue to bring customers the best choice of TV across our offering.\u2019\n\n\n\nMr Patterson said BT Sport is not charging existing broadband customers to watch live Premier League football but will be charging for some Champion League games from 2015, although no pricing structure has been published.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Snatch,Day,BT,stuns,Sky,ITV,bidding,900million,screen,live,Champions,League,games", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2496241/Snatch-Day-BT-stuns-Sky-ITV-bidding-900million-screen-live-Champions-League-games.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "BT Sport left rivals BSkyB and ITV stunned after bidding almost \u00a3900 million for the rights to screen live Champions League and Europa League matches.", "title": "BT bids \u00a3900million to screen live Champions League games", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2496241/Snatch-Day-BT-stuns-Sky-ITV-bidding-900million-screen-live-Champions-League-games.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/09/article-2496241-1A00A037000005DC-410_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "keywords": "Snatch,Day,BT,stuns,Sky,ITV,bidding,900million,screen,live,Champions,League,games", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2496241, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2013-11-09T22:53:20.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Ian+Gallagher+for+The+Mail+on+Sunday", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-11-09T22:53:20.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Snatch Day BT stuns Sky ITV bidding 900million screen live Champions League games"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "BT Sport left rivals BSkyB and ITV stunned after bidding almost \u00a3900 million for the rights to screen live Champions League and Europa League matches.", "title": "BT bids \u00a3900million to screen live Champions League games", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2496241/Snatch-Day-BT-stuns-Sky-ITV-bidding-900million-screen-live-Champions-League-games.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/09/article-2496241-1A00A037000005DC-410_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "BT Sport left rivals BSkyB and ITV stunned after bidding almost \u00a3900 million for the rights to screen live Champions League and Europa League matches."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde4a6\"", "article_summary": "BT Sport left rivals BSkyB and ITV stunned after bidding almost \u00a3900 million for the rights to screen live Champions League and Europa League matches.\n\u2018Nothing changes until 2015 and we look forward to 18 more months of live Champions League on Sky Sports.\nLive Champions League matches are currently shared between ITV and Sky Sports, but from 2015 they will only be shown on BT Sport.\nBT stuns Sky and ITV after bidding \u00a3900million to screen live Champions League gamesBT says it wants to make football more 'accessible and affordable'Will screen a number of matches involving British teams for freeFirst time a single UK broadcaster has won exclusive rightsBritish Telecom yesterday delivered the biggest shake-up in football broadcasting in two decades.\nBT promised to make football \u2018more accessible and affordable\u2019 and said it will show a match involving each participating British team for free every season."}
