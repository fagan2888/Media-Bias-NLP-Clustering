On Tuesday, communities around the D.C. Metro area will spend the night out in hopes of sending a message: bonds among neighbors keep communities safe.

The 31st annual "National Night Out" promotes public safety across the country and gets neighborhoods together in the spirit of fighting crime.

From cookouts to block parties to candlelight vigils, a slew of neighborhoods in Virginia, Maryland and D.C. are gearing up for their own celebrations.

In Fairfax, the county police department asks residents to lock their doors, turn on outside lights and spend the evening outside together. Along with activities for kids and anti-crime rallies, there will be meet-and-greets with police officers.

"This is a wonderful opportunity for diverse communities in our area to interact with sheriff’s deputies in friendly settings and get to know us better," Fairfax County Sheriff Stacey Kincaid said. “It is also a chance for us to listen to community concerns so that we may better serve the public.”

If you're in the Queen Anne's County area, you can join the Centreville Police Department in a "night out" on Lawyers Row.
