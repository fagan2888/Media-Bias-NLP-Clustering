Scott Applewhite Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) is not happy that his home state of Florida is now a marriage equality state. \u201cIf they wanted to change that law,\u201d he told Politico Wednesday, \u201cthey should have gone to the legislature or back to the Constitution and try to change it. I don\u2019t agree we should be trying to make those changes through the courts.\u201d In fact, he went as far as to say, \u201cI don\u2019t agree the courts have the power to do this.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because Rubio simply doesn\u2019t agree with how courts have been ruling on the question of same-sex marriage. \u201cI do not believe that there is a U.S. Constitutional right to same-sex marriage,\u201d he explained to reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s unconstitutional. I just don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a constitutional right to it.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s ideas about what the courts should and should not do seem to align perfectly with his own opinions about whether certain laws are constitutional or not. In his very public opposition to Obamacare, he has regularly called on the courts to strike down a law he and his fellow Republicans failed to repeal countless times in Congress. For example, when a federal court in Florida ruled against what Rubio called \u201cObamaCare\u2019s unconstitutional federal health insurance mandate\u201d back in 2011, he applauded the decision.\n\nLast February, he joined Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and others in submitting an amicus brief urging a federal court to rule against Obamacare in a different case that had to do with whether the law can provide subsidies to people if they enroll in health insurance through a federal website. Rubio also signed onto an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to allow companies like Hobby Lobby to opt out of conctraceptive coverage if they have a religious objection. When the Court ruled as such last summer, he praised the decision as a \u201cre-affirmation of America\u2019s commitment to religious freedom.\u201d\n\nRubio has used religion and \u201creligious freedom\u201d to defend his opposition to marriage equality, admitting that he believes homosexuality is a sin, rejecting the idea it should be illegal to fire someone for being LGBT, and defending opponents of marriage equality as the victims of intolerance. In his soon-to-be released book, Rubio explains that he believes marriage should be defined as one man and one woman for the sole reason that he believes \u201cthe ideal setting for children to grow up in is with a mother and a father committed to each other, living together and sharing responsibility of raising their children.\u201d\n\nWhen U.S. District Court Judge Robert L. Hinkle ruled against Florida\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage back in August, he made it clear that the states\u2019 rights argument was \u201ca nonstarter.\u201d Noting that the founders\u2019 goal in drafting the U.S. Constitution was \u201cto secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity,\u201d Hinkle dismissed the arguments against marriage equality as \u201can obvious pretext for discrimination.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "According to Sen.
