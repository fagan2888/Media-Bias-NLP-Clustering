Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) speaks at an event Thursday in Cedar Falls, Iowa, during his two-day campaign swing. (Matthew Putney/AP)\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, pacing as he always does when making a stump speech, looked out on a room packed with people and made note of the furniture.\n\n\u201cThe reason I\u2019m optimistic is because we ran out of chairs,\u201d Cruz (R-Tex.) said to the crowd at the Longbranch Hotel, some in straight-backed chairs, others massed in the back.\n\nIt\u2019s a line Cruz would use more than once on his first trip to Iowa as a declared presidential candidate, underscoring his status as an emerging top-tier contender in the crowded 2016 race.\n\nOn a two-day, five-stop swing that took him from Sioux City to Dubuque County, Cruz was greeted by enthusiastic crowds packed into stuffy auditoriums and large ballrooms. Sporting a wireless microphone, he has honed his primary pitch to voters \u2014 it involves a lot of gesticulating \u2014 and looks more comfortable on the trail than before. He chuckles after his own jokes and a self-satisfied smile came each time the crowd applauded or shouted \u201cAmen\u201d after he called for the repeal of Obamacare or the Common Core education standards.\n\nCruz is the first major presidential contender to announce his candidacy, and he is having a moment. He has broken into the top tier of candidates, according to recent polls \u2014 including a Washington Post-ABC News survey this week showing him trailing only Jeb Bush among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents.\n\nCruz speaks Wednesday during a GOP reception in Durango, Iowa. (Nicki Kohl/AP)\n\n[Ted Cruz: Principled or smug know-it-all?]\n\nCruz is also surprising many with his ability to raise money, pulling in $4 million during the first eight days of his campaign. The majority of the contributions came from small-dollar donations, while 300 donors maxed out on their contributions.\n\nThis weekend, the campaign purchased television advertising time nationally on Fox News\n\nduring \u201cKilling Jesus,\u201d a \u00addocumentary-style adaptation of Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s book, and statewide in Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina during NBC\u2019s \u201cA.D.: The Bible Continues\u201d on Easter Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to lock in those gains now and communicate about the message,\u201d a Cruz adviser said.\n\nCruz\u2019s ad, which speaks of the \u201ctransformative love of Jesus Christ,\u201d illustrates his campaign\u2019s focus on courting voters who are motivated by faith, including evangelicals here in Iowa, Catholics in New Hampshire and Southern Baptists in South Carolina. He calls for a \u201cgrass-roots army\u201d of conservatives to support him and talks about broadening his appeal to libertarians and so-called \u201cReagan Democrats.\u201d\n\nCruz spent a good deal of time on the trail talking about religious freedom, praising a law passed in Indiana aimed at shielding businesses from having to participate in same-sex weddings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say it has not been a profile in courage seeing some of the leaders running and scurrying\u201d to change the legislation, he said. \u201cDefending religious liberty is not a fringe view, it is a basic American value.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) speaks Wednesday in Sioux City, Iowa. (Nati Harnik/AP)\n\nCruz is making defending things, from the Constitution to values, a centerpiece of his campaign, casting himself as a solitary figure who relishes fighting and leading in a way other likely challengers do not.\n\n\u201cHow many of those issues have those individuals stood up and led?\u201d Cruz said in Sioux City when asked how he will show he has enough executive experience to be president. \u201cFor most of them you can find one issue, maybe two.\u201d\n\n[Five myths about Ted Cruz.]\n\nAt the same time, Cruz has been loath to hit at other prospective candidates by name, calling them friends or people he respects. He did poke Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) for voting not to overhaul a surveillance program that collects bulk records of phone calls.\n\nHe has also emphasized his hawkish views on foreign policy, castigating the framework for an Iranian nuclear deal reached this week and vowing to root out Islamic extremism.\n\nCruz\u2019s appearances often have the feel of a revival meeting, and they seemed even more upbeat than usual this week, with crowds yelling \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s right\u201d and \u201cAmen\u201d after he made a point. In Des Moines, a man in a shirt with American flags printed on it loudly praised Cruz after he said he bucked George W. Bush on an issue, and others guffawed when he talked about his precocious daughter or took a dig at Vice President Biden.\n\nCruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, was just as popular as her husband. Throngs of voters lined up to meet her after Cruz\u2019s speeches, asking her to pose for photos or sign books.\n\nMany in the crowds said they were coming to check out Cruz because they like him and are intrigued by his staunch conservatism. Others said they have already made up their minds to support him.\n\nMany also asked pointed questions, including two people at different locations who asked Cruz how he would handle undocumented immigrants who remain in the country. Cruz, who decries President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration reform as \u201cillegal amnesty,\u201d said the answer is to first secure the border then \u201chave a discussion\u201d about what to do with people who remain.\n\nBob Eft of Waterloo said he likes what Cruz had to say, but is concerned that he\u2019s not going to raise enough money to stay in the race. A man standing next to him chimed in.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s real. I really do,\u201d said Danny Michael, also of Waterloo. \u201cYou know why? Because the other guys hate him.\u201d\n\nAdam Vandall, 34, said he is fully behind Cruz\u2019s campaign and has never supported a candidate this early in the process.\n\nMotioning to a packed ballroom at a Holiday Inn next to the Des Moines airport, Vandall asked, \u201cHow many presidential candidates 10, 11 months out from the caucus have this big of a crowd?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Texas senator has vaulted to the top tier of the GOP field with a base-rousing message.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Texas senator has vaulted to the top tier of the GOP field with a base-rousing message.", "title": "In a swing across Iowa, Ted Cruz packs in the crowds with a conservative call", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-a-swing-across-iowa-ted-cruz-packs-in-the-crowds-with-a-conservative-call/2015/04/03/9852d37c-da27-11e4-8103-fa84725dbf9d_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/03/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Cruz-02366-3796.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@katiezez"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-a-swing-across-iowa-ted-cruz-packs-in-the-crowds-with-a-conservative-call/2015/04/03/9852d37c-da27-11e4-8103-fa84725dbf9d_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "9852d37c-da27-11e4-8103-fa84725dbf9d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ea2\"", "article_summary": "Republican Presidential candidate Sen.
