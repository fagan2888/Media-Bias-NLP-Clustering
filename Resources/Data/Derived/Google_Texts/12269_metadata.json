Montepare, director of the RoseMary B. Fuss Center for Research on Aging and Intergenerational Studies at Lasell College in Massachusetts.\n\nTwo decades ago, Montepare conducted a study linking a woman's perceived age \u2014 how old she feels herself to be \u2014 and her body image. Repeating the study recently, she found that women are even harder on themselves now.\n\n\"As you compare findings across decades, it's an opportunity to think about how social and cultural factors, always in flux, may come into play,\" she noted. \"New images and messages have arisen, particularly the idea that aging should be confronted and battled. More and more age-related products send the message that aging is something to be treated and contained.\"\n\nMontepare suggested that researchers may be part of the problem \u2014 that focusing on how to mediate and mitigate the ravages of growing old can fuel negative self-perceptions among those of us engaged in graying. With so many stern prescriptions about exercise and nutrition and general well-being, how can we mere mortals believe we're doing it right?\n\n\"Researchers are starting to document increases in eating disorders among aging women,\" she said. \"Ultimately, we need to figure out how to make peace with our bodies. I think it's time we made changing these views the next age battle.\"\n\nThe false choice we are currently being handed by society is between \"aging well\" \u2014 that is, staying young \u2014 and giving in to the inevitable decline. But Hanne Laceulle, who writes about the philosophy of aging at the University of Humanistics in the Netherlands, proposed an intriguing third way to think about aging.\n\n\"These age-defying narratives and decline narratives are problematic, as if there is no value of its own in later life,\" she pointed out. \"The age-defying narratives in particular are a self-effacing strategy, because ultimately they are doomed to fail.\"\n\nWhy not, she asked, consider aging simply another process of becoming who you are?\n\nAs with earlier stages of life, this would allow an elder to succeed at some things \u2014 like wisdom or tolerance or humor or love \u2014 and fail at others \u2014 like hearing loss, say, or a hip fracture.\n\nTo me, this idea of freedom to fail as you age is a liberating one. Think of how shamed and embarrassed older adults are made to feel when they fall down, and you can see how unthinkingly we have come to set ourselves up for defeat.\n\nA new approach to aging, Laceulle thinks, \"should be able to acknowledge the potential for growth and flourishing, but also provide a meaningful integration of existential vulnerability, instead of denial or rejection.\"\n\nIn other words, we need to stop blaming ourselves for the physical dependence that comes with age, while acknowledging the loss that an individual feels when this happens. To do this, we need to see aging as a part of life to negotiate like any other.\n\nSo instead of \"active aging\" or \"positive aging\" or \"anti-aging,\" Laceulle thinks we should take a cue from ancient thinkers like Aristotle and embrace what she calls \"virtuous aging.\"\n\nI like her idea, because it allows for both the triumph and the tragedy of human existence at any stage \u2014 instead of insisting that we paper over real pain with happy faces.\n\n\"One of the reasons for returning to Greek philosophy,\" Lacuelle said, \"is that it can acknowledge the fact that humans are aimed at flourishing \u2014 but also, importantly, acknowledges how vulnerable this striving is.\"\n\nBarbara Peters Smith wrote this article supported by a Journalists in Aging Fellowship, a collaboration of New America Media and the Gerontological Society of America, sponsored by the Silver Century Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/12/nyt_olderpeeps20a-cropHF1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9de2\"", "article_summary": "So instead of \"active aging\" or \"positive aging\" or \"anti-aging,\" Laceulle thinks we should take a cue from ancient thinkers like Aristotle and embrace what she calls \"virtuous aging.\"\nBut Hanne Laceulle, who writes about the philosophy of aging at the University of Humanistics in the Netherlands, proposed an intriguing third way to think about aging.\nTo do this, we need to see aging as a part of life to negotiate like any other.\nA new approach to aging, Laceulle thinks, \"should be able to acknowledge the potential for growth and flourishing, but also provide a meaningful integration of existential vulnerability, instead of denial or rejection.\"\nMore and more age-related products send the message that aging is something to be treated and contained.\""}
