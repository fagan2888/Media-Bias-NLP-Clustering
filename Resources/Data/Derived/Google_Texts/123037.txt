The Journal of Neurosurgery Publishing Group is devoting the December 2015 issue of Neurosurgical Focus to "Defining, Measuring, and Predicting Quality in Neurosurgery."

Here are six key thoughts:

1. The publication features 17 articles on systems-based quality improvement for neurosurgery, which focuses on methods to define neurosurgical quality from the perspective of multiple stakeholders, accurately measure that quality and use accumulated data to predict and improve outcomes of care for individuals or patient populations.

2. Neurosurgeon Anthony L. Asher, MD, is the vice president of NeuroPoint Alliance and director of the National Neurosurgery Quality and Outcomes Database.

3. Neurosurgeon John Ratliff, MD, is chair of the AANS/CNS National Quality Council.

4. Dr. Asher said neurosurgery's clinical data collection efforts already have helped demonstrate the effectiveness of neurosurgical care and identify significant care improvement opportunities.

5. According to Dr. Ratliff, neurosurgeons will continue to be at the forefront of understanding quality science and its methods as essential components of modern practice as quality reporting continues to grow in importance in the healthcare system.

6. Some of the key articles in the issue include "The present and future of quality measures and public reporting in neurosurgery," "The National Neurosurgery Quality and Outcomes Database Qualified Clinical Data Registry: 2015 measure specifications rationale" and "Neurosurgery value and quality in the context of the Affordable Care Act: a policy perspective."
