In saying it does not, Mr. Laycock recast the organizations\u2019 arguments, asserting that they would object even if the government required insurers to provide the contraceptives and abortifacients and the organizations \u201cwere not required to provide insurance.\u201d A religious organization might advance such a sweeping argument if the occasion were to arise, but it has not.\n\nThe more difficult issues are whether the mandate advances a compelling public interest and, if so, in the least intrusive way.\n\nWilliam H.
