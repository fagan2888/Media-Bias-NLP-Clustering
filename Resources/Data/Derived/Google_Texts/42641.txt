FARMINGTON, N.M. (AP) — A Farmington woman is behind held in Colorado on charges that she caused a crash that left one woman dead.

The Daily Times in Farmington reported (http://bit.ly/1YEH8Ce) Thursday that 36-year-old Yolanda Griswold remains held on $10,000 bond in Durango.

According to court records, she is facing charges of vehicular homicide, vehicular assault and reckless driving for the Dec. 11 accident near the New Mexico state line.

Colorado State Patrol officials say Griswold rear-ended 25-year-old Jenny Luccous’ vehicle. The impact caused Luccous’ car to collide with an oncoming pickup truck.

Luccous was killed.

Her 12-year-old son, 32-year-old boyfriend and a passenger in the truck were treated for minor injuries.

Authorities say Griswold was using her cellphone and speeding at the time.

It was not known Friday if Griswold had an attorney.
