The standoff could lead to a shutdown of the government after the fiscal year ends on Monday night.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act \"is a train wreck, and it's going to raise costs,\" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. \"It's destroying American jobs, and it must go.\"\n\nObama's appearance at the Clinton Global Initiative also comes two decades after President Clinton proposed his own national health care plan during a speech to Congress on Sept. 23, 1993.\n\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will introduce the two presidents before the forum.\n\nAs his administration launches a renewed health care campaign, Obama himself will speak on the subject again Thursday in Maryland.\n\nIn the days ahead, first lady Michelle Obama will speak to groups of mothers and veterans about signing up for health coverage.\n\nOther upcoming health care events: Vice President Biden will hold a conference call with nurses, and Obama will speak by phone with mayors and other state and local officials from across the country.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1fdKlXY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Facing a pivotal time for his signature health care law, President Obama will promote the program during a forum Tuesday hosted by predecessor Bill Clinton.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Facing a pivotal time for his signature health care law, President Obama will promote the program during a forum Tuesday hosted by predecessor Bill Clinton.", "title": "Obama to tout health care plan at Clinton forum", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/09/23/obama-clinton-health-care-plan-republicans/2857715/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Facing a pivotal time for his signature health care law, President Obama will promote the program during a forum Tuesday hosted by predecessor Bill Clinton.", "title": "Obama to tout health care plan at Clinton forum", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d3da1da8bf02ceb266678c0265d5f931ac92dcd5/c=284-0-1716-1434&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/09/23/1379975716000-AP-APTOPIX-Obama-2012-002.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html;
