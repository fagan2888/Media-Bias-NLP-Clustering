In the end, their celebrations proved premature, with final counts apportioning the FI some 3.1 percent of the vote. But the surprisingly strong performance of their party -- headed by Gudrun Schyman, a former contestant of the Swedish version of Dancing with the Stars, who\u2019d campaigned alongside ABBA\u2019s Benny Andersson and Pharrell Williams (of \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d notoriety) -- was enough to win the FI headlines the world over the next day.\n\nFounded in 2005, the FI aims to put gender issues squarely and explicitly at the top of Sweden\u2019s political agenda. In particular, Schyman says, she founded the party to tackle pay inequality in Sweden -- where women now earn 86 percent as much as men for the same work, a mere two-percentage-point improvement over the past decade. Schyman\u2019s message has apparently resonated across Sweden: since January, its membership has shot from 1,500 to 18,000, giving it the fourth-largest roster among Swedish political parties. In May, it became the first-ever feminist party to send a representative to the European Parliament, garnering over five percent of the vote nationwide and more than 30 percent in some of the country\u2019s most left-wing districts in cities such as Malm\u00f6. Among those who voted for the FI in those elections, some 70 percent were under age 25 -- making it a truly singular", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sweden's Feminist Initiative party aims to put gender issues squarely at the top of Sweden's political agenda.
