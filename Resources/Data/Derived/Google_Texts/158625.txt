As Twitchy reported yesterday, Hillary Clinton was speaking at an event in Massachusetts where she claimed that corporations and businesses don’t create jobs, which is why the minimum wage needs to be increased, or something.

She also equated the belief that businesses create jobs with “trickle-down economics,” which has been “tried” and “failed,” according to Clinton.

Jon Lovitz pointed out the painfully obvious to Clinton:

Hillary Clinton, "Don't let anybody tell you businesses & corporations create jobs." Huh? That's not trickle down, that's who hires people. — Jon Lovitz (@realjonlovitz) October 25, 2014

“What difference does it make?” Plenty!

@realjonlovitz She and Pelosi sold Obamacare as trickle-down prosperity. Now she disses the concept? SMH — Guy Valkyrie (@wikistan) October 25, 2014

As Hillary gears up for 2016, expect even more of these ridiculous claims.
