Ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease are the most common forms. People with Crohn\u2019s have inflammation throughout the entire digestive tract, while in ulcerative colitis, only the large intestine is inflamed.\n\nPrevious research has linked smoking to an increased risk of Crohn\u2019s disease and its complications but has also suggested that smokers are at lower risk for ulcerative colitis, Ducharme-Benard and colleagues note in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology.\n\nFor the current study, researchers questioned 182 people with Crohn\u2019s and 77 people with ulcerative colitis about their diagnosis, symptoms, smoking history, and understanding of how tobacco use might relate to development of their disease or to complications or recurrences.\n\nMost patients in the study were white and female, and they were typically in their 40s.\n\nCompared to patients with ulcerative colitis, patients with Crohn\u2019s used more corticosteroids and other medications to manage symptoms, and they had more hospital admissions, surgeries, and time missed from work as a result of their disease. But both groups were about equally likely to considered their disease to be well controlled.\n\nOverall, 20 percent of study participants were current smokers and 40 percent were former smokers. A greater proportion of people with Crohn\u2019s were current smokers, while there were more former smokers among the patients with ulcerative colitis.\n\nLess than half of Crohn\u2019s patients and just 10 percent of people with ulcerative colitis could correctly explain to researchers how smoking influenced their risk of getting their disease, and the proportions were similar for their understanding of complications tied to smoking.\n\nMost smokers who were informed about the effects of the habit on their disease told researchers they intended to quit, compared with less than half of the participants who didn\u2019t understand the risks.\n\n\u201cPeople think of Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis as \u2018bowel only\u2019 problems and cigarette smoking as causing \u2018lung problems\u2019 and look at them separately,\u201d Dr. Miguel Regueiro, who leads the IBD clinical program at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, said by email.\n\nOne limitation of the study is its reliance on patients to accurately recall and report their smoking habits, the researchers acknowledge.\n\nBut the message for patients should still be clear, Dr. Gilaad Kaplan, a gastroenterology researcher at the University of Calgary in Alberta, said by email.\n\n\u201cThe most important step that an individual can take to prevent IBD is not to smoke in the first place,\u201d added Kaplan, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cAmong smokers who are diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease, quitting smoking is an action that they can take for themselves to improve their health,\u201d Kaplan said.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Rapaport)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "patients, dont, realize, smoking, worsens, inflammatory, bowel, disease", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Doctors know smoking can increase the risk for certain common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but many patients haven\u2019t gotten the message, a new study suggests.", "title": "Patients Don\u2019t Realize Smoking Worsens Inflammatory Bowel Disease", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/patients-dont-realize-smoking-worsens-inflammatory-bowel-disease-348254", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/18/shutterstock232964731.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors know smoking can increase the risk for certain common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but many patients haven\u2019t gotten the message, a new study suggests.", "title": "Patients Don\u2019t Realize Smoking Worsens Inflammatory Bowel Disease", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/patients-dont-realize-smoking-worsens-inflammatory-bowel-disease-348254", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/18/shutterstock232964731.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/18/shutterstock232964731.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-18T10:55:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-18T10:55:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Doctors know smoking can increase the risk for certain common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but many patients haven\u2019t gotten the message, a new study suggests."}, "article_summary": "A study suggests that although doctors know that smoking can increase the risk of inflammatory diseases, patients don't know this.\nOut of 239 patients with two common types of IBD - Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis - only half were aware of the smoking risks associated with these conditions.\nUlcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease are the most common forms.\nPhoto courtesy of Shutterstock(Reuters Health) - Doctors know smoking can increase the risk for certain common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but many patients haven\u2019t gotten the message, a new study suggests.\n\u201cAmong smokers who are diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease, quitting smoking is an action that they can take for themselves to improve their health,\u201d Kaplan said."}
