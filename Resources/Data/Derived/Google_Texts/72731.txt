Firefighters battled a three-alarm condominium fire Sunday night, Dallas Fire-Rescue said.

The fire began about 7:50 p.m. at a 3-story complex in the 4500 block of Gilbert Avenue, near Wycliff Avenue, department spokesman Jason Evans said.

Firefighters arrived to find fire coming out of the top of a chimney. While they worked to extinguish the blaze, the floor gave way and a firefighter fell through to the level below, he said.

He was transported to a hospital with an injury that was not believed to be life-threatening and was released Sunday night, Evans said. No other injuries were reported.

Some units were evacuated as a precaution. The fire was extinguished by 10:30 p.m.

Three condos were uninhabitable and an unknown number of people were displaced. The American Red Cross was on the scene to help.

Investigators determined the fire began accidentally because of a chimney malfunction, Evans said.
