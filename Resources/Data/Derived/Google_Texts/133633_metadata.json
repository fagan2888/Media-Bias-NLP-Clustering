John Cornyn and tighter with the tea party than Rep. Steve Stockman.\n\nA former oilfield worker and business owner from Cleveland, Texas, Stovall is one of seven primary challengers for Cornyn\u2019s seat. With just a few weeks until the March 4 primary, he\u2019s crisscrossing the state and reaching out online, having some success raising funds and gaining supporters.\n\nWhile the outspoken Stockman has claimed the title of the tea party candidate, some tea party groups are going with Stovall, who is much more actively campaigning than the congressman. On Feb. 6, Grassroots America-We the People, a statewide tea party group based in Tyler, endorsed Stovall.\n\nThe group\u2019s executive director, JoAnn Fleming, said Stovall\u2019s constitutional conservative values and opposition to things like Obamacare align perfectly with the group.\n\n\u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, he\u2019s the only viable candidate in the race,\u201d Fleming said. She said the group didn\u2019t even consider Stockman, citing questions about his campaign finances and tendency to pull provocative stunts.\n\nSome local groups are also enthusiastic about Stovall.\n\nRay Myers, chairman of the Kaufman County Tea Party, says his group has also endorsed Stovall.\n\n\u201cStovall didn\u2019t just pop into the scene,\u201d Myers said, contrasting him to Stockman. \u201cHe started working with us five or six months ago. We were having a meeting at my house, and there was a knock on the door. I go to the door, and it\u2019s Dwayne Stovall. He drove 200 miles one way. How many times would you see John Cornyn do that?\u201d\n\nEven that dedication and the attention it gets from political groups is likely to leave Stovall far short of what he needs to compete with Cornyn. The incumbent has millions of dollars to work with \u2014 Stovall had just $28,000 at last count \u2014 along with broad name recognition and the backing of key Republicans around the state.\n\nStill, Stovall strikes a chord with some frustrated Texans. Will Kuhn, 29, a restaurant owner in Addison, is a supporter.\n\n\u201cWashington has become so out of touch with America that it needs everyday, hardworking people, who own businesses or who have worked real jobs,\u201d Kuhn said. \u201cMr. Stovall represents that.\u201d\n\nA large Stovall sign covers the back of Kuhn\u2019s pickup, which he parks on a busy route outside his restaurant.\n\nKuhn shrugs off Stockman as out of touch and says he used to support Cornyn but feels he no longer represents conservative values.\n\nStovall has scheduled appearances at more than a dozen events in the month of February from Arlington to San Antonio to The Woodlands. These events aren\u2019t huge \u2014 they tend to draw about 100 people, Myers said \u2014 but Stovall is doing a lot of them.\n\n\u201cThe last six months I\u2019ve spoken to thousands of people,\u201d he said recently. \u201cThe grassroots movement is absolutely there.\u201d\n\nA relative newcomer to politics, Stovall lost a GOP primary for the state House in 2012 by nearly 5,000 votes. The only elected position he\u2019s held is on his local school board.\n\nEven Stovall\u2019s supporters admit he has a tough road ahead.\n\n\u201cWe know he has a big race, an uphill climb ahead of him,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cBut we want to encourage people of his stature to enter races like this.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@nswartsell", "article_metadata": {"description": "He\u2019s outgunned by incumbent John Cornyn but is crisscrossing the state.", "og": {"description": "He\u2019s outgunned by incumbent John Cornyn but is crisscrossing the state.", "title": "Longshot Senate candidate Dwayne Stovall draws some tea party support", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140208-longshot-senate-candidate-dwayne-stovall-draws-some-tea-party-support.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-02-09T06:18:15Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-02-09T05:01:07Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Longshot Senate candidate Dwayne Stovall draws some tea party support\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140208-longshot-senate-candidate-dwayne-stovall-draws-some-tea-party-support.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1426869\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-09T05:01:07Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"NICK SWARTSELL\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-02-09T05:01:07Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "While the outspoken Stockman has claimed the title of the tea party candidate, some tea party groups are going with Stovall, who is much more actively campaigning than the congressman.\nOn Feb. 6, Grassroots America-We the People, a statewide tea party group based in Tyler, endorsed Stovall.\nRay Myers, chairman of the Kaufman County Tea Party, says his group has also endorsed Stovall.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Dwayne Stovall, a Republican primary candidate for Senate, will drive across Texas to tell you he\u2019s more conservative than Sen.
