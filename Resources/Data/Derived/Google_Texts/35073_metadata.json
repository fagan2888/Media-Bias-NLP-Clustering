Charles E. Schumer announced Wednesday, providing the starkest evidence yet of a family doctor shortage plaguing upstate New York and likely to get worse in the future.\n\nThe state\u2019s four westernmost counties had 74 primary care physicians per 100,000 people in 2010. But by last year, that figure was down to 57 to 100,000 \u2013 a 23 percent drop.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the biggest health care problems that upstate New York faces,\u201d said Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nSchumer, who culled the statistics from the Center for Health Workforce Studies in Albany, announced the numbers while proposing a partial solution: an increase in federally funded training slots for primary care physicians.\n\nHealth industry experts lauded Schumer\u2019s proposal while stressing that they are facing a complex problem stemming from the retirement of baby-boomer doctors, the reluctance of young doctors to go into less lucrative family practices, and a need for care from people who have health coverage for the first time under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe problem is serious, and it\u2019s been serious for a while,\u201d said Dr. Nancy H. Nielsen, a senior associate dean at the University at Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and a former president of the American Medical Association.\n\nNielsen termed Schumer\u2019s numbers \u201cscary.\u201d Not only do they show a precipitous drop in the number of doctors in just three years; they also show that every region in upstate New York is now falling short of an adequate number of primary care physicians, which is generally considered to be 80 doctors per 100,000 residents.\n\nOne big reason for the big drop in general practitioners is simple demographics.\n\n\u201cThe baby boom generation of doctors is retiring, and hospitals are struggling to recruit doctors to fill the ranks,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nNielsen said it\u2019s difficult to recruit young physicians to come to Buffalo unless they have a family connection there already.\n\nOn top of that, health professionals said it is difficult to lure young would-be physicians into general medicine when the specialty medical practices are so much more lucrative.\n\nAccording to a survey by Medscape, which is part of WebMD, the average family doctor earned $176,000 last year \u2013 while the average ophthalmologist took home $291,000 and the average cardiologist was paid $351,000.\n\nGiven that many new doctors graduate with upwards of $200,000 in student debt, \u201cthat may be forcing people to look at other things\u201d rather than general medicine, said Dr. Thomas J. Madejski, a general practitioner from Medina who serves as assistant treasurer of the Medical Society of the State of New York.\n\nIt is all adding up to a family doctor shortage throughout Western New York.\n\nAccording to Schumer\u2019s calculations, in Erie County, the number of general practitioners per 100,000 residents fell from 85 in 2010 to 69 last year.\n\nIn Niagara County, the number fell from 65 to 49. In Chautauqua County, it fell from 81 to 62. And in Cattaraugus County, it fell from 68 to 49.\n\nThe doctor shortage is particularly acute in rural areas, Madejski noted. \u201cI\u2019ve lived with this problem for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cI practice in a rural area, and it\u2019s always been difficult to recruit doctors to come here. But now it\u2019s next to impossible.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the problem is likely to get worse before it gets better.\n\nMore than a million people in New York are getting health coverage they didn\u2019t have before Obamacare, and given the health law\u2019s emphasis on preventive medicine, they are going to need doctors.\n\nMore general practitioners will be required to meet the growing need, Schumer said.\n\nHe has introduced similar legislation before, but he said it is more likely to pass this year because he finally has an appropriate and potentially popular legislative vehicle to attach it to: a bill that would permanently readjust Medicare reimbursement rates for physicians.\n\nSchumer\u2019s bill has the support of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and Rep. Joe Crowley, D-Queens, is pushing a similar measure in the House.\n\nNielsen called Schumer\u2019s bill a good first step, given that doctors often settle in the states where they do their residencies.\n\nAnd Dennis Whalen, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, said he supports Schumer\u2019s measure as well.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the senator\u2019s continued leadership in working to ensure more physicians can be trained to address this shortage head-on, preserving patients\u2019 access to physician services,\u201d Whalen said.\n\nemail: jzremski@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Western New York\u2019s supply of primary care physicians plummeted by nearly a quarter between 2010 and 2013, Sen.
