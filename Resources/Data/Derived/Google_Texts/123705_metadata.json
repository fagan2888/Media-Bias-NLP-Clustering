Nor is it his cheekbone-length golden hair and woody voice, gnarled by the cigarettes that he kindles with a lighter wrapped in yellow tape. It\u2019s not the highlighter, hanging on his chest by a makeshift lanyard, either.\n\nCallister catches the eye because of the legal battles he fights. His law firm\u2019s mantra is \"fight back.\" And the way he fights them, well, is like no one else.\n\nThe 58-year-old attorney specializes in class-action lawsuits and his current battle is against the State of Nevada and Xerox, the company that built flawed software for the state\u2019s health care exchange.\n\nHis case accuses Xerox and the state of negligence in operating the Silver State Exchange, the insurance marketplace operating under the Affordable Care Act in Nevada. The heart of the case is that plaintiffs paid for health insurance without receiving it.\n\nCallister, a former state lawmaker, talked to the Las Vegas Sun about lobbyists, bullfighting and Gov. Brian Sandoval. His answers have been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nIn your opinion, is health care in the U.S. better or worse since the passage of the Affordable Care Act?\n\nI think health care overall is better. Now, people who could not qualify for health care now can. But the jury is still out only because nobody really knows what the ultimate impact of the ACA will be.\n\nYou\u2019re a former state lawmaker. What would you have done differently in creating the laws governing the Silver State Exchange?\n\nWhat you do in all cases \u2014 especially where there is a multimillion-dollar bid for some new, significant piece of computer hardware and software \u2014 is engage in a bid process. I would want the people who judge and determine those bids to be absolutely independent and to have skills and expertise in health care and large scale computing systems. I fear the board was won over by a good lobbying effort. If something should be divorced from a good lobbying effort, it should be this kind of project.\n\nIf you had one question for Gov. Brian Sandoval about the exchange, what would it be?\n\nWhat did his staff know and when did they know it in regards to the failures of Xerox to produce an operational, functional product.\n\nYou once participated in a bullfight in Costa Rica. You were also a state lawmaker and city councilman. What\u2019s more dangerous, dodging horns or a political battle?\n\nA political battle, 10 times over.\n\nAs an attorney, you\u2019re not afraid to speak out and use the media to spread your message. Why is that a part of your philosophy?\n\nWhen you\u2019re dealing with the stuff I enjoy, which is public litigation, you have to use the media in the sense that they are going to get the message out. When you are talking about large group liability action, if you don\u2019t speak to the media you\u2019re foreclosing your best possible ally for getting noticed. There\u2019s no other way to do it.\n\nHow many people do you suspect paid for health insurance without receiving it because of the Xerox software?\n\nThe easy answer is 6,000 on the low end and 10,000 on the high end.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Matt Callister knows how to draw attention.
