A septic truck rolled over on U.S. 60 Saturday, leaving a big, stinky mess behind.

The accident happened on westbound U.S. 60 near Gilbert Road in Mesa.

The truck was carrying a load of porta-potties, when it swerved to avoid a barrel that had fallen off another truck.

As the truck swerved onto the side of the road, it rolled over, sending porta-potties tumbling and spilling waste-filled water all around the area.

We're told it smelled pretty bad.

DPS crews are working to figure out exactly what kind of cleanup is needed.
