(Photo: The Register)Buy Photo\n\nPolio was among the most dreaded childhood diseases of the 20th century. The virus spread from person to person, crippling, paralyzing and sometimes killing its victims. A life-saving vaccine was developed using fetal tissue. Researchers infected fetal kidney cells to produce mass quantities of the virus that were collected, purified and used for inoculations. They won a Nobel Prize for medicine in 1954.\n\nSixty-two years later, some Iowa lawmakers desperately need a refresher on such history. House Study Bill 621 would ban \u201cfetal body parts\u201d from being obtained, provided, transferred or used in this state. Though clearly an anti-abortion stunt, the legislation would prevent fetal tissue from being used by researchers seeking treatments and cures for diseases. Violators \u2014 who would likely be none other than medical providers and scientists \u2014 could land in the slammer for up to 10 years.\n\nThere is no exception in the bill for the University of Iowa, known nationally as a research institution. Rep. Linda Miller, R-Bettendorf, who supports the legislation, said she had recently visited UI and talked with people engaged in research for eye disease. The proposed ban \u201cwas not of any concern to them,\" she said.\n\nThat is difficult to believe.\n\nThe UI is one of dozens of institutions across the country that has used fetal tissue in medical research. From 2011 through 2014, the National Eye Institute provided UI more than $1 million for glaucoma research, landing it 59th among 97 institutions that received federal funding for research involving fetal tissue, according to data compiled by the Associated Press in 2015. The UI researcher whose project was being funded told a reporter last summer that he was not actively using a fetal cell line in his work because he didn\u2019t need it at that stage, but he was not ruling out using the line again. \"We still have it as a backup,\" he said.\n\nNot if some lawmakers have their way. Anyone else seeking fetal tissue and microscopic cells for medical research wouldn't be getting it either. Rep. Miller said she believes embryonic stem cells, for example, represent the \u201chistory\u201d of research. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the future of research.\u201d\n\nReally? How about we leave that to scientists, not politicians, to decide? Because it sure seems the cells extracted from fetal tissue are important in work seeking to treat and cure debilitating diseases.\n\nHuman fetal cells obtained from two abortions in the early 1960s are still growing in labs and used to replicate viruses for the production of vaccines against communicable diseases. Research using fetal tissue shows promise in treatments for spinal cord injuries, macular degeneration and strokes. In 2014, the Harvard Stem Cell Institute reported that cells extracted from fetal tissue and transplanted in the brains of people with Parkinson\u2019s helped them remain healthy and functional for more than a decade. Scientists use this tissue to understand genetic mutations and how the body develops.\n\nLike many legal surgeries, an abortion produces tissue. That tissue can either be discarded or made available to scientists engaged in medical research. A truly \u201cpro-life\u201d lawmaker would support the latter.\n\nHistory repeats itself\n\nAn Iowan can\u2019t help but feel a bit of nauseating d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when reading House Study Bill 621, which bans the transfer and use of fetal tissue. More than a decade ago, Iowa lawmakers banned the creation of stem cells through a process called somatic nuclear transfer. They gathered at the Statehouse, crying, hugging and patting each other on the back while rambling about cloning babies and implications of science many didn\u2019t even understand. It was quite a scene and certainly painful for any person of science to witness.\n\nSoon after the legislation was adopted, cell biologist Mary Hendrix left the University of Iowa for Illinois, taking her research team and millions of federal dollars for cancer research with her. She cited the law as one of the reasons for leaving.\n\nFortunately, lawmakers eventually saw the error of their ways and changed the law to make clear cloning to create stem cells for research was allowed. But the damage was done.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1QJkvhD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Banning the use of fetal tissue jeopardizes medical research", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Banning the use of fetal tissue jeopardizes medical research", "title": "Editorial: Abortion bill is anti-science", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/02/25/editorial-abortion-bill-anti-science/80851782/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Banning the use of fetal tissue jeopardizes medical research", "title": "Editorial: Abortion bill is anti-science", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a032733674bb3242890ce22812214f6584dfa43c/c=300-0-1140-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/12/IowaCity/B9318430553Z.1_20150812204502_000_GQLBK0Q1E.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Parkinson's disease", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Parkinson's disease", "title": "Editorial: Abortion bill is anti-science", "author": "The Register's editorial", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e26cfb82badd8e84cd9db68bc780c54591f1861e/c=405-0-1035-840/local/-/media/2015/08/12/IowaCity/B9318430553Z.1_20150812204502_000_GQLBK0Q1E.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dac7d256a59f84940e502b66fdba9c9126e1eda5/c=300-0-1140-840/local/-/media/2015/08/12/IowaCity/B9318430553Z.1_20150812204502_000_GQLBK0Q1E.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ea01a6a00dbd2496de65f37025887b7eaa790f77/c=160-0-1280-840/local/-/media/2015/08/12/IowaCity/B9318430553Z.1_20150812204502_000_GQLBK0Q1E.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bd64435675ed77d92ee7226039c86a4975acbcd1/c=0-15-1440-825&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/12/IowaCity/B9318430553Z.1_20150812204502_000_GQLBK0Q1E.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-02-25T21:35:32.530000-06:00", "shorthed": "Editorial: Abortion bill is anti-science", "articleid": 80851782, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf590beeec04e793cbf8e7ec6bbd1a1289afc9ba/c=0-15-1440-825/local/-/media/2015/08/12/IowaCity/B9318430553Z.1_20150812204502_000_GQLBK0Q1E.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a7e9250d0c4461d31b889d1561416dbe34fc853/c=484-0-956-840/local/-/media/2015/08/12/IowaCity/B9318430553Z.1_20150812204502_000_GQLBK0Q1E.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Research using fetal tissue shows promise in treatments for spinal cord injuries, macular degeneration and strokes.\nA life-saving vaccine was developed using fetal tissue.\nThe UI is one of dozens of institutions across the country that has used fetal tissue in medical research.\nHistory repeats itselfAn Iowan can\u2019t help but feel a bit of nauseating d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when reading House Study Bill 621, which bans the transfer and use of fetal tissue.\nBuy Photo The University of Iowa is one of dozens of institutions across the country that uses fetal tissue in medical research."}
