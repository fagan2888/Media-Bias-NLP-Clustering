Kim Bay.\n\nShe said the call was dispatched as shots fired, but first responders found a man with gunshot wounds in an apartment. Bay said officers provided first aid and CPR on the victim until he was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nAt the time of this report, no suspect is in custody, according to Bay. She said detectives have multiple witnesses to interview, so the investigation will run long into the night.\n\nSeveral neighbors at the complex said they've been concerned with crime in the area for several years. One long-time resident said the deadly shooting was a \"last straw\" for her and she's moving out after 17 years in the neighborhood.\n\nStay with Tucson News Now for the latest info on this case.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
