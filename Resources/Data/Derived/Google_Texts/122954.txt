The National Transportation Safety Board is resuming its search for the data recorder of the sunken El Faro cargo ship.

The 790-foot freighter sank last October after losing engine power and getting caught in a major hurricane en route from Jacksonville to San Juan, Puerto Rico. All 33 aboard died.

In a statement Sunday, NTSB officials say their goal is to find the data recorder and "better document the wreckage to help determine exactly why and how the ship sank." The latest search effort will begin Monday when a "research vessel" departs from Charleston, S.C., and heads to the wreckage site near the Bahamas. The ship was found in 15,000 feet of water, its top two bridge decks detached.

Investigators will use an underwater vehicle to help locate the data recorder.
