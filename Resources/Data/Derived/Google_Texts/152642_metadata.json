Negotiators from both parties are seeking to bring down the country\u2019s projected deficits as part of an agreement to keep the government open and prevent default on the national debt.\n\nIdeally, we will not ride right up to the edge of the abyss, so close that as long as we live we cannot forget how it felt to stare down into the chasm of financial ruin and panic, so close that the churn in our stomachs never fully settles, always hanging there, a reminder that there is madness and chaos inside of us, held at bay but never vanquished.\n\nBut that\u2019s wishful thinking. So in a few months, when we are hours away from a self-imposed deadline, I hope that one way we can close the gap between the parties and reduce our deficits \u2013 without higher tax rates or further cuts to cancer research or education for children with disabilities \u2013 is finally legalizing marijuana and ending a pointless, cruel and expensive policy once and for all.\n\nYes, marijuana should be legal and heavily regulated. This is obviously true. Unlike alcohol or tobacco, marijuana is not a leading factor in cancer, liver disease, domestic abuse or car accidents. It is also far less addictive than our legal drugs or prescription drugs like OxyContin or Percocet. And yet we arrest almost a million people every year simply for having this relatively benign substance in their pockets, an injustice tolerated in part because the execution of this irrational policy is felt far more by the poor and voiceless than it is by the governing class.\n\nBut here\u2019s what else marijuana prohibition does: Enforcing this policy costs the federal government and state and local governments roughly $10 billion each year. If we include the failure to tax marijuana as we tax tobacco and alcohol, the opportunity cost of prohibition is closer to $20 billion each year, and some argue it is actually far higher.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of money. That\u2019s a lot of money even on the scale of our budget deficits. For example, one perennial option for how to reduce the long-term deficit is to raise the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67. Now, this is a stupid policy choice. First, it doesn\u2019t actually reduce our nation\u2019s healthcare spending. In fact, because Medicare is more efficient at providing coverage than private insurers, more spending, not less, will likely end up in the growing slice of the economic pie devoted to healthcare \u2013 all in the name of a wealth transfer from seniors to insurance companies.\n\nBut it also barely reduces the government\u2019s healthcare spending. That\u2019s because seniors under 67 are healthier than the typical Medicare beneficiary, and many of those seniors would get a tax credit through the Affordable Care Act or coverage through Medicaid. So this saves the federal government less than $3 billion each year over the next decade. Yet this is one of the major proposals that circulates every time we consider a budget deal. It was rumored to be part of the failed negotiations between President Obama and Speaker Boehner in 2011. It was included in the latest white paper by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, the co-chairs of \u201cFix the Debt,\u201d a conservative nonprofit in Washington.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Billions saved from ending prohibition could bring down the budget deficit.
