Duly noted.)\n\n(OFA Update 2: A statement from OFA: \u201cWe neither support nor approve of the inappropriate language used in a sign on the mall today. OFA believes that John Boehner should stand up to the extreme wing in his party, pay their bills and end this now.\u201d Whereas I believe that Obama could end this shutdown with the stroke of a pen. Only one of us is right, and it ain\u2019t the flack for King Barry the First. Also, see Rules for Radicals #4, #5, #8, and #13. Not nearly as much fun when they get turned around on you, huh?)\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned in the past week, it\u2019s that the behavior of one guy at a protest reflects the group as a whole. For example, one guy was carrying around a Confederate flag at the Million Vet March in DC this weekend, which means all veterans are racists or something. (Or Uncle Toms, I guess, depending.)\n\nOkay, okay, not all veterans. Just the ones who want to visit the war memorials that Obama has barricaded because he\u2019s not getting his way.\n\nAnyway, based on that standard, the following young fellow represents all OFA volunteers.

Perhaps he ducked out to touch up his antiperspirant. Does Obamacare cover that? If not, why not?\n\nUpdate: This fellow is claiming to be the one with the sign.\n\n@reidepstein glad everyone likes my sign.
