He starred at Peachtree Ridge in Suwanee, Ga. As a punt returner, wide receiver and cornerback, he helped his team reach the 2009 state quarterfinals. He redshirted as a freshman at Ohio State, and focusing on cornerback for the first time, his career took off. He started the next 37 games. A first-team All-Big Ten performance as a junior placed him firmly on the Broncos\u2019 radar. Impressed with his athleticism and football IQ, the Broncos drafted Roby in the first round with the 31st overall pick. He has excelled in nickel coverage with the Broncos this season, producing interceptions in back-to-back games against the Patriots and Raiders. He answers questions each Thursday during the remainder of the season, and says he\u2019s open to \u201canything, not just football-related stuff.\u201d Here\u2019s the fourth installment:\n\nWhat type of movies do you like? What are some of your favorites?\n\n\u2014 Diana\n\nRoby: I like all types of movies. I can\u2019t just settle on one. Here\u2019s the top three that come to mind. \u201cTroy\u201d with Brad Pitt. \u201cNext Friday.\u201d Really all the \u201cFridays.\u201d And I liked \u201cInception\u201d a lot. I like movies that make you think. There was a cool twist at the end. I don\u2019t know if those are my top three of all time, but those are the ones off the top of my head.\n\nEveryone is talking about Odell Beckham Jr.\u2019s catch. What is the best catch you have ever made?\n\n\u2014 Keith\n\nRoby: It was in high school when I was playing receiver. We were in the state playoffs. I was on a fade route. I was running and the ball was behind me. I really should have just opened up and caught it off to my side. But I leaned back to find the ball and then dove and caught it over my shoulder. That was definitely the best catch I ever had. The best I\u2019ve seen? Probably Antonio Cromartie\u2019s one-handed interception (against Peyton Manning when he was with the Colts). I was happy for Odell and that catch he made. I met him at the draft. That was an unbelievable catch, and it was a touchdown, which makes it even better.\n\nIf you could have dinner with famous people, who would it be?\n\n\u2014 Isaac\n\nRoby: Kanye West, Tupac, Bruce Lee, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Bob Marley. Those are the guys I\u2019d like to have a conversation with around the table. Just to talk to them. I like all their personalities. I look up to all those guys for different reasons. They are tough competitors. I feel like I am. I like the self confidence of Kanye, Tupac and Marley. They speak from their heart and have a message. I just started watching stuff on Bruce Lee last year on YouTube. He\u2019s a great dude. A global icon. I like his \u201cBe Water My Friend\u201d inspirational saying. (Lee\u2019s quote: \u201cYou must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend.\u201d)\n\nHow did you end up with No. 29 with the Broncos? I heard there was a story behind it.\n\n\u2014 Brandon\n\nRoby: I had to take a number in the 20s. I might change my number someday. If I can make 29 stick, I\u2019ll keep it. It\u2019s all about whether you make plays or not. I am not going to have a necklace with No. 29. It\u2019s not like that. I want to make it mine. The number 24 was available. I remember asking (general manager John) Elway when I first got here if I could have 24. He was like, \u201cI will have to think about that.\u201d I realized right then I needed to prove myself first. And now that I have been here, met Champ, gone to his retirement ceremony and seen first-hand how much he meant to this organization, I would never wear it. I knew he was great. I just wanted a number other than 29. What Champ did here, nobody will ever match. His number will be retired here.\n\nWho is the fastest guy on the team?\n\n\u2014 Brian\n\nRoby: We have a lot of fast guys. I can\u2019t even say. I would be close, but I feel like I am getting slower. Maybe my legs are just tired. I ran a 4.38 40 (leading up to the draft) so I would be up there. Emmanuel (Sanders) might be the guy. Kayvon (Webster). Omar (Bolden). Bubba (Caldwell). The only way we\u2019d find out is if we\u2019d race, and that would probably never happen.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bob Marley,Brad Pitt,Bradley Roby,John Elway,Kanye West,Kobe Bryant,LeBron James,Odell Beckham Jr.,Tupac Shakur", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Bradley Roby discusses his favorite movies, the greatest catch he's ever seen and celebrities he'd like to dine with.", "title": "Broncos' Bradley Roby talks movies, Odell Beckham Jr.'s catch and Kanye West", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/11/27/bradley-roby-talks-movies-fast-players-likes-bruce-lee/31118/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/05/bradley-roby-495x367.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Bradley Roby discusses his favorite movies, the greatest catch he's ever seen and celebrities he'd like to dine with.", "title": "Take 5 With Bradley Roby: Broncos\u2019 rookie talks movies, greatest catch, Kanye West", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/11/27/bradley-roby-talks-movies-fast-players-likes-bruce-lee/31118/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/05/bradley-roby-495x367.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Bradley Roby discusses his favorite movies, the greatest catch he's ever seen and celebrities he'd like to dine with."}, "article_summary": "What is the best catch you have ever made?\nThat was definitely the best catch I ever had.\nWhen you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.\nWhen you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle.\nWhen you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup."}
