Without a diversity of energy sources, there would have been no gas for electricity. But other sources, such as coal, nuclear and wind, stepped in to help.\n\nThe Paris-based IEA was founded in 1974 to coordinate international oil reserves amid an energy crisis, back when ensuring oil supplies immediately was a top international priority.\n\nVan der Hoeven, a former minister of economic affairs for the Netherlands, said America should focus on long-term supplies, source diversity and environmental sustainability to make the country more secure.\n\n\u201cEnergy security is about much more than supply, and it\u2019s about more than the here and now,\u201d she said.\n\nVan der Hoeven encouraged more action to fight climate change, saying that beyond harming the environment, it threatens power generation sources that rely on water for cooling or infrastructure that could be harmed by extreme weather.\n\n\u201cAction must be taken now to stop making things worse ... in terms of [greenhouse gas] emissions and to build up the resilience of the energy system to limit the impact and costs of climate change,\u201d she said.\n\nThe IEA takes all of these factors into account when judging international energy security, van der Hoeven said, and members of the organization, including the United States, should as well.\n\n\u201cThe United States is in an enviable position today, given your oil and gas situation ... but our energy is not as secure as we sometimes may think\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in times of abundance that we must challenge ourselves to think differently and tackle the tough questions that are on the energy horizon.\u201d\n\n\u2014 This story was updated at 3:33 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Maria van der Hoeven said U.S. oil supplies will plateau in the next two decades.", "description": "Maria van der Hoeven said U.S. oil supplies will plateau in the next two decades.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Maria van der Hoeven said U.S. oil supplies will plateau in the next two decades.", "title": "Natural gas boom hasn't made US energy secure, warns IEA chief", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/212126-iea-chief-us-may-not-be-energy-secure", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-14T17:04:50-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-14T17:04-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/212126-iea-chief-us-may-not-be-energy-secure", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-14T11:04-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-14T11:04:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-14T17:04:50-04:00"}, "keywords": "International Energy Agency, Energy security, Climate change, oil, gas,Maria van der Hoeven,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/212126-iea-chief-us-may-not-be-energy-secure", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Maria van der Hoeven said U.S. oil supplies will plateau in the next two decades.", "card": "summary", "title": "Natural gas boom hasn't made US energy secure, warns IEA chief"}, "dcterms.title": "Natural gas boom hasn't made US energy secure, warns IEA chief"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25a5\"", "article_summary": "The United States has not reached a state of energy security despite the natural gas boom that is sweeping the nation, the new head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said Monday.\n\u201cYou must be careful about the degree to which you rely on gas, because energy security really requires diversity,\u201d van der Hoeven said.\n\u201cEnergy security is about much more than supply, and it\u2019s about more than the here and now,\u201d she said.\nVan der Hoeven, a former minister of economic affairs for the Netherlands, said America should focus on long-term supplies, source diversity and environmental sustainability to make the country more secure.\n\u201cThere certainly is some good news in oil security for now, but the nature of the business means that it is imperative to look ahead,\u201d she said."}
