Zenith also continues to recruit students using the very same ads that Corinthian ran during the very same daytime TV talk shows.\n\nExecutives who formerly oversaw Corinthian\u2019s business practices, which state and federal officials said were fraudulent, remain employed at Zenith.\n\nAs with Corinthian, Zenith still requires students to waive their right to sue the school in a class action, which is unheard of among traditional colleges.\n\nRecent graduates claim that they are struggling to find work which would allow them to pay back their student loans. This could mean additional student loan defaults for the U.S.\n\n\u201cI graduated in April at the top of my class, with honors,\u201d said Shane Satterfield, a roofer in Georgia who now owes more than $30,000 in debt for the associate\u2019s degree in computer science he completed last year. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t get a job paying over $8.50 an hour.\u201d\n\nZenith Chairman, David Hawn said some marketing practices were problematic, and he acknowledged that graduates are not yet graduating with key credentials for getting a job. But he said the schools were on the right track.\n\n\u201cWe are spending a lot of money to right the ship,\u201d Hawn said. He added that Zenith had shrunk down to about 15,000 students and lost more than $100 million in its first year and expects to lose money again in its second. \u201cEvery step we\u2019re taking is in support of our quest to become a really great career school,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Education sold these schools to a firm that had no experience in providing education and insufficient motivation to genuinely fix the business model,\u201d said David Halperin, a Washington lawyer and consumer advocate who helped identify problems at Corinthian. \u201cIt would have been better to help existing students find new opportunities elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is that we were able with Zenith to provide a plan for tens of thousands to move on,\u201d said Ted Mitchell, the Department of Education\u2019s Undersecretary. \u201cIf Zenith is not doing right by its students, we won\u2019t hesitate to act.\u201d\n\nThe reasons for Corinthian Colleges\u2019 collapse were not surprising:\n\nA January 2011 whistleblower lawsuit alleged that Corinthian employees routinely fabricated employers to make it appear that unemployed graduates had landed good jobs in their chosen careers.\n\nA July 2012 report by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee found that more than half of Corinthian students dropped out.\n\nUndercover investigators at the Government Accountability Office enrolled in Everest, Corinthian\u2019s flagship among its schools, and got passing grades for obviously plagiarized or incorrect assignments.\n\nA lawsuit by California\u2019s Attorney General, filed in 2013 and amended in 2014, alleged rampant lying to students about job placement and cited internal marketing documents that identified Corinthian\u2019s best prospects as people with \u201clow self-esteem\u201d who have \u201cfew people in their lives that care about them.\u201d That case is pending.\n\nDespite allegations of misconduct, the Department of Education continued to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in student loan dollars to Corinthian. The harshest punishment the department imposed was a three-week hold on payments in June 2014. The temporary delay in loan disbursements led to Corinthian\u2019s abrupt collapse.\n\nThe financial failure left the department in a nasty position. After years of payouts to investors and multimillion-dollar bonuses for its executives, Corinthian had few assets, 70,000 students, and massive legal trouble.\n\nSimply allowing Corinthian to fold would have forced the U.S. government to absorb hundreds of millions of dollars in losses on student loans and put students on the street. Keeping the schools alive would save the government from much of the damage.\n\n\u201cThere was this strong sense, from the media communications standpoint, where they said \u2018Do we really want all these students getting thrown out of school,\u2019\u201d said Robert Shireman, a former deputy undersecretary who left the department in 2010. \u201cSomewhere in there, someone came up with ECMC,\u201d Education Credit Management Corp., the nonprofit student debt collection company based in Oakdale, Minnesota, that controls Zenith.\n\nWhen Zenith Education Group acquired the remains of Corinthian, its executives knew what they were getting.\n\n\u201cZenith\u2019s schools had a culture of accepting anyone with a pulse,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cA large portion of the student body was \u2018at risk\u2019 and Corinthian had defrauded students through false promises of future employment and deprived them of a functional education.\u201d In a way reminiscent of the subprime mortgage crisis, Zenith said Corinthian walked off with money from government-backed loans and left everyone else in the lurch.\n\nMany of Corinthian\u2019s senior regulatory and compliance officials stayed on board. Zenith\u2019s deputy general counsel and its corporate counsel came from Corinthian. Also still at Zenith are executives who oversaw Corinthian\u2019s accreditation, student finance operations, and its hard-charging recruitment call centers.\n\nThe longtime director of compliance and program management at Corinthian, Susan Samek, now oversees job placement verification. That role requires her to ensure that Everest is no longer misleading the government or its students about placement rates, which Zenith acknowledged had happened.\n\nHawn said that just because Zenith compliance employees had also held senior positions at Corinthian, does not mean they will repeat that organization\u2019s mistakes. \u201cCompliance matters to us in a big way,\u201d Hawn said. \u201cThe compliance department ultimately reports to people employed by Zenith. As for the holdover employees, I\u2019m proud they\u2019re serving alongside us.\u201d\n\nZenith has retained Corinthian\u2019s policy of prohibiting its students from suing it in class actions. Under Corinthian, students were required to sign waivers giving up their right to sue over misconduct at the school; their only option was arbitration. At the Education Department\u2019s insistence, Zenith dropped the across-the-board ban on lawsuits. But Zenith still requires students to sign a ban on class actions, which are generally regarded as an effective way to pursue a large number of cases.\n\nSuch a ban is virtually unprecedented at nonprofit colleges, but Hawn said that Zenith will keep it for now.\n\n\u201cArbitration, that\u2019s a much better remedy,\u201d Hawn said. \u201cAs our confidence grows in our ability to serve our students well, we will continue to look at the class-action lawsuit issue.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Education said the government wants Zenith to lift its class-action ban. Though the Department cannot simply mandate that Zenith drop it, the government proposed rules that would bar colleges at large from restricting student\u2019s right to sue.\n\nUnder a government agreement, Zenith hired a law firm to review its operations and monitor its progress. Samples of recruitment calls from Zenith\u2019s call centers found that 11 percent of student contacts in November of 2015, for Everest\u2019s physical campuses, contained statements that merited review, including unsubstantiated statements about Everest\u2019s tuition, the likelihood of graduates finding jobs, child care options for students, and the ability to transfer Everest\u2019s credits to other schools.\n\nEverest\u2019s credits are usually not transferrable. Under Zenith, an addendum to Everest\u2019s enrollment agreement said credits \u201cwill probably not be transferable to a college or university\u201d and that an Everest degree \u201cwill probably not serve as a basis for obtaining a higher level degree at a college or university.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about taking classes, Everest admissions staff would not discuss the likelihood of credit transfers, saying only that a student\u2019s future university of choice would determine that.\n\nZenith has a board of directors that is supposed to keep an eye on governance of its schools. But when the board members receive salaries between $84,000 and $142,000 a year for working between 7 to 19 hours per week, will they monitor the school\u2019s actions appropriately and with a certain level of scrutiny?\n\n\u201cWhen a nonprofit board is paid, those people are consultants,\u201d Shireman said. \u201cSuch board members would have little incentive to act in ways that would harm Zenith\u2019s finances. They are not overseeing the management on behalf of the public.\u201d\n\nMitchell also faulted the arrangement. \u201cThe proper governance of education requires an independent board,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m personally disappointed that they haven\u2019t moved more quickly on this.\u201d\n\nCurrent students and recent Everest graduates gave mixed reviews to Zenith. Some said they would recommend Everest to friends. But most expressed disappointment and disillusionment. None reported seeing major changes in their curriculum. Hawn said that such things take time. He expects to roll out the introduction of more employer-recognized professional certifications late this year.\n\nAmong its faculty, some of Everest\u2019s online instructors have substantial professional experience in their fields and many are adjunct faculty shared with for-profit online colleges. A few of the professor\u2019s entire post-secondary education has occurred at for-profit online schools.\n\nDespite claims of wanting to recruit students more selectively, Zenith has continued to run the same ads Corinthian produced. Commercials featuring quick cuts and a high tempo musical background portray Everest as a fast track to a solid paying job and even buying a house. One commercial includes actors explaining why Everest is better than community college, which is almost always a more affordable educational option.\n\nEverest spent roughly $11.5 million last year on national television ads, according to data provided by iSpot.tv, a media tracking firm. Most were ads Corinthian created. That spending disproportionately focused on daytime TV talk shows with such hosts as Maury Povich, Steve Wilkos and Jerry Springer, shows whose audiences target the young, black, and poor.\n\nWhen Zenith took control of Everest, it shut down the school\u2019s online paralegal program as a result of its terrible track record, but continued to advertise the program on its website, in paid search ads, and in correspondence with prospective students. In conversations with Everest\u2019s admissions team, recruiters repeatedly tried to suggest enrolling in other programs.\n\nEverest plans to bring back a version of the online paralegal program later this spring, Hawn said, and only began advertising for it in last month. However, Everest advertised for the canceled program in November 2015, four months ago.\n\nSimilarly, Everest\u2019s online marketing materials continued to promote associates degrees in criminal justice and homeland security, programs that have been permanently phased out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not OK to advertise something we don\u2019t offer,\u201d Hawn said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to ensure we don\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nStudents who provided what were supposedly recent testimonials about the quality of Everest\u2019s online education appear to have never attended Everest. They were students more than a decade ago at Florida Metropolitan University, a for-profit school that Everest later bought.\n\nOne of the students, Martine Darby, was contacted and asked whether she had ever endorsed Everest. She said she had not.\n\n\u201cI would not want my name associated with Everest,\u201d Darby said. She was impressed by FMU when she attended, but she ran into trouble years later when she attempted to transfer the credits to Arizona State.\n\n\u201cI was told that none of my credits from the associate\u2019s degree I paid $30,000 for were transferrable because the school is not accredited with the appropriate organization,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAfter Zenith was asked about the testimonials, Everest replaced them with a note stating \u201cNEW TESTIMONIALS COMING SOON!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve addressed that,\u201d Hawn said. \u201cThat was inappropriate.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that it seems as though the same tactics and misleading information are still apart of Zenith\u2019s business model. Steer clear of these so called schools!!!\n\nSource: Trouble remains following failed for-profit schools\u2019 revival\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Consuella Pachico", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "The Department of Education has permitted Zenith, the new owners of Corinthian Colleges, to recruit students using large-scale telemarketing and paid media campaigns that sometimes advertise programs that no longer exist.\u00a0\u00a0Zenith also continues to recruit students using the very same ads that Corinthian ran during the very same daytime TV talk shows.
