Trade-Technical College, where an estimated 1,500 students are uninsured.\n\n\u201cThe message I have is health and education are the two biggest investments you can make in yourself,\u201d Eng told the crowd of young people who gathered at the campus.\n\nEng said he remembers working in an emergency department for three years while he was a college student. He said he doesn\u2019t want to see families go through what he saw then.\n\n\u201cThere were people using our emergency rooms as clinics,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people die, whose death could have been prevented.\u201d\n\nIsiahne Henderson, 23, said she has used the emergency department recently and she admitted it was time to enroll in a plan that gave her consistent health care. She said she was worried about cost, but didn\u2019t want to face a penalty.\n\n\u201cI need it because I know there are consequences,\u201d said Henderson, a child development major at Trade Tech. \u201cI hope it will make a difference with my health care.\u201d\n\nFrom Oct. 1, when Covered California officially opened, until January 31, at least 26 percent of the 626,210 who enrolled into health plans were between the ages of 18 and 34, and the majority have been eligible for subsidies, said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California.\n\nVarious efforts have been launched to convince the \u201cyoung invincibles,\u201d that they too must be covered under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLee told students it was time for them to be part of history by enrolling. He also warned them that if they remain unenrolled they face a $95 federal tax penalty. But it goes deeper: if they are uninsured and use the emergency department, they could be billed up to $150,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee said low income college students who are not covered under a parent\u2019s plan still believe health insurance is unaffordable.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a myth,\u201d he said, adding that for some students a health plan can cost as much as a monthly cell phone bill or a gym membership.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can,\u201d he said, of enrolling Los Angeles\u2019 college students. \u201cThis is the building period.\u201d\n\nEnrollment counselors and educators plan to be at each campus this week, including Pierce, L.A. Harbor, LA Mission, and Southwest community colleges.\n\nMeanwhile, the Covered California website, which had been down since Wednesday, was back online Monday, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe site had been offline since Wednesday afternoon to address database configuration errors possibly brought on by a software malfunction during scheduled maintenance on Feb. 16,\u201d according to a statement. \u201cCovered California and the California Department of Health Care Services are assessing the cause of the malfunction, which does not involve any security compromises.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A weeklong campaign to enroll thousands of community college students into health plans launched in Los Angeles on Monday to encourage young adults to sign up for Obamacare before March 31, or else face penalties under the federal law.At least", "title": "75,000 Los Angeles college students targeted as part of massive Covered California campaign", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140224/75000-los-angeles-college-students-targeted-as-part-of-massive-covered-california-campaign", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "75,000 Los Angeles college students targeted as part of massive Covered California campaign"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "A weeklong campaign to enroll thousands of community college students into health plans launched in Los Angeles on Monday to encourage young adults to sign up for Obamacare before March 31, or else face penalties under the federal law.At least", "title": "75,000 Los Angeles college students targeted as part of massive Covered California campaign", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140224/75000-los-angeles-college-students-targeted-as-part-of-massive-covered-california-campaign", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews.png?052016"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc459\"", "article_summary": "Eng, a former California assemblyman, spearheaded the effort to create the weeklong event with Covered California, the state\u2019s health plan exchange.\n\u201cCovered California and the California Department of Health Care Services are assessing the cause of the malfunction, which does not involve any security compromises.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the Covered California website, which had been down since Wednesday, was back online Monday, officials said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can,\u201d he said, of enrolling Los Angeles\u2019 college students.\nAdvertisementLee said low income college students who are not covered under a parent\u2019s plan still believe health insurance is unaffordable."}
