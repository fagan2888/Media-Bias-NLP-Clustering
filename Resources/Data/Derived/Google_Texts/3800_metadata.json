They worked together on improving healthcare for seniors as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe NCPSSM was founded in 1982 by James Roosevelt, a U.S. Congressman from 1955 to 1965 and the oldest son of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\n\u201cWe are a nonpartisan, nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization representing the views of millions of members and supporters nationwide,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s website. \u201cThe mission of the NCPSSM is to protect, preserve, promote, and ensure the financial security, health, and the well being of current and future generations of Americans.\u201d\n\nMargolies and Social Security\n\nOn the heels of the endorsement, Arkoosh\u2019s campaign was quick to contrast their position with that one of their opponents, Marjorie Margolies.\n\nTo fully understand the circumstances, it\u2019s necessary to have a refresher in the politics of the early years of the Clinton Administration. In 1993, Margolies was a freshman Democrat in a much more conservative 13th district that she won by a mere 1,373 votes. The President needed her vote to pass his omnibus budget bill through the House. Clinton got her support, the bill passed by one vote, and Republicans literally taunted her with chants of \u201cBye-bye Marjorie\u201d.\n\nHer support earned her the eternal gratitude of Bill and Hillary Clinton, especially after Margolies was swept out of office in the \u201cGingrich Revolution\u201d. Their families become friends and years later Chelsea would marry her son Mark, making them in-laws. All the while, the subsequent success of the 1990\u2019s economy turned Margolies into a martyred hero for Democrats.\n\nWhat seems to have been lost in the passage of time, however, is that Margolies still had to face a tough election in 1994. So, in order to prove to her constituents that she was concerned with the deficit and appear more centrist, the Congresswoman took up the issue of reforming entitlements.\n\nWhen she voted for Clinton\u2019s budget, Margolies extracted a promise that the President would attend a summit in her district about entitlements (Fun fact: The NCPSSM wasn\u2019t invited) and in May 1994 she introduced two bills to reform Social Security. These pieces of legislation would gradually raise the retirement age and limit cost of living adjustments.\n\nNow, running in a much more Democratic 13th district, Margolies is being hit by the Arkoosh campaign for her attempt to change Social Security. This is being done despite the reality that the bill is almost twenty years old, never saw the House floor and was likely little more than a political maneuver.\n\nThe Margolies campaign is countering the charge by noting that the NCPSSM does not endorse Arkoosh\u2019s attacks.\n\n\u201cThe National Committee confirmed with me by phone on Friday that its endorsement of Arkoosh had nothing to do with Marjorie\u2019s record in Congress nor do they endorse in any way the Arkoosh campaign\u2019s attack on Marjorie,\u201d said Margolies\u2019 Senior Campaign Advisor Ken Smukler.\n\nArkoosh\u2019s team, however, points to an interview Margolies conducted last December to prove that she still hold the same views as she did in 1994.\n\nAccording to audio obtained by the PA liberal blog \u201craging chicken press\u201d while addressing members of Montco Democracy For America, Margolies spoke about her views on Social Security.\n\n\u201cI think this has to be addressed but I\u2019m not so sure that there\u2019s a panic button approach to Social Security,\u201d she said, also saying that all options were on the table in the debate about reforms.\n\nWhen asked about raising the age for Social Security eligibility, Margolies talked about her 1994 bill but commented that she believed \u201cwe\u2019ve ceilinged out on that.\u201d\n\nOverall, Margolies statements were vague and noncommittal, which is a not at all uncommon tactic for candidates when answering voter\u2019s questions.\n\nFinally, in an attempt to fully rebuke the charges of the Arkoosh\u2019s team, the Margolies campaign shared with PoliticsPA the NCPSSM questionnaire the candidate filled out in July 2013 in which she stated that she would oppose cuts to Social Security to balance the budget.\n\nWhen asked flatly, \u201cDo you support raising the Social Security retirement age beyond age 67?\u201d Margolies wrote \u201cNo. The retirement age should stay where it is.\u201d\n\nUltimately, it appears this battle over Social Security will remain a central theme in this race as it heads into its final months. The other candidates in the PA-13 Democratic primary along with Arkoosh and Margolies are State Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Philadelphia) and State Sen. Daylin Leach (D-Mongtomery).\n\nFebruary 17th, 2014 | Posted in Congress, Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 4 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first-time candidate won the backing of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and used this as an opportunity to hit Margolies", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/pa-13-arkoosh-endorsed-by-social-security-group-picks-fight-with-margolies/55186/", "description": "The first-time candidate won the backing of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and used this as an opportunity to hit Margolies over her 1994 attempt to reform Social Security.", "title": "PA-13: Arkoosh Endorsed by Social Security Group, Picks Fight with Margolies"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc965c\"", "article_summary": "When asked flatly, \u201cDo you support raising the Social Security retirement age beyond age 67?\u201d Margolies wrote \u201cNo.\nNow, running in a much more Democratic 13th district, Margolies is being hit by the Arkoosh campaign for her attempt to change Social Security.\nPA-13: Arkoosh Endorsed by Social Security Group, Picks Fight with MargoliesWritten by Nick Field, Contributing WriterFirst-time candidate Val Arkoosh has based her candidacy in large part on her experience as a physician and that focus was rewarded this weekend with the endorsement of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM).\nAccording to audio obtained by the PA liberal blog \u201craging chicken press\u201d while addressing members of Montco Democracy For America, Margolies spoke about her views on Social Security.\nThe Margolies campaign is countering the charge by noting that the NCPSSM does not endorse Arkoosh\u2019s attacks."}
