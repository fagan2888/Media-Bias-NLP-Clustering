SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. — Dong Wan Sin’s three-run single helped South Korea defeat defending champion Japan 12-3 Saturday in the Little League World Series international championship.

South Korea had a seven-run second inning on just two hits. Leadoff batter Hae Chan Choi also brought in two runs on a double during the inning. He finished 2-for-4 with three RBIs.

Thanks to three walks, along with a failed play at the plate, the South Koreans took a decisive lead.

“Scoring seven runs makes it easier,” South Korea manager Jong Wook Park said.

Japan’s first hit didn’t come until the third inning. While the Japanese team scored once in the fourth and twice in the fifth inning, it was too little and late.

“We couldn’t stop their momentum and we had an unlucky situation,” Japan manager Junji Hidaka said.

On Sunday, South Korea will face the winner of the Chicago vs. Las Vegas game for the overall title.

South Korea will make its third trip to the championship game, after winning in 1984 and 1985. Park said his team isn’t feeling any pressure.

“People back home just cheer for us,” he said. “We’d like to win as much as possible, but just to be here is winning already.”
