Another remarkable result was that wealthier people who claimed to be allies of the poor told them this was bad for them. Recent developments in American popular music demonstrate that this paradox lives on. Last Sunday night, Macklemore and Lorde, artists who have built their careers upon songs attacking the desire for luxuries among African-Americans, received the highest commendations from the music establishment in the form of multiple Grammy awards. Their songs continue a long tradition, rooted in progressivism, of protests against the pleasures of the poor.\n\nTo understand this lineage we must first review the history of a revolution. In the early 19th century, the great majority of Americans were confined to farms where they had to produce their own food and clothing. Their homes contained little other than utilitarian furnishings. Their only source of entertainment was books, and most that were available were moral parables. They rarely if ever traveled more than a few miles from where they were born.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the material conditions of the poor were radically transformed. Most bought their clothing from stores and most owned clothes whose sole function was to make them attractive. They ate food that had come from all over the country. They drank cold beer and ate ice cream. In cities they shopped at department stores. In the country they purchased goods via catalogs and mail order. They read dime novels whose sole purpose was to provide them with fun. They attended amusement parks, movie theaters, and vaudeville shows. They went dancing. They rode on trains. Most importantly, when the poor acquired these new pleasures, they usually did so with no apparent shame.\n\nDuring this revolution, self-appointed champions of the poor admonished their charges for indulging in what liberals today derisively refer to as \u201cconsumerism.\u201d Thorstein Veblen, the son of a wealthy Minnesota farming family, produced the most influential progressive critique of consumption in a series of books and articles, most notably the scholarly classic The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899). Veblen lamented that rising wages and the availability of consumer goods were leading working-class Americans to lives of undisciplined pleasure-seeking. Untrained in the art of restraint, when the poor did gain more than subsistence wages they spent it on useless fun. What others had \u201ceuphemistically spoken of as a rising standard of living\u201d Veblen saw as simply the \u201ccumulative growth of wasteful expenditures.\u201d\n\nA host of progressive academic studies of working-class spending habits aimed to determine the exact degree of material wealth\u2014and not one dollar more\u2014that would provide, as one put it, \u201cthe power to ensure one\u2019s primary faculties, supply one\u2019s essential needs, and develop one\u2019s personality.\u201d The conclusion of most of these studies was that to avoid socially harmful \u201cexcesses\u201d the \u201cminimum amount of goods and opportunities\u201d should also be the maximum amount. Typical was The Standard of Living Among Workingmen\u2019s Families in New York City (1909), written by Robert Chapin, the son of a college president, which labeled \u201cvisits to cafes, ale houses,\u201d tobacco, gambling and lotteries, \u201cornaments (personal),\u201d \u201ctheater and \u201cpublic festivities,\u201d and even candy, soda water, and ice cream for children as \u201cluxuries\u201d and \u201cextravagances.\u201d Through the 20th and into the 21st centuries opposition to consumerism remained almost exclusively the domain of well-born do-gooders, often finding its voice in claims that advertisers create in common folk \u201cartificial\u201d desires for \u201cuseless\u201d luxuries and \u201cmindless\u201d entertainment.\n\nIn recent years a principal target of these elitist and puritanical attacks has been hip hop, a subculture dominated by African Americans born into poverty who celebrate what Thorstein Veblen labeled as \u201cconspicuous consumption.\u201d Until the rise of Macklemore and Lorde, the most prominent criticisms of hip hop\u2019s love of \u201cbling\u201d came from relatively obscure \u201cconscious\u201d rappers as well as intellectuals and political activists outside the music industry. But in 2012, Macklemore\u2019s song \u201cThrift Shop\u201d rose to the top of the Billboard charts to become the millennial generation\u2019s anti-consumerist anthem. The message of the song is the early progressives\u2019 polemic presented in contemporary street slang. In it, the white rapper from the hip Capitol Hill district of Seattle whose liberal credentials include songs promoting gay marriage and opposing \u201cwars from religion\u201d proudly declares \u201cOnly got twenty dollars in my pocket,\u201d as he shops for clothes in a thrift shop. In the second verse he mocks rappers\u2019 attention to designer labels:\n\nThey be like, \u2018Oh, that Gucci\u2014that\u2019s hella tight.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m like, \u2018Yo\u2014that\u2019s fifty dollars for a T-shirt.\u2019\n\nLimited edition, let\u2019s do some simple addition\n\nFifty dollars for a T-shirt\u2014that\u2019s just some ignorant bitch shit\n\nI call that getting swindled and pimped, shit\n\nI call that getting tricked by a business\n\nLike the early progressives, Macklemore believes he knows better than the poor what they should desire, buy, and value. And also like the progressives he believes that the highest value is found not in shopping malls but in places like museums:\n\nSee, I observed Escher\n\nI love Basquiat\n\nI watched Keith Haring\n\nYou see I study art\n\nNaturally, the arbiters of contemporary liberal taste have recognized Macklemore as one of their own. \u201cObviously,\u201d noted an NPR interviewer, rapping about finding bargains in thrift shops is \u201cnot your typical hip-hop theme.\u201d Rather, she said, the genre normally features \u201cbling and caddies and your gold grill.\u201d Macklemore explained, \u201chip-hop is usually an art form that is about bling, consumption\u201d but \u201cThrift Shop\u201d is \u201cabout, you know, just saving money. And I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s rare in hip-hop culture. It\u2019s usually about spending money.\u201d\n\nThe liberal intelligentsia has similarly embraced another pop-star critic of bling, the New Zealander and self-described feminist Lorde, whose hit song \u201cRoyals\u201d raced to number one with its declaration that \u201cwe don\u2019t care\u201d for the \u201cgold teeth, Grey Goose,\u201d \u201cCristal, Maybach,\u201d \u201cdiamonds on your timepiece,\u201d and \u201cjet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash\u201d that are hip hop motifs. \u201cThat kind of luxe just ain\u2019t for us,\u201d she sings. Asked by New York Magazine about how \u201cpeople seem excited by the criticism of conspicuous consumption in \u2018Royals\u2019\u201d and what inspired her to write the song, Lorde explained, \u201cI\u2019ve always listened to a lot of rap. It\u2019s all, look at this car that cost me so much money, look at this Champagne. It\u2019s super fun. It\u2019s also some bullshit....Everyone knows it\u2019s B.S., but someone has to write about it.\u201d The New York Times\u2019 rock critic Jon Pareles described \u201cRoyals\u201d as \u201csomething smarter and deeper\u201d than typical teen songs \u201cthat are calculated to suit that market\u201d: \u201ca class-conscious critique of pop-culture materialism that\u2019s so irresistible it became a No. 1 pop single.\u201d\n\nSmarter and deeper than the hedonistic masses is indeed what liberal critics of the poor have always believed themselves to be. Perhaps this is why, as Lorde puts it, \u201cWe crave a different kind of buzz.\u201d She sings, \u201cLet me be your ruler. You can call me Queen Bee....Let me live that fantasy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "\u201cThat kind of luxe just ain\u2019t for us\u201d: Where pop culture, progressives, and puritanical values meet.", "title": "The Progressive Lineage of Macklemore\u2019s And Lorde\u2019s Attacks On the Pleasures of the Poor", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/02/01/that-kind-of-luxe-just-aint-for-us-the-p", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13911995878863.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13911995878863.jpg", "title": "The Progressive Lineage of Macklemore\u2019s And Lorde\u2019s Attacks On the Pleasures of the Poor", "description": "One of the more remarkable results of the rise of\nindustrial capitalism was that, for the first time in human\nhistory, the poorest classes of people gained access to luxury\ngoods.
