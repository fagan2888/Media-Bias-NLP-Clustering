WASHINGTON – Like other Texas conservatives in Congress, Rep. Kevin Brady isn’t expecting much in the way of an olive branch when President Obama delivers his State of the Union address tonight.

“My expectations are low. I think he’s serious about going it alone and that’s exactly what the American public is tired of,” said Brady, R-The Woodlands. “We’re ready and willing to work with him on tax reform, starting over on health care with something that works, on jobs bills… If he’s willing we’ll meet him at the table.”

Brady appeared at a news conference at GOP headquarters a block from the Capitol, where party leaders and guests of Republican lawmakers denounced Obamacare.

His guest — Amy Milstead, president of a family-owned auto repair and towing company and chairwoman of The Woodlands Area Chamber of Commerce – joined the chorus.

“We have always tried to stay competitive with our competition,” she said. “It is really going to be challenging this year.”

Said she hopes her presence prods Obama to rethink his approach on health care.

“It would be a sad, sad government we have if they don’t listen,” she said.
