It’s 2014, and America is slowly legalizing marijuana. 20 states plus Washington DC now have laws legalizing marijuana at the medical or recreational level, and 13 more have bills pending. And the culture that once made the stuff taboo is changing enough that we’re now seeing the first ad for legal marijuana to run on a major TV network.

MedicalDoctors.com doesn’t sell marijuana—it’s more like Open Table for legal pot dispensaries. It lets you search for suppliers and book appointments. They’re a little like the Obamacare state exchange sites, but strictly for weed.

Boldly, they decided to take the funny route for the commercial rather than the melodramatic, turning the archetype of the shady drug dealer in a back alley on its head. The commercial features said drug dealer selling sushi and asks, you wouldn’t buy sushi from this guy, so why would you buy your marijuana from him?

It’s funny, but gets to the heart of a serious issue—in legalizing drugs we kill the impetus for black markets, which are by definition shady and dangerous. Years from now, once federal prohibition is lifted, ads for pot may be as common as beer ads. Watch the first below.
