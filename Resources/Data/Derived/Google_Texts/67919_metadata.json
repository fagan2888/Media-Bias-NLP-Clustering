In the latest research on the subject, however, a philosopher from Northwestern University and a scientist from Tufts find that spite may change and evolve with varying life situations.\n\nRory Smead (philosopher) and Patrick Forber (scientist) tweaked an old laboratory game used by researchers to study social behaviors through simplified models. In the \u201cultimatum game,\u201d players are left to divide resources in a series of interactions, with the first player making an offer to the second, who may either accept or reject \u2014 with both players getting nothing in the absence of a deal.\n\nThis graph from the Swiss study shows the study subject's propensity to punish other game-players as a function of the punishment efficiency. In groups large and small, people punish others at a consistent rate. Creative Commons\n\nThough the game sounds logical enough, Smead and Forber found the model didn\u2019t quite work mathematically. In most cases, the second player simply accepted any offer from his deal-making counterpart, a divergence from observations taken from real life, the researchers said.\n\n\"Evo\u00adlu\u00adtionary models don't match what we're observing in real life,\" Smead said in a statement, describing how the pair decided to tweak the game by adding just a little nuance.\n\nBack in the lab, the researchers infused the game with something they called \u201cnegative assortment.\u201d Under these more realistic conditions in the game, spite gained a new utility for players and resulted in greater cash winnings, despite the self-sacrifices. \"Acting fairly pro\u00adtects you from spite,\" Smead said, explaining that winning players \u2014 in the new game \u2014 triumphed by making fair offers and rejecting deals seen as unfair.\n\nA similar look at underside of altruism came in November from Swiss researchers who found that laboratory game-players seek to punish offenders for perpetuating unequal distributions of wealth. \u201cAlthough the emergence of pro-social behavior in settings which are subject to material self-interest seems to contradict rational choice theory and the principle of the survival of the fittest, it is possible to show that cooperation and altruistic punishment can emerge and can be sustained in competitive, resource-limited environment,\u201d the Swiss investigators wrote.\n\nThough some may deride the politics of \u201cclass warfare,\u201d both experiments showed a human animal strongly averse to unequal distributions of wealth through \"unfair\" means.\n\nSources:\n\nSmead R, Forber P.
