The insurance is costly and drains employers of their funds.\n\nJordan Banjo, a substitute teacher from Pitt County, is worried that she will not be able to make ends meet due to her hours being cut. She works as a substitute teacher and at a coffee shop, but even this is not enough income for her to live on.\n\nUntil last month, she was working more than 30 hours a week. The district sent a notice to all substitute teachers informing them that their hours would be reduced to only three days a week- about 21 hours.\n\n\u201cI need the money. I need to work. I\u2019m willing and able to work, and now they\u2019re telling me you can only work for so long,\u201d Banjo told WITN-NC.\n\nBrock Letchworth, Pitt County Schools Spokesman explained the district\u2019s health insurance predicament, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at just over $1 million [to provide health insurance] and that\u2019s the lowest cost for this school system.\u201d\n\nShould the district refuse to provide health insurance for their full time workers, they face a penalty of more than $6 million.\n\nPitt County currently employs 400 substitute teachers.\n\n\u201cWe had about 200 who were averaging more than the 30 hours per week that the Affordable Care Act deems to be full-time,\u201d he said. The school, unable to afford health insurance for all of their substitute teachers, has been forced to cut their hours.\n\nBanjo is unsure what will happen next. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult. If I didn\u2019t have my parents, I\u2019d be in a lot of trouble,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two hundred North Carolina teachers are getting their hours cut due to Obamacare, WITN reports.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Two hundred North Carolina teachers are getting their hours cut due to Obamacare, WITN reports.
