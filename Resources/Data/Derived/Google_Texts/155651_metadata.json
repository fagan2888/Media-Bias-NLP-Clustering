While his approval rating has increased 6 percentage points, from 41 percent to 47 percent, since the November survey, it is down 9 points from the first survey conducted, during the 2010 midterm election cycle. And more than twice as many young Americans believe things are on the wrong track rather than the right one. This disillusionment with politicians might be to the advantage of young people, because it will encourage them to question slick proposals offered by government officials to fix problems. Take Obamacare. For Obamacare to work, it depends on young, generally healthier people signing up to share the cost of care for older, generally sicker people. We\u2019ve seen a number of efforts by the administration to try to get young people to enroll in Obamacare \u2013 the president appeared on \"Between Two Ferns,\" the administration recruited celebrities to promote Obamacare, and Obama\u2019s team created a \u201cHealth Care for the Holidays\u201d website to provide a guide for parents on how to talk to their kids about enrolling. And this doesn\u2019t even include ads by outside groups, such as the infamous \u201cbrosurance\u201d ad, which encouraged young men to sign up with a keg stand. Yet only 39 percent of young Americans support Obamacare in the Harvard survey. But just disapproving of Obamacare isn\u2019t enough.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nIf young people want things to get better, they must take stock of the world they are entering upon graduation, learn from their mistakes and vote for policies that will improve society and particularly the economy for the next group of graduates.\n\nWith distrust at these levels, you\u2019d think young people would be ready to vote and vote for changed leadership. But according to this survey, less than one in four (23 percent) young Americans say they will \u201cdefinitely be voting\u201d in the upcoming midterm elections, a decrease of 10 percentage points since the fall survey. There does seem to be more enthusiasm among traditional Republican constituencies \u2013 44 percent of those who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 say they are \u201cdefinitely voting\u201d versus 35 percent of 2012 Obama voters who say the same.\n\nNew graduates should do a reality check. Young people were one of the president\u2019s most loyal constituencies. Yet, his policies are making it more difficult for them to get a job out of college, let alone to embark on a path to true success. Graduating seniors still face high unemployment. It\u2019s time to recognize that this generation deserves better and hold elected leadership accountable for their failures.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nTwenty-nine percent of 18 to 29 year-olds agree with the statement that \u201cpolitical involvement rarely has any tangible results.\u201d That means almost a third of this demographic doesn\u2019t believe that joining the political process leads to change.\n\nBut they should also consider this: Not getting involved in politics guarantees that their interests won't be taken seriously. Politicians delivering graduation speeches will try to inspire the students to change the world. Graduates instead should take a look at the world around them and use their distrust of government to fight for a new era of rolling back government\u2019s power and returning it to citizens like them.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Graduates Should Take Their Distrust of Politics to the Voting Booth", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Disillusioned grads should get involved in politics and recognize that better lawmakers are needed.", "title": "Commencement Conservatism", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/05/16/graduates-should-take-their-distrust-of-politics-to-the-voting-booth", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/a0/4f/105a2df84743b3c73a3c25377f5d/140506-index-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Disillusioned grads should get involved in politics and recognize that better lawmakers are needed.", "card": "summary", "title": "Graduates Should Take Their Distrust of Politics to the Voting Booth"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "May 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Karin Agness,colleges,politics,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Disillusioned grads should get involved in politics and recognize that better lawmakers are needed."}, "article_summary": "And more than twice as many young Americans believe things are on the wrong track rather than the right one.\nWith distrust at these levels, you\u2019d think young people would be ready to vote and vote for changed leadership.\nYet only 39 percent of young Americans support Obamacare in the Harvard survey.\nBut they should also consider this: Not getting involved in politics guarantees that their interests won't be taken seriously.\nBut according to this survey, less than one in four (23 percent) young Americans say they will \u201cdefinitely be voting\u201d in the upcoming midterm elections, a decrease of 10 percentage points since the fall survey."}
