* Paul Ryan is just super-fed-up with everyone telling him how great he is and talking about how he should be the leader of the free world:

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) on Tuesday delivered a forceful statement rejecting calls from establishment Republicans who want him to usurp their party’s presidential nomination from the remaining contestants in that race. Ryan, who has spent a couple months making these statements, to no avail, arranged a hastily called 3:15 p.m. news conference inside the Republican National Committee headquarters. He insisted — in his clearest terms yet — to the GOP’s big donor and lobbyist class that he will not attempt to claim the nomination at the July convention in Cleveland. “Let me be clear: I do not want nor will I accept the nomination for our party,” Ryan said.

Because when you want people to stop talking about you, what you do is hold a press conference. Just to be clear, I’m not saying that Ryan actually wants to run for president this year. He’s smart enough to know that his party is a complete clusterfrack right now, and he’d lose. But he is running — just not until 2020.

* Speaking of clusterfracks, Manu Raju and Dierdre Walsh report that lots of high-profile Republicans, including some vulnerable senators up for re-election, are opting to skip the GOP convention in Cleveland.

They offer the usual plausible excuses: my car’s in the shop, I have to wash my hair that night, my dog plans to be sick, there’s going to be a John Wayne marathon on TCM that week…

* North Carolina’s governor tries to limit the damage from the Republicans’ anti-gay bill:

Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, whose state has been the subject of withering criticism since its legislature passed a law limiting bathroom use by transgender people and eliminating anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people, on Tuesday retreated from his full-throated defense of the measure. But he stopped short of opposing limits on bathroom access and left other elements of the law intact. Mr. McCrory signed the bill immediately after it was passed. But on Tuesday, he signed an executive order altering the equal employment policy for state workers to cover discrimination claims related to sexual orientation and gender identity. He said he would urge lawmakers to reverse course and allow people to bring discrimination cases in state court. “Simply put, I have listened to the people of North Carolina, and the people of North Carolina are entitled to both privacy and equality,” Mr. McCrory, a Republican who is seeking re-election this fall, said as he announced the executive order. “We can and we must achieve both of these goals.” The effects of Mr. McCrory’s order are modest. The most disputed provision of the law, which limited bathroom access for transgender people, will stand.

Republicans have controlled the governorship and the state legislature there since the GOP sweep of 2010. One does wonder whether that will change come November.

* The latest Quinnipiac poll shows Hillary Clinton leading Bernie Sanders in New York by 53-40.

* The Quinnipiac poll also shows Donald Trump with 55 percent, John Kasich with 20, and Ted Cruz with just 19.

* PPP shows a smaller lead for Clinton, at 51-40, but similar numbers on the Republican side, with Trump/Kasich/Cruz at 51/25/20. Among the entire New York electorate, 65 percent view Trump unfavorably, and 69 percent say the same of Cruz.

* A new Emerson College poll finds Clinton leading Sanders by 49-43 in Connecticut, which votes on April 26th, and is another state where Sanders would have to win big to close the delegate gap.

* Michael Tomasky notes that back in the day, Bernie Sanders wanted to increase mass incarceration by tossing more people in jail for longer sentences for drug possession.

* Daniel Gross boils down why Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are having success opposing free trade: Ordinary people haven’t been allowed to share in its benefits.

* The blogger DownWithTyranny notes that Hillary Clinton is going to have to answer some tough questions about fracking when the campaign gets to California.

* Dara Lind offers 11 charts that explain taxes in America, including a handy widget telling you how you’d fare under each candidate’s tax plan.

* At The Week, I argued that humanity needs killer robots. Seriously.

* And you may have heard Donald Trump’s assertion that under Obamacare, health insurance premiums have increased by eleventy bajillion percent. Actually, Charles Gaba reports that average premium increases this year are at eight percent, which is not so scary.

Would it be better if it was zero, or negative? Sure. But as with every other detail of this law, what conservatives say about it is completely bogus.
