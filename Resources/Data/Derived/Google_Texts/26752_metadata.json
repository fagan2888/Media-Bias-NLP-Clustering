The measure would have forced lawmakers to give up the taxpayer-subsidized health plans provided by the Legislature and individually sign up for Covered California.\n\nWilk introduced the measure after hearing complaints from several constituents about difficulties in signing up on the Covered California website and limitations on what is covered.\n\n\u201cI believe the Legislature would be more pro-active in addressing these concerns if we were enrolled in the program,\u201d Wilk said.\n\nHowever, some Assembly members said the legislation violates a provision of the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) that prohibits large employers from shifting their workers to Obamacare.\n\nWilk does not believe the ACA provision on large employers would prevent lawmakers from switching to Covered California, according to his spokeswoman, Lisa Johnson.\n\n\u201cLegislators are not employees of the Assembly in any traditional sense,\u201d she said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t hired or fired by the Assembly. They have immunity from many things. Legislators are representatives to their respective districts and are elected by the people. If anything, they are employees of those voters and individual districts.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @mcgreevy99", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Democratic lawmakers reject switching their health coverage to Obamacare", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Democratic state lawmakers on Thursday shot down a proposal that would have required all California state legislators to get their health insurance from Covered California, the benefits exchange set up to implement Obamacare in the state.", "title": "Democratic lawmakers reject switching their health coverage to Obamacare", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-democratic-lawmakers-reject-switching-their-coverage-to-obamacare-20150423-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56fd643a/turbine/la-l-a-times-logo-20160331/600", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obamacare, healthcare, California, Covered California", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83369831", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-04-23", "Description": "Democratic state lawmakers on Thursday shot down a proposal that would have required all California state legislators to get their health insurance from Covered California, the benefits exchange set up to implement Obamacare in the state.
