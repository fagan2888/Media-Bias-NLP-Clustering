She admitted she was a little overwhelmed by all the numbers, and was thrown off by the monthly tax subsidy calculation.\n\n\"I was excited at first because I mistook the tax subsidy that I'd get, which is $65, for how much I'd have to pay. And then I was gut-wrenchingly sad when I saw that the cheapest plan I could get was $307,\" she said.\n\n\n\n(Read more: Obamacare fix puts insurers in a tough spot)\n\nHer most affordable plan option with lower deductibles and dental coverage came with premiums of more than $300 a month, after her tax subsidy.\n\nBut because she's under 30, Irwin also has the option to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan for less than $200 a month. She can add dental coverage for another $26 a month.\n\n\n\n\"With catastrophic, I'm not spending a catastrophic amount of money,\" she said.\n\nChadwick's search produced more than five dozen plan options, with premiums ranging from about $200 a month to more than $500 a month, after the tax subsidy. He's leaning toward the cheapest plan, but it comes with higher out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\n\n\"I hardly ever get sick, I haven't needed to see a doctor in over two years \" he said. \"The biggest thing for me was MRI coverage.\"\n\nExperts weigh in\n\nWe asked Mike Fortner, a broker at online insurance brokerage Gravie, to look over the young freelancers' plan options, both on the New York exchange and off of it, to see if he thought they had made the best choices.\n\n\n\nFortner found that Irwin's catastrophic plan with a dental supplement would be a cost-effective option for her. She would have to pay as much as $6,300 in out-of-pocket costs if she had a major medical problem, but she gets a little more coverage than meets the eye, if she remains healthy.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Even if HealthCare.gov worked better, for many young, first-time insurance buyers trying to pick the most cost-effective plan can involve a steep learning curve.", "author": "Bertha Coombs", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Even if HealthCare.gov worked better, for many first-time insurance buyers trying to pick the most cost-effective plan can involve a steep learning curve.", "title": "Picking a health plan\u2014better off 'throwing darts'", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/22/biggest-obamacare-hurdle-picking-a-health-plan.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/11/22/101221899-450630137.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even if HealthCare.gov worked better, for many first-time insurance buyers trying to pick the most cost-effective plan can involve a steep learning curve.", "title": "Biggest Obamacare hurdle: Picking a health plan", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/22/biggest-obamacare-hurdle-picking-a-health-plan.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/11/22/101221899-450630137.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@BerthaCoombs", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Obamacare, Obamacare, Health Care, Health Insurance, Personal Finance, US: News, Amazon.com Inc, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2013-11-22T13:24:14-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Obamacare", "modified_time": "2013-11-22T13:39:01-0500", "tag": "Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 101221185, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, exchanges, insurance, young, first time, cost-effective"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0154\"", "article_summary": "Fortner found that Irwin's catastrophic plan with a dental supplement would be a cost-effective option for her.\nShe admitted she was a little overwhelmed by all the numbers, and was thrown off by the monthly tax subsidy calculation.\nBut because she's under 30, Irwin also has the option to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan for less than $200 a month.\n\"I was excited at first because I mistook the tax subsidy that I'd get, which is $65, for how much I'd have to pay.\nChadwick's search produced more than five dozen plan options, with premiums ranging from about $200 a month to more than $500 a month, after the tax subsidy."}
