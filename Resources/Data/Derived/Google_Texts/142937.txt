Marvel’s ‘Guardians Of The Galaxy’ Marvel

“Why would you want to save the galaxy?” poses Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) to Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) in this all new, extended “Guardians of the Galaxy” trailer. The answer we find out is simple. “Because I’m one of the idiots that lives in it!” Quill immediately replies.

It’s a blunt, yet appropriate sentiment that sums up the plot of Marvel’s newest comic-to-film franchise. While the first trailer gave viewers an introduction to Rocket, Quill, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (WWE’s Dave Batista) and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), this clip makes the case for “Guardians” as one of the action films of the summer. Guns blaze, spaceships explode and one-liners lurk behind every dark corner.

“Guardians of the Galaxy” hits theaters on August 1 and was directed by James Gunn, best known for writing and producing the live-action “Scooby Doo” films in 2002 and 2004. Check out the action-packed trailer below:
