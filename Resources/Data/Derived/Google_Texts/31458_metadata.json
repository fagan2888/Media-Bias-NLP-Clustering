Scott Walker (R) on Friday suggested that denying health coverage to additional low-income Americans helps more people \u201clive the American Dream\u201d because they won\u2019t be \u201cdependent on the American government.\u201d\n\nWalker has recently leveled some criticism at other GOP leaders for accepting Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion, saying they shouldn\u2019t necessarily trust the government to come through with the federal funds to cover the policy. During an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on Friday, Walker was asked whether his position stemmed from an \u201cideological criticism,\u201d and if he believes the handful of Republican governors implementing this provision of the health law are not \u201cgenuine conservatives.\u201d\n\nThe governor didn\u2019t explicitly answer that question, pointing out that every state has different needs. But he did offer a broader criticism of the public health program.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, I just ask the basic question: Why is more people on Medicaid a good thing?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather find a way, particularly for able-bodied adults without children, I\u2019d like to find a way to get them into the workforce. I think ideologically, that\u2019s a better approach, not just as a conservative, but as an American. Have more people live the American dream if they\u2019re not dependent on the American government.\u201d\n\nIn reality, however, the majority of people who stand to benefit from the Medicaid expansion are already in the workforce. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which has been closely tracking the policy effect of states\u2019 decisions on this Obamacare provision, most of the people in this coverage gap are part of a demographic group known as the \u201cworking poor.\u201d Two thirds of them are part of a family where someone is working, and more than half of them are working themselves \u2014 often in sectors like the agricultural and service industries, which have a history of failing to provide insurance benefits to their workers.\n\nLast fall, the New York Times analyzed the data about the coverage gap and confirmed that the Americans being denied Medicaid are cashiers, cooks, nurses\u2019 aides, waiters and waitresses, and janitors. Most of them are people of color, and many are single mothers. They don\u2019t fit the conservative trope of the lazy individual who is overly dependent on the government programs \u2014 and, as the New York Times reported at the time, they are actually \u201cthe very kinds of people that the [Medicaid] program was intended to help.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, 20 states have refused to move forward with the expansion. According to Kaiser\u2019s latest estimates, about four million low-income people across the country currently fall into the coverage gap. If every state accepted the Medicaid expansion, the national uninsurance rate would be two percentage points lower.\n\nAlthough Walker has maintained his resistance to Obamacare\u2019s traditional Medicaid expansion, there isn\u2019t a coverage gap in his state. Even before the passage of the health reform law, Wisconsin had a generous Medicaid program that allowed people with incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty line to qualify. But the threshold varies for each state, and low-income people living in other places aren\u2019t so lucky. In Louisiana and Texas, for instance, a family of three with an annual income over $5,000 makes too much money to receive any Medicaid assistance.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The Wisconsin governor defended his fellow GOP leaders' decision to block Medicaid expansion, saying poor people need to enter the workforce.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The Wisconsin governor defended his fellow GOP leaders' decision to block Medicaid expansion, saying poor people need to enter the workforce.", "title": "Scott Walker: Denying Health Care To Low-Income People Helps Them \u2018Live The American Dream\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/11/14/3592511/scott-walker-medicaid-expansion/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/scottwalkerap-e1395668776161.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Wisconsin governor defended his fellow GOP leaders' decision to block Medicaid expansion, saying poor people need to enter the workforce.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/scottwalkerap-321x214.jpg", "title": "Scott Walker: Denying Health Care To Low-Income People Helps Them \u2018Live The American Dream\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/scottwalkerap-e1395668776161.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/scottwalkerap-e1395668776161.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-14T11:18:51+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda42f\"", "article_summary": "Health Scott Walker: Denying Health Care To Low-Income People Helps Them \u2018Live The American Dream\u2019 CREDIT: AP Photo/Jacquelyn MartinDefending his fellow Republican governors\u2019 decision to block Medicaid expansion in their states, Wisconsin Gov.\nAlthough Walker has maintained his resistance to Obamacare\u2019s traditional Medicaid expansion, there isn\u2019t a coverage gap in his state.\nAccording to Kaiser\u2019s latest estimates, about four million low-income people across the country currently fall into the coverage gap.\nIf every state accepted the Medicaid expansion, the national uninsurance rate would be two percentage points lower.\nHave more people live the American dream if they\u2019re not dependent on the American government.\u201dIn reality, however, the majority of people who stand to benefit from the Medicaid expansion are already in the workforce."}
