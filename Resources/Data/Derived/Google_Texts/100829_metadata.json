Their discussions will air on HBO's \"Vice\" documentary program in September.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after their discussion, Obama reflected, \"These are young people who made mistakes that aren't that different from mistakes I made.\"\n\n\"The difference is they did not have the support structure, the second chances, the resources that would allow them to survive these mistakes,\" he said.\n\nMore than 1.5 million Americans were in state or federal prisons at the end of 2013, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. African-Americans were 15 percent of the U.S. population at that time but accounted for about a third of its prisoners.\n\nObama wrote about his own drug use in his memoir \"Dreams from my Father\" and has made helping young black and Hispanic boys a priority of his remaining time in office through a program called \"My Brother's Keeper.\"\n\nThe issue is one he has said he intends to remain committed to after he leaves office in 2017.\n\nFor the unprecedented visit, guards cleared prisoners from the building where Obama toured and spoke.\n\nHe said the criminal justice system should do a better job of discerning between young drug offenders from poor backgrounds and hardened, violent criminals.\n\n\"We have to consider whether this is the smartest way for us to control crime and rehabilitate individuals,\" Obama said.\n\nNOT THE HARSHEST OF U.S. PRISONS\n\nEl Reno is a medium-security prison. David Fathi, director of the National Prison Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the visit would not show Obama the extent of overcrowding or lengthy stints in solitary confinement that exist at maximum-security prisons.\n\n\"He's not going to see the harshest and most restrictive and most problematic conditions in the federal prison system,\" Fathi said.\n\nBut, Fathi said, Obama deserves credit for being the first president to visit a federal prison and use his position to draw attention to the flawed system.\n\nAs his time in office begins to draw to a close, Obama has become more outspoken, while also enjoying a run of victories on Pacific Rim trade, his healthcare law, same-sex marriage rights and, earlier this week, a historic nuclear agreement with Iran.\n\nOverhauling prison sentencing is an issue he has set as a key goal for his final months in the White House. On Tuesday, he called on the U.S. Congress to send him a sentencing reform bill by the end of the year.\n\nSoaring U.S. incarceration followed a 1980s-1990s drug-crime crackdown. Mandatory minimum-sentencing guidelines from then would be altered under steps being considered in Congress for non-violent drug offenders.\n\nThe United States has 25 percent of the world's prisoners but just 5 percent of its population but has 25 percent of its prisoners.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ayesha Rascoe and Jeff Mason; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Cynthia Osterman)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "EL RENO, Oklahoma (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, who wrote in his memoir about us", "title": "Obama goes behind bars in push for criminal justice reform", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/07/16/Obama-goes-behind-bars-push-criminal-justice-reform", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama-criminal-justice_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/07/16/Obama-goes-behind-bars-push-criminal-justice-reform", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama-criminal-justice_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "EL RENO, Oklahoma (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, who wrote in his memoir about us", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1832\"", "article_summary": "Obama spoke with inmates and toured El Reno federal prison, which holds 1300 inmates, 146 percent of its capacity.\nHe said the criminal justice system should do a better job of discerning between young drug offenders from poor backgrounds and hardened, violent criminals.\n\"He's not going to see the harshest and most restrictive and most problematic conditions in the federal prison system,\" Fathi said.\nHe vowed to work with wardens and corrections officers to address overcrowding, a piece of his administration's wide-ranging criminal justice reform agenda.\nBut, Fathi said, Obama deserves credit for being the first president to visit a federal prison and use his position to draw attention to the flawed system."}
