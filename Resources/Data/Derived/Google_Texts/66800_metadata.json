Each geared towards the success of students and the community was there to support the cause.\n\n\"With all the crime and all the things we have going on in Meridian, I think it's important for us to continue to keep children in school and work to reduce the dropout rate,\" Divas on the Run Felecia Brown said. \"By reducing the drop out rate, we can hopefully reduce the crime rate.\"\n\nRunners and walkers were welcomed at the finish line by hundreds of supporters cheering them on. One runner and employee of the MPSD says usually he runs for the benefits, but today he ran for the future of students.\n\n\"Usually when I run it's for myself to maintain so on and so forth,\" marathon runner Tom Kuriakose said. \"To see the community come out and actually have something to compete for, that was really special, it made this competition special for me.\"\n\nA competition that many supporters hope will carry on into the classroom.\n\nIn all, 237 runners supported the cause to raise money for the Meridian Public School District's Dropout Prevention Program.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Meridian Public School District held the 1st annual Race for the Future, to benefit the Dropout Prevention Program.", "language": "english", "author": "Aaron Morrison", "og": {"url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Marathon-Runners-Race-for-the-Future-288924231.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/B5B/A48/B5BA4869C0014F7B9498D0018FA714B0", "type": "article", "description": "The Meridian Public School District held the 1st annual Race for the Future, to benefit the Dropout Prevention Program.", "title": "Meridian Runners Race for the Future"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "The Meridian Public School District held the 1st annual Race for the Future, to benefit the Dropout Prevention Program.", "title": "Meridian Runners Race for the Future", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Marathon-Runners-Race-for-the-Future-288924231.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/MPSD+Marathon+(400x225).jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Meridian Runners Race for the Future", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Meridian Runners Race for the"}, "article_summary": "In all, 237 runners supported the cause to raise money for the Meridian Public School District's Dropout Prevention Program.\nThe run known as Race for the Future is the 1st annual 5K run 2 mile walk and race organizer Deidre Bland says it's for a special cause.\nThat cause being education and the future of those students at one local school district.\nIf you were to ask runners their reason for racing, you would get responses that vary, but early Saturday morning runners came together united for one cause.\nOne runner and employee of the MPSD says usually he runs for the benefits, but today he ran for the future of students."}
