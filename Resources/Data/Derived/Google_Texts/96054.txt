Jenna Bush Hager gave birth Thursday to her second daughter with husband Henry Hager, naming the baby girl after her grandfather and former President George H.W. Bush.

Poppy Louise Hager weighed in at 7 lbs. 9 oz., joining her 2-year-old sister, Mila. Mr. Bush’s nickname growing up was “Poppy,” NBC’s “Today”reported.

“We are proud to name her after a man we so adore,” Mr. Hager told “Today.” “We are thrilled.”

Before leaving for maternity leave, Mrs. Hager, a “Today” correspondent, was surprised by her colleagues with baby gifts and and a phone call from her mother and grandmother, first ladies Laura and Barbara Bush.

“We’re calling in just to give her lots of love, and tell her we can’t wait to see that new baby,” Laura said on the phone.

“I can’t handle this!” an emotional Jenna kept repeating, NBC reported.

Savannah Guthrie added that the proud parents, “Facetimed grampy – Poppy – to tell him the news and it got very emotional. [And Jenna said,] ‘and then you can imagine how emotional I was after that.’ And [Jenna] said, ‘When Poppy was growing up in Connecticut, he was known as smart and loyal and humble’ and she says, ‘[Poppy] has some big socks to fill.’”
