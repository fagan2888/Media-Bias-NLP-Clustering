Why aren\u2019t docs in the room?\u2019 \u201d said John Nunes, chief medical officer of St. Charles Medical Group in Bend, Ore. This can spur resentment among other workers and make true teamwork difficult, he explained.\n\nBut in a world in which physicians have competed as individuals from the day they entered medical school, team dynamics may not come easy. Add to that the extraordinary responsibilities they face on the job, and it\u2019s no wonder that doctors often believe that the safety of their patients is entirely in their hands, which makes the idea of handing over the reins a difficult proposition, Nunes said.\n\n\u201cAutonomy is what [physicians] hold most dear,\u201d he explained.\n\nOften, there is a need to create urgency to make physicians see that they must give up some control.\n\n\u201cYour physicians in the room may not see a problem. Teamwork is in the eye of the beholder,\" Nunes said. \"What you have to do with physicians is create that burning platform because they don\u2019t see it. They see the patient in front of them. They don\u2019t think about community and they don\u2019t think about population health.\u201d\n\nBut once you can get physicians to make that switch, they can become some of the most collaborative and helpful staff in the entire hospital and eventually be your strongest ally.\n\n\u201cSix months later, the TeamSTEPPS was their idea,\u201d Nunes joked. \u201cA year later, they invented TeamSTEPPS.\u201d\n\nAndrew Grose, an orthopedic trauma surgeon at Westchester Medical Center, Poughkeepsie, N.Y,. and a TeamSTEPPS Master Trainer, said the duty to ignite that burning platform among physicians ultimately rests on hospital leadership.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be talking about how to engage physicians; that should be the C-suite\u2019s job,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen taking on that engagement, it\u2019s important to approach and speak to physicians \u201cas professionals: collegial, very short, very simple conversations that are peer to peer,\u201d Grose said.\n\nIn addition, the C-suite must first do a better job at taking care of them before trying to forge new relationships, he added. In a time when large numbers of doctors are reporting burnout, hospital leaders can\u2019t build a culture of trust unless they are treating doctors the way they would patients, Grose said.\n\nNunes considered circling back to TeamSTEPPS as a way to help alleviate that burnout in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe pay a personal price for the great work that we do, but we lower that price with teamwork,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Teamwork may not come naturally to a group that thrives on autonomy, but doctors can be some of the most effective champions of change around if you can earn their trust, say speakers on the third and final day of the TeamSTEPPS National Conference.", "csrf-token": "OJI33AjifAuU3LAIFokvjRJLWLmSO65XjnMr6BjsoKc=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/June/STEPPs_190x127.jpg?1448315759", "description": "Teamwork may not come naturally to a group that thrives on autonomy, but doctors can be some of the most effective champions of change around&mdash; if you can earn their trust, say speakers on the third and final day of the TeamSTEPPS National Conference.", "card": "summary", "title": "How to Engage Physicians in TeamSTEPPS"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/June/STEPPs_190x127.jpg?1448315759", "type": "Article", "description": "Teamwork may not come naturally to a group that thrives on autonomy, but doctors can be some of the most effective champions of change around&mdash; if you can earn their trust, say speakers on the third and final day of the TeamSTEPPS National Conference.", "title": "How to Engage Physicians in TeamSTEPPS"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "TeamSTEPPS, TeamSTEPPS National Conference, TeamSTEPPS physicians", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "DENVER \u2014 When it comes to training hospital staff in TeamSTEPPS, physicians are notoriously the most difficult members to win over, said speakers on the third day of the National TeamSTEPPS conference.\nand a TeamSTEPPS Master Trainer, said the duty to ignite that burning platform among physicians ultimately rests on hospital leadership.\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be talking about how to engage physicians; that should be the C-suite\u2019s job,\u201d he said.\nNunes considered circling back to TeamSTEPPS as a way to help alleviate that burnout in the first place.\nWhy aren\u2019t docs in the room?\u2019 \u201d said John Nunes, chief medical officer of St. Charles Medical Group in Bend, Ore."}
