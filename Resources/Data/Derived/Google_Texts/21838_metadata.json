Eaton Corp., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75636 (E.D.Mich. May 30, 2013), rev\u2019d, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 8375 (6th Cir. May 1, 2014), a class of \u201cfront-line\u201d supervisors at one of the employer\u2019s manufacturing plants claimed that they were misclassified under the executive exemption, and therefore they were owed overtime compensation. Although the employees conceded that they satisfied the first three elements of the exemption, they disputed the extent to which their \u201csuggestions and recommendations\u201d as to the hiring and firing of other employees were given sufficient weight to meet the standard for the exemption. The district court awarded summary judgment to the employer, finding it \u201cfatal\u201d to the employees\u2019 claim that their suggestions concerning whether probationary employees should be retained, whether employees were qualified to advance, and whether to initiate disciplinary action were indeed \u201cgiven particular weight\u201d by the employer\u2019s upper management.\n\nLast month, the Sixth Circuit disagreed. Following the employees\u2019 appeal, the Sixth Circuit held that, to warrant summary judgment, the employer must show that \u201cno reasonable jury could find that individual Plaintiffs lacked sufficient influence over personnel changes of status to qualify for the FLSA\u2019s executive exemption.\u201d The Sixth Circuit then looked to the employees\u2019 evidence that \u201ctheir personnel recommendations were disregarded and rejected, that they were not trained to participate in personnel recruitment and intake, and that their job descriptions did not include decision-making regarding personnel.\u201d In light of this evidence, the Court stated that, \u201c[a]s a matter of law, an employee who merely carries out the orders of a superior to effectuate a change of status is not performing exempt executive duties.\u201d The Court concluded that \u201c[w]hile Plaintiffs certainly did work in supervisory positions, the record reflects substantial controversy as to the material facts at issue in this case\u00ad\u00ad\u2014whether or not Plaintiff\u2019s suggestions and recommendations as to hirings, firings, promotions, or other changes in status were given particular weight by Defendants.\u201d Accordingly, the Court reversed the district court\u2019s decision \u2013 and the award in favor of the employer \u2013 and remanded the case for trial.\n\nTakeaway\n\nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Bacon serves as a warning to employers that employees who may supervise other employees but who cannot hire or fire such employees, or at least make meaningful recommendations as to such decisions, are unlikely to satisfy the executive exemption. Per the employees in Bacon, even a perfunctory \u201cvoice at the table,\u201d i.e., employees whose suggestions are routinely disregarded or ignored by management, will not suffice. Rather, employers should take care that executive employees are given significant input in employment decisions in order to avoid claims of misclassification.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a recent decision, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued helpful guidance to employers \u2013 albeit in a decision in favor of a class of employees \u2013 as to what responsibilities employees must have in order to satisfy the executive exemption to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/sixth-circuit-affirms-executive-exemption-to-apply-class-employees-must-do-more-mere", "type": "article", "site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "In a recent decision, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued helpful guidance to employers &amp;ndash; albeit in a decision in favor of a class of employees &amp;ndash; as to what responsibilities employee", "title": "Sixth Circuit Affirms that, for Executive Exemption to Apply, Class of Employees Must Do More than Merely Carry Out Supervisors\u2019 Orders Regarding Hiring and Firing"}, "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "keywords": "Legal, Business, Sixth Circuit, Executive Exemption, Labor, Employment, FLSA, Bacon v.
