Orange City, IA

The Orange City day care provider charged with murder was back in court Thursday morning.

33-year-old Rochelle Sapp pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and child endangerment.

Authorities say Sapp admitted to throwing three-year-old Autumn Elgersma to the floor after she refused to take her coat off in October. The girl later died of head injuries at a Sioux Falls hospital.

A judge also denied Sapp's request to have her bond reduced, but did allow her to post 10 percent of her $250,000 bond, so Sapp is now at home.

She's expected back in court in April.
