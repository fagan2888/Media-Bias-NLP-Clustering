LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - A new administrator at the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services has resigned after a little more than a week on the job.

Yolanda Webb, director of the Developmental Disabilities Division, submitted her resignation Wednesday to Gov. Pete Ricketts. Webb started the job on Aug. 31 at a salary of $142,500.

Webb, of New Orleans, La., had been the executive director and CEO of the Metropolitan Human Services District, the planning and public policy body for several parishes.

Webb says in her resignation letter that she decided to go in a new direction, but did not elaborate. In a statement, Ricketts says his administration has already started looking for a new division director.

Courtney Miller, a deputy director at DHHS, will serve as the divisionâ€™s acting director.
