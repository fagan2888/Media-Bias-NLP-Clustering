Here’s an extra-large grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.

Note how often these grammatical and style lapses occur in long, complex sentences. If the writer and editor have trouble keeping track of the sentence, what hope does a reader have? Pare them down or break them up.

•••

Mr. Inslee [the governor of Washington] argues that in the state of Microsoft and Boeing and where science and technology drive much of the economy, denying the science of climate change is a losing political stance.

The two phrases modifying “state” — “of Microsoft and Boeing” and “where science and technology …” — are not parallel, and so should not be connected by “and.” Replacing “and” with a comma would work.

•••

The fight over fracking in a swing state that prizes its natural beauty and relies on its energy resources for jobs and tax revenues has become a monthslong headache for Democratic leaders, opening fissures within the party and between pro-energy moderates and environmental groups that want to impose tough limits on the oil and gas rigs sprouting up alongside subdivisions.

Under the agreement announced Monday, Representative Jared Polis, a millionaire Democrat who has been a leading backer of a campaign to limit drilling, said he would pull his support for two measures that would have prohibited drilling within 2,000 feet of homes and given communities the power to pass tough new rules on energy development in their backyards — a power now claimed by the state.

Two successive sentences of over 60 words each, stuffed with multiple clauses and a parade of prepositional phrases. It’s as though we’re daring readers to try to get through them.

•••

Express Scripts, a company that manages drug benefits for insurers, prepared a worst-case situation: It said that states alone could be on the hook for up to $55 billion if every Medicaid patient or state prisoner with the disease was treated.

Use the subjunctive for a hypothetical or contrary-to-fact clause like this: “were treated.”

•••

Here, little unites the lives of the actress Hana (Hannah D. Scott) and the athlete Milos (Saul Reichlin) except their Jewry and the horrors they suffered and witnessed.

“Jewry” means the Jewish people collectively. We wanted “Jewishness.”

•••

[Video summary] Women keep their clothes loose, lightweight and stick to light colors to stay cool throughout the sweaty New York City summer.

The three elements are not parallel. Make it “keep their clothes loose and lightweight, and stick to …”

•••

The hedge fund firm of billionaire Paul E. Singer has about 300 employees, yet it has managed to force Argentina, a nation of 41 million people, into a position where it now has to contemplate a humbling surrender.

“Billionaire” is a description; don’t use it with the name like this as if it were a title.

•••

More than a decade and a half ago, almost no one thought that a feather boa-wearing former professional wrestler could become the governor of Minnesota.

We needed another hyphen to hold this modifier together: “feather-boa-wearing.”

•••

Regulators and consumer advocates say the true figure is probably much higher since many victims do not report being ripped off because of the difficulty in prosecuting such cases and the embarrassment of being duped.

No reason for the slang.

•••

Over the last few years, pension smoothing has been one of Congress’ favorite fiscal tricks, with members proposing it as a way to pay for all sorts of things: Cutting tax rates. Repealing the tax on medical devices in the Affordable Care Act. Shoring up benefits for coal miners.

Make it “Congress’s favorite fiscal tricks.”

•••

The disagreements surfaced after Wendy R. Sherman, the under secretary of state for policy and the lead American negotiator with Iran, made the case that the four-month-long extension in negotiations agreed to by the administration, along with modest additional sanctions relief, were warranted “because we have seen significant progress in the negotiating room.”

The singular “extension” should have a singular verb, “was warranted” — the “along with” phrase is grammatically treated as parenthetical. It’s no wonder the grammar went awry in such a stuffed and convoluted sentence. (Also, the “long” in “four-month-long extension” is superfluous.)

•••

Leaders of the Republican-controlled North Carolina legislature on Tuesday announced details of a tentative budget agreement, including a 7 percent pay raise for teachers in public schools, that could end a monthlong stalemate that has exposed a breach between Republican conservatives and moderates in the state.

Make it “a 7 percent raise.” A raise is understood to be in pay.

•••

By then, Jones had gone back to Kentucky, and in November 1953, he won an election to county sheriff.

Make it “he won election as county sheriff” or “he was elected county sheriff.”

•••

The beer was for the send-off of a reporter who was leaving the paper after 13 years, adding to dozens of staff members who had left in the previous year, reducing the newsroom to nearly half the size it was five years ago.

The phrasing is ambiguous. Was it reduced by almost 50 percent, meaning it is now a little more than half of its previous size? Or was it reduced by more than 50 percent, so that it is now “nearly half the size” it once was? Rephrase.

•••

Rowland’s referentiality can feel heavy-handed.

The word “referentiality” is also likely to feel heavy-handed to many readers.

•••

Studies have repeatedly shown that participants who are in high positions of power (or who are temporarily induced to feel powerful) are less able to adopt the visual, cognitive or emotional perspective of other people, compared to participants who are powerless (or are made to feel so).

Make it “compared with.” The groups are being contrasted, rather than likened. The Times’s stylebook says this:

compare. Use compare to when the intent is to liken things: The book compared the quarterback’s role to the job of a company’s vice president for operations. When the intent is to compare and contrast, or just to contrast, use compare with: They compared Terry’s forecasting with Dana’s, and found Dana more accurate.

•••

[Headline] Cures for Canines

Usually it’s best to call a dog a dog. As the stylebook says, “canine” as a noun is trite.

•••

She has also helped children prepare their family home for sale, including hiring painters, carpet cleaners and art appraisers or arranging for the Salvation Army or Housing Works to pick up furniture and clothes once a parent has passed away.

No need for the euphemism. “Died” is perfectly acceptable.

•••

With the outbreak of World War II, he enlisted in the Army and completed officers’ training at Ft. Benning, Ga.

The stylebook says this:

fort. Spell out in news copy and capitalize as part of a name: Fort Hamilton. The abbreviation (Ft.) may be used with the name in a headline, a chart, a list or a map.

•••

Fortuitously for Mr. Ayer, “Fury” was born before another of his films, “Sabotage,” ran into a wall of resistance from audience and critics alike.

In precise usage, “fortuitously” means “by chance”; it does not mean “fortunately.”

•••

It looks like the Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer is staying at the St. Louis Art Museum.

Make it “as if.”

•••

Going forward, if the city does not appeal, its officials will have to decide just what those measures should be.

This faddish phrase causes groans among readers, and is often entirely superfluous.
