They called such erasures damnatio memoriae.\n\nThe Soviet Union likewise airbrushed away, or \u201cTrotskyized,\u201d all the images of any past kingpin who became politically incorrect.\n\nThe Obama administration seems obsessed with doing the same to retired Gen. David Petraeus.\n\nSecretary of Defense Ashton Carter is now thinking of retroactively taking away one or two of Gen. Petraeus\u2018 four stars. The potential demotion in rank, opposed by the Army, is intended as further punishment for the misdemeanor to which he pleaded guilty last year. Gen. Petraeus accepted two years of probation and paid a $100,000 fine for allowing his mistress, Paula Broadwell, to read classified information for research on the biography she was writing about him.\n\nMr. Carter apparently wants to ensure that Gen. Petraeus is treated the same fashion as other miscreant generals and admirals who have lost rank. Yet there is no evidence that Mrs. Broadwell (who enjoyed a military security clearance of her own) ever shared the classified information with anyone or disclosed it in the biography.\n\nThat does not excuse the bad judgment of the general. But it does invite an obvious comparison with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She not only sent classified information over her unsecured email to several individuals, but remains untruthful about that fact.\n\nTo this day, we still do not know how many people received classified information via Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, or whether hackers tapped into her non-approved private server. By any sense of commensurability, the Obama Justice Department should charge Mrs. Clinton in the fashion it did Gen. Petraeus. If she goes free, the Obama administration confirms the suspicion that there are no longer any security laws for government officials \u2014 particularly when they are powerful and their politics agree with the president\u2019s.\n\nGen. Petraeus was not just any four-star general. He was the most effective and talented American general since Gen. Matthew Ridgway, who saved what appeared to be a lost Korean War. Gen. Petraeus and his team promoted the so-called \u201csurge\u201d of troops into Iraq, and enlisted tens of thousands of Iraqis to join the American effort to defeat radical terrorists and insurrectionists.\n\nGen. Petraeus\u2018 efforts saved Iraq \u2014 and thousands of American and Iraqi lives. Barack Obama entered office in 2009 with a mostly quiet Iraq. Gen. Petraeus\u2018 legacy explains why Vice President Joe Biden claimed Iraq as possibly one of the administration\u2019s \u201cgreatest achievements.\u201d President Obama himself boasted in late 2011 that he was pulling out all U.S. forces from a \u201csovereign, stable and self-reliant\u201d Iraq.\n\nThat claim was true \u2014 until Mr. Obama\u2019s politically driven skedaddle from Iraq created a vacuum to be filled by Islamic State terrorists.\n\nPractically, it might not be wise for Mr. Obama to humiliate Gen. Petraeus, thereby revisiting the circumstances of the general\u2019s strange exit from the Obama administration.\n\nThe media have rarely noted that the administration learned of Gen. Petraeus\u2018 imbroglio sometime in summer of 2012, right in the middle of the Obama re-election campaign. Yet Gen. Petraeus\u2018 sudden, unexpected resignation as CIA director came just three days after Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election. What exactly the CIA was doing in Libya, and what happened in Benghazi, are likewise murky.\n\nThe current puritanical frenzy with regard to our military is sacrificing battlefield talent. We never would have won World War II had we shared the administration\u2019s present obsessions.\n\nThe hard-drinking and womanizing Adm. Ernest King was the architect of the brilliant comeback of the U.S. Navy, which had been crippled at Pearl Harbor. Less than four years later under King, it utterly destroyed the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\nGen. George S. Patton in 1943 slapped two soldiers in Sicily whom he thought were slackers, but who were probably ill. Yet the reprimanded Patton\u2019s career was ultimately salvaged. He went on to save tens of thousands of American lives in Europe with his audacious armored drives and often brilliant encirclements.\n\nGen. Dwight D. Eisenhower quite possibly had an affair with his chauffeur, Kay Summersby, in the midst of overseeing the Normandy operations. Should we now strip the long-dead Eisenhower of his fifth star, given that he may well have discussed confidential information with Summersby while overseeing an army of 2 million?\n\nIconic Gen. Douglas MacArthur carried on an affair with an underaged Filipina actress, Isabel Rosario Cooper, while he was top U.S. commander in the Philippines in 1930. Should MacArthur have been relieved of duty before he led a Pacific offensive that liberated the Philippines from Japanese occupation?\n\nGen. Petraeus has lost his reputation. He resigned his job as CIA director. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor. He was fined. He was put on probation.\n\nEnough is enough with Gen. Petraeus. It is time to move on for an administration that threw away a stable Iraq \u2014 once saved by the man it still hounds.\n\n\u2022 Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In politically driven moods, the ancient Romans often wiped from history all mention of a prior hero or celebrity.
