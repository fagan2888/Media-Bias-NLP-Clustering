One morning this summer, Dr. Sid O\u2019Bryant fit his hulking frame into his silver sedan and pointed it along a route that ended at a Medicaid-funded primary-care clinic there.\n\nO\u2019Bryant is one of the school\u2019s premier Alzheimer\u2019s researchers, and a stubborn one. While at Texas Tech in 2006, he drafted a dream proposal to create the first-ever diagnostic blood test for the cognitive disease. It would be administered in primary-care offices. It just needed funding. But there isn\u2019t a blood biomarker that tips off its presence the way a high blood-glucose level does for diabetes. So the National Institutes of Health wasn\u2019t having it.\n\n\u201cI was basically told, \u2018This can\u2019t work, so why would you even do this research?\u2019 \u201d he says.\n\nBut O\u2019Bryant, barrel chested and broad shouldered, does not seem like a man who would allow that sort of rebuff to stop him. A former powerlifter (heaviest competition squat: 705 pounds), he veered into the less intense\u2014but still demanding\u2014world of bodybuilding after having spinal fusion surgery. When the NIH declined his request, he bolstered his proposal and eventually got it funded. The research began in 2012. Two years later, he\u2019s again at the mercy of the NIH. Once they renew the grant, he can begin taking blood samples from Tarrant County residents to test. But when?\n\n\u201cFunding lines are so bad, I just don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, trailing off. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWhich is why he\u2019s in his sedan, heading to the clinic. The $8.6 million program known as MIGHTY Care\u2014Mobile Interdisciplinary Geriatric Healthcare in the Community (yes, the acronym needs work)\u2014will help more than 3,000 low-income Hispanic residents manage chronic diseases and treat minor medical problems at two clinics and a few other locations, like churches and thrift stores. On paper, its goals are basically the same as any post-Affordable Care Act health-care program: slice readmission rates, drop ER visits, engage the patient in his or her own care.\n\nBut there\u2019s something else here, too: the Health & Aging Brain Among Latino Elders (HABLE) study. O\u2019Bryant will ask the elderly, largely Hispanic population to allow the physician to take a blood sample. Pending funding, he will store them and look for differences in the way Alzheimer\u2019s manifests itself in Hispanics compared to other demographics. He hopes to eventually study 3,000 total samples, with equal amounts coming from non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic or Mexican-Americans, and African-Americans.\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s Association estimates the disease will affect the brains of as many as 16 million Americans by 2050. As of this year, 5.2 million had it. Alzheimer\u2019s steals a person\u2019s mind and ends in death. There is no cure.\n\nAnd so while he waited for word on the grant renewal, O\u2019Bryant studied the brain tissue and blood of genetically modified mice, attempting to match biomarkers present in both. He has found that the disease is \u201ca mixed bag,\u201d that it doesn\u2019t affect everyone as neatly and uniformly as it\u2019s currently treated. The biomarkers he has identified can pick out mice with Alzheimer\u2019s at a success rate of 90 percent or higher, he says. If he gets his money, he is confident he\u2019ll be able to back that up in humans and show the differences in its development in different racial and ethnic demographics, something that has never been done before.\n\n\u201cA lot of people still have no faith in it, that it\u2019ll be useful,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s getting harder and harder for people to take that stance, because of the success.\u201d\n\nThis article first appeared in the October issue of D Magazine.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "Dr. Sid O\u2019Bryant is taking on Alzheimer\u2019s, a degenerative, incurable disease that will affect 16 million Americans by 2050, at an estimated cost to society of $1.2 trillion.
