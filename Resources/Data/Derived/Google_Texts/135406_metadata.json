The company is located on 4014 S. 9th street in Kalamazoo, and serves customers in Kalamazoo and Van Buren County.\n\nThe landscape company offers lawn maintenance and landscape design services for residential and commercial purposes, in addition to the separate lawn care services the Weed Man franchise offers.\n\n\u201cThrough the work of my grandfather, my dad, my brother and me, we have built the company on good reputation, quality work and good customer service,\u201d said Nate DeVisser, division manager of Weed Man Kalamazoo.\n\nNate DeVisser started to manage Weed Man Kalamazoo in 2003 after his dad, Dave DeVisser, bought the franchise as a part of the family business. The lawn care franchise offers fertilizers and weed control, mostly for residential customers.\n\nAfter almost a decade in Kalamazoo, the local Weed Man division joined the franchise's Million Dollar Club in June, as it earned more than one million dollars in its net annual sales.\n\n\u201cWe are the second largest Weed Man franchise in Michigan,\u201d said Nate DeVisser, who added that the largest Michigan Weed Man franchise is located in Novi. \u201cThere are only 20 to 30 Weed Man franchises in the U.S. who are above that million dollar mark.\u201d\n\nDeVisser said there are around 10 Weed Man franchises in the state, and the closest division outside of Kalamazoo can be found in Grand Rapids.\n\n\u201cAs a business we have grown a lot, and we are able to keep 10 to 11 full time employees year round,\u201d said DeVisser, who added that most landscaping companies find it hard to keep a high number of employees throughout the winter season.\n\n\n\nSeveral members of the DeVisser family are currently employed with DeVisser Landscape Services, such as brothers Nate and Joel DeVisser, their dad Dave DeVisser, and his sister, Jan Post.\n\n\u201cI was raised in this business,\u201d said Post, who has worked for the company since 1983.\n\nJoel DeVisser, the vice president of DeVisser Landscape Services, said the Weed Man franchise is a \"nice addition\" to the company\u2019s preexisting services.\n\n\"Weed Man Kalamazoo complements our (landscaping) services,\" he said. \"Despite the economic down times a couple of years ago, (Weed Man Kalamazoo) continued to grow because it's a low-cost service.\"\n\nWeed Man Kalamazoo's rapid growth allowed for the local franchise to expand in size and employment, and is currently looking to hire two additional employees for the franchise.\n\n\"We started out with one Weed Man truck 10 years ago, and today we have seven trucks,\" Nate DeVisser said.\n\n\n\nDeVisser added that the Weed Man department of DeVisser Landscape Services is also expanding the office space for their sales team.\n\n\"I'm proud of (the growth),\" Nate DeVisser said. \"Our family works well together, and we've come a long way.\"\n\nChristina Cantero is a reporter for MLive/the Kalamazoo Gazette.
