In a general election, Mr. Obama is expected to help Mrs. Clinton raise money, and he would be asked to campaign for her in, among other places, the most heavily African-American counties of the swing states that he won in 2008 and 2012, according to numerous people briefed on the plans, who discussed them on the condition of anonymity\u2026 [E]ven in [battleground] states, Mrs. Clinton does not plan to distance herself from Mr. Obama\u2019s record, advisers said. Rather, she intends to praise, above all, the economic progress Mr. Obama has made, getting the country out of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and cutting the unemployment rate nearly in half. Advisers say Mrs. Clinton will promise a \u201cnew chapter\u201d that would expand upon Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to address persistently stagnant wages and rising inequality.\n\nWhy would Hillary Clinton want to align herself with a guy whose average job approval rating hasn\u2019t been above water in nearly two years? Lots of reasons. For one, the media\u2019s going to wet itself every time she breaks with one of O\u2019s policies. The juicy drama of Team Barack and Team Hillary feuding behind the scenes will be irresistible, notwithstanding the press\u2019s rooting interest in her candidacy. The more stories there are like that, the more time Hillary will spend smoothing Democratic feathers instead of attacking the GOP. Not optimal. Relatedly, the big mystery of her campaign is whether she can turn out Obama\u2019s base in the same numbers O himself did. Philip Klein has a nice piece about that today noting that, when it comes to black voters and young voters especially, Obama has set the bar awfully high. Every high-profile disagreement between him and her on policy raises the risk that O\u2019s base will stay home, forcing Clinton to scramble to make up those votes elsewhere. I think she can do it: It won\u2019t surprise anyone if the First! Woman! President! does better with women than even Obama did, and Bill has always done well with working-class whites and Latinos. Losing the \u201cObama coalition\u201d doesn\u2019t mean Hillary will lose, but it\u2019ll make the race tougher for her. Better for her to hug O as much as possible and keep a stiff upper lip while the GOP accuses her of running for Obama\u2019s third term, which they\u2019re going to do regardless, than to run away from him and alienate Obama fans on her own side.\n\nMost importantly, though, embracing Obama\u2019s record won\u2019t hurt her as much as it would an average candidate running for a third consecutive term for his or her party in the White House. If, say, Martin O\u2019Malley were the Democratic nominee, he\u2019d be such an unknown quantity that his candidacy would end up as a referendum on four more years of Obama. If Joe Biden were the nominee, he\u2019d be so closely identified with O already that he couldn\u2019t distinguish himself if he tried. That too would be a de facto referendum on another term for the current president. The novelty of Hillary is that not only can she plausibly turn to Bill Clinton\u2019s record instead of O\u2019s as needed, but she herself is such a well known quantity to voters that she already enjoys quasi-presidential notoriety herself. This election won\u2019t be a referendum on Obama, no matter how closely she hews to his agenda. If it ends up as a referendum, it\u2019ll be a referendum on Hillary. And since she has no signature accomplishments as senator or secretary of state to tout, since her deepest political beliefs are largely a mystery to this day, any referendum on Hillary the politician inevitably becomes a referendum on Hillary the person. Viewed that way, endorsing Obama\u2019s agenda is actually a shrewd and efficient way for her to check the box on having a policy platform. She\u2019ll borrow a bunch from O, some from Bill, and of course some from Elizabeth Warren to make sure that the hard left doesn\u2019t stay home next November. But the policies are largely beside the point: Anyone voting for Hillary will know that she\u2019s to the left of the Republican nominee and probably a bit to the right of Obama on foreign policy. For most of the country that\u2019ll be all they need to know and then they can proceed to the more important question of whether \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d for a woman president and whether electing Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio would, as Team Hillary will insist, mean that birth control will disappear from American convenience stores overnight. In fact, here\u2019s the silliest line in the NYT piece:\n\n\u201cHow do you leverage the benefits and accomplishments of the last four years but make clear this is an election about the future?\u201d said Chris Lehane, a strategist who worked for Bill Clinton and Al Gore.\n\nIf you\u2019re Hillary Clinton, you don\u2019t. Realistically, with \u201cthe stench of yesterday\u201d all around you, you can\u2019t hope to make this an election about \u201cthe future.\u201d You can gesture to that by parrotting Warren on income inequality, but again, when people go to vote, the decision will be whether they\u2019re in the mood for a return to Clintonism and nothing will change that. The irony of her endorsing O\u2019s policies is that, if she wins, it\u2019ll likely be because she represents the opposite of what Obama represented in 2008 \u2014 a return to the known quantity, to experience, to the familiar after eight turbulent years. The policies are second to the image. In that sense, she\u2019s the ideal successor to O.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Sequel.", "title": "Emerging Hillary strategy: Run for Obama\u2019s third term", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/04/13/emerging-hillary-strategy-run-for-obamas-third-term/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-13T15:21:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-13T15:16:24+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016, Bill Clinton, democratic, Elizabeth Warren, hillary, nomination, nyt, Obama, party, record,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Why would Hillary Clinton want to align herself with a guy whose average job approval rating hasn\u2019t been above water in nearly two years?\nAdvisers say Mrs. Clinton will promise a \u201cnew chapter\u201d that would expand upon Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to address persistently stagnant wages and rising inequality.\nFor one, the media\u2019s going to wet itself every time she breaks with one of O\u2019s policies.\nMost importantly, though, embracing Obama\u2019s record won\u2019t hurt her as much as it would an average candidate running for a third consecutive term for his or her party in the White House.\nIf you\u2019re Hillary Clinton, you don\u2019t."}
