Why do you think that is, and how does that help your constituents?\n\nTom Reed (Photo: File photo)\n\nAs the political season comes to an end, the people of the 23rd Congressional District will soon have the chance to make a decision on our representation in the halls of Congress. In this campaign, I have worked hard to highlight our record of accessibility and present the stark contrasts between my opponent and myself. The policy that affects everyone should come before the personal attacks that don't address the challenges facing our country today.\n\nOur campaign is about restoring jobs, economic opportunity, fairness and a sense of caring for the community. Instead of coming up with a plan to come together as a community and restore jobs in our region, my opponent has launched false attacks on my record and my personal life. Obviously, Americans find much about modern campaigns distasteful, and rightly so.\n\nI believe politics and public policy can and should be a more honorable part of American life. In the course of this campaign, I've talked with thousands of folks about our plans for creating jobs, our work to protect rural hospitals and real change that will truly benefit families here at home. Our work to simplify the tax code will keep money in the pockets of the hardworking taxpayers who earned it. We've worked across the aisle to pass bipartisan advance manufacturing legislation that will grow manufacturing across the United States and increase opportunity right here in our backyard.\n\nRegardless of what my opponent and outside groups have done to negatively influence this campaign, the facts matter. I've put over 200,000 miles on our Buick to continue doing what we believe in \u2014 listening to you. While my campaign has used a variety of television ads to highlight my opponent's record of doubling property taxes and increasing her own taxpayer-funded salary four times, those issues are public record, and an accurate and fair representation of her destructive vision for our home.\n\nThe voters deserve a meaningful debate and from the beginning, my campaign has resonated with the voters because we listen to the people of New York. My door is always open. I've heard their concerns and spoken to them about the kind of leadership they need in Washington, D.C. Many are deeply troubled by this administration's failures on everything from the economy and job creation to national security and Obamacare. The burden of carrying President Barack Obama's agenda is obviously a heavy one for my opponent, and it shows in the desperation in her attacks.\n\nIt's important for voters to be able to judge both candidates based not only on their policy positions and their philosophies, but also on their desire to listen to the people and understand their concerns. I care about our communities. To me, it's simple: The best representation comes from truly listening and working together to preserve this place we call home for generations to come. I promise you I will always continue in this effort.\n\nReed, a Republican, lives in Corning.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://ithacajr.nl/1wqXu5o", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Politics and public policy can and should be a more honorable part of American life.", "og": {"site_name": "Ithaca Journal", "description": "Politics and public policy can and should be a more honorable part of American life.", "title": "Reed: Robertson prefers false attacks to real issues", "url": "http://www.ithacajournal.com/story/opinion/2014/10/25/reed-robertson-prefers-false-attacks-real-issues/17887539/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/ithacajournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Politics and public policy can and should be a more honorable part of American life.", "title": "Reed: Robertson prefers false attacks to real issues", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b431d25da209b75b2fc3a61084860cc4f9554c7f/c=0-46-500-546&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Ithaca/2014/08/12/tomreed.jpg", "creator": "@ithacajournal", "site": "@ithacajournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=890555245", "fb": {"app_id": 185569708121396}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "The policy that affects everyone should come before the personal attacks that don't address the challenges facing our country today.\nIn this campaign, I have worked hard to highlight our record of accessibility and present the stark contrasts between my opponent and myself.\nInstead of coming up with a plan to come together as a community and restore jobs in our region, my opponent has launched false attacks on my record and my personal life.\nIn the course of this campaign, I've talked with thousands of folks about our plans for creating jobs, our work to protect rural hospitals and real change that will truly benefit families here at home.\nOur campaign is about restoring jobs, economic opportunity, fairness and a sense of caring for the community."}
