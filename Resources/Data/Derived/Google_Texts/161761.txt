Though he doesn't know where yet, Ty Okada will be standing on the podium for the 120 pound Class AAA tournament at the end of the night.

Okada locked up All-State honors with a 3-1 overtime victory over St. Paul Harding senior Keinnan Thacker Saturday morning to advance to the consolation semifinals. Okada is assured of at least a sixth place finish.

He'll compete Saturday afternoon against the loser of today's championship semifinal between Farmington's Jamin LeDuc and Brainerd's Andy Scholosser.
