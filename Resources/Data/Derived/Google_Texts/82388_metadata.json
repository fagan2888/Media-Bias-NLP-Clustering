When Obamacare was implemented and forced upon America, our state legislature decided not to implement an\n\nObamacare Exchange, like many other states. When Wayne saw that North Dakota families\n\nand individuals would not be able to afford health insurance, he reached across\n\nparty lines in the case known as KING vs BURWELL. If that lawsuit would have\n\nbeen successful, it would have eliminated the credits to help low-income families\n\npay health insurance premiums. Wayne has always opposed Obamacare but this\n\nlaw was not the way to eliminate it. Wayne Stenehjem has always looked out for\n\nour best interests.\"\n\nNicely put by my wife, Cathy.\n\nAs a North Dakota farm boy I say it like this: The Obamacare bull was let out of\n\nthe corral by Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and President Obama. In 2010, Obama signed it into law. Attorney General Stenehjem signed on early with a Florida lawsuit to block it.\n\nHe, along with other AGs, opposed it since it was \u2014 and still is \u2014 unconstitutional.\n\nI'm dealing with it now, however, and I'm glad Stenehjem's action allowed the credits\n\nto keep coming so I can pay premiums for coverage. If the King vs Burwell\n\nlawsuit would have been successful, I wouldn't have health insurance.\n\nI'm grateful to Stenehjem for making this Obamacare bull better suited to my\n\nneeds.\n\nI believe Doug Burgum means well and is a great guy, but he\n\nneeds to get off the Obamacare bull, because he will be riding this bull off into\n\nthe sunset. Come the day after the election in November, we will experience the\n\nmost beautiful sunrise we ever have seen as we welcome our new governor,\n\nWayne Stenehjem, into his new office.\n\nSchlecht lives in Fargo", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "opinion,letters,Obamacare", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "INFORUM", "description": "In response to Doug Burgum's slick TV ads on Wayne Stenehjem supporting Obamacare, my wife summed it up like this: \"Wayne Stenehjem has always looked out for North Dakota people.
