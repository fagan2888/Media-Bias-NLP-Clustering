It's not so common, but it\u2019s happening around the globe.\n\nDoctors are diagnosing patients with a red meat allergy after being bit by the \u2018Lone Star\u2019 tick. The Lone Star tick, named for Texas, may have started causing this problem over a decade ago, but was first linked to meat allergies in 2011. Researchers think some other types of ticks might also cause meat allergies; cases have been reported in Australia, France, Germany, Sweden, Spain, Japan and Korea, cited the AP.\n\nDr. Erin McGintee, an allergy specialist who has seen nearly 200 cases over the last three years in Long Island said, \u201cWhy would someone think they\u2019re allergic to meat when they\u2019ve been eating it their whole life?\u201d What\u2019s interesting about this particular allergy is that symptoms may not occur right after consuming the meat, but possibly many hours later.\n\nHours after eating a hamburger, 63-year-old Louise Danzig stated, \u201cI woke up with very swollen hands that were on fire with itching.\u201d She also noted she felt her lips and tongue swelling and before making a call for help, was losing her ability to speak. Another bite victim, 71-year-old Georgette Simmons, went to a steakhouse for dinner and reported waking up the next morning with her body on fire and covered in hives. A few weeks later, she had another steak dinner and hours later woke up \u201calmost hysterical\u201d with more severe symptoms.\n\nPatients are being treated with antihistamines to ease itching or epinephrine shots in more severe cases. Doctors are unsure if the allergy is permanent, but even if it\u2019s not, additional bites can bring the allergy back. Lone Star ticks are mainly found on white-tailed deer residing in southeastern and eastern United States.

This map has been designed to answer the question, \u2018What ticks should I be concerned about at a regional scale?\u2019\u201d\n\nFortunately, not all tick bites will result in a meat allergy, but there are other tick-borne illnesses to be aware of. If you have a tick, it should be properly removed as soon as possible. Furthermore, if you experience a fever, chills, aches and pains, or a rash after being bit by a tick, see a doctor immediately.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lone star tick bites, red meat allergy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "\u2018Lone Star\u2019 ticks are sending many bite victims to the hospital, where they\u2019re learning they have an allergy to red meat.", "title": "A Bite From The 'Lone Star' Tick Might Turn You Into A Vegetarian", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/victims-lone-star-tick-bites-are-developing-severe-allergies-red-meat-297194", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/lone-star-tick.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u2018Lone Star\u2019 ticks are sending many bite victims to the hospital, where they\u2019re learning they have an allergy to red meat.", "title": "A Bite From The 'Lone Star' Tick Might Turn You Into A Vegetarian", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/victims-lone-star-tick-bites-are-developing-severe-allergies-red-meat-297194", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/lone-star-tick.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/lone-star-tick.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-08T12:35:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-08T12:35:52-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\u2018Lone Star\u2019 ticks are sending many bite victims to the hospital, where they\u2019re learning they have an allergy to red meat."}, "article_summary": "Doctors are diagnosing patients with a red meat allergy after being bit by the \u2018Lone Star\u2019 tick.\nThe Lone Star tick, named for Texas, may have started causing this problem over a decade ago, but was first linked to meat allergies in 2011.\nLone Star ticks are mainly found on white-tailed deer residing in southeastern and eastern United States.\nTo see exactly where the Lone Star ticks call home, view the map below.\nLyme disease is a well-known tick-borne illness, but have you ever heard of someone developing an allergic reaction to meat after a tick bite?"}
