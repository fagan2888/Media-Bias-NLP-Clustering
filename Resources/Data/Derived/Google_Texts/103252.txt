Authorities say the fire that burned down the Colonial Inn in Yankton Tuesday was set deliberately, and there is a $5,000 reward for anyone that has information that leads to an arrest.

Early Tuesday Morning, a fire was reported at the hotel on Broadway Street in Yankton. Details are limited at this time, but multiple agencies investigated the scene and determined that the fire was set intentionally.

Nearly 60 firefighters from Yankton, Lesterville and Gayville fought to put the fire out, which lead to an estimated $500,000 in damage.

"You know Yankton is a good-size community but it's still kind of got the small-town feel. So anytime something major like that happens it just gives you a little concern as far as wondering, 'What's going on?'" resident Curt Roth said.

This is the second high-profile crime this week in Yankton.



On Friday, Joshua Hudson was arrested after being suspected of killing his Uncle Todd Hudson.
