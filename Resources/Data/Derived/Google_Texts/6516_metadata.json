You probably know that too much sugar is probably not great for your health.\n\nNow, a new initiative from UC San Francisco is spelling out the health dangers in clear terms. The project is called \u201csugar science,\u201d and science there is.\n\nA team of researchers distilled 8,000 studies and research papers, and found strong evidence showing overconsumption of added sugar overloads vital organs and contributes to three major chronic illnesses: heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and liver disease.\n\nWhile there are no federal guidelines recommending a limit on sugar consumption, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends cutting our consumption way down. Right now, the average American consumes the equivalent of 19.5 teaspoons a day in added sugars. The AHA says men should cut that down to no more than 9 teaspoons and women should consume less than 6 teaspoons.\n\nUCSF Professor Laura Schmidt is lead investigator on the project. \u201cRight now, the reality is that our consumption of sugar is out of whack, and until we bring things back into balance, we need to focus on helping people understand what the consequences are to having the average American \u2026 consume too much added sugar.\u201d\n\nAs part of its outreach, Schmidt\u2019s team has created a user-friendly website and is partnering with health departments across the country to spread the word. The website includes downloadable resources, including television commercials, that public health officials can localize for their own cities.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what sugar science is all about,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cIt\u2019s about translating the information that\u2019s locked up in the medical journals and sharing it with the public in ways that are understandable.\u201d\n\nHealth departments from San Francisco to New York City have already agreed to participate in outreach. In a statement, the New York Department of Health called Sugar Science a \u201cwonderful resource\u201d and said it was \u201csomething that can be used by researchers, the public health community and those who just want thorough information.\u201d\n\nSchmidt is quick to point to the food environment as a driver in the increase of obesity that America has seen in the last generation. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Americans suddenly lost their willpower,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only major change in the diet that explains the obesity epidemic is this steep rise in added sugar consumption that started in the 1980s.\u201d\n\nThat sugar isn\u2019t just making us fat, she says, \u201cit\u2019s making us sick.\u201d\n\nSchmidt insists the team, which includes researchers from UC Davis and Emory University, is not \u201canti-sugar.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s really about knowing how much sugar is too much.\n\nBut knowing how much sugar you\u2019re eating can be challenging. Some key facts on the Sugar Science website are these:\n\nAdded sugar is hiding in 74 percent of packaged foods. (Proposed changes to the nutrition label would change this by including a separate line for added sugars.)\n\nA common type of sugar can damage your liver \u2014 just like too much alcohol.\n\nOne 12-ounce can of soda a day can increase your risk of dying of heart disease by one-third.\n\nThe site also includes tips on concrete steps that people can take to cut down on sugar. The most straightforward way to cut down on sugar is to stop drinking sugar-sweetened drinks, like sodas, sports drinks and energy drinks, the researchers say. More than one-third of added sugar in the diet comes from sugary drinks. They also recommend reading nutrition labels. While there are 61 different names for sugar on ingredients labels, the UCSF team says that \u201cif the chemical name has an \u2018ose\u2019 at the end\u2014as in dextrose, fructose, lactose \u2014- it\u2019s likely to be added sugar.\u201d\n\nSeeing Diabetes as the AIDS Crisis of This Generation\n\nDean Schillinger is also part of the Sugar Science team. He\u2019s a primary care doctor at San Francisco General Hospital. He first came to San Francisco in 1990 at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. \u201cAt that point, one out of every two patients we admitted was a young man dying of AIDS,\u201d he says. At that time, there were no treatments, little any doctor could do.\n\nToday, he says, there are good treatments, and it\u2019s rare to admit someone to the hospital dying of AIDS.\n\nInstead, Schillinger says, that same ward, Ward 5A, where young men died of AIDS is now filled with diabetes patients.\n\n\u201cI feel like we are with diabetes where we were in 1990 with the AIDS epidemic,\u201d Schillinger said. \u201cThe ward is overwhelmed with diabetes \u2013- they\u2019re getting their limbs amputated, they\u2019re on dialysis. And these are young people. They are suffering the ravages of diabetes in the prime of their life.\u201d\n\nBut unlike AIDS, where activists pushed hard for action from researchers and governments, there\u2019s little activist response for diabetes \u201cbecause it affects low-income communities disproportionately,\u201d Schillinger said. \u201cWe\u2019re at the point where we need a public health response to it.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the SugarScience launch is not a coincidence. The UC researchers waited until after the election last week voters in Berkeley and San Francisco were considering soda tax measures. Measure D in Berkeley passed with 75 percent of the vote. Schmidt says that since the university is a public institution, it could not be seen as trying to sway votes with the announcement of the new initiative.\n\nSugar Science was funded by a grant from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Sugar Science' distills more than 8,000 scientific papers on the health effects of added sugar.
