The catcher who has struggled for most of the season came up with a mighty blast onto the concourse in left field, a walk-off, two-out, two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Rockies a 7-6 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks in the battle for the National League basement.\n\nBOX SCORE: Colorado 7, Arizona 6\n\n\u201cTo show what I can do feels really good,\u201d Rosario said. \u201cThis is my first walk-off homer \u2014 that feels good too.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies moved into a tie with the Diamondbacks as both teams now stand 61-92, with three more games in the series.\n\nRosario finished 4-for-5, including his 12th home run, connecting on the first pitch from Addison Reed. Corey Dickerson led off the ninth inning with a single. Justin Morneau and Michael Cuddyer both lined out, setting up Rosario\u2019s heroics.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fought through a challenging year, but he\u2019s worked hard and he\u2019s got a great attitude,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said of Rosario. \u201cHe brings positive energy every day. He\u2019s been grinding through a tough year. It happens to just about everybody in this league. He\u2019s showing up well now.\u201d\n\nKahnle has shown promise, limiting opposing hitters to a .198 average. But he can also be erratic, and that trait reared its head in the sixth when he helped turn a 2-1 Arizona lead into a 6-1 lead. He gave up a bunt single, a walk, a single to right and another walk to Aaron Hill, forcing in a run. Weiss had seen enough and gave Kahnle the hook with the bases loaded.\n\nMatt Belisle couldn\u2019t put out the fire Kahnle started, and those three runners also scored.\n\nFlande put together an impressive five-inning audition. He gave up two runs on just two hits and walked only one.\n\nAs for the veteran outfielder/first baseman Cuddyer, it was another game that solidified his reputation. He went 3-for-5, coming up a triple short of the cycle and boosting his average to .327.\n\nCuddyer is already a proven star, but he\u2019s 35 and at the end of his three-year, $31.5 million contract with the Rockies.\n\nPHOTOS: D-backs-Rockies game Thursday at Coors Field\n\nBut, finally healthy, Cuddyer is playing well as the season winds down, showing the Rockies, or another suitor, that he\u2019s got some magic left in his bat.\n\nCuddyer\u2019s homer extended the Rockies\u2019 streak to 19 consecutive home games in which they\u2019ve hit a home run. That\u2019s the longest streak since they hit 19 at Coors from May 23 to July 3, 2002.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nLooking ahead\n\nD-backs\u2019 Chase Anderson (9-6, 3.70 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Jordan Lyles (6-3, 4.21), 6:10 p.m. Friday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nLyles, 23, figures to be a key part of the Rockies\u2019 rotation next season, so it would be nice to see him finish up the current season on a high note. He did not pitch well in his last start at St. Louis, giving up three runs on nine hits in six innings. The right-hander, proficient at getting groundball outs, has shown some promise this season. In 14 of his 20 starts, he has limited opponents to three or fewer runs and pitched five or more innings. In those 14 starts, he\u2019s 4-2 with a 2.84 ERA. Trouble arrives when he doesn\u2019t keep the ball down.\n\n\u2014 Patrick Saunders, The Denver Post\n\nSaturday: D-backs\u2019 Trevor Cahill (3-11, 5.38 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Eddie Butler (0-1, 10.13), 2:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nSunday: D-backs\u2019 Wade Miley (8-11, 4.17) at Rockies\u2019 Christian Bergman (2-4, 5.56), 2:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nMonday: Rockies\u2019 Tyler Matzek (6-10, 4.19) at Padres\u2019 Eric Stults (7-17, 4.59), 8:10 p.m., ROOT", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies win as Rosario beats D-backs with two-out walk-off home run", "title": "Rockies win as Rosario beats D-backs with two-out walk-off home run", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/18/rockies-win-as-rosario-beats-d-backs-with-two-out-walk-off-home-run/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140918__DbacksRockies091814mcp1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140918__DbacksRockies091814mcp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-18T21:44:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:53:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe296f\"", "article_summary": "BOX SCORE: Colorado 7, Arizona 6\u201cTo show what I can do feels really good,\u201d Rosario said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fought through a challenging year, but he\u2019s worked hard and he\u2019s got a great attitude,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said of Rosario.\nCuddyer\u2019s homer extended the Rockies\u2019 streak to 19 consecutive home games in which they\u2019ve hit a home run.\nRosario finished 4-for-5, including his 12th home run, connecting on the first pitch from Addison Reed.\nFor players on struggling teams \u2014 Exhibit A, the 2014 Rockies \u2014 September performances can leave impressions that last until spring training."}
