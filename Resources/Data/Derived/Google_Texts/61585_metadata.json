This year HHS has published a blog post offering advice for defending Obamacare over the July 4th holiday. It\u2019s titled, \u201cTips for Talking to Your Family about the Affordable Care Act this Fourth of July.\u201d\n\nThis Fourth of July, families across the nation will gather around hot dogs (or their favorite vegetarian alternative) and potato salad to spend some quality time together, watch fireworks and reflect on the holiday\u2019s meaning. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nSo far, so good. But if you guessed that there\u2019s a \u2018but\u2019 coming, you\u2019re correct.\n\nBut as much as we love our families \u2013 and we do, seriously \u2013we don\u2019t always agree when it comes to current events, like last week\u2019s Supreme Court decision upholding tax credits that help make insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) more affordable for millions of people.\n\nThis is like those times in college when you\u2019d call home just to chat and then mention, in passing, that you needed money. Surprise, HHS doesn\u2019t really care about your vegetarian broccoli burgers.\n\nMisinformation about the ACA is everywhere, and there\u2019s been a lot of money spent to spread that misinformation \u2013 as much as half a billion dollars in ads, according to one 2014 estimate.\n\nYes, misinformation is everywhere. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. People will save $2,500 a year off their premiums. The Cadillac tax. Yes, there was lots of misinformation out there. As for the ads criticizing Obamacare, that figure is accurate but omits the fact that $700 billion was spent by state and federal governments to promote the law.\n\nNot surprisingly, many Americans still don\u2019t know how changes the law made to insurance and the health care system can help improve their lives. You should be prepared when Aunt Janine says something like, \u201cObamacare hasn\u2019t helped anyone!\u201d So here are a few points to remember during this long holiday weekend:\n\nNow we\u2019ve gone from the sphere of public holidays to the sphere of public events to the sphere of private family discussions. There should have been a stop sign or, better yet, a do not enter sign there. This is a line Obama\u2019s permanent campaign has crossed before, but this isn\u2019t coming from Organizing for Action; this is coming from HHS.\n\nSituation: Uncle Ted claims Obamacare is a train wreck and has cost jobs. You say: Uncle Ted, you\u2019ve gotten ahold of some old talking points. With greater access to affordable, quality health insurance, the Affordable Care Act is helping individuals and strengthening our economy!\n\nThink about the phrase \u201cyou say\u201d for a moment. The Obama administration is not only telling you to upbraid your uncle Ted, they assume you\u2019re too dumb to do it on your own. They need to give you the words to say. This is a script for insecure zealots who need their lines spoon-fed to them.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for the federal government, in a blog post or any other forum, to offer talking points for use at private family gatherings. That strikes me as the sort of thing a totalitarian state might do. It\u2019s Orwellian and, frankly, un-American in concept.\n\nOf course arguing about politics is one of the things families do when they gather. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but the federal government should not be attempting to directly intrude on those conversations with partisan advice for defending the current government\u2019s policies.\n\nImagine the reaction to President Bush\u2019s DOD publishing a blog post titled \u201cTips for Talking to Your Family about the Iraq War this Fourth of July.\u201d The fact that the major media all but ignored the HHS post shows how accustomed we\u2019ve become to being community organized by this hyper-partisan White House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HHS Offers Obamacare Talking Points for Your July 4th BBQ", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "HHS Offers Obamacare Talking Points for Your July 4th BBQ", "title": "HHS Offers Obamacare Talking Points for Your July 4th BBQ - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Fourth-of-July-food-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/03/hhs-offers-obamacare-talking-points-for-your-july-4th-bbq/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "HHS Offers Obamacare Talking Points for Your July 4th BBQ", "creator": "@verumserum", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Fourth-of-July-food-Getty.jpg", "title": "HHS Offers Obamacare Talking Points for Your July 4th BBQ - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "4th of July, HHS, obamacare,Big Government,Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-07-03T16:55:01-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcff1\"", "article_summary": "With greater access to affordable, quality health insurance, the Affordable Care Act is helping individuals and strengthening our economy!\nYou say: Uncle Ted, you\u2019ve gotten ahold of some old talking points.\nThis year HHS has published a blog post offering advice for defending Obamacare over the July 4th holiday.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROne of the most disturbing innovations of the Obama era is partisan talking points issued by the government for use at family gatherings.\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for the federal government, in a blog post or any other forum, to offer talking points for use at private family gatherings."}
