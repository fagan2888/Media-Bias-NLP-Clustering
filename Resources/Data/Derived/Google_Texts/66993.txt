Washington may be hot for "Homeland," but actor Mandy Patinkin, who plays Saul Berenson on the show, doesn't think any real inside-the-beltway types should grace the Showtime series.

"I don't want to mix it up like that," Patinkin told reporters Monday night during the show's season three premiere in Washington, D.C.

"I'm also not a fan of real news people ... showing up in films, either," he added. (He said this, coincidentally, as pundit-producer-actor hybrid Lawrence O'Donnell was arriving at the event.)

"I think we should do what we do," Patinkin continued. "We're the reflections of what they're doing."

That being said, Monday's party at the Corcoran Gallery of Art was a blur of fictional Washington mixed with the real one. Stars Claire Danes and Damian Lewis; Morena Baccarin, who plays Jessica Brody; Morgan Saylor and Jackson Pace, who play the kids Dana and Chris Brody, respectively, powwowed with Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., ABC's Martha Raddatz, Fox News Channel's Bret Baier, the New York Times' Maureen Dowd, half of CNN's new "Crossfire" team S.E. Cupp and Van Jones and many, many more.

"They don't need to be in make believe," Patinkin said of lawmakers. "They have a full plate in the real world and they don't have time to go be in a TV show in my opinion right now, there's too much happening."
