The products, according to the agency also exceed by 3 grams the maximum amount of total fat per 40 grams to be considered \u201clow fat\u201d products.\n\nFDA said the bars are misbranded under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act \u201cbecause the labels include the nutrient content claim \u201cGood Source of Fiber\u201d without including the required statement disclosing that the food is not low in total fat in immediate proximity to the claim.\u201d\n\nSince it is Kind LLC\u2019s responsibility to ensure its products comply with the federal regulations, FDA said failure to correct the violations could result in regulatory action without further notice. The company has 15 days to respond to the agency\u2019s claims.\n\nKind however, is standing behind its \u201chealthy\u201d snack food claims.\n\nIn a statement, company spokesman Joe Cohen said a key ingredient in Kind products are nuts, which contain nutritious fats that exceed the amount allowed under the FDA standard.\n\n\u201cThere is an overwhelming body of scientific evidence supporting that nuts are wholesome and nutritious,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is similar to other foods that do not meet the standard for use of the term healthy, but are generally considered to be good for you like avocados, salmon and eggs.\u201d\n\nCohen said the company is fully committed to working with FDA and is moving quickly to comply with its request.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The company's products exeed saturated fat and calorie limits, the FDA says.", "description": "The company's products exeed saturated fat and calorie limits, the FDA says.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The company's products exeed saturated fat and calorie limits, the FDA says.", "title": "FDA tells KINDSnacks to remove 'healthy' from label", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/238927-fda-tells-kind-healthy-snacks-to-remove-healthy-from-label", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/kindsnacks.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/238927-fda-tells-kind-healthy-snacks-to-remove-healthy-from-label", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-15T13:09-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-15T13:09:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "keywords": "Food and drink, Nutrition, Health, KIND Healthy Snacks, Saturated fat, Dietary fiber, Food and Drug Administration, Almond,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/238927-fda-tells-kind-healthy-snacks-to-remove-healthy-from-label", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The company's products exeed saturated fat and calorie limits, the FDA says.", "card": "summary", "title": "FDA tells KINDSnacks to remove 'healthy' from label"}, "dcterms.title": "FDA tells KINDSnacks to remove 'healthy' from label"}, "article_summary": "The Food and Drug Administration is ordering KINDSnacks to stop claiming that their fruit and nut bars are \"healthy.\"\nThe products, according to the agency also exceed by 3 grams the maximum amount of total fat per 40 grams to be considered \u201clow fat\u201d products.\nIn a statement, company spokesman Joe Cohen said a key ingredient in Kind products are nuts, which contain nutritious fats that exceed the amount allowed under the FDA standard.\nKind however, is standing behind its \u201chealthy\u201d snack food claims.\n\u201cThere is an overwhelming body of scientific evidence supporting that nuts are wholesome and nutritious,\u201d he said."}
