The biggest of those cartels, the Sinaloa, supplies heroin directly to New York, which then distributes it to other areas.\n\nMaine Drug Enforcement Agency Director Roy McKinney said Maine, along with other northern New England states, is being targeted by urban dealers for obvious reasons: A dealer can sell a gram of heroin in Maine for as much as three times what it would bring in New York.\n\n\u201cThere was a time in Maine where you would see heroin smuggled in that was packaged for sale,\u201d McKinney said. \u201cThat day is no longer. Now we see bulk heroin, and it\u2019s being milled and packaged here. There\u2019s simply more money to be made than in the saturated Greater New York market, and the dealers know that.\u201d\n\nMcKinney said that last year, 17 percent of all drug traffickers his agents arrested were not Maine residents.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that Maine dealers would leave the state to get their supply and bring it back,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, these larger (drug) organizations are coming here or having people come here.\u201d\n\nA GAME OF NUMBERS\n\nA massive drug sweep in January that resulted in the arrest of two dozen people in the Lewiston area provided a glimpse of that phenomenon.\n\nThe investigation established, for the first time, a concrete link between Maine and the gang-controlled drug operations in the New York City borough of Queens.\n\nAt least two of the people arrested in January after a months-long investigation have direct ties to the powerful Crips street gang in Far Rockaway, a rough neighborhood in Queens.\n\nIn that case, Jamel Hamilton, who goes by the nickname \u201cMurder,\u201d has been charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin. Hamilton, who was identified by police as a gang leader, was arrested nine years ago in a similar drug sweep in Far Rockaway.\n\nAnother man, Christian Dent, who was arrested in January in Maine, was part of the same previous drug sweep. He was identified as one of Hamilton\u2019s top lieutenants.\n\nMaine\u2019s drug supply has long been linked to Massachusetts, but the direct New York connection is also cause for concern.\n\nNationally, the heroin supply is as large as it\u2019s ever been.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2013, the amount of heroin seized at the U.S.-Mexico border jumped from 560 kilograms to about 2,100 kilograms, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nBut it\u2019s a game of numbers. Even as more heroin is being seized, more is also getting through.\n\nMcKinney said the same holds true at the local level. He said his agents are doing what they can to attack the supply but they aren\u2019t getting everything off the street.\n\n\u201cDrug cases are very personnel-intensive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s more sophisticated. The higher-level dealers are doing everything they can to insulate themselves from criminal conduct. We want to disrupt or dismantle these operations at all levels.\u201d\n\nSMALL TOWN, HUGE PROBLEM\n\nThe drug trade is filtering down to more rural areas as well.\n\nOld Orchard Beach Police Chief Dana Kelley said heroin has become a huge problem in his community.\n\nKelley said Old Orchard Beach, a tourist destination, is attractive to out-of-state dealers because it has many motels that offers cheap rates in the off-season. He also thinks dealers believe smaller towns don\u2019t have the resources to thoroughly investigate trafficking \u2013 and that is often true.\n\nMore and more, police departments in Maine are focusing on eliminating drug trafficking, and right now that means heroin. In February, Maine joined a task force of East Coast states to investigate heroin trafficking, including across state lines.\n\nThe task force members will share information, including the identities of traffickers, stash houses and phone numbers gathered from wiretaps, informants and cooperating witnesses.\n\nUntil now, the drug activity has mostly operated under the radar of law enforcement.\n\nThat could change as heroin-related overdose deaths continue to rise precipitously.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019re any further ahead than we used to be, but we\u2019re out there fighting it,\u201d Kelley said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The crackdown on OxyContin boosted the demand for heroin, sending prices to levels big-city suppliers can't pass up.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The crackdown on OxyContin boosted the demand for heroin, sending prices to levels big-city suppliers can't pass up.", "title": "How Maine became a haven for heroin - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "updated_time": "2015-04-25T21:28:56-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/04/26/how-maine-became-a-haven-for-heroin/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The crackdown on OxyContin boosted the demand for heroin, sending prices to levels big-city suppliers can't pass up.", "title": "How Maine became a haven for heroin - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "News", "published_time": "2015-04-26T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-25T21:28:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea0a\"", "article_summary": "In February, Maine joined a task force of East Coast states to investigate heroin trafficking, including across state lines.\n\u201cIt used to be that Maine dealers would leave the state to get their supply and bring it back,\u201d he said.\nFor drug traffickers, even those who operate at the highest level in sophisticated, gang-controlled markets like New York City, Maine is fertile ground.\nAnother man, Christian Dent, who was arrested in January in Maine, was part of the same previous drug sweep.\nMore and more, police departments in Maine are focusing on eliminating drug trafficking, and right now that means heroin."}
