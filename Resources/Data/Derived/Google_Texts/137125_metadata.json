Rick Perry is asking whether people would prefer an experienced captain \u2014 or an exciting lecturer \u2014 to fly them across the Atlantic Ocean in bad weather.\n\n\u201cI tell people \u2014 like gettin\u2019 on an airplane, and you\u2019re flyin\u2019 from New York City to London and there\u2019s some pretty severe weather,\u201d Mr. Perry told Bloomberg Politics. \u201cDo you want a grizzled, 20,000-hour-old captain in the left seat of that airplane that\u2019s done this thousands of times, and also been out there and done this, or do you want a really bright, capable, exciting lecturer that will have you on the edge of your seat in a classroom talkin\u2019 about aerodynamics and how an airplane flies and how all this works?\u201d\n\nMr. Perry, a potential GOP presidential contender, said the next election cycle is going to take place \u201cafter this period of time of a young, inexperienced United States senator in the form of Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nAnother first-term senator \u2014 Ted Cruz of Texas \u2014 formally entered the 2016 GOP presidential race this week. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida, both elected in 2010, are also weighing White House bids.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, speaking on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Wednesday, said he\u2019d like to see the party\u2019s nominee be a \u201cconservative reform governor\u201d and that he\u2019d make a decision on a presidential run after the state\u2019s legislative session, which is scheduled to wrap up in June.\n\n\u201cWe need a president who wants to do something, not just be somebody,\u201d Mr. Jindal said. \u201cAnd so, we put a lot of thought into what the next president should do. I\u2019m surprised others aren\u2019t doing that.\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz, for his part, has pushed back on the experience question, saying on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d that Mr. Obama was \u201cbasically a back-bencher\u201d during his time in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIn my time in the Senate, there are a lot of faults I have, but nobody would accuse me of being a back-bencher,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve tried to do is lead on the great challenges of the day, whether it\u2019s stopping Obamacare or stopping the out-of-control debt or stopping executive amnesty or defending our constitutional rights or standing with Israel or stopping Iran from getting nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nHe also said that unlike Mr. Obama, he wasn\u2019t a \u201ccommunity organizer\u201d before his time in the U.S. Senate, citing his tenure as solicitor general of Texas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Making a pitch for his own executive experience ahead of 2016, former Texas Gov.
