Anthony List, identified the different Planned Parenthood locations and community health care clinics across America.\n\nThe two groups argue there are plenty of health centers \u2014 that also can receive federal funding \u2014 to absorb Planned Parenthood\u2019s patients should the organization be defunded by Congress.\n\n\u201cWhat these graphics put into pictures is what the data has been telling us for a long time,\u201d Casey Mattox, a senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom who focuses on pro-life issues, told The Daily Signal. \u201cPlanned Parenthood is really a small part of the national health care picture in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood is really a small part of the national health care picture in America,\u201d @CaseyMattoxADF.\n\nAccording to data collected by the two groups, there are currently 13,540 clinics providing comprehensive health care for women, versus 665 Planned Parenthood locations.\n\nCommunity health centers primarily exist to provide comprehensive care to millions of uninsured, working poor and jobless Americans.\n\nIf Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal funding \u201cwent away tomorrow,\u201d Mattox argues, the money \u201cwould be better used by community health centers and other places around the country that can provide a fuller range of services to women without the ethical challenges that Planned Parenthood presents.\u201d\n\nThe effort to defund Planned Parenthood comes after the Center for Medical Progress, a group that opposes abortion, released a series of damaging videos.\n\nThe videos show high-ranking Planned Parenthood employees discussing the sale of tissue from aborted babies and changing abortion procedures to harvest these organs.\n\nThe issues raise a host of legal questions and have sparked both state and federal investigations.\n\nSome healthcare experts warn that lawmakers should be careful in punishing Planned Parenthood. These supporters argue community health clinics can\u2019t fulfill the services that Planned Parenthood provides.\n\n\u201cThe notion that you could literally overnight defund providers serving a couple million people and think that health centers\u2014even if they\u2019re right nearby, which is not always the case\u2014could just magically absorb patients, I think shows an astounding naivety in healthcare,\u201d says Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University.\n\n\u201cYou can map all you want and the fact of the matter is health centers are not magicians and health care doesn\u2019t work this way.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he fact of the matter is health centers are not magicians and health care doesn\u2019t work this way,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum.\n\nRosenbaum, in an interview with The Daily Signal, argued that banning Planned Parenthood funding would create an immediate health care access crisis for millions of women.\n\nTexas, she says, is the \u201csmoking gun\u201d in the debate.\n\nIn 2012, Texas stopped funding abortion-providers like Planned Parenthood. Instead, in 2013 it created the Women\u2019s Health Program, which provides low-income women with family planning services, health screenings and birth control.\n\nAccording to a study by George Washington University, this resulted in community clinics increasing their women\u2019s health care services by an average of 81 percent.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2013, after Planned Parenthood was excluded, the study found that the program experienced a nine percent decrease in enrollees, a 26 percent decrease in Medicaid claims and a 54 percent decline in contraceptive claims.\n\nEventually, community health care clinics replaced Planned Parenthood\u2019s services, Rosenbaum said, but not without consequences.\n\n\u201cYes, health centers eventually ramped up. Yes, they offer more family planning services than they did before because they had to respond to a crisis and health centers are remarkable at responding to crises. But the state\u2019s own data show that the actual number of patients served dropped.\u201d She added:\n\nWe\u2019re talking family planning, cancer screenings, things like that. You certainly do not want people who are seeking family planning to have to put it off at all. Otherwise, you wind up with unplanned pregnancies, half of which will turn into an abortion. This is exactly what we don\u2019t want so why would you shut down a point of access for contraceptives? And why would you shut down cancer screen sites? It makes no sense.\n\nMattox, with Alliance Defending Freedom, argues the Texas example paints an entirely different picture\u2014one that actually appears to be a success story.\n\nAccording to state data, in 2012, the pregnancy rate in Texas remained relatively the same, falling from 82.2 pregnancies per 1,000 women ages 15-44, to 81.1 in 2013.\n\nAbortions dropped during the same period, from 65,547 in 2012 compared to 61,513 in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe data bellies the claim that Planned Parenthood was necessary to women\u2019s health care in Texas,\u201d Mattox said.\n\nIn 2013, right after Texas ousted the organization, Planned Parenthood clinics in the state agreed to pay $4.3 million to settle a federal civil suit brought by the Justice Department under President Obama.\n\nThe suit claimed the organization fraudulently billed Medicaid for women\u2019s health care services such as birth control from 2003 to 2009.\n\nThe massive drop in Medicaid and contraceptive claims, Mattox said, \u201cmay be evidence that Texas cleaned up a lot of false claims.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Mattox argued the drop in program enrollees could be attributed to a bump in the economy\u2014with more people enrolling on employer-provided health care plans\u2014and the creation of the Affordable Care Act, which \u201ccompelled free coverage of contraceptives.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems some of our friends on the left conveniently forget that they created Obamacare and compelled free coverage of contraceptives when that is inconvenient to defending the need for Planned Parenthood,\u201d he said.\n\nTaking in these broader factors, Mattox argued the Texas example \u201cmight actually be good news\u201d and further proof that taking away Planned Parenthood won\u2019t hurt women.\n\nIt seems like there may be other factors that explain what happened to women during this time period in Texas. That might actually be good news\u2014we may have solved problems rather than found new ones.\n\nIf Congress defunds Planned Parenthood, the country will have to wait and see if the Texas model will be tested on the national level.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article originally appeared at the Daily Signal, and is reprinted here with permission.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With over 13,000 comprehensive health centers in the U.S., would stripping Planned Parenthood of its $500M annual taxpayer dollars hurt women\u2019s health care?", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "With over 13,000 comprehensive health centers in the U.S., would stripping Planned Parenthood of its $500M annual taxpayer dollars hurt women\u2019s health care?", "title": "If Planned Parenthood loses funding, here's a map of health clinics that could take its place | Live Action News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1250, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/healthclinics_ADF_1250-1250x650-1.jpg", "height": 650}, "updated_time": "2015-08-17T15:35:49-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/if-planned-parenthood-loses-funding-heres-a-map-of-health-clinics-that-could-take-its-place/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With over 13,000 comprehensive health centers in the U.S., would stripping Planned Parenthood of its $500M annual taxpayer dollars hurt women\u2019s health care?", "creator": "@liveactionnews", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/healthclinics_ADF_1250-1250x650-1.jpg", "title": "If Planned Parenthood loses funding, here's a map of health clinics that could take its place | Live Action News", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "section": "Analysis", "tag": "Women's Health Program", "published_time": "2015-08-17T15:18:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-17T15:35:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25c4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou can map all you want and the fact of the matter is health centers are not magicians and health care doesn\u2019t work this way.\u201d\u201c[T]he fact of the matter is health centers are not magicians and health care doesn\u2019t work this way,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum.\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood is really a small part of the national health care picture in America.\u201d\u201cPlanned Parenthood is really a small part of the national health care picture in America,\u201d @CaseyMattoxADF.\nAccording to data collected by the two groups, there are currently 13,540 clinics providing comprehensive health care for women, versus 665 Planned Parenthood locations.\n\u201cThe data bellies the claim that Planned Parenthood was necessary to women\u2019s health care in Texas,\u201d Mattox said.\nThese supporters argue community health clinics can\u2019t fulfill the services that Planned Parenthood provides."}
