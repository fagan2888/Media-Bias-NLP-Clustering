In today’s edition of “No Sh*t, Sherlock!” we have the results of a poll provided to TPM on Tuesday. The poll, conducted by Public Policy Polling — a “Democratic-leaning” organization — determined that those who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 like the Duggars a whole lot more than President Barack Obama. So, yeah.

Specifically, 67 percent of Romney voters polled said they preferred the 19 Kids and Counting family to the then-incumbent President of the United States of America.

Only 12 percent of those who answered admitted to liking Barack HUSSEIN Obama II more than the popular cultural offering from The Learning Channel TLC. Because #Mericuh.

On the flip side, 87 percent of voters who casts their ballots for Obama’s 2012 ticket preferred the president to the Duggars. Amazingly, 5 percent of this group claimed to have a better opinion of the Jim Bob and Michelle-led Christian clan than the president. Mind you, this isn’t “amazing” because it’s so low — but because there’s even a recognizable result.

According to TPM, the poll took place from June 11-14, and its results contain a 2.9 percent margin of error.
