But many millennials are over being called millennials, tired, they say, of the stereotypes and baggage many associate with their generation.\n\nYou know: Self-entitled. Self absorbed. Ski hats in summer. A selfie, and then another, to share with their 1,000 closest friends on Facebook.\n\n\u201cPeople are sick of being categorized,\u201d says Donna Khalife, a young Washington, D.C., entrepreneur. \u201cYou\u2019ll find millennials who don\u2019t even want to be called millennials.\u201d\n\nRelated: Tech Upstart Uber Aims to Ride High in 2014\n\nA name change, or a rebranding anyway, was a hot topic of conversation as millennials gathered in the nation\u2019s capital for Millennial Week to share ideas, lively conversation and, yes, focus on themselves.\n\nRecent findings by the Pew Research Center paint a broader economic picture of this demographic. Their study shows that young people ranging in age from 18 to 33 are largely unattached to organized religion and politics, deeply connected through social media, facing record amount of student debt, distrustful of people - and yet, they are remarkably upbeat about their economic future.\n\nMore than 80 percent say they either currently \u201chave enough money to lead their lives\u201d (32 percent) or \u201cexpect to in the future\u201d (53 percent). At the same time, more than half of millennials doubt there will be any money for them in the Social Security system by the time they retire.\n\nDan Mindus, fresh from millennial central casting - grey T-shirt, blue jeans and a scruffy beard - completes the picture with his Harvard Business School background. At Wednesday night\u2019s Entrepreneur\u2019s Forum, held at WeWork, a Wonder Bread factory turned dynamic workspace for start-ups and small businesses, Mindus and others made the case that millennials are best suited to spark new economic growth with enterprising new start ups because they don\u2019t fear risk and failure as much as their parents or grandparents.\n\nRelated: Jobs Report Confirms Economy Is on the Mend\n\nMindus is the founder of NextGen Angels, a company comprised of young entrepreneurs that invites angels under the age of 40 to invest in startups. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly hard to start a company,\u201d he told The Fiscal Times. \u201cYes, young people have the passion and the energy. But sometimes it\u2019s better if you just jump off a cliff without even knowing what you\u2019re getting in to.\u201d\n\nMichael Lastoria is a repeat cliff jumper \u2013 a \u201cserial entrepreneur,\u201d says Mindus. Lastoria\u2019s latest venture, \u201c&pizza,\u201d described as a disruptive fast-casual pizza concept, is quickly expanding. \u201cBut nothing ever happens in the time frame you think it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he says. \u201cWith entitlement comes this idea that things will happen over night.\u201d\n\nBorn in 1980, Lastoria is technically a millennial, but he remembers the days before Facebook and Twitter - even before Blackberry. \u201cSilicon Valley has screwed up people\u2019s minds on what life is like.\u201d His advice: \u201cBank on how you wake up every day and prepare yourself for the unknown.\u201d\n\nDonna and Rosy Khalife live by those words. They are sisters and co-founders of SurpriseRide.com, a D.C.-based service that designs activity boxes and fosters a lifelong love of learning.\n\nRelated: This Is the Best Investing Advice You\u2019ll Get All Year\n\nIt\u2019s the ability to adapt to the unknown that Rosy Khalife, the younger of the two sisters, says is both the challenge and gift of entrepreneurship. \u201cThe hardest thing,\u201d she says, \u201cis not really knowing. Every day is uncertain. One day, you plan that all day you\u2019ll be working on marketing, one specific thing for your business. And then, you wake up that morning and you have some other problem that you need to solve. So you become the lawyer of the team, or the accountant. You are kind of like Jello, fitting into whatever the mold is for that day,\u201d she says. \u201cWhatever happens, you just need to make it work. It\u2019s the uncertainty that makes our job so challenging.\u201d\n\nThe Khalife sisters are in a special niche. Many millennials are out of work or struggling to get their ideas funded. Donna Khalife recalls the stress of getting ready to pitch their business on ABC\u2019s hit series, Shark Tank.\n\nBut might \u2018entrepreneur\u2019 just be a fancy code word for unemployed, an excuse to hang around cool retrofitted spaces like WeWork? Donna says most young entrepreneurs start companies because they are disenchanted with their jobs, not because they can\u2019t get jobs. She\u2019s right about the disenchantment part. An ongoing Gallup study of the American workplace from 2010 through 2012 found that 70 percent of Americans with full-time jobs either hated their work or simply \u201cchecked out.\u201d\n\nBoth Khalife sisters rejected job offers before starting their company. \u201cI think [entrepreneurship] comes from a search for meaning. People want something that gives them purpose,\u201d says Donna Khalife.\n\nRelated: The No-Fear Guide to Financial Planning in 2014\n\nAs Mindus sees it, there\u2019s something special about that search for purpose in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cIn D.C., we have a real asset in the intellectual energy that has long been here. Because the federal government exists here, you have intelligent, creative, well-educated people who are striving,\u201d he says. \u201cBut more and more of them are realizing that the way to have a significant impact in the world is by creating a high-growth company. It is not just though non-profits or government service.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the traditional way of doing things is fading. So too is the idea that all millennials want and do the same things. \u201cPeople are searching for that grey area,\u201d says Donna. \u201cPeople are searching to carve out their own path.\u201d\n\nThe Khalife sisters\u2019 business cards perhaps state the millennial message best: \u201cThe world in a box.
