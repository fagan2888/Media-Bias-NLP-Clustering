Aaron Paul has been to some impressive parties, but one sticks out particularly for the "Breaking Bad" star. And that was the time he did a shot with Michael Jackson. Of course it is.

"It was the Prince of Brunei's 25th birthday party. Six years ago, outside of London," he tells Details magazine. "I was going back up to my room, and this guy grabs me and says, 'Hey, Prince Azim wants to see you in the library,'" Paul says. "So I go down there, and he's sitting on the couch with Michael Jackson, and me and Michael Jackson end up having this hourlong heart-to-heart about family and upbringings, and I remember, he just put his arm around my shoulder and said, 'You know, if you've had a rough childhood or not, it's all about forgiveness. Once you realize that, it's fine. Everything's fine.' And I'm like, 'Michael, you are absolutely right. Do you want to do a shot?' And he goes, 'Sure!'"
