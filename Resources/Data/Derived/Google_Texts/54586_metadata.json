John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion shattered enrollment projections in its first year, and reliance on the welfare program keeps growing.\n\nThere were 634,526 Ohioans enrolled in the Obamacare expansion in September \u2014 an increase of more than 140,000 since January \u2014 according to the Ohio Department of Medicaid.\n\nFor the 21 months Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion has been in effect, the program has grown much faster than Ohio\u2019s economy.\n\nMost of the Ohioans on Medicaid under the expansion are working-age adults without children or disabilities. Before Obamacare, Medicaid was restricted to children, the elderly, the disabled, pregnant women and impoverished families.\n\nPitching Obamacare expansion to the Ohio General Assembly in 2013, the Kasich administration estimated 447,000 would enroll by fiscal year 2020. Actual enrollment exceeded 620,000 by the time fiscal year 2015 ended in June.\n\nKasich implemented Obamacare expansion after vetoing a legislative ban on the policy, despite publication of a National Bureau of Economic Research study finding Tennessee\u2019s employment increased when the state removed working-age adults from Medicaid.\n\nThe Foundation for Government Accountability and other free-market groups warned against extending Medicaid benefits \u2014 which come with no work requirements \u2014 to every Ohioan whose income is at or below 138 percent of the poverty line.\n\nFGA expects budget-busting enrollment in Ohio and elsewhere will deter more states from chasing Obamacare expansion funding.\n\n\u201cMore able-bodied adults have signed up for Gov. Kasich\u2019s unilateral ObamaCare expansion than the administration thought would ever sign up,\u201d FGA research director Jonathan Ingram said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cThat is costing taxpayers billions more than expected, but the problem goes beyond that,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cKasich\u2019s expansion will also have a lasting, negative impact on the state\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Ohio\u2019s Obamacare expansion has cost taxpayers $5 billion\n\nOhio\u2019s employment and labor force, Ingram added, \u201cmay worsen over the coming years, as Medicaid discourages work and, ultimately, shrinks the economy. Research suggests that in Ohio, as many as 93,000 able-bodied adults could drop out of the labor force as a result of Kasich\u2019s expansion.\u201d\n\nIn May testimony before the Ohio Senate, the Kasich administration reported only 43 percent of Ohio\u2019s Obamacare expansion enrollees have jobs. The governor\u2019s office did not respond to Ohio Watchdog questions about enrollment.\n\nKasich staffers weren\u2019t the only Obamacare advocates to undershoot the target with their projections for Medicaid expansion enrollment.\n\nOhio\u2019s pro-Obamacare newspapers widely disseminated a 2013 Health Policy Institute of Ohio study including enrollment estimates from Ohio State University researchers and the left-leaning Urban Institute.\n\nUI projected 380,313 Ohioans would enroll in Obamacare expansion by fiscal year 2015. OSU researchers\u2019 fiscal year 2015 estimate of 550,050 was low compared to actual June enrollment, but high relative to the monthly average for the full year.\n\nOSU\u2019s initial estimate of 609,264 enrollees in fiscal year 2016 is already falling short \u2014 but not as short as UI\u2019s 2016 estimate of 497,799.\n\nHPIO published revised enrollment projections last year, and communications manager Nick Wiselogel told Ohio Watchdog the organization will likely review enrollment trends over the coming months.\n\nBecause of backdated eligibility for Ohioans whose health care Medicaid will cover even though they haven\u2019t enrolled in the program yet, September\u2019s enrollment is likely to climb in future Ohio Department of Medicaid caseload reports.\n\nIn May, ODM reported there were 509,771 Obamacare expansion enrollees the preceding month. By the time the September caseload report was released, backdated eligibility had increased April enrollment to 606,524.\n\nComparing the numbers initially reported for each month, Obamacare expansion enrollment has grown by at least 10,000 per month since April \u2014 when the state was in the process of settling a lawsuit over ODM\u2019s old method for dropping ineligible enrollees.\n\nAs a result of the lawsuit, ODM now uses a \u201cpassive redetermination\u201d process, checking tax records and other government databases once a year to confirm Medicaid enrollees still qualify for benefits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
