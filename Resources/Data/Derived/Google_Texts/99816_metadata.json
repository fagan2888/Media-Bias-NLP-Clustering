Big brother is watching your waist\n\nData mining is digging into your health.\n\nActuaries predict your life span. Banks track your spending habits. Now, your employer can tell whether you\u2019ll have diabetes a year from now.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd the federal government is encouraging businesses to use that information to tell you how to eat and exercise, to \u201cdata mine\u201d for your own good and the employer\u2019s bottom line.\n\nMedical records, social media, credit card records and new activity tracking gadgets like Fitbits are being used to assess your riskiness to yourself and to the cost-conscious health care system.\n\n( Sign up for POLITICO\u2019s Morning Tech tip sheet)\n\nAetna is among the companies paving the way. It\u2019s using data analytics and interventions on its own 50,000 employees \u2014 and about 40 of the companies it insures are using them, too.\n\nThe data explosion \u2014 some would say intrusion \u2014 is being fueled by trends in the private sector and by federal policies, including elements of Obamacare.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act gives companies incentives to provide \u201cwellness programs\u201d like prevention screenings or help to quit smoking. And workers can get rewards if they participate, such as discounts on insurance premiums or gym memberships.\n\nThe 2009 HITECH Act gives cash to doctors who switch from paper to electronic records \u2014 which create a home for the health data.\n\nThe health law also banned insurers from excluding people who were sick or likely to become so \u2014 those with pre-existing conditions. One cost of admitting \u201chigh risk\u201d patients to the health insurance pool, it seems, is more snooping into their lives \u2014 and ours.\n\n\u201cHealth care,\u201d says Kulleni Gebreyes, director of the Health Industries Advisory group at PwC, \u201cis doing credit scoring now.\u201d But instead of scoring your credit, health data firms are actually scoring you.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)\n\nUsed together, the electronic medical records and wellness promotion enable companies to find their sickest, most expensive employees, and push and cajole them into healthier lifestyles.\n\nThe wider use of health care data analytics raises many questions. Does it work? Is the intrusion ethical? Where\u2019s the line between encouragement and coercion?\n\nOne hospital employee, who wished to be identified only as Martin, said his employer initially offered a break on health insurance costs in exchange for information about his weight and whether he smokes.\n\nThen the demands grew.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s not enough. They want us to use a Fitbit that monitors how many steps we take each day, how many fruit and vegetables I eat. It\u2019s all too much. It\u2019s none of my employer\u2019s business,\u201d he said.\n\nBut they are increasingly making it their business, with the help of data algorithms.\n\nStanford University researchers this month published an algorithm that allows them to predict a diagnosis of clinical depression up to a year in advance, based on information from a patient\u2019s electronic health record.\n\nIn another study this month, scientists used claims data and electronic health records to predict which of the 37,000 employees at an Aetna-insured multinational corporation would develop diabetes-related problems within a year. They were nearly always right.\n\nIBM teamed up with a Virginia health system, doing the analytics to help identify patients at risk of heart failure.\n\nParts of the ACA financially reward clinicians for health outcomes, instead of just paying for individual procedures, part of the gradual broader shift away from fee-for-service medicine. These new incentives make it valuable for everyone in the system \u2014 insurers, employers, hospitals and doctors \u2014 to know who to target for preventive care interventions.\n\nSo health plans, insurers and businesses employ data crunchers, like Inovalon, that amass vast amounts of information that can be used to predict which patients are likely to run up big medical bills.\n\nInsurers like Aetna or Cigna have long used health claims to predict illness mortality. But now they can plug in information from electronic health records, which are spreading through hospitals and physician practices across the country, sped by $24 billion in government payments.\n\n\u201cThe adoption of electronic health records has increased the amount of information available to employers and providers and health plans,\u201d says PwC\u2019s Gebreyes. \u201cYou can mine the data to get the answers and make correlations you couldn\u2019t make before. And with the correlations, you address the root causes.\u201d\n\nAn emerging trend is to add \u201cbehavioral\u201d data \u2014 what the patient does outside the doctor\u2019s office. Some companies provide employees with mobile devices such as Fitbits, which enable people to measure how much they are walking and eating, and other health-related facts. Feeding all that data into the electronic medical record allows providers to keep tabs.\n\nCORRECTION: Corrected by: Libby Isenstein @ 07/21/2014 10:05 AM CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct where Inovalon is based.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The data explosion in health records is being fueled by the private sector and Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The data explosion in health records is being fueled by the private sector and Obamacare.", "title": "Big brother is watching your waist", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/data-mining-health-care-109153.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/06/15/140615_doctor_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Privacy,Health Care,Health,Technology,Big Data,Data Mining,Data,Affordable Care Act", "article": {"author": "www.facebook.com/arthurallen"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0072\"", "article_summary": "Big brother is watching your waistData mining is digging into your health.\nThe wider use of health care data analytics raises many questions.\n\u201cThe adoption of electronic health records has increased the amount of information available to employers and providers and health plans,\u201d says PwC\u2019s Gebreyes.\nThe 2009 HITECH Act gives cash to doctors who switch from paper to electronic records \u2014 which create a home for the health data.\n\u201cHealth care,\u201d says Kulleni Gebreyes, director of the Health Industries Advisory group at PwC, \u201cis doing credit scoring now.\u201d But instead of scoring your credit, health data firms are actually scoring you."}
