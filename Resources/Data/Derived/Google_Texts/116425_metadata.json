Twelve years later, a series of workarounds and court rulings have allowed more cash than ever to flood the political system. In that period, the top dozen individual donors spent at least $396 million in federal elections \u2014 about 1.5 percent of the entire $28 billion spent across the country \u2014 and an additional $271 million in state elections. And those amounts understate the donors\u2019 total contributions: They don\u2019t, for example, include money given to political nonprofit groups, which are not required to disclose their donors. This is why the billionaire Koch brothers don\u2019t appear on the list.\n\nAfter McCain-Feingold, donors began to direct large checks to so-called 527 groups that could accept unlimited funds from individuals to spend on voter initiatives and advertising as long as they didn\u2019t directly advocate for a candidate. In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that political groups could also accept unlimited money from corporations and unions; \"super PACs,\" which are able to advocate for votes, effectively replaced federal 527s. Meanwhile, four of the top 12 donors got there in part through aggressive spending on ballot initiatives in California.\n\nIn some cases, the bulk of a donor\u2019s money went toward a losing cause: a failed initiative or a candidate who fell short. But in others, the largess could have tipped the scales of an election. When asked in 2012 whether he regretted spending so much on a voter measure, Tom Steyer replied: \"W\"hat was it they say in \u2018The Untouchables\u2019? Don\u2019t take a knife to a gunfight.\"", "article_metadata": {"thumbnail_75": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/11/opinion/sunday/top-twelve-political-donors-in-twelve-years-1413006154729/top-twelve-political-donors-in-twelve-years-1413006154729-thumbStandard.png", "ptime": 20141011112845, "twitter": {"description": "Over the past twelve years, workarounds and court rulings have allowed more cash than ever to flood the nation\u2019s political system.
