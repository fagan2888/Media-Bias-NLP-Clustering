Dr. Amer Alshekhlee recognizes the 10-year-old for saving her grandpa\u2019s life. \u201cI have no doubt she saved a lot of his functions and probably his life too,\u201d Alshekhlee said.\n\nTabors\u2019 grandfather is now in recovery, thanks to her quick thinking and recognizing his symptoms.\n\nWhat Is A Stroke, And How Do I Recognize One?\n\nStroke, a leading cause of death in the U.S., is a serious condition that requires emergency care.\n\nThere are two types of strokes. The first, more common type of stroke is called an ischemic stroke. This type of stroke occurs when the flow of oxygen-rich blood going to a portion of the brain is blocked. Blood clots in the brain are a common cause of these, as they block brain cells from getting oxygen, causing them to die. The second type of stroke is a hemorrhagic stroke, which occurs when an artery in the brain ruptures or leaks blood. The pressure from the blood can damage brain cells. Hemorrhagic strokes are often preceded by high blood pressure or an aneurysm.\n\nWhen brain cells die or get damaged, portions of the body that are controlled by the brain are affected. Common symptoms of stroke include sudden weakness; paralysis or numbness in the arms, legs, or face; trouble understanding speech or speaking; and problems with seeing. Strokes have the potential to cause long-term consequences such as disability, brain damage, or death.\n\nThe American Stroke Association (ASA) recommends using the mnemonic \"F.A.S.T.\" to remember the sudden signs of stroke. F.A.S.T. stands for face drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty, and time to call 911. The ASA advises bystanders to call if a person has any of these symptoms, even if they go away.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "science, fair, project, helps, fourth, grade, girl, save, her, grandpa, stroke", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Some knowledge from a recent science fair project helped a 10-year-old save her Grandpa's life.", "title": "Science Fair Project Helps Fourth Grader Save Her Grandpa From A Stroke", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/science-fair-project-helps-fourth-grade-girl-save-her-grandpa-stroke-344650", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/25/emergency.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some knowledge from a recent science fair project helped a 10-year-old save her Grandpa's life.", "title": "Science Fair Project Helps Fourth Grader Save Her Grandpa From A Stroke", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/science-fair-project-helps-fourth-grade-girl-save-her-grandpa-stroke-344650", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/25/emergency.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/25/emergency.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-25T17:31:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-25T17:31:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Some knowledge from a recent science fair project helped a 10-year-old save her Grandpa's life."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce92e\"", "article_summary": "When brain cells die or get damaged, portions of the body that are controlled by the brain are affected.\nThe first, more common type of stroke is called an ischemic stroke.\nThe second type of stroke is a hemorrhagic stroke, which occurs when an artery in the brain ruptures or leaks blood.\nA 10-year-old girl saved her grandfather\u2019s life after noticing that he was having a stroke \u2014 a subject she had recently explored for a science project.\nTabors won a second-place ribbon for her science fair entry on stroke research, but her knowledge came to be critical two months later, when her other grandfather had a stroke."}
