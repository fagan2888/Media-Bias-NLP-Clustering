The concept was outlined in the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999, which sought state reforms to licensing. Several attempts to pass the measure in recent years have failed.\n\nWith House passage of the bill, \u201cthere is unprecedented momentum to get this bipartisan legislation enacted in to law to secure its promise of an efficient and cost-effective insurance licensing process for financial advisors operating in multiple states,\u201d said Cathy Weatherford, president of the Insured Retirement Institute.\n\n\u201cThis is a common-sense bill that will maintain important consumer protections, retain states\u2019 authority to regulate the marketplace, and ultimately remove a barrier that is impeding broker-dealers\u2019 ability and financial advisors\u2019 willingness to sell lifetime income products,\u201d she added.\n\nIRI and other national insurance industry and agent associations have lobbied for passage of the bill.\n\n\u201cNARAB streamlines the multi-state agent licensing process through a regulator controlled board and preserves state enforcement of critical consumer protections,\u201d said Jim Donelon, president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and Louisiana\u2019s chief insurance regulator. \u201cWe urge the Senate to move swiftly to pass this common sense legislation.\u201d\n\nRep. Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas), lead sponsor of H.R. 1155, noted that the law would allow agents to expand their business to nearby states.\n\n\u201cThe NARAB Reform Act will create a more efficient, modern, and workable system of insurance agent licensing,\u201d Neugebauer said when introducing the legislation, \u201cthat allows for more competition between insurance agents and brokers, which ultimately means more choices and better prices for consumers purchasing insurance policies.\u201d\n\nSept. 13, 2013: Updated to include comments from National Association of Insurance Commissioners.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House overwhelmingly approved legislation that brings the U.S. closer to multistate licensing for insurance agents.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "The House overwhelmingly approved legislation that brings the U.S. closer to multistate licensing for insurance agents.", "title": "\u00ad\u00ad\u00adHouse approves NARAB, insurance agents closer to multi-state licensing", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2013/09/10/house-approves-narab-insurance-agents-closer-to-multi-state-licensing/", "image": {"width": 285, "identifier": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/weatherford-Cathy-e1355809096698.jpg", "height": 376}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/weatherford-Cathy-e1355809096698.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-10T19:35:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-18T14:51:40+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9d6\"", "article_summary": "The House overwhelmingly approved legislation on Tuesday that brings the U.S. closer to multistate licensing for insurance agents.\nIRI and other national insurance industry and agent associations have lobbied for passage of the bill.\nIf enacted into law, NARAB II would set up a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for insurance agents, allowing them to more easily sell across state lines nationwide.\nThe House version of the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2013 (H.R.\nNARAB II would create a non-profit to act as a clearinghouse where agents and brokers could gain virtual nationwide licensing through a single process."}
