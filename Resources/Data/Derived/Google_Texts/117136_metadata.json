The findings carry added importance because insurers selling policies on exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act will be paid under a similar risk-based formula, which officials expect to reduce overall health care expenditures.\n\nHEALTH INSURERS HAVE THEIR WAY WITH REGULATORS\n\n\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nHidden Killers: 'Undeclared' Allergens Lurk in Foods\n\nFailure to Launch: NASA's Flying Saucer Stays Grounded\n\nCybercrime Costs Businesses $445 Billion a Year\n\n\n\nThe secretive audit process is known as Risk Adjustment Data Validation, or \"RADV,\" in Washington parlance. In early November 2013, federal officials notified 30 health plans that they had been selected for review this year. Officials declined to name the companies or discuss the audit process. So it's not clear if any of these audits have yet been completed, or what the results might be.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that runs Medicare, has quietly conducted some of these RADV (pronounced RAD'-vee) audits since 2008. But the agency has never before imposed stiff financial penalties for overbilling the government, as it now intends to do. In the first round of audits, officials expect to recoup as much as $370 million from overpayments allegedly made to the 30 Medicare Advantage plans during 2011, according to CMS.\n\n\n\nHowever, that figure is well below previous administration estimates, and health plans have been granted extensive appeal rights that could stall any repayment orders for years.\n\nRead the Center for Public Integrity's version of this article\n\n\n\nCMS is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The HHS Office of Inspector General, which acts as a watchdog over CMS, has done some of its own audits of Medicare Advantage. It estimated much higher losses in six plan audits it conducted starting late in 2008. Those audits found that just the six plans reviewed had been overpaid by as much as $650 million for 2007 alone because of inflated risk scores, including payments for diseases that couldn't be verified through a patient's medical record.\n\n\n\nThe HHS inspector general audits are more worrisome to the industry than the CMS audits because the findings are made public and often draw media notice and attention from members of Congress. But the inspector general's office has said it won't be conducting any more of its reviews for the foreseeable future due to budget cuts, leaving oversight in the hands of CMS.\n\n\n\nRead MoreHospital charges surge for common ailments\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "partnerstory", "description": "After years of criticism, Medicare Advantage plans are facing audits that could order them to repay tens of millions of dollars for billing errors.", "news_keywords": "Medicare Advantage, audit, reviews, billing errors, overcharging", "author": "Fred Schulte, Center for Public Integrity", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Medicare Advantage plans are facing audits that could order them to repay tens of millions of dollars for billing errors.", "title": "Secretive reviews of 30 Medicare Advantage plans", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/09/secretive-reviews-target-30-medicare-advantage-plans.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/02/26/101448423-186973797.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Medicare Advantage plans are facing audits that could order them to repay tens of millions of dollars for billing errors.", "title": "Secretive Reviews Target 30 Medicare Advantage Plans", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/09/secretive-reviews-target-30-medicare-advantage-plans.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/02/26/101448423-186973797.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Health Insurance, Health Insurance, Health Care, Medicare, Medicine, Humana Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-06-09T10:33:32-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Health Insurance", "modified_time": "2014-06-09T10:34:17-0400", "tag": "Humana Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 101743088, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90d7\"", "article_summary": "In early November 2013, federal officials notified 30 health plans that they had been selected for review this year.\nIn the first round of audits, officials expect to recoup as much as $370 million from overpayments allegedly made to the 30 Medicare Advantage plans during 2011, according to CMS.\nHowever, that figure is well below previous administration estimates, and health plans have been granted extensive appeal rights that could stall any repayment orders for years.\nThe HHS Office of Inspector General, which acts as a watchdog over CMS, has done some of its own audits of Medicare Advantage.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that runs Medicare, has quietly conducted some of these RADV (pronounced RAD'-vee) audits since 2008."}
