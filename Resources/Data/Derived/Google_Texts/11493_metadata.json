Thank you for doing that\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u2014 letter posted in a tweet by Marco Rubio, Jan. 11, 2016\n\nVoters all across America know it: Obamacare is a bad law. https://t.co/7dcnGfWxua pic.twitter.com/k1TsN8CMFN \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) January 11, 2016\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is once again spreading the fiction that he was the lawmaker responsible for a provision in a spending bill that has wounded the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. He previously earned Four Pinocchios for making this claim.\n\nNote that the anonymous letter-writer in the tweet refers to an article that explained this. This appears to be a reference to a New York Times report that got this basic fact wrong in its first sentence and in its front-page print-edition headline: \u201cRubio Measure Delivers a Blow to Health Law.\u201d\n\nYet amazingly, a month later, there is still no correction of the article or the headline. [Update, Jan. 14: The New York Times corrected the article and rewrote portions of it. \u201cOther Republicans were ultimately responsible,\" the newspaper acknowledged.]\n\nTo recap, Rubio did raise concerns about a provision of the massive law that was intended to protect insurance companies from losses if they did not properly estimate premiums in the initial three years of the law. But his legislative method \u2014 a bill \u2014 did not get very far.\n\nInstead, a trio of other lawmakers in the Senate and House laid the groundwork to get a provision slipped into a massive spending bill. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), then ranking member of the Budget Committee, and Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, came up with a new strategy of attacking the legality of the payments. They also enlisted the help of then-Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), who chaired the appropriations panel that funds the Department of Health and Human Services and the Labor Department.\n\nIt was Kingston who slipped the provision in the bill, in negotiations with then-Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). Rubio had signed a letter urging such an action, but Kingston says he never saw the letter.\n\nThe Fact Checker Recidivism Watch tracks politicians who repeat claims that we have previously found to be incorrect or false.
