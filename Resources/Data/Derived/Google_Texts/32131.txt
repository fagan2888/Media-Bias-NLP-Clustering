JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Hundreds of people got out to walk Saturday morning at the Annual First Coast Heart Walk.

It kicked off bright and early at Metropolitan Park and people wore hats and ponchos during the rain. Channel 4's Rob Sweeting was there to kick off the walk.

According the the American Heart Association, heart attacks are the No. 1 killer of Americans. So far the event has raised more than $1.1 million to fight heart disease.

Ty'Meisha Sloan was the face of this year's heart walk. She was born with a congenital heart defect and had a pacemaker installed with in days of her birth.

Her father says she's 10 years old now and that she's doing well.

"I'm going to walk the whole thing and I'm going to have fun with all of my friends and all of my teachers and family out here," said Sloan.

The walk's goal is to teach people how to live a better lifestyle, to raise money for research to find a cure, and to understand the impacts of heart disease. Money raised from the walk stays in the River City.

To be heart healthy doctors say it's important to watch our cholesterol and blood pressure and to walk and make simple changes to our diet.

The Jacksonville Jaguars helped raise money for the cause, agreeing to match every dollar their fans donated up to $75,000.

"Prevention is key and we can provide the resources and our brand that's so strong in the market to help people with education and prevention," said Chad Johnson with the Jaguars.

Darnell Smith will be the chair of next year's walk.

"We think it's important to get involved because it's something that impacts all of us. If it hasn't impacted you yet, it's only a matter of time," said Smith.
