The danger and excitement of the races is a testament to the courage and fearlessness of the jockeys as they ride bareback and jump from horse to horse. \"It's more or less carried on from the warrior days of old, when they would go and invade enemy camps and make off with their horses,\" Robert Old Horn, who took part in his first relay when he was just 16, told the news network.\n\nThe 96th annual event draws tens of thousands of people each year and is considered the largest modern day American Indian encampment in the nation, according to Montana\u2019s official travel website. The rodeo, racing and parade end on August 17; and the pow wow, which is daily, ends on August 18.\n\nThe Crow Nation\u2019s pow wow starts in the evening and welcomes a celebration of dance. The fair also hosts its \u201cParade Dance\u201d \u2013 a way for the Crow to pray for good things to come now, and in the future.\n\nDance specials include, Crow, style, chicken dance, and one for tiny tots. The emcee\u2019s are Jason Goodstriker, Corky Old Horn and Darin Old Coyote. And this year\u2019s host drums are the White Fish Jrs and the Young Bear Singers.\n\nRELATED:Bareback Jockeys Shock and Awe at First Indian Horse Relays\n\nAll are welcome to the event, which is free, and many come from all over the United States and Canada to a part of the country that\u2019s deep in the plains.\n\n\"You could call it the Wild West. But this is what we call it: \u2018The Tee-pee Capital of the World,'\" Old Horn said.\n\nRead more about the fair and rodeo on CNN.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Crow Fair and Rodeo near Billings, Montana, is bustling with the next generation of rodeo stars,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/13/teepee-capital-world-96th-crow-fair-and-rodeo-156388", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/crow_fair_and_rodeo.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "'Teepee Capital of the World': The 96th Crow Fair and Rodeo"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/13/teepee-capital-world-96th-crow-fair-and-rodeo-156388", "dc": {"title": "'Teepee Capital of the World': The 96th Crow Fair and Rodeo"}, "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-13T12:51-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "'Teepee Capital of the World': The 96th Crow Fair and Rodeo"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ecf\"", "article_summary": "But this is what we call it: \u2018The Tee-pee Capital of the World,'\" Old Horn said.\n\"We've had quite a few young Indian men that have ridden here, gone into professional rodeo, and become world champions.\"\nThe rodeo, racing and parade end on August 17; and the pow wow, which is daily, ends on August 18.\nAccording to CNN, a \u201cmini metropolis of teepees\u201d are set around the Little Big Horn River for the four-day event, which begins August 14.\nThe Crow Nation\u2019s pow wow starts in the evening and welcomes a celebration of dance."}
