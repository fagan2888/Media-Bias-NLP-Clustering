But there\u2019s a new pool of money rolling out that could help change that.\n\nIt comes from Obamacare. It\u2019s an entitlement program. And Texas is one of five states taking part, thanks to legislation by one of the state\u2019s most conservative senators.\n\nThe program, called Community First Choice, represents a relatively new idea of what housing for people with special needs should look like. The idea is that they should live in the community, in their own homes or apartments, instead of nursing homes and state institutions.\n\nIt\u2019s a change in thinking that Texas has been slow to adopt. The state\u2019s system of mental institutions spends about $581 million to house just 3,362 people. Meanwhile, more than 102,000 people are stalled on waiting lists for money that could help them live in the community.\n\nFrustrated by those waiting lists, some North Texas parents started Community for Permanent Supported Housing to create housing options for their children.\n\nIn the past year, the group has secured affordable housing in the area for more than 50 disabled adults, with more co-ops on the way, in the hope that these options can take advantage of funding through Community First Choice.\n\nShifting policy\n\nIn the last couple of decades, national policy and court rulings have moved the country away from state institutions and group homes as the default for housing people with intellectual and developmental disabilities \u2014 conditions including Down syndrome and autism. Such places are costly, and they reinforce the physical and social isolation that segregates that population.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for them to be living their lives like your kids live their lives. It\u2019s not appropriate to be isolating this population because they look or act differently, because we all look and act differently,\u201d said Robin LeoGrande, Community for Permanent Supported Housing president. \u201cThey are here to stay, and no amount of blindfolds is going to change that they are part of our society.\u201d\n\nTexas, however, is far from letting that institutional model go. It operates more institutions for people with disabilities than any other state: 13 centers for 3,362 people.\n\nIn 2012, Texas spent $166,643 per person to keep them in a state institution, compared with $39,947 per person it pays for people with disabilities to live in a community. The funding for community-based programs went down 5.8 percent in two years, according to the Texas Council for Developmental Disabilities.\n\nThis is why Texas has consistently ranked almost last in the U.S. in providing services for people with disabilities, said Kyle Piccola, government affairs director for the disability rights group ARC of Texas. He and other groups say the root cause is legislators\u2019 general aversion to funding social programs like Medicaid.\n\nMedicaid is supposed to provide adults with services to live in their own homes or apartments, but the waiting lists for it are so backlogged that tens of thousands are left waiting a long time.\n\n\u201cFor so many people, Medicaid is a lifeline, especially with people with disabilities,\u201d Piccola said. \u201cAnd unfortunately for more conservative-thinking legislators, when you\u2019re talking about Medicaid, you\u2019re talking about something that has a really negative connotation.\u201d\n\nYears of waiting\n\nFamilies have had to wait years, sometimes more than a decade, for these Medicaid benefits.\n\nVirginia Phillips, one of the mothers with Community for Permanent Supported Housing, put her son Brent on a waiting list when he was 5. Now 23, he\u2019s risen to around the 300th spot \u2014 which is a good number, she says.\n\nMelissa Gale, spokeswoman for the Department of Aging and Disability Services, said the lists are so long because state funding doesn\u2019t keep pace with the growth in demand, along with other factors like Texas\u2019 booming population.\n\nEven when people do get to the top of those lists, there\u2019s no guarantee there will be a spot for them in a group home or that the home will be near the family and community they know. The state has group home vacancies, but those can be as far away as Corpus Christi.\n\nAnd parents don\u2019t want group homes to be the only option for their kids. Some of their children can drive, have jobs and have spent nights on their own. Not all of them need to be watched 24/7.\n\nFrustrated with waiting, housing advocates are looking for ways around the waiver lists. But little was it publicized that the Legislature had already created such an option for them two years ago.\n\nConservative backing\n\nCommunity First Choice, a program established by the Affordable Care Act, is now rolling out in Texas, one of only five states that have adopted it.\n\nTexas\u2019 participation was spearheaded by Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound.\n\nBut the program comes with a big perk: a 6 percent bump in Medicaid funding from the feds.\n\n\u201cThis was one piece of a broader effort to extend services to individuals with disabilities, many of whom have been on waiting lists for years to receive basic services that will help them live more independently,\u201d Nelson said in an email through her spokeswoman.\n\nApproved in 2013, the program has gotten little media coverage in Texas since former Gov. Rick Perry supported it while refusing to call it Obamacare. Yet advocates call it a massive shift in how the state supports people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\n\nFamilies won\u2019t have to be at the mercy of years-long waiting lists anymore. People with disabilities who qualify can apply to the government for money to pay for community-based home services, and the state will have to give it to them.\n\nAccording to Health and Human Services Commission spokesman Bryan Black, the state has approved $54.9 million for this fiscal year and $61 million for the next as it rolls out the program.\n\nA place of her own\n\nAdvocates hope those funds will help people like Shayna Forrest, 24, have a good place to live.\n\nThis summer, with a learning disability and not enough money to afford her own place, Forrest went to a homeless shelter instead.\n\nShe woke up at 6 every morning on a top bunk in a room with three other women. She had dinner duty every night from 5 to 8. She did her laundry in the same washing machine as 30 other people.\n\nShe had wanted to live on her own in a house or apartment ever since she finished high school. But she couldn\u2019t afford anything in the area with the $1,000 a month she gets from her grocery store job. The government doesn\u2019t give her any aid, even though she has a disability, because she works.\n\n\u201cI try to be as financially independent as I can, but again, mental disability ... not exactly helpful in the normal world, you know?\u201d she said.\n\nLast month, Forrest finally got her own room in a brick house in McKinney through Community for Permanent Supported Housing\u2019s advocacy. Rent is less than $300 a month. Forrest has two housemates, both with disabilities.\n\n\u201cBeing in special ed, it\u2019s just like, it\u2019s really hard to catch up with everyone else. It\u2019s always catch up, catch up, catch up,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cThis is actually one of the first places that goes at our own pace.\u201d\n\nThe adults who are housed through Community for Permanent Supported Housing are all supported by parents or service providers who help them when they need it. The group hopes that adults can eventually use Community First Choice funds to help pay for such caregivers.\n\nThe moms in their 50s and 60s who started the group did so to ease one worry that haunts them: If they die first, what will happen to their kids?\n\n\u201cIf no more housing was available, where do these people go? They go to the prisons, and they go to the mental health hospitals, and they go to nursing homes, and down to The Bridge [shelter] in Dallas,\u201d LeoGrande said. \u201cAnd that is not what we as parents want for our children.\u201d\n\n@Kristen_Taketa", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of North Texas parents has pushed forward an effort to provide more affordable housing options for their children.", "og": {"description": "A group of North Texas parents has pushed forward an effort to provide more affordable housing options for their children.", "title": "Texas taking part in Obamacare program to help disabled adults live outside institutions", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20151127-texas-taking-part-in-obamacare-program-to-help-disabled-adults-live-outside-institutions.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20151127-met_10disabledhousing_cover.ece/BINARY/original/MET_10DISABLEDhousing_COVER", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-12-01T05:14:52Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-11-28T05:25:55Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Texas taking part in Obamacare program to help disabled adults live outside institutions\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20151127-texas-taking-part-in-obamacare-program-to-help-disabled-adults-live-outside-institutions.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20151127-met_10disabledhousing_cover.ece/BINARY/original/MET_10DISABLEDhousing_COVER\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2556439\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-11-28T05:25:55Z\", \"section\": \"State Headlines\", \"author\": \"KRISTEN TAKETA\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20151127-met_10disabledhousing_cover.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/MET_10DISABLEDhousing_COVER", "publishtime": "2015-11-28T05:25:55Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, more than 102,000 people are stalled on waiting lists for money that could help them live in the community.\nFrustrated by those waiting lists, some North Texas parents started Community for Permanent Supported Housing to create housing options for their children.\nFamilies won\u2019t have to be at the mercy of years-long waiting lists anymore.\nAnd Texas is one of five states taking part, thanks to legislation by one of the state\u2019s most conservative senators.\nThe group hopes that adults can eventually use Community First Choice funds to help pay for such caregivers."}
