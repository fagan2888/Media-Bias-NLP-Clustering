The day has been dubbed by some \u201cthe SEC primary,\u201d after the Southeastern Conference of college athletics, because of its heavy Southern tilt. One of the biggest prizes up for grabs is Georgia.\n\nStill trailing Donald Trump and Ben Carson in the polls, Cruz has a plan to surge ahead: Win or stay close in the early contest states; use home-field advantage to stomp the competition in Texas; and impress Republican voters nationwide with a dominant performance in Georgia.\n\nAlready, Cruz has a more extensive organization in the Peach State than any of his rivals. The campaign has enlisted 1,500 volunteers, and it\u2019s aiming for 5,000 by year\u2019s end. There are Cruz supporters in each of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties and designated campaign directors in the two-thirds or so that will generate the bulk of primary votes.\n\n\u201cWhen the time is right, when it\u2019s time to move, we\u2019ll be ready,\u201d said Kay Godwin, the director of Cruz\u2019s grass-roots efforts in Georgia. Godwin said new volunteers are signing on daily, \u201cand we\u2019re training them quickly.\u201d\n\nLew Stafford, a Georgian who\u2019s been in the real estate business for 30 years, said he\u2019s impressed with the Texas senator\u2019s overtures to the state.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s planted the flag here,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for the nomination, and the pathway is here.\u201d\n\nThough he\u2019s praised the campaigns of the two GOP front-runners, Cruz doesn\u2019t think Trump or Carson can win. His hopes are to inherit their supporters should they drop from the race.\n\nSince being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012, Cruz has branded himself the \u201cconsistent conservative.\u201d He proudly points out that he didn\u2019t abandon fights against Planned Parenthood and the Affordable Care Act, even when it was clear that those efforts would fail.\n\nThat adherence to principle should serve him well in the conservative South.\n\nBut some political analysts say Trump or Carson \u2014 or both \u2014 could flourish for much longer than Cruz thinks.\n\nAcross the country, Republican voters have expressed their desire for a nominee who\u2019s an outsider \u2014 meaning someone who has not held elected office.\n\nLike Cruz, Trump has circled March 1 as a critical juncture in the GOP race, even though his organization in most of those primary states doesn\u2019t stack up to Cruz\u2019s.\n\nThe New York real estate magnate is opening a campaign office in Texas, where, supporters say, he already has thousands of volunteers lined up.\n\nNathan Gonzales, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report in Washington, said Cruz\u2019s edge over Trump and Carson could be his organization.\n\n\u201cSome of the rules of the game are changing, but I believe you still need a robust campaign operation to identify your supporters and get them out to the polls,\u201d Gonzales said.\n\n\u201cThe nomination will not be decided by who has the biggest rally. Free media coverage will boost your name identification, but it\u2019s not a substitute for a complex get-out-the-vote operation that can deliver voters to the caucuses or the polls, even in the middle of a February snowstorm.\u201d\n\nCruz supporters acknowledge that Trump currently holds the upper hand.\n\n\u201cRight now, most people are for Trump, so it\u2019s an uphill battle,\u201d said Sam Verniero, a leader in Cruz\u2019s Georgia campaign effort.\n\nBut Verniero said Cruz is positioned to win that uphill battle.\n\nThe Texas senator has raised money and built a machine like successful, if more moderate, Republicans before him.\n\nIn the states with the first four presidential contests, he boasts of 340 campaign leaders in 171 counties.\n\nHe has leadership teams in 22 states and the Virgin Islands. Those teams include nearly 600 people.\n\nThat kind of ground organization could prove critical in February, when Cruz must get off to a good start. But it\u2019s also essential for the big matchups on March 1.\n\nTexas is the top prize in the SEC primary, with 155 delegates up for grabs. Georgia is next with 76.\n\nElsewhere on that date, nearly 500 delegates will be awarded. The other states voting on March 1 include Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Virginia and Oklahoma.\n\nAt the debate party in Marietta, Scott Johnson, a member of the Georgia Board of Education and a Cruz supporter, said his candidate is ready.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a strong infrastructure of volunteers ... and no other candidate can match that,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom Jan. 1 to March 1, it\u2019s going to be voter contact on steroids.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Election, Local News, Gromer Jeffers Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "MARIETTA | At a watch party for a recent Republican presidential debate, the people in Ted Cruz T-shirts cheered whenever their guy appeared on camera.", "title": "Ted Cruz bets big on Georgia in bid to catch GOP front-runners", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/election/2015-11-27/ted-cruz-bets-big-georgia-bid-catch-gop-front-runners", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/14917183.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s a great fit for Georgia Republicans,\u201d said Louie Hunter, a Cruz campaign worker.\n\u201cRight now, most people are for Trump, so it\u2019s an uphill battle,\u201d said Sam Verniero, a leader in Cruz\u2019s Georgia campaign effort.\n\u201cWe\u2019re impressed that he\u2019s taking Georgia so seriously.\u201dTexas\u2019 junior senator is indeed taking Georgia \u2014 and many other states \u2014 seriously in what could be a protracted struggle for the GOP nomination.\nThere are Cruz supporters in each of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties and designated campaign directors in the two-thirds or so that will generate the bulk of primary votes.\nLike Cruz, Trump has circled March 1 as a critical juncture in the GOP race, even though his organization in most of those primary states doesn\u2019t stack up to Cruz\u2019s."}
