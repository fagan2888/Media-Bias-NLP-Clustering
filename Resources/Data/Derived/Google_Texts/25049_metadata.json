The union gave up small car production in the U.S. for fatter paychecks. (Photo: Jose Juarez)\n\nUAW President Dennis Williams called the recent announcement that Ford Motor Co. is investing $1.6 billion and 2,800 jobs in a new Mexico plant a \u201cdisappointment\u201d and \u201cvery troubling.\u201d But it\u2019s disingenuous for him to complain the jobs are moving south rather than growing in Detroit.\n\nWilliams and the union knew they were sacrificing jobs and future investments from Detroit\u2019s Big Three in the United States when they pushed for a fatter contract with the automotive companies last fall. They sacrificed long-term growth, which could have included expanding small car production here, for immediate gains.\n\nEven the union\u2019s relative current stability, rooted in confidence they\u2019ll continue to make high-profit, popular trucks and SUVs in the United States, could be threatened in the near future.\n\nBut Ford\u2019s announcement is no surprise; it\u2019s reality setting in. The company has made it perfectly clear it can\u2019t make money on small cars if they\u2019re built in the U.S. It would cost Ford about five times as much to have UAW workers make the cars rather than use labor in Mexico.\n\nThe union knows that because it actually worked with the auto companies during 2008 and 2009 to retain some small car production here. UAW members accepted the two-tier wage structure to lower labor costs and keep those jobs in the country.\n\nGeneral Motors, for example, started making small cars at its Lake Orion plant, and Ford expanded production of the popular Focus in Wayne. Those agreements were crucial to the auto industry\u2019s booming recovery.\n\nWithout the tiered wage structure, Ford doesn\u2019t have much of a choice where it manufactures small cars, despite Williams\u2019 belief that they should be made in the U.S.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that Mexico has created a relatively inviting atmosphere for business by improving its workforce, manufacturing quality levels, and signing free trade agreements over the past several decades.\n\nBut Williams has threatened the longevity and health of his union in other ways, notably by abandoning the noble idea he touted to solve the union\u2019s growing healthcare problem. Costs continue to increase, and will more so with Obamacare\u2019s coming so-called Cadillac taxes. Williams claimed it was a priority to create a structure to manage the healthcare issue, but abandoned it at the bargaining table.\n\nThese choices the union made knowingly will likely backfire should gas prices rise again and large vehicle production \u2014 sales of which have been record-setting over the past year \u2014 slows.\n\nThen those jobs the UAW now relies on will be at risk.\n\nIt\u2019s a long bet the UAW has made, and Ford\u2019s announcement indicates the union will suffer more job loss in the future. But it shouldn\u2019t feign surprise and disappointment when realities of the global market once again become more powerful than its ballooning contract demands.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1S3fNsp", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Ford\u2019s Mexico plant should be no surprise to union, which gave up small car production in U.S. for fatter paychecks", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Ford\u2019s Mexico plant should be no surprise to union, which gave up small car production in U.S. for fatter paychecks", "title": "Our Editorial: UAW traded jobs for short-term gain", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/04/09/editorial-uaw-traded-jobs-short-term-gain/82853012/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ford\u2019s Mexico plant should be no surprise to union, which gave up small car production in U.S. for fatter paychecks", "title": "Our Editorial: UAW traded jobs for short-term gain", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fad2a84a119b9cfa33ef1f662587e4198b5242d6/c=0-418-1888-2306&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/09/DetroitNews/B99379267Z.1_20160409211529_000_GQLT25G0.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "editorial,UAW,Williams,jobs,Mexico"}, "article_summary": "The company has made it perfectly clear it can\u2019t make money on small cars if they\u2019re built in the U.S.\nFord\u2019s plans for a Mexico plant should not surprise UAW President Dennis Williams.\nUAW members accepted the two-tier wage structure to lower labor costs and keep those jobs in the country.\nThen those jobs the UAW now relies on will be at risk.\nGeneral Motors, for example, started making small cars at its Lake Orion plant, and Ford expanded production of the popular Focus in Wayne."}
