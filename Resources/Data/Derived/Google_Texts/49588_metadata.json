He urges his team to tune out \u201cthe noise,\u201d \u201cthe echo chamber,\u201d the Beltway obsession with who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down. But in the fall of 2014, he got sick of the narrative of gloom hovering over his White House. Unemployment was dropping and troops were coming home, yet only one in four Americans thought the nation was on the right track \u2014 and Democrats worried about the midterm elections were sprinting away from him. He wanted to break through the noise.\n\nObama\u2019s strategists, led by his longtime political guru David Axelrod, had always warned him against \u201cdancing in the end zone.\u201d Their polling suggested that gloating about the recovery would backfire when so many Americans were still hurting. But Obama thought it was time to spike the football, and in a speech at Northwestern University, he tried to reshape his narrative. If the presidential bully pulpit couldn\u2019t drown out the echo chamber, he figured nothing could.\n\n\u201cSometimes the noise clutters and, I think, confuses the nature of the reality out there,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHere are the facts.\u201d\n\nThe facts were that America had put more people back to work than the rest of the world\u2019s advanced economies combined. High school graduation rates were at an all-time high, while oil imports, the deficit, and the uninsured rate had plunged. The professor-turned-president was even more insistent than usual that he was merely relying on \u201clogic and reason and facts and data,\u201d challenging his critics to do the same. \u201cThose are the facts. It\u2019s not conjecture. It\u2019s not opinion. It\u2019s not partisan rhetoric. I laid out facts.\u201d\n\nThe Northwestern speech did reshape the narrative, but not in the way Obama intended. The only line that made news came near the end of his 54-minute address, an observation that while he wouldn\u2019t be on the ballot in the fall midterms, \u201cthese policies are on the ballot \u2014 every single one of them.\u201d When Obama boarded Air Force One after his speech, his speechwriter, Cody Keenan, told him the Internet had already flagged that line as an idiotic political gaffe.\n\n\u201cWhat exactly was untrue about it?\u201d Obama asked, a bit incredulous.\n\nNothing, but Obama\u2019s words couldn\u2019t change the narrative of his unpopularity; they just gave Republicans a new opening to exploit it. They quickly became a staple of campaign ads and stump speeches tying Democrats ball-and-chain to their leader. \u201cRepublicans couldn\u2019t have written a better script,\u201d declared The Fix, the Washington Post\u2019s column for political junkies. Even Axelrod called it \u201ca mistake\u201d on Meet the Press. The substance of the speech was ignored, and Keenan still blames himself for letting one off-message phrase eclipse a story of revival, a prelude to the second Republican midterm landslide of the Obama era. \u201cI\u2019m still pissed off about that,\u201d Keenan told me. \u201cEverything he said was true and important, and that one line got turned against him.\u201d\n\nObama was hailed as a new Great Communicator during his yes-we-can 2008 campaign, but he\u2019s often had a real failure to communicate in office.\n\nObama was hailed as a new Great Communicator during his yes-we-can 2008 campaign, but he\u2019s often had a real failure to communicate in office. The narrative began spinning out of his control in the turbulent opening days of his presidency, and he\u2019s never totally recaptured it. His tenure has often felt like an endless series of media frenzies over messaging snafus \u2014 from the fizzled \u201cRecovery Summer\u201d to \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d to the Benghazi furor, which is mostly a furor about talking points.\n\nWhat happened to Obama\u2019s message is not just an inside-baseball question. Perceptions of presidents matter: They can shape an administration\u2019s ability to get things done, and even the way the nation thinks about itself. Obama may resent how \u201cthe narrative\u201d judges long-term policies and even historical legacies according to the latest polls, but his struggles to make the case for his record have helped Republicans reclaim both houses of Congress, along with governors\u2019 offices and legislatures nationwide. They also set the tone for this year\u2019s campaign to replace him, with Republicans blasting him as a pure catastrophe while Democrats gingerly try to embrace him without denying the prevailing narrative of hard times.\n\nWhen Obama himself has been asked about his administration\u2019s failures, he\u2019s harped on communication failures, and it\u2019s been a consistent theme inside his White House. \u201cOur policies are so awesome,\u201d he quipped to a few aides after a 2011 Roosevelt Room meeting. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you guys do a better job selling them?\u201d I interviewed more than two dozen current and former administration officials for this article, and at least a dozen told me some version of the internal joke that every problem in Obamaworld is a communications problem.\n\nLike him or not, Obama has had a hugely consequential presidency, transforming America\u2019s approach to foreign and domestic affairs, enacting almost all of his original Change We Can Believe In policy agenda. And credit him or not, America\u2019s trajectory has improved on his watch. Along with the trends he cited at Northwestern, the housing market, gas prices, combat deaths, and other vital statistics have moved in the right direction. So why does only a quarter of the public still think the country is on the right track? Why haven\u2019t his reforms of health care, education, energy and Wall Street been more popular? In short, why hasn\u2019t America gotten his message?\n\nObama veterans have a slew of theories about what went wrong. They cite the challenges of driving a complex message through the horrific crisis he inherited. They blame the intensifying polarization of the public judging him, with nearly half the electorate reflexively opposing almost anything he does. They recognize the contrast between his pristine campaign vision of change and the change he\u2019s been grinding out in the real world, through the kind of messy Washington sausage-making he used to criticize on the trail. And the White House\u2019s own messaging strategy, a subject of perennially fierce internal debate, has been perennially debatable.\n\nMost of all, they cite the dizzying changes in modern media, where Americans get their news where they choose, where conflict is the click of the realm, where lies travel at the speed of tweet while the truth is still annotating its Medium post. They blame short-attention-span journalism for creating a distorted narrative of a flailing presidency, by freaking out over crises \u2014 double-digit unemployment, the Gulf oil spill, the healthcare.gov malfunction, Ebola \u2014 and virtually ignoring their resolutions. They think the bully pulpit has lost much of its power in an era of 24-hour cable and social media, though they admit they were slow to adjust to the new realities. When Obama spoke at Northwestern, he didn\u2019t even have presidential Facebook or Twitter accounts.\n\nThen again, political types love to blame bad outcomes on bad communications, and for some of Obama\u2019s problems \u2014 chaos in Syria and Libya, the website fiasco, disappointing wage growth \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine a message that could have spun lemons into lemonade. Some Obama policies are unpopular because they\u2019re not what people want. Some Americans are dissatisfied with the Obama era because they\u2019re not doing well.\n\nThe president\u2019s Spock-like, no-drama persona has also complicated his efforts to connect with the public at times when terrorists were beheading innocents and pathogens were on the loose, especially in the new on-demand environment of rapid response and viral content. Obama sees himself as playing a longer game, rising above the tyranny of the news cycle, valuing the verdict of history over the hot take. But the Washington narrative unspools in real time, and to quote one of his favorite TV shows, The Wire, the game is the game.\n\nObama and his team sometimes claim they simply haven\u2019t tried hard enough to market their policies. \u201cWe don\u2019t go out and explain why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Vice President Biden told me. \u201cWhen we have a good idea, we think it will be self-evident.\u201d The president has delivered 3,300 speeches and remarks, so he\u2019s certainly tried to explain why he\u2019s done what he\u2019s done. But he still suggests he has neglected communications, as if promoting his policies were as forgettable a chore as cleaning the grill. \u201cOne thing I need to constantly remind myself and my team is, it\u2019s not enough to build a better mousetrap,\u201d he said after those embarrassing 2014 midterms. \u201cPeople don\u2019t automatically come beating to your door. We\u2019ve gotta sell it.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed, though, Obama aides admit their problems have been less about remembering to sell than making the sale. Yes, Republicans have manufactured \u201cdeath panels,\u201d \u201capology tours\u201d and other dubious outrages, while Fox News and talk radio portray Obama\u2019s America as a lurid dystopia where Barack grabs your guns and Michelle steals your snacks. Still, myth-busting is part of his job. And plenty of Democrats have criticized Obama as aloof, tone-deaf and seemingly lost in the new media landscape.\n\nAt times, Obama has been one of them. He sees himself as a storyteller as well as a policymaker, and by his own admission, he hasn\u2019t always told a persuasive story.\n\n* * *\n\nOne day early in his race for the White House, Obama\u2019s campaign manager, David Plouffe, threw a newspaper on the desk of his traveling press secretary, Dan Pfeiffer. It was the inaugural issue of The Politico, a startup dedicated to as-it-breaks, wall-to-wall coverage of politics for an insider audience.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d Plouffe said, \u201cis going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nAlong with \u201ccable,\u201d Obama\u2019s dismissive shorthand for TV\u2019s blab-a-thon of talking heads, Politico \u2014 the \u201cThe\u201d soon disappeared \u2014 became Obama\u2019s snide term of art for political coverage that prioritized optics over substance, short-term gamesmanship over long-term consequences, speed over thought. Eventually, his beef became less about Politico than his view that its established competitors seemed to be adopting its up-to-the-second style. He still thinks of most political journalism as superficial theater criticism, although his aides say that partly reflects his contempt for the political theater it chronicles, and they notice he still reads quite a lot of it.\n\nObama\u2019s 2008 campaign brilliantly navigated this new environment, often bypassing the mainstream media \u2014 he calls it \u201cthe filter\u201d \u2014 to communicate directly with voters. He had a simple message, Change, backed by a high-priced advertising blitz. He had a new-age digital strategy that brought supporters together on Facebook and sent them the scoop on his running mate via text message.\n\nThe shift to the White House felt like a journey back to the analog era. In January 2009, Facebook and Twitter were still blocked on West Wing computers. When one press aide checked the New York Times website on his first day of work, the multimedia display crashed his government laptop. After deploying a sophisticated digital operation with scores of staffers on the campaign, the Obama press team inherited a George W. Bush administration staff list with just two \u201cnew media\u201d slots, for updating the whitehouse.gov website.\n\nWhat the West Wing saw as gotcha journalism and substance-free sensationalism, the news media saw as long overdue scrutiny and balance.\n\nThe move into the Washington fishbowl also meant that Obama could no longer pick and choose which events to respond to and which to ignore. The borderline adulatory tone of the news coverage accompanying his quest to become the first African-American president evaporated as well. The veteran reporters of the White House press corps resented and resisted his team\u2019s campaign-style efforts to bypass their filter by keeping them at a distance to try to control his message, and even keeping photographers away to try to control his image.\n\n\u201cIt got ugly fast,\u201d recalls Reid Cherlin, a former assistant White House press secretary who has written about the Obama administration\u2019s battles with the media.\n\nWhat the West Wing saw as gotcha journalism and substance-free sensationalism, the news media saw as long overdue scrutiny and balance. Obama aides complained about the constant media focus on niggling inconsistencies and explicitly political angles; reporters rolled their eyes and noted that their stories happened to be accurate. Both sides came to see the other as arrogant, thin-skinned and annoyingly self-righteous.\n\nThere was a telling confrontation on Obama\u2019s third day in office, when he visited the West Wing pressroom to say hi, then bristled when a Politico reporter asked why he had nominated a Raytheon lobbyist to a Pentagon job despite having recently banned lobbyists from top posts in his administration. \u201cI can\u2019t end up visiting with you guys and shaking hands if I\u2019m going to get grilled every time I come down here,\u201d Obama complained. When the reporter tried again, Obama told him to save his questions for a news conference. Politico\u2019s headline: \u201cObama Flashes Irritation in the Press Room.\u201d To the president, it was an example of no good deed going unpunished \u2014 not just that he was grilled when he was trying to be polite, but that he was grilled over an exception to his rule against hiring lobbyists instead of credited for the groundbreaking rule. To the reporters, it was an early example of Obama feeling entitled to avoid probing questions about matters of public importance. They wouldn\u2019t see much more of him in the press room.\n\nObama strategist Larry Grisolano liked to say that campaigning is flying on a trapeze, while governing is letting go of the trapeze, and Obama let go at a moment of unimaginable chaos. He had to assemble an enormous economic stimulus bill to contain the vicious downturn, devise a plan to avoid another financial panic, save the dying auto industry, deal with two wars overseas, staff his administration and triage whatever else had gone to hell in the last few minutes. The economy was actually deteriorating even faster than it seemed, which led to an early messaging disaster: a report by Obama\u2019s economists predicting that his stimulus bill would keep unemployment no higher than 8 percent. It promptly soared above 8 percent, which had nothing to do with a stimulus that hadn\u2019t even passed yet, but handed Republicans an enduring talking point.\n\nObama\u2019s message of change seemed to disintegrate upon contact with Washington. He had pledged to blow up the hyperpartisan, backroom-deal culture of the capital, but within his first week in office, Republicans were already uniting against his stimulus proposal, and his staff was already cutting deals to salvage it. In normal times, the stimulus might have been a messaging dream, an $800 billion gift box of tax cuts, aid to states and families, campaign priorities like clean energy and medical research and much, much more. But that was a mouthful to explain in a crisis, and the GOP settled on a simple message of opposition: Big government, big mess. By the end of his second week, public support for the stimulus had dropped 12 points.\n\nObama decided to use his new bully pulpit to reclaim the narrative, summoning five network anchors to the Oval Office for one-on-one interviews. This would be his chance to prove the stimulus wasn\u2019t a worthless boatload of pork, to explain to a panicked public how it would create jobs now and growth in the future. But hours before his sit-downs with Katie Couric, Brian Williams, and the other familiar faces of the nightly news, the narrative spun further out of his control, when his confidant Tom Daschle, under fire for unpaid taxes, abruptly withdrew as his nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services. Instead of five opportunities to pitch his rescue bill, Obama endured five cross-examinations over his latest stumble.\n\nThe big soundbite: \u201cI screwed up.\u201d Politico\u2019s analysis: \u201cObama Losing Stimulus Messaging War.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re president, events don\u2019t cooperate,\u201d said Pfeiffer, who later led Obama\u2019s White House communications shop. \u201cYou can try to tell a story over time, but not every chapter\u2019s going to be pretty.\u201d\n\nMost economists now credit the stimulus with helping to prevent a depression, but Obama lost the messaging war so decisively that he stopped uttering the word \u201cstimulus\u201d in public. In retrospect, his marketers wish they had launched promotional campaigns for some of its little-noticed provisions, from electric vehicles to education reform to middle-class tax cuts, but they didn\u2019t have the bandwidth or the inclination when the economy was imploding at an 8 percent annual rate. This is the most common excuse they make about those frenetic early days, that there was just too much going on.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t talk about smoking cessation programs when the world is falling apart,\u201d said Jon Favreau, Obama\u2019s first-term speechwriter. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been awesome to spend a week pushing clean energy, but come on.\u201d\n\nObama himself changed the subject the day after he signed the stimulus into law, announcing a new plan to address the housing crisis. Then he turned to the unpopular auto bailout. His communications team, after two hectic years on the campaign, explored new frontiers in exhaustion spinning his efforts to avoid Armageddon, and it didn\u2019t have a nine-figure ad budget anymore. His first communications director, Ellen Moran, lasted just three months.\n\n\u201cWe were rolling out six policies a day,\u201d recalled Jen Psaki, Obama\u2019s current communications director. \u201cWe\u2019d get a 30-page fact sheet at midnight for a briefing at 9 a.m. We had no oxygen to sell what we were doing.\u201d\n\nAnd besides, while the financial earthquake hit before Obama took office, the economic tsunami was just reaching the shore, wiping out nearly 800,000 jobs a month that would be charged to his political account. Meanwhile, his economists warned him the jobless rate was a \u201clagging indicator,\u201d likely to rise throughout 2009 no matter how terrific a jobs bill he passed \u2014 and they didn\u2019t want him to talk about how grim the underlying situation was, for fear of crashing jittery markets. In essence, Obama faced the messaging version of a perfect storm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we could have done a better job with communications, but I doubt we could have changed that basic narrative of cascading job losses,\u201d said Jay Carney, who was Biden\u2019s communications director and later Obama\u2019s press secretary.\n\n* * *\n\nObama\u2019s first official hire was his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, a Democratic operative turned congressional leader, a down-and-dirty Washington insider who demanded to win every news cycle. The move signaled that after all Obama\u2019s talk about changing Washington, his priority would be getting things done in the Washington that currently existed. Emanuel\u2019s screaming and brawling masked the soul of a deal maker, and he didn\u2019t care if his deals seemed contrary to the lofty spirit of the campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m goddamned sick of hearing about the fucking campaign!\u201d Emanuel once shouted. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to solve some problems here!\u201d\n\nSolving problems meant cobbling together filibuster-proof majorities to pass bills. And that meant outsourcing Obama\u2019s message to Capitol Hill, drowning it in subcommittee markups, horse-trading and motions to proceed. After campaigning in poetry, he would have to govern in turgid legislative prose. If passing health reform required a brazen deal with the drug industry, an unsavory (and ultimately doomed) \u201cCornhusker Kickback\u201d to win a Nebraska senator\u2019s vote, the inclusion of an insurance mandate he opposed during the campaign, and an interminable wait while Senate Democrats fruitlessly sought Republican buy-in, well, Obama was willing to take the hit.\n\n\u201cCongress was toxic. Period,\u201d Pfeiffer said. \u201cFor those of us who measured our success by how the public thought of him, it was a problem.\u201d\n\nCoverage made Obama look isolated and his agenda look radioactive. And Obama really was isolated.\n\nObamacare would end up covering 18 million uninsured Americans and reining in medical costs, but the ugly process damaged Obama\u2019s anti-Washington post-partisan brand. GOP leaders shrewdly recognized he couldn\u2019t keep promises of bipartisan cooperation if they refused to cooperate, and on the stimulus, Obamacare, and almost all of Obama\u2019s agenda, they didn\u2019t. Many voters who heard about the same old Washington bickering would wonder what happened to Obama\u2019s grand vision of change.\n\nSome Obama loyalists think he was hurt just as badly by nitpicking from Democrats, who repeatedly criticized the stimulus (too big or small, too many or not enough tax cuts), Obamacare (no public option for insurance) and his aggressive Wall Street reforms (didn\u2019t break up the biggest banks). The result was coverage that made Obama look isolated and his agenda look radioactive. And Obama really was isolated. He\u2019s notoriously unenthusiastic about schmoozing with lawmakers, which helps explain why they\u2019ve been unenthusiastic about pushing his message. \u201cHe\u2019s paid a real PR price for his attitude that politics and politicians are mostly awful,\u201d a strategist in the Obama orbit told me.\n\nGenerally, Democrats who support Obama\u2019s policies have been the harshest critics of his messaging. \u201cThe best communicator in the history of politics got out-communicated as president, and it cost us the House and the Senate,\u201d former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell told me. When I asked for an example, Rendell cited Obama\u2019s branding failures with stimulus-financed road projects. \u201cThere should\u2019ve been colorful billboards with a cute mascot,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople would have said: \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a purple billboard with a lavender moose! It\u2019s a stimulus project!\u2019\u201d\n\nWhite House messaging veterans scoff at this lavender-moose genre of criticism, the idea that a magic word or branding strategy could have spun widely reviled policies into political gold. Their purple billboard was named Barack Obama.\n\nBut they did have real fights about what the billboard should say.\n\n* * *\n\nFDR had his New Deal. Lyndon Johnson had his Great Society. On April 14, 2009, in a speech at Georgetown University, Obama floated the New Foundation.\n\nThe slogan came from a parable about two men in the Sermon on the Mount. One built his house on a pile of sand, and it was wiped away by a storm. The other built his house on a foundation of rock, and when storms came, \u201cIt fell not.\u201d The U.S. economy, Obama said, had been built on sand. Now that it had been wiped away, the time had come to lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity. It would rest on five sturdy pillars: financial reform, education reform, health reform, a clean energy revolution and deficit reduction.\n\nThe New Foundation was as close as Obama ever came to a tweetable theory of the case for his agenda. He repeated the phrase in 15 speeches over the next month. His communications director, Anita Dunn, thought about setting up a New Foundation website.\n\nBut Obama thinks slogans are cheesy, typical of the Washington artifice he despises; he would later use and discard \u201cwe do big things,\u201d \u201cwinning the future\u201d and \u201cwe can\u2019t wait.\u201d Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin told him the New Foundation sounded like a girdle. Emanuel told him his slogan ought to be Jobs, and he ought to shut up about everything else. The New Foundation soon faded away, overshadowed by the Great Recession, the rise of the Tea Party, an awkwardly timed Nobel Peace Prize and countless other narrative eruptions.\n\nObama never found another coherent message to tie together his whirlwind of activity. The Republicans had a succinct on-message response to every Job-Killing and Big-Government policy he floated, while the White House was all over the map. For example, there was a never-ending internal battle over the Obamacare message: Should the selling point be extending coverage to the uninsured, improving coverage for the insured or reducing out-of-control costs? The battle was never resolved, so the message ended up being all of the above. Cherlin, the former press aide, says his guidance on health care constantly changed with poll results.\n\n\u201cOne month we\u2019d emphasize coverage, the next month cost, the next month taking on the insurers,\u201d Cherlin recalled. \u201cThe more polling you do and the more of a beating you take, the more you try different things. And you lose the narrative.\u201d\n\nBy late 2009 and early 2010, America had escaped the Great Recession much faster than other advanced economies. Still, Obama\u2019s strategists warned that celebratory rhetoric was politically untenable.\n\nComplexity is hard to message in a clickbait climate. Obama once spent most of a news conference on health care details, and the big news was his offhand comment that arresting a black Harvard professor on his own front porch seemed stupid.\n\nBut the message the White House spent the most time debating was the simple question of how things were going, and it struggled to crack that code, too. By late 2009 and early 2010, America had escaped the Great Recession much faster than other advanced economies, converting massive job losses into modest job gains. Still, Obama\u2019s strategists warned that celebratory rhetoric was politically untenable, because their polls suggested the public wasn\u2019t feeling the recovery. Phrases like \u201cAmerica is back\u201d were banned from speeches.\n\n\u201cThat was a constant struggle, how to temper our claims so we didn\u2019t lose people,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cYou wanted to shout: \u2018Look what our tough decisions have achieved!\u2019 But you don\u2019t want to impeach yourself. If people don\u2019t feel better, that\u2019s a self-impeaching message.\u201d\n\nInternally, Vice President Biden was the leading voice for more emphasis on the improving economy. It was, after all, improving, or at least getting less awful. Biden argued that if the White House didn\u2019t point that out, no one would believe it, and no one would give Obama credit when the recovery was undeniable.\n\n\u201cEven my own folks say, \u2018Jeez, Joe, you got 60-70 percent of the American people [who] think we\u2019re going in the wrong direction, don\u2019t try to buck it,\u2019\u201d Biden said in an interview on Air Force Two. \u201cWhat do you mean, don\u2019t try to buck it? If everybody doesn\u2019t buck it, guess what, it\u2019s gospel, man. We must have really screwed the pooch.\u201d\n\nTypically, Obama split the difference with on-the-other-hand messaging that satisfied no one: We\u2019re making progress, but not enough, but better days are ahead, but people are hurting, but less than they would be if we hadn\u2019t acted, but there\u2019s much left to do, and so on. In late 2009, Obama\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Summers, who had been Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, convened a meeting to discuss the amateur-hour economic message discipline. \u201cLook, we all know what this is supposed to look like,\u201d he told the Clintonite-heavy team.\n\nStill, every month after the official jobs numbers were released, Obama would go before the cameras to express his ambivalence, and the West Wing would resume its circular debate about how much of the positive to accentuate.\n\n\u201cGod, we went around that pole so often: Do things suck or not?\u201d Favreau said.\n\nAs they fought over the message, Obama\u2019s aides also fought over how often he should deliver it. Emanuel always wanted the president \u201cout there,\u201d to show the public he was hard at work on their behalf. Axelrod didn\u2019t want to overexpose Obama by making him a play-by-play announcer for the government. As Favreau told agency officials who wanted Obama to air their news, the president is not a PA system.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give your star running back the ball on every play,\u201d Axelrod told me. \u201cWe used him way too much. It robbed him of his power as the narrator of a larger story.\u201d\n\nObama did a lot of talking. But America wasn\u2019t listening.\n\nBut who else could run the ball? Democrats in Congress were frantically distancing themselves from Obama. And the White House didn\u2019t trust its own Cabinet officials as surrogates. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner\u2019s debut speech had been so unsteady the stock market had tanked while he was talking. Kathleen Sebelius of Health and Human Services got besieged by Tea Party activists at Obamacare events. Biden wasn\u2019t exactly renowned for message discipline either, and the ill-fated \u201cRecovery Summer\u201d campaign during the doldrums of 2010 was a Joe special.\n\nSo Obama did a lot of talking. But America wasn\u2019t listening. The days when the network nightly news shows would cover every presidential event for almost all to see had faded with the network nightly news shows. His policy speeches rarely seemed to get much coverage unless he admitted something had gone wrong, promised to do something differently or pointed fingers.\n\nThe ultimate example of Obama\u2019s powerlessness over his narrative was the Gulf of Mexico oil spill of April 2010, which was still gushing all over cable news at the start of the misbegotten Recovery Summer. Talking heads blasted him for seeming disengaged in a crisis \u2014 some called it \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201d \u2014 and even his 11-year-old daughter asked him when he would plug the hole. Pressure mounted for him to show resolve in an Oval Office address. Obama didn\u2019t want to do a speech, because he had nothing new to say, especially an Oval Office speech, which seemed stagey and melodramatic. But it felt like the narrative would be all about his failure to address the nation until he addressed the nation. So Favreau got to work on the worst speech of his career.\n\n\u201cI knew from the moment I sat down that we\u2019d get panned,\u201d Favreau recalled. \u201cThe idea was, a report to the nation. But that\u2019s not what people wanted. They wanted him to fix the hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Favreau concluded, offering a decent summary of Obama\u2019s first-term messaging problems, \u201cwords weren\u2019t going to fix the hole!\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nAs Air Force One left Charlotte after the 2012 Democratic convention, Obama and his staff grumbled about the buzz that Bill Clinton had outshone him, that America had a new Explainer-in-Chief. Favreau complained a bit longer than the others about the dismissive coverage of a speech he had written, when the actual explainer-in-chief cut him off.\n\n\u201cHey, man, how do you think I feel? I wake up every day knowing half the country thinks I\u2019m doing a lousy job,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObama is enough of a human being to get annoyed by the narrative, and enough of a technocrat to try not to let it guide his substantive decisions. He genuinely seems to believe that wise policy will eventually turn out to be wise politics.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he told Favreau, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to do your job and let the chips fall where they may.\u201d\n\nIn his first two years on the job, that long-game theory did not look prescient. Obama helped end the recession, started winding down two wars, let gays serve openly in the military, put two women on the Supreme Court, and enacted three monumental laws \u2014 the stimulus, Obamacare and financial reform. But with unemployment still near 10 percent, the chips fell on Democrats in the midterms. Even the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011 became a messaging mess after the White House press briefing misstated details of the raid, prompting then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates to propose a new communications strategy: Shut the fuck up.\n\nThe narrative did not improve until the 2012 campaign began. With the economy still soft, and the football-spiking ban still in effect, Obama\u2019s message was not inspiring. His slogan was: Forward. He argued that America had crawled out of the 2008 abyss \u2014 as Biden put it, bin Laden was dead and General Motors alive \u2014 but not that America was in good shape. His main message was that the Republicans were you\u2019re-on-your-own right-wingers who would take America backward, a message Mitt Romney reinforced with an agenda reminiscent of Bush\u2019s and a videotaped suggestion that 47 percent of the country just wanted free stuff. Obama didn\u2019t have much of an agenda beyond staying the course, but he didn\u2019t need one. He was like the guy in the joke who didn\u2019t have to run faster than the bear, just faster than the other guy. As Biden liked to say: Don\u2019t compare us to the Almighty, compare us to the alternative.\n\nBut once the campaign was over, there no longer was an alternative. Obama returned to governing mode, with all the familiar Washington messaging problems that entailed, except this time he couldn\u2019t govern. He tried to use his bully pulpit to push a gun safety bill through Congress after the Newtown massacre, to no avail. He used the opposite approach to push immigration reform, remaining quiet so Republicans who considered him toxic could still support a bill, but that didn\u2019t work either. Washington was gridlocked, and the narrative of crisis just got worse.\n\nIn 2013, the White House was overwhelmed by media uproars over Benghazi, allegations the IRS had targeted the Tea Party, NSA spying and finally the crash of the Obamacare website, a debacle that seemed to confirm every attack ever leveled at Obama\u2019s competence. The Fix gave him its award for \u201cWorst Year in Washington,\u201dchiding him for \u201cwasting a year torpedoing your legacy.\u201d The only time the narrative broke his way was when Republicans shut down the government, reminding voters of the alternative.\n\nBy 2014, the economy was better, and the website was working. But Obama claimed Worst Year in Washington honors yet again. Now his problem was global turmoil \u2014 chaos in the Middle East, Russian aggression \u2014 and his flaccid responses. When it came to foreign policy, he doubted more muscular responses would produce less intractable situations, and worried they could ratchet up demand for disastrous interventions like the Iraq war. The echo chamber wanted him to show resolve in Syria, Libya, Ukraine and beyond, but to Obama it felt like the Gulf spill on an international scale, a hole he couldn\u2019t plug.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the presumption we can fix these places and impose satisfying outcomes,\u201d said Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser.\n\nThe criticism of Obama\u2019s passivity peaked after he told reporters his foreign policy doctrine was \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid shit,\u201d which was roundly mocked for its blinkered message about American power. \u201cIt says something about the political media that \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid shit\u2019 is seen as controversial,\u201d Rhodes told me. \u201cWhy would we want to do stupid shit?\u201d\n\nObama sees most messaging about global conflict as a trap, creating pressure for harsher rhetoric that can backfire down the road, as with his own ill-advised warning that Syria would cross a \u201cred line\u201d if it used chemical weapons. His instinct is to lower the temperature, which can sound lame when terrorists are cutting off heads. \u201cHe has a fundamental allergy to cheap rhetoric that gives people a disproportionate sense of risk in their lives,\u201d said former National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor. That allergy was on display during the hysteria over Ebola, when Obama patiently explained the modest risks and launched an unusually effective multipronged response. Meanwhile, Republican campaign ads screeched that terrorists were smuggling Ebola over the Mexican border. That got more attention.\n\nAt that point, Democrats in tight races were practically claiming they didn\u2019t know who Obama was. The West Wing was so desperate to highlight good news that on August 28, when second-quarter growth was revised from 4.0 percent to 4.2 percent, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough urged the president to hold an impromptu news conference. Pfeiffer was vehemently opposed, and argued in the Oval Office that nobody on earth would care about a blip in Q2 GDP. But Obama decided to make a statement and take a few questions.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t asked about Q2 GDP. He was asked about ISIL, and observed that \u201cwe don\u2019t have a strategy yet,\u201d another gaffe that rocketed directly into Republican talking points. It illustrated the downside of the put-him-out-there approach to messaging; Obama was referring to a not-yet-complete Pentagon review of a possible Syria bombing campaign, but context is not the value-added of insta-news. His only consolation was that the tempest over his gaffe was mild compared to the Internet meltdown over the tan suit he wore, which sparked a firestorm of Twitter memes, from Yes We Tan to the Audacity of Taupe. You never know what\u2019s going to go viral.\n\nUndaunted, Obama went on to spike the football at Northwestern, giving the speech made famous by his \u201cpolicies on the ballot\u201d gaffe. It went virtually unnoticed that his theme was the New Foundation, a follow-up to his rollout five-and-a-half years earlier at Georgetown. He boasted that the five pillars he had promised in 2009 had all become reality: a wind and solar boom, Obamacare, a two-thirds reduction of the deficit, education reform and Wall Street reform. If the New Foundation had been the narrative of his administration, it might have been big news.\n\n\u201cThe New Foundation is now in place,\u201d he declared. \u201cAnd I will not allow anyone to dismantle this foundation.\u201d\n\nThat seemed like the sort of thing Americans should know. After the midterms, Obama wanted to figure out how to tell them.\n\n* * *\n\nObama\u2019s time in the public eye has coincided with a communications revolution. Pfeiffer calls it \u201cthe greatest change in how people consume and distribute information generally and journalism particularly since the invention of the printing press.\u201d It\u2019s hard to fathom today that it was a big deal in 2009 when Obama called on a Huffington Post reporter at a news conference, a first for a digital publication.\n\n\u201cIt was seen as a weird flash in the pan,\u201d says Anita Dunn, the former Obama communication director. \u201cLike, \u2018Are they even real press?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Obama campaign was way ahead of the modern-media curve, but his White House was slow to adjust the ancient architecture it inherited \u2014 weekly radio address, daily press briefing, website nobody read. The constant focus was a White House press corps that, in that halcyon time before reporters tweeted all day, erupted in protest when the administration announced the delay of a trip via Twitter rather than a news release. There were modest efforts to produce video content, like a series of \u201cwhiteboards\u201d explaining policies in plain English. But most White House officials weren\u2019t allowed on social media back then, so it was hard to get their video to go viral. The heart of the communications strategy was the president at his podium.\n\nObama glimpsed the power of loosening up with his 2014 appearance on the \u201cFunny or Die\u201d show \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d in which he traded insults with the actor Zach Galifianakis and plugged healthcare.gov. (\u201cThe thing that doesn\u2019t work?\u201d Galifianakis deadpanned.) The president was still the president \u2014 a joke about the first couple\u2019s sex life was edited out of the script \u2014 but he recognized that unconventional content could reach Americans who didn\u2019t read Politico or watch Sunday shows. His strategists could see the impact of social media in their focus groups, as low-information voters who wouldn\u2019t have heard about something like the IRS scandal in the first term were quoting back GOP talking points from their Facebook feed. And the \u201cFunny or Die\u201d bit worked: Traffic to the Obamacare website jumped by 40 percent.\n\nAfter the disastrous 2014 midterms, Pfeiffer began a review of the sleepy White House digital operations, meeting with tech types in New York and Silicon Valley, ultimately writing a memo calling for more forward thinking. Some of Pfeiffer\u2019s rivals actually blamed him for some of the earlier stodginess \u2014 a few pointed me to an article he wrote predicting the 2016 election would hinge on a flash-in-the-pan app called Meerkat \u2014 and he left the White House after his review, the last of the original Obama message mavens to go. He was replaced by Shailagh Murray, a former reporter, while Jason Goldman, a former head of product at Twitter, became chief digital officer. In any case, under the new team, unconventional communications has become the norm. Obama is now reaching Americans on their smartphones through viral videos with Jerry Seinfeld, the cast of Hamilton and a106-year-old woman who danced for joy when she met him. His team is going around the old school White House press corps to engage new outlets like Mic and the Verge, using new platforms like Snapchat and Vine.\n\nSo Obama didn\u2019t just promote his Clean Power Plan to limit climate change from the podium. He took a climate-themed trip to Alaska, where he recorded a video with a selfie stick in front of a receding glacier, then spent a day in the wilderness with the survivalist host of Running Wild With Bear Grylls. It was one thing to talk about criminal justice reform; Obama took the first presidential trip to a federal prison. And when the Supreme Court upheld marriage equality last June, his rainbow-lit White House said more than a speech ever could.\n\nIn its fourth quarter, the White House is taking political niche marketing to new extremes. The Centers for Disease Control answered questions about the Zika virus on the pregnancy and parenting advice site Scary Mommy. The drug czar did a Q&A about opioids with a Facebook group called The Addict\u2019s Mom.\n\nObama\u2019s team is still putting him out there, but often in ways that are kind of, well, out there. The president visited a comic in his Los Angeles garage to tape a podcast called WTF. He sat down with an author he loves, Marilynne Robinson, for a rambling New York Review of Books chat about fiction and history, a hit with the 1 million literati who follow the NYRB on Twitter. Media critics snickered when he spoke with the YouTube star GloZell Green, who wears green lipstick and once ate cereal out of her bathtub. But she asked substantive questions about same-sex marriage and Cuba, although Obama did smirk when she called Michelle \u201cyour first wife.\u201d And her channel has 4 million subscribers, numbers Morning Joe can only dream of.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to meet people where they are,\u201d says White House political director David Simas.\n\nLiberated from electoral politics, Obama clearly enjoys this stuff. \u201cThat\u2019s going viral,\u201d he crowed after he helped Hamilton star Lin-Manuel Miranda in March with a freestyle rap in the Rose Garden. \u201cThis is a childhood dream,\u201d he said as he rode a 1963 Corvette Stingray around the White House grounds with Seinfeld on Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee. He\u2019s not too interested in horse-race pundits \u2014 it\u2019s no coincidence that Chuck Todd, host of Meet the Press, wrote a book about Obama titled The Stranger \u2014 but he gave an extended tour of his global thinking to the Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, a long-form foreign affairs journalist.\n\nThe message may finally be getting through. Obama\u2019s WTF communications strategy has coincided with a climb in his approval rating to as high as 53 percent, better than just about any other national politician\u2019s. At a time when so many Americans view the world through a partisan prism, that might be near his ceiling.\n\n\u201cIf we dug up bin Laden\u2019s corpse and waxed him again, maybe we\u2019d go up to 55,\u201d one senior White House official said.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t sell it.\u201d\n\nOf course, Obama\u2019s good numbers might have more to do with a record 73 straight months of job growth and 5 percent unemployment than good messaging. He\u2019s also been getting in the muck with Congress much less and doing much more: the Iran nuclear deal, a global climate pact, the Cuba opening. And he is again avoiding comparisons to the Almighty thanks to the GOP primary, particularly the pouffe-haired alternative musing about nuking Europe and punishing women who have abortions. Obama aides frustrated over their inability to pivot during brutal news cycles admit to flashes of envy at Donald Trump\u2019s ability to change the subject by tweeting a new outrage. But for all his ups and downs, the basic Obama brand hasn\u2019t changed much since his rocky introduction to inside-Washington politics: The haters hate, the lovers love and the approval ratings oscillate within a remarkably narrow band, almost never lower than 40 or higher than they are now.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to pinpoint how much messaging truly drives outcomes, but the African-American named Barack Hussein Obama who won two presidential elections probably didn\u2019t forget how to communicate after the first one. The real communications lesson of the Obama era may be that communications are overrated. The stimulus and Obamacare were unpopular and dubiously messaged, but they were transformative achievements, and they didn\u2019t prevent the president from getting comfortably reelected. His numbers went up a bit after bin Laden, and down a bit after the website humiliation, but nothing he\u2019s said or done has realigned his trajectory. There might be something to Obama\u2019s long-game theory of doing stuff and letting the chips fall where they may.\n\nThe chips haven\u2019t always fallen where he wants, and a Republican successor could scatter them. But his legacy will depend more on deeds than words or GIFs or Vines. Good communications can amplify success and mitigate failure, but it rarely changes outcomes.\n\nDuring Obama\u2019s rare stint behind the wheel with Seinfeld, they decided to see whether a guard would let the president drive off his property. The answer, inevitably, was no.\n\n\u201cI knew that wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d Obama muttered.\n\nBut Seinfeld shook his head with a hint of mock disgust.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t sell it,\u201d he replied.\n\nMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for POLITICO Magazine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The inside story of how a great communicator lost the narrative.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The inside story of how a great communicator lost the narrative.", "title": "The selling of Obama", "url": "http://www.politico.eu/article/selling-of-obama-media-legacy-us-president-exit-policy/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GettyImages-517921876-1200x628.jpg", "height": 628}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-01T05:51:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-01T13:35:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GettyImages-517921876.jpg?w=640", "site": "@POLITICOEurope", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Obama didn\u2019t have much of an agenda beyond staying the course, but he didn\u2019t need one.\nSo Obama didn\u2019t just promote his Clean Power Plan to limit climate change from the podium.\nObama didn\u2019t want to do a speech, because he had nothing new to say, especially an Oval Office speech, which seemed stagey and melodramatic.\nWhen Obama himself has been asked about his administration\u2019s failures, he\u2019s harped on communication failures, and it\u2019s been a consistent theme inside his White House.\n\u201cIt got ugly fast,\u201d recalls Reid Cherlin, a former assistant White House press secretary who has written about the Obama administration\u2019s battles with the media."}
