An overview of the committee\u2019s Dec. 15, 2014 meeting says, \u201cCholesterol is not considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.\u201d That benign-sounding statement overturns decades of official dietary advice, and it could prove to be a boon for the egg industry.\n\nRelated: The 12 Hottest Foods Trends for 2015\n\nScientists on the panel are also pushing the government to take a tougher stand on added sugars and want to encourage people to eat \u201cmore plant-based foods and lower amounts of meat.\" The new recommendations could see the government take a tougher line on added sugars and red meat consumption. Though these changes are in line with views of health organizations, they are worrisome to the multi-billion dollar food manufacturing industry, including the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), because they may lead to costly changes in product formulations.\n\nThe nutrition experts want to advise people that added sugars should be limited to 10 percent of someone\u2019s daily caloric intake, a change from the 2010 Dietary Guidelines that said \u201cno more than about 5 to 15 percent of calories from solid fats and added sugars (combined) can be reasonably accommodated in a healthy eating pattern.\u201d Another proposal calls on the U.S. population to consume diets that are \u201clower in red and processed meats,\u201d a change from earlier guidelines that encouraged people to eat lean beef.\n\nRelated: The Foods You Should Never Eat in 2015\n\nThe U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture aren\u2019t bound by the DGAC\u2019s recommendations when issuing their \u201cDietary Guidelines for Americans,\u201d but they have tended to hew closely to the advisory panel\u2019s recommendations. Those official Dietary Guidelines, updated every five years, then influence everything from the advice your doctor gives you to the school lunches your child receives. Food manufacturers in the past have removed salt, sugar and artificial trans fats in response to concerns about health issues such as obesity and heart disease.\n\n\u201cThis is the federal government\u2019s official advice on what to eat,\u201d said Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition for the Center for Science and the Public Interest, a watchdog group that is often critical of the food industry. \u201cIt's rare for those agencies to ignore a specific recommendation from the committee. However, the government often revises the DGAC's language (largely to make it more understandable to the general public), so it's more likely that the advice to eat less red and processed meat might change.\u201d\n\nAs Liebman noted, the DGAC\u2019s proposals aren\u2019t radical. The American Heart Association, for instance, recommended a stricter approach to sugar a few years ago, suggesting a maximum of nine teaspoons per day for men and 6 teaspoons per day for women. The American Cancer Society also encourages people to limit their consumption of red and processed meats, as do other health organizations.\n\nNonetheless, some groups in the food industry are already pushing back, or at least preparing for a potential fight. The North American Meat Institute, a trade group, denounced the proposal about meat consumption as \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d and arguing that the recommendations ignored the nutritional value that lean meat and poultry provide Americans. \u201cThe change was made behind closed doors during a lunch break at the final December 15 meeting, the group said. \u201cActions made in haste behind closed doors are not rooted in science and do not make good public policy.\u201d\n\nThe Meat Institute also objected to the DGAC's discussion about sustainability and the environmental impact of animal agriculture, arguing the committee lacked the expertise on the issue. It also urged the group to wait on the results of research being conducted by the Institute of Medicine among others.\n\nRelated: The 11 Worst Fast Food Restaurants in America\n\nThe Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents the 300 largest food manufacturers, is withholding comment on the sugar proposal until the committee\u2019s final report is issued.\n\n\u201cGMA has consistently said that the committee\u2019s recommendations and the guidelines should be based on the best available science,\u201d the organization said in a statement to The Fiscal Times. \u201cWe have not seen the 2015 recommendations of the advisory committee, and when they are released, we will be looking at the recommendations for added sugars and a range of other matters.\u201d\n\nAs for cholesterol, the changes being considered there are backed by many studies that have questioned the relationship between dietary cholesterol and heart disease. Experts now believe that saturated fats in foods like red meat and cheese have a bigger impact on blood cholesterol levels that the cholesterol in foods like eggs.\n\nMitch Kanter, executive director of the industry-backed Egg Nutrition Center, told The Fiscal Times that the industry isn\u2019t counting any additional sales before the process behind Uncle Sam\u2019s suggestions are hatched. \u201cWe are not doing cartwheels until we read the report,\u201d he said in an interview, adding the industry has argued for the changes throughout the process.\n\nRelated: The World\u2019s Most Expensive Foods\n\nPer capita-egg consumption is at a multi-decade high thanks to trends such as \u201cbreakfast for dinner\u201d and the growing interest in dietary protein \u2014 though they are still well below the levels from previous decades. Rising prices for other proteins have helped boost demand as well.\n\n\u201cThe growth in eggs have been in specialty eggs,\u201d said Charlie Lanktree, chief executive of Eggland\u2019s Best, which is benefitting from the trend. \u201cWe have experienced 18 years of double-digit unit growth.\u201d\n\nThe new government recommendations could further fuel that trend.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "An obscure advisory panel tasked with helping craft the federal government\u2019s nutrition", "title": "Why the Government\u2019s New Dietary Guidelines Could Set Off a Food Fight", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/18/More-Eggs-Less-Meat-Why-Government-s-New-Nutrition-Guidelines-Could-Set-Food-Fight", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/eggs%20%28flickr%3APietro%20Izzo%29.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/18/More-Eggs-Less-Meat-Why-Government-s-New-Nutrition-Guidelines-Could-Set-Food-Fight", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/eggs%20%28flickr%3APietro%20Izzo%29.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "An obscure advisory panel tasked with helping craft the federal government\u2019s nutrition", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Nonetheless, some groups in the food industry are already pushing back, or at least preparing for a potential fight.\nThe new recommendations could see the government take a tougher line on added sugars and red meat consumption.\nThose official Dietary Guidelines, updated every five years, then influence everything from the advice your doctor gives you to the school lunches your child receives.\nThe 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) has already garnered headlines because its members are advocating revisions to a decades-old warning about cholesterol consumption.\nExperts now believe that saturated fats in foods like red meat and cheese have a bigger impact on blood cholesterol levels that the cholesterol in foods like eggs."}
