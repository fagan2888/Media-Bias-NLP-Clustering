They are dinosaurs in the market.\u201d\n\nAfter more than two years of speculation, developers have announced their grand vision to transform the largely vacant mall at Park Boulevard and 113th Street into a shopping destination with a name that speaks to the community\u2019s hopes: Seminole City Center.\n\nAt a recent city meeting, representatives from veteran development partners Primerica Group and North American Development Group showed images of shops and eateries set along a wide, well-manicured boulevard that leads to a movie theater.\n\nThe partnership\u2019s plans are the most ambitious of several redevelopment schemes gaining momentum at declining shopping centers in Pinellas County. But Seminole is not alone.\n\nIn Largo, the first commercial plaza built at U.S. 19 and East Bay Drive, Tri-City Plaza, is being leveled to make way for a new collection of large and small retailers; and on North Missouri Avenue, the aging Midway Plaza is being rebuilt.\n\nIn South St. Petersburg, residents who live near the Skyway Mall on 34th Street South hope the easing of city building codes at last will attract an investor with a vision for the faded commercial plaza.\n\nProspects for quality retail are on the upswing, developers told the Seminole City Council, and the time is right for big public and private investment.\n\n\u201cWe really do not want to present something that won\u2019t happen, that can\u2019t happen,\u201d Primerica Group President Richard Trzcinski told the council.\n\n\u201cBut now I think we\u2019ve got tenancy correct. I think we\u2019ve got the site plan correct. We have an economy now that, the tide is rising, revenues are up and there\u2019s more cash available for people to spend.\u201d\n\nAnchored by a Publix grocery store, Seminole Mall saw several decades of growth in the 1960s and 1970s followed by years of decline, especially since the 1990s. Its tenants have narrowed to a handful of stores including Bealls, Stein Mart and a CVS drugstore.\n\nCanadian investment firm North American Development Group bought the property for $14.6 million and has teamed with Tampa-based developer Primerica to revitalize it. Both groups have a large portfolio of successful retail projects across Florida and North America with big-box retailers, a mix of boutique stores and restaurants, high-end grocers and cinemas.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe new wave of commercial development is punctuated by a chic architectural style, outdoor space for music, live entertainment and other attractions that elevate the spaces from functional to a shopping destination.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entertainment, it\u2019s theater, it\u2019s great restaurants, it\u2019s a lifestyle center,\u201d Trzcinski said.\n\nThe developers have promised the city a $32 million increase in the property\u2019s value, bringing in an extra $586,000 in annual tax revenue, if the mall is redeveloped, along with more than 750 new jobs.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nAn agreement with the city is in the works in which the developers would get a substantial tax refund, but only after the mall is built.\n\nA deal involving the city, county and state governments also could make use of grants and other incentives to help pay for infrastructure costs, a model used for new shopping centers in Brandon, Orlando and Hallandale Beach, Trzcinski said.\n\n\u201cNever in our proposals will we put at risk the citizens of Pinellas County, the residents of Seminole, to put up any money up-front at all,\u201d he said.\n\nCity officials plan to hold a workshop with the developers this month to explore details of a possible agreement for the mall.\n\nOn the south side of St. Petersburg, residents hope to lure a developer like Primerica to revamp eyesores such as the Skyway Mall on 34th Street South.\n\nThe shopping center housed a Sears, a movie theater and other stores about the same time Seminole Mall was reaching its high point. By the 1990s, the area around Tyrone Square Mall \u2014 about seven miles away \u2014 began thriving with a cluster of big-box retailers and restaurants.\n\nSurrounded by residential neighborhoods and unable to accommodate sprawling commercial growth, the Skyway Mall and other shopping centers along 34th Street fell into decline.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of space to be developed in the Skyway Marina District, a lack of land, and the Tyrone area and other areas of the city had larger parcels and more parcels to develop,\u201d said Gary Jones of the city\u2019s community redevelopment office.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe same dynamic on a much larger scale occurred at Westfield Countryside Mall on U.S. 19 in Clearwater, which has grown into a regional shopping destination, even as smaller malls in the surrounding area have faded.\n\nSt. Petersburg city officials aim to entice developers to the 34th Street corridor in part by allowing the mall property and others nearby to be built to maximum height and density levels.\n\nThis would make way for buildings up to 15 stories high that could house offices, retail, apartments or a host of other uses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one specific idea. It would be up to a developer and the private market to determine what was most appropriate and what was best for the area,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nProjects already underway in the county should provide newer, nicer places for residents to shop, but may not reach retail-destination status.\n\nThe longtime owners of Tri-City Plaza saw the need to tear down a series of strip centers and a movie theater that, at more than 40 years old, simply were becoming worn out.\n\nKimco Realty is investing about $32 million to bulldoze most of the commercial space along U.S. 19 and East Bay Drive, except for a Publix and a couple of restaurants, to make way for new large tenants, including discount-retailer Ross and smaller shops and restaurants.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just responding to the marketplace and saying it\u2019s time to refresh this property,\u201d said Carol Stricklin, Largo\u2019s community development director.\n\nCity leaders have said even if the new Seminole City Center development doesn\u2019t bring in people from across the Tampa Bay area, as is hoped, the prospect of a renewed shopping plaza will have a huge effect in the local community.\n\n\u201cIt is the epicenter of our city and it\u2019s probably the only question we get when (city) council is out at community meetings: \u2018What\u2019s going on with the mall?\u2019\u201d Mayor Leslie Waters said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very anxious to get their mall back, their Seminole City Center.\u201d\n\njboatwright@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-1277", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 03 Aug 2014 23:11:24 -0400", "Description": "Once bustling hubs for growing towns, old shopping centers like Tri-City Plaza in Largo and the Seminole Mall have become big, empty spaces surrounded by even emptier parking lots.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Once bustling hubs for growing towns, old shopping centers like Tri-City Plaza in Largo and the Seminole Mall have become big, empty spaces surrounded by even emptier parking lots.", "title": "Long empty Pinellas malls could get chic makeovers", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pinellas-county/long-empty-pinellas-malls-could-get-chic-makeovers-20140803/", "image": {"width": 3847, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140803/ARTICLE/140809753/EP/1/3/EP-140809753.jpg", "height": 2544}, "updated_time": "2014-08-04T09:21:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Once bustling hubs for growing towns, old shopping centers like Tri-City Plaza in Largo and the Seminole Mall have become big, empty spaces surrounded by even emptier parking lots.", "title": "Long empty Pinellas malls could get chic makeovers", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140803/ARTICLE/140809753/AR/0/AR-140809753.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-08-03T23:11:24Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-08-04T09:21:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12b5\"", "article_summary": "The partnership\u2019s plans are the most ambitious of several redevelopment schemes gaining momentum at declining shopping centers in Pinellas County.\n\u201cThey\u2019re very anxious to get their mall back, their Seminole City Center.\u201djboatwright@tampatrib.com(727) 215-1277\nProspects for quality retail are on the upswing, developers told the Seminole City Council, and the time is right for big public and private investment.\nThe shopping center housed a Sears, a movie theater and other stores about the same time Seminole Mall was reaching its high point.\nOnce bustling hubs for growing towns, old shopping centers like Tri-City Plaza in Largo and the Seminole Mall have become big, empty spaces surrounded by even emptier parking lots."}
