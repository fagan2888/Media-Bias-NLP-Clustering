Ted Cruz had to say about it in a prior interview with Hewitt:\n\nHere is my interview w/ @tedcruz wherein he stands by filibuster: http://t.co/EMhrHfOgwX https://t.co/Uov5drvdQN \u2014 Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) June 26, 2015\n\nMore on Bush\u2019s revelation from Bloomberg\u2019s Sahil Kapur:\n\n\u201cI think we Republicans first need to unify behind the replacement,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s unity there, we can act. Right now, though, for the last few years we\u2019ve been organized against Obamacare\u2026 But there hasn\u2019t been any kind of unity about what the alternative is and that\u2019s what my focus is.\u201d Hewitt pressed Bush, pointing out that Republicans are unlikely to get 60 Senate to defeat a filibuster if Democrats stick together and block efforts to repeal Obamacare, as they have done for years. \u201cAt that point,\u201d Hewitt said, \u201cwould you at least be open to making the argument that on this issue, before it gets its tentacles too deep, that we break the filibuster and ram through a repeal and replacement?\u201d Bush responded that he was open to it. \u201cI\u2019d have to see\u2014if the repeal is what I\u2019m going to advocate, then I might consider that,\u201d he said, adding that if the replacement includes high-deductible, low-premium catastrophic coverage and helps the middle class, \u201cthen I would certainly consider that.\u201d\n\nInteresting, but would a President Bush encourage the Senate to do this?\n\n@sahilkapur @hughhewitt Gee, we've never heard this before, from anyone, whom once elected promptly dropped it like a hot potato. \u2014 Karen (@KarenDagerman) June 26, 2015\n\nT.B.D.\n\n***", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "title": "Going nuclear?
