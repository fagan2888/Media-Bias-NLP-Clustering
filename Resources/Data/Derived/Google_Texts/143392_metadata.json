Scott Walker has added one of Washington\u2019s leading advocates of military readiness to the ranks of advisers helping prepare him for a likely campaign for president.\n\nJim Talent, who represented Missouri in both the House and Senate before becoming a fellow at The Heritage Foundation, confirmed Thursday that he has joined Walker\u2019s budding national security and foreign policy team.\n\n\u201cI was impressed by his understanding and\u2014I\u2019ll use a 50-cent word\u2014how he contextualizes issues,\u201d Talent said in a phone interview with The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cI think he understands that being strong isn\u2019t everything you need to do in foreign policy, but it\u2019s the essential foundation for everything else,\u201d added the former member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cIf you\u2019re weak nothing works, right? Your diplomacy doesn\u2019t work, sanctions don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTalent didn\u2019t use President Obama\u2019s name at this juncture, but the clear implication was that Walker comes out better in the comparison. Talent added:\n\nI also think he\u2019s absolutely right when he says that leadership in foreign policy is really the same skill set as leadership in domestic policy. It\u2019s about having the priorities, the right basic principles, making good judgments, and assembling a good team and asking questions until you get the answers you need.\n\nThese are some of the reasons why Talent, 58, said he signed on with Our American Revival, the committee Walker created in January to explore a race for president. After a strong appearance in Iowa, Walker enjoys a spot at or near the top among at least 10 rivals for the Republican nomination in early presidential preference polls.\n\nCNN first reported Walker had tapped Talent, who served eight years in the Missouri state legislature beginning at age 28. He next was elected to the first of four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Two years after an unsuccessful bid for governor in 2000, he won a special election to the U.S. Senate. In 2006, he narrowly lost re-election to Democrat Claire McCaskill.\n\nTalent said he expects to be of most value to Walker on rebuilding military readiness, his signature issue as a member of both the House and Senate armed services committees. He also concentrated on that cause after leaving Congress, first as a distinguished fellow at The Heritage Foundation and, as of last year, at American Enterprise Institute as senior fellow and director of the National Security 2020 Project.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to [Walker] mostly about military preparedness, what the size and shape of the force should be to protect the homeland and our vital interests,\u201d Talent said. \u201cThat was such a foundation of Reagan\u2019s foreign policy, and people have missed it. It\u2019s one of the prime reasons he was so successful.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe understands being strong isn\u2019t everything, but it\u2019s the essential foundation,\u201d @JimTalent says of @ScottWalker\n\nTalent agrees that the 2016 presidential election is likely to turn more on national security and foreign policy than any since 2004.\n\nAmericans \u201ccan see what\u2019s happening around the world,\u201d he said, from the Middle East to Russia and China to North Korea.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now entering a period of visible consequences of the president\u2019s weakness in foreign policy,\u201d Talent said, noting that likely Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton was Obama\u2019s secretary of state for four years.\n\n\u201cAnother big issue is going to be the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq after we had won the conflict, which has opened the door to everything that\u2019s happening in Syria and Iraq now and indeed [terrorist group] ISIS\u2019s growing influence throughout the region and around the world.\u201d\n\nTalent was part of Mitt Romney\u2019s foreign policy team in both the 2008 and 2012 campaigns. So why Walker for 2016?\n\n\u201cYou get to know people, and you see where you click and who you think is the right leader at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cIn politics, the moment often finds the man or the woman.\u201d\n\nTalent, who met Walker at AEI\u2019s annual off-the-record World Forum gathering, said that, as a fellow Republican, he had paid attention to and admired the governor\u2019s ability to \u201cvalidate\u201d his leadership with Wisconsin voters. Walker first won a recall election sparked by his confrontation with public employee unions, then secured a second term in November.\n\n\u201cGovernor Walker is a proven conservative leader and winner,\u201d Talent said. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual for a person to be able not only to enact a big part of the conservative agenda, but also to so persuade the voters that it\u2019s a battle you don\u2019t have to fight again. He\u2019d changed attitudes as well as laws.\u201d\n\nWhat were Talent\u2019s first impressions?\n\n\u201cI found him to be exactly what he appears to be: He\u2019s very down to earth, he has an air of confidence about him but there\u2019s no arrogance with it. I like that. He\u2019s just a regular guy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has added former Sen.
