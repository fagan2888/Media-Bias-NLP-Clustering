Back then, it served about 100,000 residents.\n\nThat number has mushroomed to 202,360, officials announced this month.\n\nState data shows thousands of other people are covered by programs outside of Gold Coast, bringing total Medi-Cal membership to 227,500 people in a county of 846,178.\n\nThe other surprising number \u2014 the 50 percent of young children covered \u2014 could grow next year because of a California law extending coverage to undocumented minors.\n\nTo some, high coverage numbers are surprising in a county considered among the state's wealthier, with a family median income of $86,000. Others say the numbers reflect dramatic changes in the Medi-Cal health system and poverty that pockmarks areas of the county.\n\n\"We see a growing number of families who are in poverty or the working poor and don't have the means to lift themselves out,\" said Claudia Harrison, executive director of First 5 Ventura County.\n\nPerhaps the most powerful trigger for change has been the reshaping of a Medi-Cal program once aimed at very low-income families with children.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, expanded eligibility in 2014 to people in the tiers above the federal poverty line. That means families of four with incomes of $33,465 \u2014 likely ineligible under the old rules but still financially stretched \u2014 qualify for coverage.\n\nA complicated eligibility formula was simplified and based solely on income, meaning people could qualify even if they were single and had no children.\n\nIn other changes, the Healthy Families program aimed at families who previously didn't qualify for Medi-Cal were folded into the insurance program. That means children from households with incomes as high as $64,505 for a family of four qualify for coverage, although they have to cover some costs.\n\nThe changes ignited enrollment. Ventura County Health Services Agency officials said they originally expected enrollment to plateau at 175,000 members, but it rocketed past that mark.\n\nAcross California, 12.8 million people are now enrolled in Medi-Cal \u2014 about one-third of all state residents. About 1.4 million children younger than 5 are covered statewide, comprising 56 percent of all youth in the age range.\n\nThe rise shows how Medi-Cal's role has changed, said Anthony Wright, director of Health Access California.\n\n\"It's gone from being a health care program for some categories of children and senior with disabilities to a safety net for all of us when we might need it,\" he said. \"If you and I are between jobs, we might be eligible for Medi-Cal \u2014 that's a good thing.\"\n\nBut the program's primary focus remains low-income populations. That's why the inclusion of 50 percent of children younger than 5 in Medi-Cal makes Harrison anxious. She heads a nonprofit group that focuses on early childhood health and development, with half of the families served earning less than $20,000 a year.\n\n\"There are a lot of kids in poverty in Ventura County,\" she said, citing a United Way study contending 25 percent of families in Ventura County don't make enough to meet basic needs.\n\nThe study also highlighted the struggles of families relying on low-paying jobs. It said two parents with an infant and a school-aged child would have to hold more than three full-time, minimum-wage jobs to survive.\n\nHarrison said rising Medi-Cal numbers show people in need are receiving health insurance. She praised local enrollment efforts.\n\nWendy Aiens views things differently. She isn't surprised more than one of four Ventura County residents is covered by Medi-Cal. She just wishes she was one of them.\n\nThe Santa Paula resident works as a medical assistant and makes less than $1,400 a month.\n\nShe has been told she misses the limit for Medi-Cal. She said costs of private health coverage, even through the Covered California marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, are too high.\n\nSo she goes without, biding her time until she can apply for Medi-Cal again.\n\n\"I'd rather have that,\" she said. \"I can't afford Obamacare.\"", "article_metadata": {"title": "Ventura County\u2019s Medi-Cal numbers skyrocket", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/ventura-countys-medi-cal-numbers-skyrocket-27989544-be20-7b9c-e053-0100007f07c7-363564761.html", "image": {"width": 899, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/V0007240229--436984.JPG", "height": 897}, "type": "article", "description": "More than one of four people in Ventura County receives health insurance through a Medi-Cal system pointed primarily at low-income people.", "title": "Ventura County\u2019s Medi-Cal numbers skyrocket"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/V0007240229--436984.JPG", "description": "More than one of four people in Ventura County receives health insurance through a Medi-Cal system pointed primarily at low-income people.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ventura County\u2019s Medi-Cal numbers skyrocket"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "By Tom Kisken of the Ventura County StarMore than one of four people in Ventura County receives health insurance through a Medi-Cal system pointed primarily at low-income people.\nGold Coast is the managed care organization launched four years ago to administer Medi-Cal in Ventura County.\nVentura County Health Services Agency officials said they originally expected enrollment to plateau at 175,000 members, but it rocketed past that mark.\nOthers say the numbers reflect dramatic changes in the Medi-Cal health system and poverty that pockmarks areas of the county.\nShe isn't surprised more than one of four Ventura County residents is covered by Medi-Cal."}
