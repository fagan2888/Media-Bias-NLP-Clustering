Trouble is, kitsch palace Hobby Lobby has long-been the go-to place for the eternally crafty, despite the right-wingery for which it is known and about which so many locals (read: liberal) have bemoaned, even prior to this troubling case. What's an Austin crafter to do?\n\nWe found our answer on the newsfeed of a local artsy type and friend, Fabricker.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court appeased the religious right and pissed off a lot of women and the people who love them in the much-anticipated Hobby Lobby ruling. In a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that closely held corporations (like the famed arts-and-crafts chain) cannot be required to provide contraception coverage for employees when it interferes with the religious beliefs of business owners.\n\nThe lawsuit was brought forth by Hobby Lobby and a small Mennonite-run business called Conestoga Wood Specialties \u2013 who claimed that the Affordable Care Act interfered with religious freedoms by requiring businesses to provide preventative care like birth control for female employers.\n\nWhile the decision marks a seriously sad day for women, local crafters may take comfort knowing that the knitting and glittering may continue with fewer moral qualms and with just a little effort. Yesterday, former owner of the indie fabric store, Fabricker, April Kling-Meyer, upon learning of the morning's ruling, compiled a list on Facebook of local craft supply alternatives.\n\n\u201cWe have other options besides big corporations,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I saw that ruling, I thought of the all the women who feel like they don\u2019t have options that align with their political beliefs.\u201d\n\nKings says that her post has received over 60 shares on Facebook \u2013 including reposts by out-of-staters in Washington and Tennessee. She hopes the movement spreads nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to show people with our money, because that\u2019s what talks. You shop with your dollars, and you vote with your dollars.\u201d\n\nWe plumbed Kling-Meyer's local picks and the comments section of her thread, then solicited some ideas from some other crafty pals and scoured the web, added some ideas of our own, and somewhat organized it all into links for your convenience.
