The condition means the sisters have had to \u201cgive up on their hopes and dreams\u201d, according to mum Martine.\n\nShe said: \u201cSharnia was a talented springboard and highboard diver, a National Junior Elite UK Silver and Bronze Medallist and a South African National Gold Medallist.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately Sharnia\u2019s health deteriorated rapidly and she was unable to dive and could no longer attend college.\u201d\n\nHer other daughter Serena was working as a nurse at Addenbrooke\u2019s and was set to study nursing at Homerton. But as she got ill, she lost her job and the place.\n\nBoth sisters regularly attend the Vasculitis and Lupus Centre at Addenbrooke\u2019s where they receive life saving treatment.\n\nMartine added: \u201cI nearly lost Serena three times in the last six months, ending up in intensive care with an uncontrollable infection.\n\n\u201cShe also started having seizures as lupus attacked her brain and she had two heart attacks in half an hour as the lupus caused embolisms and clots in her heart.\n\n\u201cSharnia has been hospitalised a number of times for kidney infections and uncontrollable overall infections.\u201d\n\nNow Martine is fundraising for the clinic that regularly helps her daughters, and has been kindly supported by Cllr Michael Allen. She said: \u201cLupus is such a horrible illness and there\u2019s not enough support there. There are very few clinics in the country which specialise so people come from far and wide.\n\n\u201cWe spend a lot of time there waiting and we would love to do something to make that time more comfortable for people.\u201d\n\nTo donate, go to fnd.us/c/akkVf. Or, send a cheque made payable to \u201cACT \u2013 Vasculitis\u201d, writing \u201cLupus Martine Mockford\u201d on the back and send it to 101 Ness Road, Burwell.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A mother whose daughters are living with an incurable illness has launched a fundraising campaign for the clinic that treats them.
