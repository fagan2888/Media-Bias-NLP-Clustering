One of Niabi Zoo's big cats, Jackson the jaguar, was put down earlier this week.

Jackson, who was 21 years old, was euthanized by the zoo's veterinary staff after a rapid decline in his health.

The jaguar had been at the zoo since 1995. In the wild jaguars normally live 12 to 15 years.

“Jackson lived a very long life and was a great ambassador for his species,” said Dan Meates, interim director of Niabi Zoo. “He was a strikingly beautiful cat who was very charismatic. He has touched thousands of lives and inspired many to learn more about how to protect endangered cats. We will miss him dearly. We’d love to hear visitors’ favorite stories or memories of Jackson on our Facebook page.

As animals age their medical needs may increase, and our keeper team, who know these animals very well, are trained to notice subtle differences in behavior,” said Meates. “This allows us to detect any signs of aging that might become problems and immediately address them and helps us maintain the best possible quality of life.”
