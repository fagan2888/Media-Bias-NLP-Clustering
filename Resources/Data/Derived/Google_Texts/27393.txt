Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey has announced an extension of its payment deadline for January coverage to Jan. 25, citing "technical difficulties."

In an alert on its website, the state's largest insurer said it recognized customers may have encountered problems in trying to pay a monthly premium. For that reason, customers - both those who bought policies directly as well as those who purchased them through the federal Obamacare website, healthcare.gov - have until the 25th to pay.

As long as payment is made by January 25th, customers will continue to have access to their health benefits, the website alert stated.

However, prescription benefits will not be available until the January premium has been paid.

The extension was offered at the urging of the federal government, in recognition that the uptick in applications through the federal website means insurers are still receiving applications for January policies, said Horizon spokesman Tom Vincz.

"Extending payment due dates helps accommodate those affected members and ensure their access to benefits," he said.

The extension applies to customers buying individual plans, according to the notice.

The alert also spells out several ways customers can pay their bill.
