Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, said that his administration is considering closing the state exchange, Vermont Health Connect, and having the federal government take over. Vermont\u2019s exchange is still suffering from technological problems, even after the second open enrollment period, and has been more expensive than estimated. Currently, customers are not able to update their data once they\u2019ve applied for coverage.

He said the website is on track to be ready, but the state will have a contingency plan for the feds to take over and form a \u201cfederally-supported state-based marketplace\u201d if Vermont\u2019s system still isn\u2019t working properly.\n\n\u201cWe now have a vendor with a proven delivery record to finish the job,\u201d Shumlin said in a statement. \u201cIdeally Vermonters will continue to benefit from the Vermont-focused health insurance marketplace that we all envisioned\u2026but if our system can\u2019t deliver for Vermonters by next fall, we\u2019ll need to take action to move permanently to a system that can.\u201d\n\nThe state exchange was supposed to last just until 2017, while Vermont prepped the country\u2019s first single-payer health system, but Shumlin\u2019s administration was forced to abandon those plans in December due to out-of-control costs.

There\u2019s already been a few shifts \u2014 Idaho was the only state to build its own exchange after using HealthCare.gov in 2014 \u2014 and others have already failed. Oregon\u2019s state-run exchange has been officially dissolved and Nevada has switched over to HealthCare.gov for enrollment.\n\nNow the few remaining hold-out states are considering allowing the federal government to handle their own exchanges as well. A bill to close Minnesota\u2019s Obamacare exchange in favor of HealthCare.gov passed a state committee this week and Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton is open to the idea.\n\nThe state exchange, MNsure, is also dealing with technological problems.
