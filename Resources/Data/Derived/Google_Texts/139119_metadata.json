He was CEO of New Schools for New Orleans, where more than 90 percent of the children attend charter schools, and is a senior fellow at the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, which over the past four years has given away $150 million to a range of players in the charter industry.\n\n\u201cThe work ahead is really hard because we\u2019re at 8 percent of students in California, whereas in New Orleans they\u2019re at 90 percent, so we have a lot of catchup to do,\u201d Hastings said in a profile last winter on EducationNext.org, created by the pro-privatization Hoover Institute. \u201cSo what we have to do is continue to grow and grow\u2026 It\u2019s going to take 20 to 30 years to get to 90 percent of charter kids.\u201d\n\nThere are many problems with charter public schools, according to traditional public school advocates. They are anti-democratic, often embracing secretive and unaccountable corporate-style governance. They are prone to fiscal corruption, often using taxpayer money to enrich top staff and business associates. (In California, which has the most charters in the nation, reports by pro-public education advocates found that fraudulent self-enrichment schemes were expected to cost taxpayers in excess of $100 million in 2015.) They vehemently oppose teachers\u2019 unions and have a disdain for locally elected school boards. When it comes to academics, many\u2014especially the largest chains\u2014share an over-reliance on teaching for test scores and not addressing individual student needs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reed Hastings has pledged $100 million to help privatize traditional public schools across America.
