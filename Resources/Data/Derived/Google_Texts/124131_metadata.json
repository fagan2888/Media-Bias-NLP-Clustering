Anthony List to have the state\u2019s \u201cfalse statements\u201d campaign rule thrown out as unconstitutional.\n\nWe\u2019re with you, the ACLU said in a filing.\n\n\u201cOhio\u2019s political false-statement statute \u2026 presents a clear facial violation of the First Amendment,\u201d the ACLU said in its filing. \u201cThe First Amendment protects free political expression foremost among all areas of speech. American self-governance requires that the public be well-informed not only in facts, but in the broad range of political opinions present in the marketplace of ideas. Restrictions on political speech must therefore be regarded with particular suspicion.\u201d\n\nAnother group, the 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, said it \u201csupports the invalidation of the statutes at issue in this matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cConstitutionally limited government mandates the protection of free political debate from content-based restriction such as Ohio\u2019s peculiar statutory scheme that appoints panels of politicians as arbiters of the truth of political statements.\u201d\n\nBest-selling author Mark Levin talks about his blueprint to fix America\u2019s broken government, in \u201cThe Liberty Amendments.\u201d\n\nIt continued: \u201cBecause of this statute, people must refrain from speaking because of the potential threat of litigation. The net effect is censorship. By allowing this statute to stand as is, without the option of judicial intervention, citizens of Ohio are in essence being stripped of their First Amendment right and are prevented from hearing an unfettered debate of the issues.\u201d\n\nAnd the Justice and Freedom Fund, another of the nearly two dozen groups joining the SBA in the case, said: \u201cOhio has hand-delivered a powerful political weapon to candidates and other politically motivated individuals \u2026 [The law] expressly targets and stifles \u2018speech uttered during a campaign for political office\u2019 \u2013 exactly when the First Amendment has its \u2018fullest and most urgent application.'\u201d\n\nThe group continued: \u201cOhio\u2019s statutory scheme encourages manipulation because anyone can easily file a complaint and set the wheels of criminal prosecution in motion \u2013 then dismiss it when the election is over and the speech is politically irrelevant. This virtually guarantees not only that speech will be chilled during critical election times, but also that future constitutional injuries will evade review.\u201d\n\nSBA List said about 20 groups have filed documents in support of the its request that the state censorship law be struck down.\n\nA district court judge in 2014 had given SBA List the victory, ruling the Ohio statute is unconstitutional, but the state, insisting it can censor political statements, appealed.\n\nThe case originally dates to the 2010 election cycle and already has been before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIt was that year that SBA List wanted to post billboards regarding the pro-abortion vote of then-Rep. Steve Driehaus, a Democrat, when he supported Obamacare. SBA List said it was alarmed by the abortion funding in Obamacare, and Driehaus also opposed abortion funding but voted for the bill anyway. SBA List wanted to point that out.\n\nBut Driehaus contended there was no abortion funding in the law.\n\nSBA List was prevented from countering Driehaus\u2019 view by the threat of prosecution under Ohio\u2019s false statement law.\n\nDriehaus lost his re-election bid anyway, and later sued SBA list for defamation and loss of livelihood, but that case apparently came to an end last year when the 6th Circuit said his defamation complaint failed because the claim wasn\u2019t false.\n\nThat ruling said: \u201cGiven the debate prior to passage of the PPACA as to whether it includes taxpayer funding for abortion, the gist or sting of the statements appears to have at least some truth, to be substantially true, or to be subject to differing interpretations. Driehaus vocally opposed the PPACA because of his concerns about federal funding for abortions but he then voted for it anyway despite the absence of his desired language (the Stupak-Pitts Amendment) in the final version. The executive order adds language, but is not part of the PPACA and does not alter the statutory text. In fact, debate continues over the meaning and effect of the PPACA \u2026 For SBA List to overcome Driehaus\u2019s defamation claim, it is enough that the statements had some truth, were substantially true, or were subject to differing interpretations. Driehaus\u2019s own change of position demonstrates that they were.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the SBA List\u2019s case had been dismissed on claims the group did not have standing to challenge the law, a decision that ultimately the U.S. Supreme overturned.\n\nThat sent the case back to the district court, which awarded SBA List victory. The state, claiming its right to censor such ads, then appealed.\n\nWND reported the lower court\u2019s decision. Ohio District Judge Timothy Black found that Ohio could not issue judgments on what is true or false in political campaigns.\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom and Life Legal Defense Foundation, have said: \u201cFive years into Obamacare, it is now evident that SBA List\u2019s warnings were true. This law is forcing Americans to pay for abortions in numerous ways, and SBA List had a right to say so.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The left-leaning American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio has joined with conservative organizations such as the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence and the Justice and Freedom Fund in a case against the state of Ohio, which insists it has the right to censor campaign ads.
