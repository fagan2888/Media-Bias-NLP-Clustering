BERLIN, Vt. (AP) - A Waterbury woman who helped lead Vermont’s recovery from damage caused by flooding from Tropical Storm Irene was appointed Tuesday to become the state’s next transportation secretary, Gov. Peter Shumlin announced.

Sue Minter is currently the deputy secretary of the Vermont Transportation Agency. On Jan. 1 she will succeed Secretary Brian Searles, who is retiring after 40 years of public service.

Current Transportation Planning Director Chris Cole will become deputy secretary.

“They’ve been the team that has worked alongside Brian and all of the hardworking employees of transportation to get us to where we are,” Shumlin said in announcing the changes in front of two state plow trucks waiting for their next storm.

“Our recovery from Irene actually launched us into a new era,” Minter said at a ceremony at the agency’s central garage in Berlin. “It’s been a transformational time for our agency. We work as a team like never before, we have strong partnerships throughout state government and at the municipal level.”

Vermont also has been working to replace aging bridges, keep up with repaving the state’s roadways and improve the state’s rail system, she said.

Minter, a former Democratic state representative, has been Searles’ deputy since January 2011 when Shumlin first took office. After Irene, Shumlin named her the state’s recovery officer.

Searles previously served as transportation secretary from 1999 to 2003 under former Gov. Howard Dean.

Cole previously served a decade as general manager of the Chittenden County Transportation Authority.

Searles said he felt he was leaving the agency in good hands.

“One can stay in a job like this too long. I’m acutely aware of that,” Searles said. “The average tenure for secretaries of transportation in Vermont is about three years over the 40-year history of the agency. I’m in my eighth and it’s long enough.”
