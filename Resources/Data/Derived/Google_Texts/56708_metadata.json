CalPERS spends $8 billion annually on medical care for 1.4 million active and retired state and local government employees and their family members.\n\nAlmost half the price increase for HMO and PPO policies was the result of drug costs, according to CalPERS. Some of the priciest drugs for the agency, in terms of overall spending, were acid-reflux pill Nexium, asthma inhaler Advair and hepatitis C drug Sovaldi.\n\nThe higher costs at CalPERS might be further evidence of an acceleration in U.S. medical spending \u2014 after a historic slowdown in recent years. Experts see spending ramping up as the economy strengthens and more people obtain coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRecent U.S. census data show that health spending grew 7.3% in the first quarter of 2015 compared with the same period last year.\n\n\u201cFor many years, CalPERS has been a bellwether of which direction healthcare costs are heading,\u201d said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cTheir premium increases now add to a mounting body of evidence that costs are trending back up.\u201d\n\nBut Levitt and other health-policy experts don't see a return to the double-digit increases of the early 1990s because of efforts aimed at eliminating wasteful spending and rewarding quality care.\n\nU.S. workers have a lot at stake over rising insurance premiums because wages have remained fairly stagnant during the economic recovery.\n\nLike CalPERS, many large employers are weighing their health insurance options in preparation for open enrollment for employees this fall.\n\nThe Covered California exchange, which has more than 1.3 million individuals enrolled, is preparing to negotiate with health insurers, and 2016 rates will be announced next month. Many analysts expect rate increases to surpass this year's average boost of 4.2% statewide.\n\nThe CalPERS Board of Administration gave final approval to its 2016 rates Wednesday, and they take effect Jan. 1.\n\nAbout two-thirds of CalPERS members are enrolled in an HMO. Actual rates will vary by health plan and region.\n\nAnn Boynton, CalPERS' deputy executive officer for benefits, said the latest premium increases stemmed in large part from bigger pharmacy bills.\n\nShe said drug costs accounted for nearly 45% of the overall rate increases for both HMO and PPO plans.\n\n\u201cCalPERS endeavors to keep increases as low as possible for members while still providing quality healthcare, but pharmacy pricing presented a high hurdle to get over,\u201d Boynton said.\n\nThe agency listed some of its highest-cost drugs for 2014, and Sovaldi, the new hepatitis C drug priced at $1,000 a pill, was near the top.\n\nCalPERS said it spent nearly $40 million for Sovaldi on plans run by Blue Shield of California, Kaiser Permanente and CVS Health.\n\nThe high prices of specialty medications for hepatitis C, cancer and multiple sclerosis have drawn the ire of lawmakers, health insurers and patients.\n\nAmong the four biggest CalPERS plans by enrollment, Blue Shield had the biggest premium increase. Its NetValue HMO plan is going up 13.6%, on average, next year and its Access+ HMO is rising 6.9%.\n\nMia Campitelli, a spokeswoman for Blue Shield, said its rate increases were driven by an uptick in doctor visits, hospital admissions and high-cost specialty drugs such as Sovaldi.\n\nAnthem Blue Cross is raising rates by 11.8% for PERS Choice, the most popular PPO. The company declined to comment.\n\nKaiser's HMO has the largest CalPERS enrollment with more than 500,000 employees and dependents. Kaiser's premiums are going up 4.5%, on average, statewide.\n\nCalPERS also offers UnitedHealth, Health Net and Sharp Health coverage.\n\nFor retirees, CalPERS approved a new Medicare Advantage plan from UnitedHealth and eliminated Medicare coverage from Anthem, Blue Shield, Health Net and Sharp.\n\nAgency officials said the move could save $24 million if at least 40,000 members move into UnitedHealth's Medicare plan.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "CalPERS approves 7.2% increase in HMO rates as drug costs climb", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "One of the nation's biggest healthcare buyers, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, said its HMO premiums are rising by 7.2% next year as pharmacy costs climb.", "title": "CalPERS approves 7.2% increase in HMO rates as drug costs climb", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-calpers-health-rates-20150618-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5582de48/turbine/la-fi-calpers-health-rates-20150618", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "calpers, health insurance, anthem, kaiser, sovaldi", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83808344", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-06-18", "Description": "One of the nation's biggest healthcare buyers, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, said its HMO premiums are rising by 7.2% next year as pharmacy costs climb.
