The health law mandates the reductions for the quarter of hospitals that Medicare assessed as having the highest rates of \u201chospital-acquired conditions,\u201d or HACs. These conditions include infections from catheters, blood clots, bed sores and other complications that are considered avoidable.\n\nA total of 31 Florida hospitals will pay penalties for their combined HAC scores, the Kaiser analysis show. Penalized hospitals cross the state and vary from small, rural facilities to urban teaching hospitals. The 10 highest scores in the state came from:\n\n\u00b7 South Lake Hospital, Clermont\n\n\u00b7 Venice Regional Medical Center\n\n\u00b7 Broward Health Coral Springs\n\n\u00b7 Gulf Coast Medical Center, Lee Memorial Health System, Fort Myers\n\n\u00b7 Shands Jacksonville\n\n\u00b7 Ed Fraser Memorial Hospital, Macclenny\n\n\u00b7 Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami\n\n\u00b7 Manatee Memorial Hospital, Bradenton\n\n\u00b7 Lee Memorial Hospital, Fort Myers\n\n\u00b7 Tampa General Hospital\n\nSee a complete listing of Florida hospital scores here.\n\nThe penalties, which are estimated to total $373 million, are falling particularly hard on academic medical centers: Roughly half of them will be punished, according to the national Kaiser Health News analysis.\n\nDr. Eric Schneider, a Boston health researcher who has interviewed patient safety experts for his studies, said research has demonstrated that medical errors can be reduced through a number of techniques.\n\nBut \u201cthere\u2019s a pretty strong sense among the experts we talked to that they are not widely implemented,\u201d he said. Those methods include entering physician orders into computers rather than scrawling them on paper, better hand hygiene and checklists on procedures to follow during surgeries. \u201cToo many clinicians fail to use those techniques consistently,\u201d he said.\n\nThe penalties come as the hospital industry is showing some success in reducing avoidable errors. A recent federal report found the frequency of mistakes dropped by 17 percent between 2010 and 2013, an improvement U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell called \u201ca big deal, but it\u2019s only a start.\u201d\n\nEven with the reduction, one in eight hospital admissions in 2013 included a patient injury, according to the report from the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ.\n\nThe new penalties are harsher than any prior government effort to reduce patient harm. Since 2008, Medicare has refused to pay hospitals for the cost of treating patients who suffer avoidable complications. Legally, Medicare can expel a hospital with high rates of errors from its program, but that punishment is almost never done, as it is a financial death sentence for most hospitals. Some states issue their own penalties \u2014 California, for instance, levies fines as high as $100,000 per incident on hospitals that are repeat offenders.\n\nThe government has also been giving money to some hospitals and quality groups to help improve patient safety efforts.\n\nThe HAC program has \u201cput attention to the issue of complications and that attention wasn\u2019t everywhere,\u201d said Dr. John Bulger, Geisinger\u2019s chief quality officer. However, he said hospitals such as his now must spend more time reviewing their Medicare billing records as the government uses those to evaluate patient safety. The penalty program, he said, \u201chas the potential to take the time that could be spent on improvement and making sure the coding is accurate.\u201d Hospitals complain that the new penalties are arbitrary, since there may be almost no difference between hospitals that are penalized and those that narrowly escape falling into the worst quarter.\n\n\u201cHospitals may be penalized on things they are getting safer on, and that sends a fairly mixed message,\u201d said Nancy Foster, a quality expert at the American Hospital Association.\n\nHospital officials also point out those that do the best job identifying infections in patients may end up looking worse than others. \u201cHow hard you look for something influences your results,\u201d said Dr. Darrell Campbell Jr., chief medical officer at the University of Michigan Health System. \u201cWe have a huge infection control group, one of the largest in the country. I tell them to go out and find it.\u201d Campbell\u2019s hospital had a high rate of urinary tract infections but was not penalized because it had fewer serious complications than most hospitals, records show.\n\nThe penalties come on top of other financial incentives Medicare has been placing on hospitals. This year, Medicare has already fined 2,610 hospitals for having too many patients return within a month of discharge. This is the third year those readmission penalties have been assessed. This is also the third year Medicare gave bonuses and penalties based on a variety of quality measures, including death rates and patient appraisals of their care. With the HAC penalties now in place, the worst-performing hospitals this year risk losing more than 5 percent of their regular Medicare reimbursements.\n\nIn determining the HAC penalties, Medicare judged hospitals on three measures: the frequency of central-line bloodstream infections caused by tubes used to pump fluids or medicine into veins, infections from tubes placed in bladders to remove urine, and rates of eight kinds of serious complications that occurred in hospitals, including collapsed lungs, surgical cuts, tears and reopened wounds and broken hips. Medicare tallied that and gave each hospital a score on a 10-point scale. Those in the top quarter \u2014 with a total score above 7 \u2014 were penalized.\n\nAbout 1,400 hospitals are exempt from penalties because they provide specialized treatments such as psychiatry and rehabilitation or because they cater to a particular type of patient such as children and veterans. Small \u201ccritical access hospitals\u201d that are mostly located in rural areas are also exempt, as are hospitals in Maryland, which have a special payment arrangement with the federal government.\n\nThe AHRQ study found that the biggest decreases in errors among those it studied occurred in the two categories of infections Medicare used in setting the penalties. Central-line associated bloodstream infections decreased by 49 percent and catheter-associated urinary tract infections dropped by 28 percent between 2010 and 2013. By contrast, pneumonia cases picked up by patients on ventilators that help them breathe \u2013 a condition not covered by the new penalties \u2014 decreased by only 3 percent during the same period.\n\nSome of the errors on which the Medicare HAC penalties are based are rare compared to other mistakes the government tracks. For instance, AHRQ estimated that in 2013 there were 760,000 bad drug reactions to medicine that controls blood sugar in diabetics, but only 9,200 central-line infections. Infections from tubes inserted into urinary tracts are more common \u2014 AHRQ estimated there were 290,000 in 2013 \u2014 but those infections tend to be easier to treat and less likely to be lethal.\n\nOn the other measures, the study estimated there were 240,000 falls and more than 1 million bedsores.\n\nIn evaluating hospitals for the HAC penalties, the government adjusted infection rates by the type of hospital. When judging complications, it took into account the differing levels of sickness of each hospital\u2019s patients, their ages and other factors that might make the patients more fragile. Still, academic medical centers have been complaining those adjustments are insufficient given the especially complicated cases they handle, such as organ transplants.\n\nMedicare penalized 143 of 292 major teaching hospitals, the KHN analysis found. Penalized teaching hospitals included Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and Keck Medicine of USC in Los Angeles; Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta; Northwestern Memorial Hospital and University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago; George Washington University Hospital and Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cWe know some of the procedures we do \u2014 heart transplants or resecting cancerous portions of the esophagus \u2014 are going to be just more prone to having some of these adverse events,\u201d said Dr. Atul Grover, the chief public policy officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges. \u201cTo lump in all of those things that are very complex procedures with simple things like pneumonia or hip replacements may not be giving an accurate result.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of the penalties that Dr. Ashish Jha, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, conducted for KHN found that penalties were assessed against 32 percent of the hospitals with the sickest patients. Only 12 percent of hospitals with the least complex cases were punished. Hospitals with the poorest patients were also more likely to be penalized, Jha found. A fourth of the nation\u2019s publicly owned hospitals, which often are the safety net for poor, sick people, are being punished.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked in community hospitals, I\u2019ve worked in teaching hospitals. My personal experience is teaching hospitals are at least as safe if not safer,\u201d Jha said. \u201cBut they take care of sicker populations and more complex cases that are going to have more complications. The HAC penalty program is really a teaching hospital penalty program.\u201d\n\nMedicare levied penalties against a third or more of the hospitals it assessed in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Utah, Washington and the District of Columbia, the KHN analysis found.\n\nThe penalties are reassessed each year and Medicare plans to add in more kinds of injuries. Starting next October, Medicare will assess rates of surgical site infections to its analysis. The following year, Medicare will examine the frequency of two antibiotic-resistant germs: Clostridium difficile, known as C. diff, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, known as MRSA.\n\n--Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
