That being said, I am wondering if the federal government will supply the drug Modafinil to all of the hardworking American taxpayers who will be forced to pay for this expenditure. Modafinil is used on missions by the military to stay awake for extended periods of time.\n\nBy the look of things, the American taxpayers will need to work 24/7 to pay for this ridiculous proposal. Or better yet, maybe Clinton will have the paychecks of the hard working American taxpayers direct deposited to the federal government for said use.\n\nThe only news organization that reported this story was Fox News. Shortly afterward, Clinton back-pedaled and stated that she will give the illegals a chance to pay for their own Obamacare. She can fool some of the people some of the time, but definitely not all of the people all of the time. Of course, the taxpayers will again take it on the chin and be forced to pay for this. Wake up, America. Don't let her fool you.\n\nWanda Dietz\n\nFranklin Township", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Don't be fooled by Hillary Clinton", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "Hillary Clinton earlier announced, if elected, that she plans to give the 12 million illegal immigrants in this country free Obamacare.
