His bottom teeth were moving around \u201clike piano keys\u201d and he could barely eat or sleep. Eventually, the pain became so bad that he had to remove the teeth himself.\n\nAccording to a civil rights settlement announced this week, Michael Sanzo, 47, will receive $60,000 from the state for the \u201cunbearable pain\u201d that forced him to take drastic measures during his stint at High Desert State Prison in 2012.\n\n\u201cDue to the unbearable pain that the plaintiff endured, despite his repeated and desperate cries for help, the plaintiff was forced to smash out his teeth by punching himself in the face, other macabre means, and pulling the teeth out,\u201d the official court complaint reads.\n\nSanzo repeatedly begged for treatment for his infected teeth and gums, and penned several letters to staff about the pain.\n\n\u201c4 of my bottom teeth are ready to fall out \u2014 they are like \u2018weeble wobbles\u2019 I can\u2019t eat bareLy (sic) \u2014 and I\u2019m in bad pain \u2014 please hurry I need them pulled,\u201d he wrote the first time. His sixth letter, written three months later, said, \u201cI have had to cry myself to sleep in such pain! I have had to pull 6 of my own teeth cause the pain is sooooo unbearable \u2014 It\u2019s been 3 months now \u2014 please help me.\u201d\n\nInstead of offering assistance, the prison kept him locked away in isolation for a courtyard fight and told him over and over that he had to wait his turn for treatment.\n\nThe prison\u2019s dental assistance responded, \u201cAs I have explained before Mr. Sanzo you are in a lockdown unit. You are seen 1 at a time and share you (sic) time slot with 3 other lockdown units. We see everyone by order of their kite this being firm, fair, and consistant (sic).\u201d She also wrote, \u201cYou need to look at the big picture. A lot of inmates here.\u201d\n\nWitness accounts corroborated Sanzo\u2019s claims that he was neglected and denied pain medicine. Another inmate said he was \u201chaunted\u201d by Sanzo\u2019s \u201cghostly moans\u201d and screams.\n\nSanzo was transferred to Ely State Prison and treated three months after his first written complaint. He was ultimately given false teeth.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "His teeth were wobbling \"like piano keys.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "His teeth were wobbling \"like piano keys.\"", "title": "Nevada Prisoner Forced To Smash His Own Teeth Out", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/04/02/3765942/nevada-prisoners-forced-to-pull-out-teeth/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/02112635/high-desert-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "His teeth were wobbling \"like piano keys.\"", "creator": "@CarimahWheat", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/02112635/high-desert-321x214.jpg", "title": "Nevada Prisoner Forced To Smash His Own Teeth Out", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/02112635/high-desert-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/02112635/high-desert-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-02T11:41:25+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/carimahwritesstuff/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Justice Nevada Prisoner Forced To Smash His Own Teeth Out CREDIT: AP Photo/John Locher FILE - This April 15, 2015 file photo shows guard towers at High Desert State Prison in Indian Springs, Nev., one of Nevada\u0092s toughest prisons.\nA Nevada inmate languished in solitary confinement for eight months while prison staff ignored pleas for medical help.\nSanzo was transferred to Ely State Prison and treated three months after his first written complaint.\nSanzo repeatedly begged for treatment for his infected teeth and gums, and penned several letters to staff about the pain.\n\u201cDue to the unbearable pain that the plaintiff endured, despite his repeated and desperate cries for help, the plaintiff was forced to smash out his teeth by punching himself in the face, other macabre means, and pulling the teeth out,\u201d the official court complaint reads."}
