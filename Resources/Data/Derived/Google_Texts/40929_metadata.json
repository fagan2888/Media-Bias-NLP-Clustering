Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, would extend federal funding for Medicaid. The amendment has little hope of success but is likely to pop up in campaign advertisements against Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who faces a difficult reelection battle next fall. | Getty Senate votes designed to exact maximum political pain\n\nSenate Democrats and Republicans Thursday are breaking out their well-trod strategy of forcing each other to cast politically difficult votes, this time on amendments to a budget \"reconciliation\" bill that would repeal Obamacare. The amendments stand virtually no chance of being adopted, but they'll make for great campaign attack ads.\n\nMany are ripped straight from the headlines, including one Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid plans to offer on gun control, fueled by the Colorado Planned Parenthood shooting and just a day after the massacre in San Bernardino, California. It'll put heat on the four Republican senators running for president, as well as vulnerable GOP members up for reelection this year as Democrats try to take control of the chamber.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOther targets range from curbing corporate tax avoidance to suspending the issuance of visas for travelers from countries \"with a high risk of terrorism.\"\n\nAmong Senate procedures, the \"vote-a-rama\" is second perhaps only to the filibuster as a campaign tool. The stretch of roll call votes on amendments offers members a chance to bring pet issues to the floor and show up members of the opposite party, virtually risk-free. Consider them press release votes.\n\nTake an amendment from Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) to extend federal funding for Medicaid expansion. His office styled it as a move to \u201cprotect more than 600,000 Ohioans who gained coverage through the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion from Republican attacks on Medicaid.\" It\u2019s certain to pop up in a campaign advertisement against Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who is facing a tough reelection fight this cycle \u2014 even though it stands no chance of being attached to the legislation.\n\nReid is pushing a measure to ban people who have been convicted of threatening health clinics or places of worship from purchasing or owning guns. It's a flourish of political provocation that could only come from the man who once trolled Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) with an amendment denying senators health benefits if there was \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe they\u2019d solicited prostitutes,\n\nAlong the same lines, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) plans to force a vote on establishing a \u201cwomen\u2019s health care and clinic security and safety fund.\u201d Murray dredged up a 2012 campaign talking point, a \u201cBuffett tax\u201d on wealthy individuals, to cover the cost.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) will offer a measure that \"would suspend visa issuance for countries with a high risk of terrorism and impose a waiting period for background checks on visa issuance from other countries until the American people can be assured terrorists cannot enter the country through our immigration and visa system.\"\n\nIn another move inspired by recent headlines \u2014 this time about the record-breaking Pfizer-Allergan merger agreement announced last month \u2014 Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) is introducing a measure that would make it harder for American corporations to pick up stakes and move abroad to lower their tax bills. Brown\u2019s Medicaid amendment also targets such \"inversions,\" with a funding provision to end \"tax loopholes for companies that move investment overseas.\u201d\n\nSen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) is pushing a measure to repeal the unpopular Cadillac tax on high-end health care plans \u2014 even though the legislation he wants to attach that to would repeal the Affordable Care Act that includes the tax.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) is advancing a provision restoring a tax deduction for medical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of a taxpayer\u2019s income. The Affordable Care Act eliminated that deduction in 2010.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a tax deduction for rich people, this is a tax deduction for ordinary Americans who are going through very difficult times,\u201d said Toomey, who is also up for reelection this cycle.\n\nDemocrats faced a tough call on how to handle today's votes: A vote-a-rama just two months before the first primary gives them a chance to force politically touchy votes on the GOP just as campaign season kicks off in earnest. But the marathon session would have to be a sprint this time around, with Democratic lawmakers hoping to leave town around 7 p.m. to make an appearance at the Paris climate talks.\n\nSo Democrats are offering just a handful of amendments.\n\nDemocratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), for example, is not planning to reintroduce a minimum wage amendment he offered in March\u2019s marathon budget vote session. He called the reconciliation bill a \u201cwaste of time,\u201d since President Barack Obama has already threatened to veto the bill.\n\nJennifer Haberkorn contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Among Senate procedures, the &quot;vote-a-rama&quot; is second perhaps only to the filibuster as a campaign tool.", "title": "Senate votes designed to exact maximum political pain", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/senate-votes-budget-reconciliation-216403", "image": "http://static.politico.com/c2/7c/482af68e4d40b7a1e38cd1137558/151203-brown-votearama-gty.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Among Senate procedures, the &quot;vote-a-rama&quot; is second perhaps only to the filibuster as a campaign tool.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| Getty Senate votes designed to exact maximum political painSenate Democrats and Republicans Thursday are breaking out their well-trod strategy of forcing each other to cast politically difficult votes, this time on amendments to a budget \"reconciliation\" bill that would repeal Obamacare.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a tax deduction for rich people, this is a tax deduction for ordinary Americans who are going through very difficult times,\u201d said Toomey, who is also up for reelection this cycle.\nSen.
