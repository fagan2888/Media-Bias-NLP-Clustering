Gov. Corbett reprises role as teacher with college courses\n\nEmail Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters.\n\nLife has a funny way of taking people full circle, and no one knows that better than former Gov. Tom Corbett.\n\nAfter a legal career that included stints as an assistant district attorney, U.S. attorney and Pennsylvania attorney general, Corbett, who was elected governor in 2010, is back in the classroom.\n\nHe's teaching at St. Vincent College near Latrobe and the Duquesne University School of Law, reprising a role he played in 1972 when he taught history and civics to high school students in the Pine Grove School District.\n\nThe irony is not lost on the 66-year-old Shaler Republican.\n\nHe lost a hard-fought battle for re-election last November following a campaign in which his opponents cast him as an anti-education governor.\n\nIt would be hard to make that argument while watching Corbett \u2014 dressed in his signature dark suit, tie, white shirt and cuff links \u2014 take students through their paces on a dreary Wednesday afternoon in Room 204 as he teaches a Duquesne law class.\n\nHe smiles, cracks jokes about the process of bringing complex policy initiatives to fruition in Harrisburg, and engages in a brisk give-and-take with second- and third-year law students.\n\nThey are covering policy issues ranging from the state's role in crime and corrections, where he sought to reduce incarceration rates, to health care, where he battled mandates that were a result of Obamacare.\n\nAsked about the best part of teaching, Corbett doesn't hesitate: \u201cIt's the students. They're great. There's a real energy here.\u201d\n\nAt Duquesne, he can tap his experience in public life for a class on the law, public policy and the executive branch.\n\nAt St. Vincent, he can reach back to that, as well as his private-sector experience as counsel to Waste Management, for an undergraduate course in environmental law.\n\nMoving from public office to academia isn't unusual.\n\nOthers who have traveled that route include former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who is president of Purdue University; former Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, who became a professor of political science at Northeastern University; and former Oklahoma governor and U.S. Sen. David Boren, who is president of the University of Oklahoma.\n\nDuring a recent class at Duquesne, Corbett invited his former secretary of Transportation, Barry Schoch, to help explain how they moved his signature $2.4 billion transportation bill through a legislature that was reluctant to approve any tax increases.\n\nTheir secret for amassing votes?\n\nSpelling out the public safety and economic consequences of failing to act, and emphasizing the opportunities for lawmakers to be part of the effort to preserve and rebuild Pennsylvania's critical transportation infrastructure.\n\nDavid Zimmerman of Reading is among the more vocal students, questioning Corbett repeatedly about the process and staying after class to ask more questions.\n\n\u201cIt's not your typical law class,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cYou get to see and hear from people on the ground about how things are done in the real world.\u201d\n\nCorbett, who has banned recording in class, pulls no punches about the sometimes messy process of ushering initiatives through the legislature.\n\nDuquesne Law School Dean Ken Gormley, who approached Corbett about teaching shortly after the election last year, couldn't be happier.\n\nEver conscious of the need to present a balanced perspective, Gormley paired the former governor with Duquesne professors Joe Mistick and John Rago \u2014 staunch Democrats with backgrounds in state and local government \u2014 for a course titled \u201cLaw, Public Service and the Executive Branch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe response from students has been extremely enthusiastic,\u201d Gormley said.\n\nGormley said the former governor typically arrives on campus early and well-prepared for class.\n\nIt's like old times for Corbett and Mistick.\n\nThey met when Mistick was executive secretary to the late Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie Masloff and Corbett was U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The unlikely pair forged a strong partnership as they started \u201cWeed and Seed,\u201d an anti-drug program that debuted in Pittsburgh and became a template for similar efforts across the country.\n\nAt Duquesne, they take turns, sometimes prodding one another with inside jokes, offering students different perspectives and pointing out how some things never change in politics, regardless of which party rules.\n\n\u201cWe have a tradition here of training lawyers for public service, so this is right in our sweet spot,\u201d Mistick said.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to give something back,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cWhat I like about Duquesne is it's almost identical to my law school in San Antonio, St. Mary's. It was the working person's law school.\u201d\n\nIn a decade in the spotlight in Harrisburg, first as attorney general and then as governor, Corbett acknowledged that the pace back home, where he divides his time among the classroom, home-improvement projects and his wife, Sue, and their grandchildren, has its appeals. He is planning for next semester.\n\nThis fall, he is teaching with professor Gabriel Pellathy at St. Vincent.\n\nNext semester, Corbett will be on his own in the classroom, teaching \u201cState and Local Politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always thought I'd do this at some point. I thought that would be four years from now, but I guess God always has a plan,\u201d Corbett said, smiling.\n\nDebra Erdley is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
