This season he\u2019s averaging a double-double of 16.9 points and 10.1 assists per game, the latter of which is tied for the NBA lead, with Washington\u2019s John Wall.\n\nLawson\u2019s scoring average is the second-highest of his career. His shooting percentage of 44.7 is his best since 2012-13, and is so far stopping his career-long trend of declining shooting percentages.\n\nIn short, Lawson\u2019s playing the best basketball of his career.\n\nIn a point guard-rich league, consistent production like his is hard to find, and letting that go without a firm plan to replace him is not on the Nuggets\u2019 agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, shooting guard Arron Afflalo and forward Wilson Chandler continue to draw the most attention.\n\nPortland remains at the top of the list of teams that want to add Chandler, and that has been the case for weeks now. The Trail Blazers have consistently been most interested in dealing for the Nuggets\u2019 small forward as they look to add scoring to their bench.\n\nAfflalo has drawn considerable interest from Oklahoma City, according to Michael Scotto of Sheridan Hoops. That makes sense for the Thunder, which starts former Colorado star Andre Roberson at shooting guard and could use Afflalo either in that spot or as an additional scorer off the bench.\n\nThere are two days remaining until Thursday\u2019s trading deadline.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ty Lawson generating trade interest, but Nuggets plan to keep PG", "title": "Ty Lawson generating trade interest, but Nuggets plan to keep PG", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/17/ty-lawson-generating-trade-interest-but-nuggets-plan-to-keep-pg/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150217__ty-lawsonp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150217__ty-lawsonp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-17T12:16:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T00:36:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7b8\"", "article_summary": "Lawson has been the Nuggets\u2019 best \u2014 and steadiest \u2014 player over the past three seasons.\nSeveral teams have called the Nuggets about his availability, but Denver has turned them away, intent on keeping its veteran point guard, according to an NBA source.\nThere are players available for trades on the Nuggets\u2019 roster, but, for now, Ty Lawson isn\u2019t one of them.\nMeanwhile, shooting guard Arron Afflalo and forward Wilson Chandler continue to draw the most attention.\nThat makes sense for the Thunder, which starts former Colorado star Andre Roberson at shooting guard and could use Afflalo either in that spot or as an additional scorer off the bench."}
