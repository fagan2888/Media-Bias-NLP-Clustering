Ted Cruz \u2014 credited with leading the effort to shut down the federal government last fall \u2014 will visit Sarasota next month, adding to the area\u2019s growing national reputation for rolling out the red carpet for Tea Party icons.\n\nThe list of recent honorees includes Herman Cain, Sean Hannity and Donald Trump. And besides Cruz, a future guest will be Allen West.\n\nSuch figures contrast starkly with Sarasota County\u2019s long-standing reputation as a moderate GOP haven where more socially moderate Republicans could win elections with a fiscally conservative message. That image seems a distant memory with the ultra-conservative figures who have visited, promoting ideas including abolishing the IRS, shutting down the government and opposing any abortion rights.\n\nSarasota Republican Party chairman Joe Gruters said the more conservative speakers partly reflect some change in the local party.\n\n\u201cCertainly the party has gotten more conservative over the years,\u201d said Gruters, who has also brought U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and Haley Barbour here for speaking engagements.\n\nGruters said he knows some critics who will blast him for giving Cruz the local party\u2019s \u201cStatesman of the Year Award,\u201d a recognition that has virtually become a national drawing card for the Sarasota County GOP. Hannity got the award last year, and in 2012 it went to Trump. Gruters justified his latest move by saying Cruz is a star in the party who will be a big box-office draw.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a principled leader who fights for what he believes in,\u201d Gruters said, adding that the money made at the event will help fund the local party\u2019s efforts to boost Republican Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s re-election campaign this year.\n\n\u201cI know some people are going to love him coming, and some are going to think we are crazy for bringing him,\u201d Gruters said.\n\nBesides raising money with a big draw, landing Cruz is also about elevating the local party\u2019s stature nationally and helping Gruters appease a growing Tea Party wing of the local party leadership. In other Republican counties, party leaders have been slow to adjust to a growing Tea Party voice.\n\nBut Gruters has aggressively courted conservative guests who can help defuse potential unrest that could develop following a more diverse cast.\n\nDefunding, disrupting\n\nNo Republican has been more discussed over the last six months than Cruz.\n\nThe first-term Texan shot to national prominence in 2013 by leading an effort to defund the government as a way to force Democrats to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. While Cruz\u2019s effort ultimately failed, it gained him political cachet and put him on the short list of 2016 GOP presidential hopefuls.\n\nBut his rise has been disruptive, even for some other Republicans. Many see him as having upstaged Florida\u2019s own rising star, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who could be battling Cruz for the 2016 presidential nomination.\n\nIt was partly Cruz\u2019s shutdown effort that produced a Tea Party backlash against U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Longboat Key, for voting to reopen the federal government and avoiding the nation\u2019s default on its debts. One Tea Party group launched a Web campaign to recruit primary opponents to run against Buchanan and others who voted to reopen the government, declaring they had \u201ccaved\u201d while Cruz and other stood strong.\n\nState Sen. Nancy Detert, R-Venice, said she\u2019s not sure all those Gruters attracts reflect the area\u2019s true Republican leanings. But she said it may represent the GOP leadership within the local party.\n\n\u201cWe are not a Tea Party county, but it is a Tea Party executive committee,\u201d she said of the leadership panel that runs the local party.\n\nStill, Detert said Gruters is bringing in big names and giving Sarasota Republicans a chance to see national players up close, whether the rank-and-file membership supports a speaker\u2019s positions or not.\n\nUniversity of South Florida political science professor Susan MacManus, who frequently speaks in Sarasota to political and community groups, said the list isn\u2019t a proxy for the local party\u2019s leanings.\n\n\u201cIt says less about ideology and is more about promoting the party and showing its clout in the state,\u201d MacManus said.\n\nThe Sarasota GOP\u2019s ability to draw big names has certainly caught the attention of state party leaders and increased the local group\u2019s statewide credibility, MacManus said. Gruters said he\u2019s trying to be an equal-opportunity party leader. He said he\u2019s sought to convince New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. John McCain to visit, but also is working to get former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nDuring the 2012 cycle, he aggressively courted Mitt Romney and brought a more moderate Jon Huntsman in for what was likely his biggest event in Florida.\n\nGruters said his goal is simply to bring every big Republican name through to make Sarasota a mini-Iowa, a place where candidates with presidential ambitions feel obligated to test there mettle. The party\u2019s record underscores the region\u2019s importance in presidential politics, he said. Of the eight biggest Republican presidential contenders in 2012, only Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Texas Libertarian Ron Paul failed to visit Sarasota.\n\nSarasota Democrats say Cruz and the other speakers Gruters has courted represent a lurch to the extreme right for a party out of step with voters.\n\nPresident Barack Obama came within just 211 votes of winning Sarasota County in 2008 and Scott\u2019s 6,500-vote margin of victory in Sarasota was the lowest for a GOP gubernatorial candidate in 20 years. Sarasota County Democratic Party chairwoman Rita Ferrandino said she likes Gruters\u2019 picks because they contrast with the prominent names she has invited.\n\nThree days after Cruz speaks to the Sarasota Republicans, civil rights leader Julian Bond speaks to the Sarasota Democrats. Ferrandino also has brought other civil rights notables such as Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, and Eleanor Holmes Norton to speak at the local Democrats\u2019 annual fundraising dinner.\n\nGruters makes no apologies for giving Sarasota Republicans firsthand access to influential leaders.\n\n\u201cHe could be our next president,\u201d Gruters said of Cruz.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://politics.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/01/AP759880834252-crop.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Area is becoming known for rolling out the red carpet for Tea Party icons.", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf911\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are not a Tea Party county, but it is a Tea Party executive committee,\u201d she said of the leadership panel that runs the local party.\nSarasota Republican Party chairman Joe Gruters said the more conservative speakers partly reflect some change in the local party.\nThree days after Cruz speaks to the Sarasota Republicans, civil rights leader Julian Bond speaks to the Sarasota Democrats.\nIn other Republican counties, party leaders have been slow to adjust to a growing Tea Party voice.\nU.S. Sen.
