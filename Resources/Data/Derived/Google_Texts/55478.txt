Look out the window and you can see that it's time to bring the sled down from the rafters – or up from the basement – wax up the bottom and make sure the handles are tight.

OnMilwaukee.com is happy to provide you with a list of some of the best hills in the county, which are now covered with snow, children and some really big kids who haven't quite grown up yet.

You can hit the hills at any of the sledding spots listed below during the day, and then take advantage of the area parks' lighted hills if you're not quite ready to come in when the street lights come on.

Sledding Safety (from Milwaukee County Parks)

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommends the following safety guidelines:

Essential Safety Guidelines

Sled only in designated areas free of fixed objects such as trees, posts, and fences.

Children in these areas must be supervised by parents or adults.

All participants must sit in a forward-facing position, steering with their feet or a rope tied to the steering handles of the sled. No one should sled head-first down a slope.

Do not sled on slopes that end in a street, drop off, parking lot, river or pond.

Preferred Safety Guidelines
