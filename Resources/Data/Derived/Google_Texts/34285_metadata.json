Tom Graves and 42 House cosponsors introduced a budget plan Thursday to defund Obamacare without forcing a government shutdown, placing pressure solely on the shoulders of Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nGraves\u2019 Security, Stability, and Fairness Resolution is a continuing resolution budget bill that offers a fiscal year 2014 budget that keeps the government open but does not fund Obamacare. The Obama administration has already delayed the law\u2019s employer mandate until 2015, after the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nThe \u201cDefund Obamacare\u201d campaign spearheaded by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz has repeatedly been accused of seeking a government shutdown if Cruz\u2019s demands are not met. Graves\u2019 legislation relieves Cruz of that burden and puts Harry Reid in the crosshairs.\n\n\u201cAs it relates to Obamacare, it would accomplish exactly what Sen. Cruz has advocated from the beginning \u2014 to fund the government without funding Obamacare. It is an important step forward, we hope the House quickly acts to stop Obamacare,\u201d Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told The Daily Caller, noting that Cruz is still reviewing the legislation in its entirety.\n\nUtah Sen. Mike Lee, who is one of the main ringleaders of Ted Cruz\u2019s \u201cDefund Obamacare\u201d campaign, supports Graves\u2019 plan, saying, \u201cThe House should pass this legislation immediately and send it to the Senate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what we\u2019ve been talking about from day one,\u201d Lee\u2019s communications director Brian Phillips told TheDC. \u201cThere has never, ever, ever been any proposal from Ted Cruz or Mike Lee to shut down the functions of government. That was just the media. There\u2019s no sneaky vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a [continuing resolution] that funds every section of government except Obamacare,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Harry Reid at this point. If the House passes it, the only thing standing in the way of funding the government is Harry Reid. If he doesn\u2019t take it to a floor vote in the Senate, then he\u2019s the one responsible for a shutdown scenario.\u201d\n\n\u201cCruz would absolutely support it,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nSen. Reid\u2019s office did not immediately return a request for comment, but he does not appear to be in a bipartisan mood.\n\nReid\u2019s office re-tweeted a parody movie poster from the Senate Democrats Thursday afternoon headlined, \u201cShutdown 2,\u201d featuring Cruz and Lee.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Republican Rep.
