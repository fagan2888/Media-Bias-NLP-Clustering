Some doctors and nurses in Boston have noticed this can pose particular challenges at the end of life, where the undocumented do not have access to nursing facilities or hospice care.\n\nSome health care providers are stepping in to help these undocumented and dying individuals.\n\n\u2018This Place Is Special\u2019\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your breathing been feeling?\u201d the nurse asks. \u201cTake a deep breath. Has the pain gotten any better?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I tolerate it better,\u201d Kervin Alleyne says, reassuring his nurse that the bone pain he feels is manageable.\n\nAlleyne is dying of metastatic prostate cancer, but he is not one to complain.\n\nHe looks around the room at the three other hospital beds, and then out the window to the concrete and traffic of Boston\u2019s South End.\n\n\u201cOne of the best places that a person could ever be,\u201d he says. \u201cThis place is great. This place is special. Trust me. Trust me.\u201d\n\nBefore arriving at this special place, Alleyne was staying in a homeless shelter.\n\nBut for the past year he\u2019s been at the Barbara McInnis House. It has over 100 medical beds for homeless individuals.\n\n\u201cWe help individuals who are too sick to be in shelters or on the streets but not sick enough to actually warrant a medical bed in a hospital,\u201d explains Denise De Las Nueces, the McInnis House medical director.\n\nUsually homeless patients are discharged after about a dozen days \u2014 when they are healthy enough to go back to the streets.\n\nBut what about homeless patients who are dying?\n\nMaking An Exception\n\nIf the patient has citizenship or immigration documents they usually go to a nursing facility or a hospice.\n\nBut Alleyne, who is 67, is an undocumented immigrant from Trinidad. That means he is largely barred from public health insurance options and can only get access to emergency services.\n\nDe Las Nueces says for the undocumented and dying, the McInnis House has started making an exception because the patients have nowhere else to go.\n\n\u201cWe really provide end-of-life care for individuals who really have no other options in terms of where they can have a dignified death,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd many of those patients are individuals who are undocumented and therefore have limited insurance or no insurance at all.\u201d\n\nDe Las Nueces says this isn\u2019t too common, but there has been a steady trickle of undocumented, homeless and dying patients.\n\nThis prompted the whole McInnis House medical team to get end-of-life care training.\n\nCheryl Kane, the director of nursing at the McInnis House, says the medical staff often provides more than just medical care.\n\n\u201cThings the family members might usually do, we take on that role,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat are your wishes at the end of your life? Setting up the cremation form, working with the funeral home. Maybe where family members might sit with the patient when somebody is actively dying, we do that.\u201d\n\nKane says it\u2019s an honor to provide such care but ultimately hopes these individuals will have somewhere else to go.\n\nImmigrant activists say it\u2019s unlikely that undocumented immigrants will gain access to public health programs soon. Advocates are currently focusing their resources on maintaining the right of documented immigrants to access state health insurance.\n\nKervin Alleyne says given that he is undocumented, homeless and terminally ill he feels blessed to have found a place to stay and to die.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this report misspelled Kervin Alleyne\u2019s last name. We regret the error.\n\nEarlier:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Undocumented immigrants in Massachusetts do not have access to most public health insurance programs, which can pose particular challenges at the end of life.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Undocumented immigrants in Massachusetts do not have access to most public health insurance programs, which can pose particular challenges at the end of life.", "title": "McInnis House Provides End-Of-Life Care For The Undocumented And Homeless", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/06/undocumented-health-care-mcinnis-house", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/06/0610elleyne-620x390.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/06/undocumented-health-care-mcinnis-house", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/06/0610elleyne-620x390.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "McInnis House Provides End-Of-Life Care For The Undocumented And Homeless"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-06-10", "date": "Tue, 10 Jun 2014 06:16:33 -0400", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc678\"", "article_summary": "McInnis House Provides End-Of-Life Care For The Undocumented And HomelessThe roughly 160,000 undocumented immigrants in Massachusetts do not have access to most public health insurance programs.\nCheryl Kane, the director of nursing at the McInnis House, says the medical staff often provides more than just medical care.\nThis prompted the whole McInnis House medical team to get end-of-life care training.\nBut for the past year he\u2019s been at the Barbara McInnis House.\nDe Las Nueces says for the undocumented and dying, the McInnis House has started making an exception because the patients have nowhere else to go."}
