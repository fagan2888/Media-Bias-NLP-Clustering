He says that the hackers repeatedly were logging into the networks, bogging them down and overloading them.\n\n\"It's like a traffic jam, it floods the services to access, not necessarily sensitive information, but just to get on the network,\" Linthicum said, \"so when a legitimate user tires to get on, there are so many attempts to access, that you cannot get on.\" He says that the hackers are not accessing information like credit cards but rather bottling up the system and disrupting service.\n\nThe networks were taken down on Christmas Eve and for some, there is still no connectivity.\n\nXbox One consoles appear to be working like they should and Sony PlayStation 4 units are slowly coming back online.\n\nThe group Lizzard Squad has claimed they are the reason for the shut down.\n\n12-year-old Espon Dziewulski received a $700 setup with a PlayStation and five games. Most of the games cannot be played or have limited access when it comes to functionality. \"All I can do is sit there and try to mess around with out, trying to get it to work and it doesn't ever work,\" Dziewulski said. He and his mother are frustrated and want the people who took the network down to be held responsible.\n\nMore information from Sony can be found by clicking here.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Sony PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles are coming back online after hackers disrupt services for days.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "Sony PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles are coming back online after hackers disrupt services for days.", "title": "PS4 & XBox One networks slowly coming back online", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/PS4--XBox1-are-slowing-coming-back-online-286939091.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/242/749/2427498171A448D9B9BF364978B28A16", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C66/B5C/C66B5CAE84784C7D99D0FC621F626806.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Sony PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles are coming back online after hackers disrupt services for days.", "title": "PS4 & XBox One networks slowly coming back online", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/PS4--XBox1-are-slowing-coming-back-online-286939091.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/playstation_controller_mgn_320.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "PS4 & XBox One networks slowly coming back online", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "PS4  XBox One networks"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb89\"", "article_summary": "Xbox One consoles appear to be working like they should and Sony PlayStation 4 units are slowly coming back online.\nMore Video...Christmas for gamers was ruined for many who use the Sony PlayStation 4 or Xbox One gaming consoles after hackers take down the networks required for many games to function.\nHe says that the hackers repeatedly were logging into the networks, bogging them down and overloading them.\nHe says that the hackers are not accessing information like credit cards but rather bottling up the system and disrupting service.\nThe networks were taken down on Christmas Eve and for some, there is still no connectivity."}
