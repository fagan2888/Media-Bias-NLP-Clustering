Jaycee Chan, 32, the son of Hong Kong’s well-known action movie star Jackie Chan, has been indicted by Chinese authorities on charges related to drugs.

He was detained more than four months ago on a charge of sheltering others to use drugs, The Associated Press reported.

On Monday, he was indicted and now faces up to three years in prison if he is convicted, AP said.

Mr. Chan and Taiwanese movie star Ko Kai were arrested in August and tested positive for marijuana, Beijing police said, AP reported. They also reportedly admitted using the drug, while authorities confiscated 3.5 ounces of it from Mr. Chan’s apartment.

It’s not clear when Mr. Chan’s trial will start.
