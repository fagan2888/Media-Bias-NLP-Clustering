In elementary school, it was mostly listening to a fifth-grader attempting to coax sound \u2014 any sound \u2014 out of a trumpet, the timer set to make sure the required 20 minutes were filled.\n\nThere was a concert or two, and being polite to the former in-laws. In middle school, the theme was parades: making sure the boy made it to the meeting spot, watching for the green-and- white Sabin Middle School banner, then trying to get pictures of my marcher once I found his curly head in the moving formation.\n\nIt was never getting tired of \u201cThe Imperial March (Darth Vader\u2019s Theme)\u201d from \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d and \u201cSecret Agent Man\u201d as they took form in my living room and of watching the band members make their way down streets during Veterans Day, the Festival of Lights, St Patrick\u2019s Day, and the Apple Blossom Festival parades, year after year.\n\nIn eighth grade, there was jazz band, and the awful minutes waiting for my boy\u2019s solo: Would he hit all the notes?\n\nNow he\u2019s in high school. In the spring, there are concerts, once with an original composition, my son and all the other trumpeters rising at the end to sound a thrilling fanfare, the evocation of the triumph of effort. And in the fall, it\u2019s all about marching band. \u201cParades?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, we do them, but parades are boring. It\u2019s the performances that count!\u201d\n\nAnd they do. Suddenly, I\u2019m driving to the high school for a 5:30 a.m. call. Every weekend there\u2019s an event at some high school stadium, where you sit in baking sun or howling wind, waiting, watching for the five or 10 minutes when your child\u2019s band performs its piece and, well, a sort of dance routine.\n\nAs many as 70 girls and boys dress up in uniforms designed to look like those of Napoleonic armies, complete with feathered hats that require their own boxes. They make hundreds of careful, almost mincing, choreographed steps, creating circles, squares, diamond formations and lines. They\u2019re joined by teams of students dancing with huge flags, deliberately flowing and graceful to contrast with the ram-rod vertical of the instrumentalists.\n\nHigh schools field all kinds of groups. At a recent competition, a sparse mountain town band bravely negotiated a version of Dvorak\u2019s symphony \u201cFrom the New World,\u201d a little unevenly, but their last fortissimo iteration of \u201cGoing Home\u201d still brought tears to my eyes.\n\nA band from Albuquerque, huge and synchronized, practically invaded in their retelling of World War II, complete with a short outtake of the \u201cday of infamy\u201d broadcast, and dancers dressed in enchanting period costumes. This year, my son\u2019s group lounged against split rail fences as a soloist sounded the final notes of \u201cSimple Things,\u201d ending their rendition of Copeland\u2019s \u201cAppalachian Spring.\u201d Then, as one, the members sprang into a band pose and marched slowly off the field.\n\nWhen I tell my European friends about all this, they respond with slightly patronizing smiles. That\u2019s not surprising. The best musical performance I heard on a recent visit to Prague was from a cello quartet, whose studied nonchalance (and untucked shirts, and bare feet) belied the thousands of practice hours that underlaid their technical proficiency. And that was just a show for the tourists on Charles Bridge. This band thing is a very American art, steeped in its unique mixture of effort and bling, unabashedly kitschy and tear-evoking in its earnestness.\n\nI love being a band parent.\n\nEva Syrovy teaches school in in Colorado Springs.
