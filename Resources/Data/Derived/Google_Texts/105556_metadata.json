Richard Haro/The Coloradoan)Buy Photo\n\nNeither of Colorado\u2019s U.S. senators pay their interns, but as the dog days of summer hit \u2014 which is prime time for internships \u2014 both offices say the experience makes up for it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s generally a good professional development activity because of the experience you get and what you learn and the networking you can do, on its own,\u201d said Adam Bozzi, a spokesperson for Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet\u2019s office. \u201cIf interns do good work here, we want to help them succeed, and whatever we can do to help, we\u2019ll do.\u201d\n\nPaying interns would put a limit on how many opportunities the office can offer, Bozzi said. They typically have between 80 and 100 interns a year, most of them in Washington.\n\nAnna Perks, a former intern for Bennet in Colorado Springs and Denver, said her year with the office was a good learning experience. She put in a few days a week during and immediately after her senior year of college during the especially tumultuous time when the Affordable Care Act was working its way through Congress.\n\n\u201cWe took a lot of calls from that and answered questions because there was a lot of concern about it at that time,\u201d Perks said.\n\nBennet and Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Udall have deadlines approaching for their internship programs: July 31 for a spot in Udall\u2019s Colorado office and Aug. 15 for Bennet\u2019s Washington, D.C., office. Both note the temporary positions are unpaid in the listings.\n\nAlex McCarthy, a spokesperson for Udall\u2019s office, said the office aims to hire interns with third-party stipends or who are participating in a D.C. study program. The office also works to get interns academic credit.\n\nBozzi said Bennet\u2019s office works with students on a case-by-case basis if hardships might prevent them from taking advantage of the opportunity.\n\n\u201cIf there are hardships and an intern is not going to be able to take the position because of those hardships, we\u2019ll certainly work with the intern,\u201d he said.\n\nA flood of lawsuits against private companies rolled out in 2013 after it was ruled some unpaid internships violated labor laws.\n\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act lays out guidelines about whether interns must be paid or not. Key among the criteria for not paying them: The internship must be for the benefit of the intern, to the point that the operations of the business \u201cmay actually be impeded.\u201d\n\nJason Surbey, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Labor, said some exceptions exist. Unpaid internships for nonprofits and government agencies are \u201cgenerally permissible,\u201d provided the volunteer intern goes into it without expectation of payment. However, enforcement of employment rules for legislative branch employees, including interns, falls on Congress.\n\nMost senators, or 65 of them, don\u2019t pay their interns, according to a 2013 article in the Atlantic. Several who do pay their interns have some qualifications, such as only paying summer interns and not spring or fall, or offering a stipend or academic credit. Others only have a handful of paid slots with other interns going without.\n\nIt did not analyze intern pay for members of the House of Representatives.\n\nOffices for Reps. Jared Polis, D-Boulder, and Cory Gardner, R-Yuma, did not respond to requests from the Coloradoan about their internship programs. Gardner is campaigning to claim Udall\u2019s Senate seat.\n\nRepresentatives for the senators said each internship office operates a bit differently, but primary among interns\u2019 tasks are answering calls from constituents and helping with events. Those in Washington have the additional opportunity to lead tours of the Capitol and sit in on congressional hearings. Interns at hearings can help draft policy memos as well, albeit with supervision from paid staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a learning experience, no matter what,\u201d Bozzi said.\n\nPerks learned how constituent information is received and processed, and it helped her see how change happens in government \u2014 two tidbits that help with her job as zero waste field organizer and event coordinator with Eco-Cycle Inc. in Boulder. While educational, she said two grants from her college \u201cdefinitely helped\u201d during her time interning.\n\nPerks remembers constituents yelling at her over the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and learning patience and the ability to deal with a variety of calls while paid staffers mentored her. She also wrote \u201ca lot of thank you notes,\u201d did legislative work on the national heritage trail and some casework.\n\nBozzi called interns \u201ca great help\u201d to people in the office and constituents but added the office would function smoothly without them.\n\nInterns often balance their work with classes or a part-time job. Both offices said they try to be as flexible as possible.\n\nMcCarthy, of Udall\u2019s office in Washington, didn\u2019t respond to several questions sent via email, including if there was concern that not paying interns limited who could pursue them.\n\nBozzi said his office\u2019s flexibility with financial support aims to make sure the pool is as diverse as possible. Like Udall\u2019s office, Bozzi said he targets Coloradans.\n\n\u201cGenerally, we try to have a diverse cross section both in economically and socially,\u201d as well as being from different parts of the state, he said. He encouraged anyone interested to apply and not let hours or finances deter them.\n\nBennet doesn\u2019t have a formal stance about unpaid internships at private companies, Bozzi said, and guessed it would be case specific.\n\n\u201cIt would depend on the industry, what the duties of the interns are,\u201d Bozzi said. \u201cBusinesses need to comply with the law, of course. I think case-by-case would be the way to look at that.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy did not say what Udall\u2019s stance is. She called their program \u201ca professional training opportunity\u201d and added that \u201cmany of our staffers, in fact, started out as congressional interns.\u201d\n\nU.S. Department of Labor\u2019s test for unpaid interns\n\n\u2022 The internship must be similar to training in an educational environment.\n\n\u2022 The experience is for the benefit of the intern.\n\n\u2022 The intern does not displace regular employees and works under close supervision of staff.\n\n\u2022 The employer of the intern does not derive an immediate advantage from the intern\u2019s activities and, on occasion, its operations may actually suffer.\n\n\u2022 The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job after the internship.\n\n\u2022 Employer and intern understand that intern is not entitled to wages during the internship.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://noconow.co/1rGnJVy", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Offices welcome scores of young adults throughout summer and school year.", "og": {"site_name": "Coloradoan", "description": "Offices welcome scores of young adults throughout summer and school year.", "title": "Bennet, Udall don\u2019t pay their interns", "url": "http://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/local/2014/07/25/bennet-udall-pay-interns/13194915/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/coloradoan.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Offices welcome scores of young adults throughout summer and school year.", "creator": "@coloradoan", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eefb303ecceebe5416a144fcee803b1bda9cdbd7/c=288-0-1911-1623&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/FortCollins/2014/07/25/-ftc0727-ggunpaidinterns.jpg20140723.jpg", "title": "Bennet, Udall don\u2019t pay their interns", "site": "@coloradoan", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743847167", "fb": {"app_id": 140942715960163}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2090\"", "article_summary": "Most senators, or 65 of them, don\u2019t pay their interns, according to a 2013 article in the Atlantic.\nAlex McCarthy, a spokesperson for Udall\u2019s office, said the office aims to hire interns with third-party stipends or who are participating in a D.C. study program.\nLike Udall\u2019s office, Bozzi said he targets Coloradans.\nBozzi said Bennet\u2019s office works with students on a case-by-case basis if hardships might prevent them from taking advantage of the opportunity.\nSeveral who do pay their interns have some qualifications, such as only paying summer interns and not spring or fall, or offering a stipend or academic credit."}
