It\u2019s really good.\n\nAt one point, Bachmann, who has embraced Tea Partyers big time, claims that 30 million Americans will be kicked off their employer\u2019s insurance once Obamacare goes into effect. Blitzer tells her \u201cthat\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nHe really nails her in this interview. The best part is during the first half when he simply won\u2019t let her get away with her crazy off-topic meandering. She refuses to answer the questions, and is very good at deflecting. But he simply wouldn\u2019t let her get away with it. Typically, TV reporters ask a question twice, let you deflect twice, and then move on. He didn\u2019t.\n\nNow, of course, in the end Bachmann still refused to answer a single question. And normally you\u2019d simply write off someone like this as \u201ccrazy, but irrelevant.\u201d But Bachmann is mainstream in Republican circles, at least the circles that run the party. And that\u2019s because the rest of the Republican party refuses to stand up to its own nuts the way Blitzer did to Bachmann. And as a result, we all pay the price for the GOP\u2019s inability to police its own and stop its party from veering dangerous, and perhaps permanently, to the far right.\n\nFollow @aravosis", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wolf Blitzer interviewed Tea Partyer Michele Bachmann right before the government shutdown, and really stood up to her madness.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "AMERICAblog News", "description": "Wolf Blitzer interviewed Tea Partyer Michele Bachmann right before the government shutdown, and really stood up to her madness.", "title": "Wolf Blitzer unleashes Michele Bachmann's inner crazy (video)", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/michele-bachmann-obamacare-shutdown.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-24T22:18:17-04:00", "url": "http://americablog.com/2013/10/wolf-blitzer-unleashes-michele-bachmanns-inner-crazy-video.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wolf Blitzer interviewed Tea Partyer Michele Bachmann right before the government shutdown, and really stood up to her madness.", "creator": "@aravosis", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/michele-bachmann-obamacare-shutdown.jpg", "title": "Wolf Blitzer unleashes Michele Bachmann's inner crazy (video)", "site": "@americablog", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "p": {"domain_verify": "6a65cadbb06b6a8cd2795a412c36d6b4"}, "fb": {"admins": 504024627}, "google-site-verification": "LrdwJVMR_suty6YsOZ4xc1Hv3-F8Ms0Wo-VhCAoXm_U", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AMERICAblog", "published_time": "2013-10-25T07:00:27-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aravosis", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-10-24T22:18:17-04:00", "tag": "Wolf Blitzer"}, "news_keywords": "CNN, government shutdown, Michele Bachmann, Obamacare, Tea Party, Wolf Blitzer"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c74\"", "article_summary": "Typically, TV reporters ask a question twice, let you deflect twice, and then move on.\nWolf Blitzer interviewed Michele Bachmann right before the government shutdown, and I\u2019m sorry I missed the interview.\nAnd that\u2019s because the rest of the Republican party refuses to stand up to its own nuts the way Blitzer did to Bachmann.\nThe best part is during the first half when he simply won\u2019t let her get away with her crazy off-topic meandering.\nBlitzer tells her \u201cthat\u2019s not true.\u201dHe really nails her in this interview."}
