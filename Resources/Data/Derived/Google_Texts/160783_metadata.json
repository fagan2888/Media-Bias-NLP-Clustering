By analyzing medical records, the researchers determined that about four percent of the women were underweight at birth. Similarly, six percent were born unexpectedly small.\n\nThe team found that women with fertility problems attributable to a female factor were 2.5 times more likely to have been born with LBW compared to women whose fertility issues were attributable to a male factor or unexplained. The same women were also three times more likely to have been born SGA. The association persisted after the researchers controlled for previous motherhood, current weight, and other factors known to influence fertility.\n\nNumerous past studies have explored the possible consequences of LBW. In a 2011 study from the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, researchers showed that people who are underweight at birth may have an increased risk of obesity later in life. Similarly, a study from the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing found the prevalence of autism to be higher in LBW babies.\n\nVikstrom and colleagues wrote that several factors may underpin the association between LBW, SGA, and female fertility problems. One possibility is that growth restriction in the womb may come to the detriment of reproductive organs, affecting function later in life.\n\nAlthough the sample size was relatively small, the team believes that the findings warrant further investigation. \"As medical research and care advances, more infants will be born [with low birthweight or small size] and survive, which in turn might influence future need of infertility treatment,\" they concluded.\n\nSource: Vikstrom J, Hammar M, Josefsson A, Bladh M, Sydsjo G.
