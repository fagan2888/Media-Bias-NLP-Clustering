Jose Kevo\n\nA Michigan elementary school is enforcing a new \u201cno tag, no chasing\u201d policy following growing concerns over possible injuries. The controversial decision is accompanied by a letter clarifying the risks associated with \u201crunning in packs, pushing, knocking other children over, and making the game dangerous.\" Failure to comply is met with removal from play and a letter home.\n\n\"We want our children to treat each other with respect, kindness, and with safety in mind,\" said Ginger Smith, community relations manager for the K-5 Zeeland, Mich. public school that currently serves 425 students.\n\nAccording to school officials, the rule is in place to limit the dangers of rough play among younger students. They hope that a ban on popular, \"dangerous\" games like push-tag will cause students to gravitate towards safer alternatives.\n\n\"Yesterday we took the entire kindergarten group and modeled the correct expectations for appropriate recess behavior and demonstrated examples of safe, fun play,\" school officials wrote in a letter. \"All students at New Groningen are expected to treat others with respect and kindness. When a negative behavior is recognized, the staff handles each situation with care and concern.\"\n\nAlthough the ban has not yet been subject to any direct complaints, at least one parent has contacted the media about the new policy, MLive reported.\n\nRegulating Play\n\nThe school\u2019s safety effort is the latest in a long line of attempts to regulate play among students. In 2011, the New York State Health Department ran a short-lived campaign against whiffle ball, dodgeball, capture-the-flag, horseshoes, and other games considered to pose \u201csignificant risk to injury.\u201d However, after vehement opposition from lawmakers, the department decided to scrap the proposal.\n\nSome opponents believe that such legislature will impose undue burdens on youth organizations promoting exercise. After school programs and team sports running \u201cdangerous\u201d games would need to conform to the same expensive safety regulations as summer camps. For many organizations, hiring a medical professional and a director with a bachelor\u2019s degree would be unfeasible.\n\nOthers claim that the games themselves are not inherently dangerous, and that most can be perfectly safe with proper instruction. Calzet Liburd, program director at Playworks, said that injuries occur when kids don\u2019t know how the game is played.\n\n\"Part of the danger during play is because kids don't know how to play certain games. No one is teaching them,\u201d he said, speaking to LiveScience. \"So they're coming up with their own ways based on what they see on TV or what they hear.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "school bans tag, rough play ban, dodgeball ban, dangerous play, tag risks, recess play risks, calzet liburd playworks", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A K-5 elementary school has decided to outlaw tag, chasing, and other types of \"dangerous\" play in an attempt to promote safety.", "title": "Elementary School Bans Tag, Rough Play To Promote Safety", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/elementary-school-bans-tag-rough-play-promote-safety-should-school-officials-regulate-play-259130", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/06/recess.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A K-5 elementary school has decided to outlaw tag, chasing, and other types of \"dangerous\" play in an attempt to promote safety.", "title": "Elementary School Bans Tag, Rough Play To Promote Safety", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/elementary-school-bans-tag-rough-play-promote-safety-should-school-officials-regulate-play-259130", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/06/recess.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/06/recess.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-10-06T20:30:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-06T20:34:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A K-5 elementary school has decided to outlaw tag, chasing, and other types of \"dangerous\" play in an attempt to promote safety."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd437\"", "article_summary": "School officials said that the ban on rough play is an attempt to promote safer alternatives.\nAccording to school officials, the rule is in place to limit the dangers of rough play among younger students.\n\"Yesterday we took the entire kindergarten group and modeled the correct expectations for appropriate recess behavior and demonstrated examples of safe, fun play,\" school officials wrote in a letter.\nAfter school programs and team sports running \u201cdangerous\u201d games would need to conform to the same expensive safety regulations as summer camps.\nJose KevoA Michigan elementary school is enforcing a new \u201cno tag, no chasing\u201d policy following growing concerns over possible injuries."}
