At one point, Mr. Kronenfeld lived in a nine-bedroom mansion and drove a fleet of luxury cars; newspaper reporters dug up testimony from an addiction counselor who said that Mr. Kronenfeld \u201cdid not have a gambling addiction. He had a lifestyle addiction.\u201d\n\nThe recent indictment stems from $12.9 million in gambling IOUs that were promised to the Green Valley Ranch resort in Henderson and to the Venetian resort on the Las Vegas Strip more than five years ago.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
