Democrats conflicted over the direction of their party and of the country under their party\u2019s current leadership should strike, he says.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 a voter strike. What the Democratic Party needs most from its loyal members, he says, is a boycott of the next few elections.\n\n\u201cEven if the polls completely collapsed regarding our party, those who control the party would never step down, except to \u2018raise up\u2019 people who believe the same things they do, and who will lead the same way. That\u2019s the problem,\u201d writes Just in an exclusive column on WND today.\n\n\u201cOnly regular Democrat voters can force a real change in our party leadership with a voter strike over the next few elections. One election is not enough,\u201d he adds.\n\nJust perhaps is best described as a traditional Democrat who doesn\u2019t bend to fringe interests. He\u2019s a veteran national radio talk-show host, has worked with his \u201cold friend\u201d Sean Hannity on the best-seller \u201cDeliver Us from Evil\u201d and guest-hosted his top-rated radio show. He is founder of several Oregon-based organizations, including the nationally acclaimed Concerned Fathers Against Crime.\n\nJust starts his commentary: \u201cI am ashamed of my party. But it goes deeper than shame. I am afraid of what my party has become over the last two decades. And judging by the polls, I\u2019m guessing there are millions of Democrats who feel the same unease I feel.\n\n\u201cAs 2016 approaches, it has never been more important for mainstream Democrats to draw a line by not voting Democrat. You don\u2019t have to vote Republican; just let your \u2018no-vote\u2019 send a message to our local, state and national leaders. If even a small percentage of each major Democrat voting block were to join the protest, it would force the party to take a hard look at itself, or at least start a healthy discussion.\u201d\n\nHe says today\u2019s party has become \u201csomething unrecognizable to those of us who remember the Democratic Party of President Kennedy.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cSomething ruinous on an epic scale controls our party. And only Democrats can do something about it \u2013 with a no-vote protest.\u201d\n\nJust takes readers on a quick guided tour, documenting the strange transformation of the Democratic Party in recent decades \u2013 from the emergence of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d on college campuses to the major influence of Saul Alinsky on both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nNoting that Clinton was a \u201cstudent\u201d of Alinsky, Just cited the \u201ccommunity organizing\u201d founder\u2019s published desire \u201cfor a future where the means of economic production will be owned by all of the people instead of the comparative handful.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo independents and Republicans reading this,\u201d comments Just, \u201ctrust me \u2013 that\u2019s not a regular Democrat talking. That\u2019s Marxism, straight up.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur leadership problem doesn\u2019t end with Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama,\u201d Just writes. \u201cThe sad truth is that our party apparatus has been taken over by political correctness \u2013 PC \u2018radicals\u2019 who share Alinsky\u2019s basic Marxist worldview, his desire for class warfare and radical \u2018change.\u2019 Our party leaders support, or at least tolerate, the use of Alinsky\u2019s aggressive \u2018no rules\u2019 techniques against mainstream America \u2013 basic bullying strategies,\u201d Just writes.\n\n\u201cIt may be that President Obama\u2019s disastrous leadership will be the wake-up call we needed to realize the wrong people are running our party. At this point we must know something is terribly wrong. It\u2019s hard to ignore President Jimmy Carter\u2019s recent decision to step forward and publicly reject President Obama\u2019s handling of Iraq.\u201d\n\nJust recalled that not that long ago, the Democratic and Republican Parties had far more similarities than differences.\n\n\u201cThink of famous Democrat Sen. Patrick Daniel Moynihan, who as a young social scientist and deputy secretary of labor in 1965 warned the country about the devastating effect fatherless families were having on the African-American community,\u201d Just writes. \u201cHe was called a racist for that prophetic warning, which if heeded, could have prevented so much misery \u2013 not only among blacks, but also among whites and Hispanics who are now following the same self-destructive path.\u201d\n\nHe concludes: \u201cMainstream Democrats have to decide if this is what we want to support when we vote Democrat. \u2026 Do we really want to be forced to accept a creed that\u2019s entirely \u2013 entirely \u2013 different than the beliefs of our parents and grandparents and great grandparents?\u201d\n\nRead Bob Just\u2019s column, \u201cDemocrat voter strike.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "With midterms around the corner, Barack Obama\u2019s popularity at a stunning all-time low, Democrat candidates avoiding Obama like Ebola and hundreds of audience members actually walking out during a presidential campaign appearance, it\u2019s a rough time for Democrats.
