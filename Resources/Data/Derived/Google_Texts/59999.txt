Pine Ridge, SD

An Oglala Sioux tribal member is trying to grow industrial hemp again on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.



Alex White Plume and his family planted hemp on his Pine Ridge farm from 2000 to 2002, but never harvested a crop. Federal agents conducted raids and cut down the plants.



Now that the federal Department of Justice has laid out guidelines for tribes who want to grow and sell marijuana, White Plume wants to try again. But he first has to get federal authorities to lift a restraining order keeping him from planting industrial hemp on his Pine Ridge farm.



White Plume says his attorneys are working to see the restraining order lifted and believes hemp could be an appropriate form of economic development.
