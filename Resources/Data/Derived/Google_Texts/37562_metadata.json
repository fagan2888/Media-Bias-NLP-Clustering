Lloyd Austin stunned lawmakers when he said the U.S. train and equip had only \u201cfour or five\u201d graduates still in the field. The command has since upped that number to around 70.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power defended the ongoing effort in an interview this weekend but admitted it hasn\u2019t gone as smoothly as planned.\n\nRelated: As Russian Weapons Stream In, How Far Will Putin Go in Syria?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously even more complex, I think, than we would have envisioned,\u201d she said Sunday on ABC\u2019s This Week.\n\nThe program is sure to be discussed when President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet in New York during the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nMoscow has rapidly expanded its military presence in the country, creating an airbase near the city of Latakia. On Sunday, Russia announced it had struck a deal to share intelligence from the ISIS fight with Iran, Iraq and Syria, surprising the Obama administration.\n\nIn an interview with CBS and PBS that was released by the Kremlin, Putin derided the Syrian rebel program as illegal.\n\nRelated: 12 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To Syria\n\n\u201cIn my view, providing military aid to illegitimate organizations contravenes the principles of international law and the U.N. Charter,\u201d he said, according to an excerpt. \u201cWe back only legal government entities,\u201d he added.\n\nPutin mocked the effort, encapsulating its various failures.\n\n\u201cThe initial aim was to train 5,000 to 6,000 fighters, then 12,000, but it turns out that only 60 were trained and only four or five are actually fighting,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the others simply ran away with their American weapons to Islamic State.\u201d\n\nPatience for the program may be wearing thin on Capitol Hill, as well.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said last week\u2019s incident \u201cis confirmation that U.S. policy may unwittingly be furthering this catastrophic endgame\u201d and called on the administration to suspend the effort.\n\n\u201cEmpowering al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria would be a disastrous side effect of the Syrian train and equip program. The only thing worse than Bashar al-Assad staying in power is for him to be replaced by an al Qaeda backed regime,\u201d Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Monday in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s troubled $500 million program to train Syrian rebels to fig", "title": "U.S. Program to Train Syrian Rebels Is Nearing Meltdown", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/28/US-Program-Train-Syrian-Rebels-Nearing-Meltdown", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09102015_Syrian_Rebel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/28/US-Program-Train-Syrian-Rebels-Nearing-Meltdown", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09102015_Syrian_Rebel.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s troubled $500 million program to train Syrian rebels to fig", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc31e\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration\u2019s troubled $500 million program to train Syrian rebels to fight Islamic State militants is veering towards complete meltdown.\n\u201cEmpowering al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria would be a disastrous side effect of the Syrian train and equip program.\nIn an interview with CBS and PBS that was released by the Kremlin, Putin derided the Syrian rebel program as illegal.\nRelated: Why Congress Won\u2019t Cut the Failed $500 Million Program to Fight ISIS in Syria\"If accurate, the report of [New Syrian Forces] members providing equipment to al-Nusra Front is very concerning and a violation of Syria train and equip program guidelines,\u201d Colonel Patrick Ryder said, in a statement.\nThe program is sure to be discussed when President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet in New York during the U.N.
