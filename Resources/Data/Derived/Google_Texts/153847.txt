WASHINGTON — Republican lawmakers may try to use must-pass government spending legislation to block President Barack Obama’s plans to increase the number of Syrian refugees entering the U.S.

Pressure to do so follows Friday’s deadly attacks in Paris.

Congress is facing a Dec. 11 deadline to approve a spending bill to keep the government running. Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama released a letter on Monday saying the legislation should require congressional approval for the president’s refugee resettlement plans and the money needed to carry them out.

New House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin tells conservative talk host Bill Bennett on Monday that he’s looking at all options.

In September the White House announced plans to accept an additional 10,000 refugees from Syria, with no congressional approval needed.
