The agreement reached July 14 will see Iran reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent and cut its number of centrifuges with which to enrich more uranium by two-thirds. In exchange, Iran will see the immediate easing of $100 billion worth of international sanctions that have battered its economy. Congress has 60 days to review the agreement.\n\n\u201cIf 99 percent of the world community and the majority of nuclear experts look at this thing and they say: \u2018This will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb,\u2019 and you are arguing either that it does not or that, even if it does, it\u2019s temporary, or that because they\u2019re going to get a windfall of their accounts being unfrozen, that they\u2019ll cause more problems, then you should have some alternative to present. And I haven\u2019t heard that,\u201d President Obama told reporters at the White House one day after the agreement was announced.\n\n\u201cAnd the reason is because there really are only two alternatives here: Either the issue of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon is resolved diplomatically through a negotiation, or it\u2019s resolved through force, through war. Those are\u2014those are the options,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nThe success in the nearly two-year-long Iranian nuclear negotiations came just one week after two soaring personal domestic victories for the president\u2014the Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 decision upholding the Affordable Care Act (ACA or \u201cObamacare\u201d), and his moving, commemorative eulogy for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a Black South Carolina state senator and the pastor of Charleston\u2019s Emmanuel AME Church who was slain with eight other parishioners in his church by a White supremacist, Confederate sympathizer.\n\nVice President Joseph Biden, who served for 35 years in the U.S. Senate, was at work immediately after the deal was announced telephoning and then visiting senators, and listening to their concerns about distrust of Iran. The administration will need at least 34 senators to support the agreement to sustain Mr. Obama\u2019s veto, if legislation is adopted to block it. A two-thirds majority would be required in both houses to override a veto and disapprove the agreement.\n\nDemocrats \u201care getting a lot of pressure from constituents who are suspicious of any agreement,\u201d Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) said, according to Politico. Mr. Obama \u201chas his hands full.\u201d Republicans in the Senate and the House, as well as GOP presidential candidates are almost universally opposed to the deal.\n\nFormer Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who served in the Senate from New York and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), both, joined Mr. Biden early, registering their support for the agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose past warnings about Iran\u2019s supposed nuclear capacity have contradicted the findings of his own spy agency, called the deal a \u201chistoric mistake. And Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran, because Iran continues to seek our destruction. We will always defend ourselves,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said according to published reports.\n\nBut Defense Secretary Ash Carter was in Israel with offers of more defense aid immediately after the agreement was reached. \u201cFriends can disagree but we have decades of rock-solid cooperation with Israel,\u201d Sec. Carter told reporters traveling with him. Among the proposals Mr. Carter was expected to discuss is a 50 percent increase in U.S. military aid to the Zionist state, increasing the gift from $3 billion per year to as much as $4.5 billion per year.\n\nBut while many Republican, Jewish, and conservative politicians oppose the agreement, a majority of Jews in both the United States and Israel support it, according to Jackie Goldberg, who served in the California State Assembly, on the Los Angeles City Council, and as president of the Los Angeles Unified School Board. \u201cFifty-nine percent of American Jewish people back the agreement,\u201d Ms. Goldberg told Margaret Prescod on KPFK-FM\u2019s \u201cSojourner Truth Radio.\u201d\n\nThat information was revealed in \u201ca poll by \u2018J Street,\u2019 the centrist, liberal voice of American Jews\u2014not J-Pac, which is the Netanyahu wing, and certainly not Jews for Peace which is a much more progressive wing\u2014this is kind of a mainstream group who did a poll and found that the deal was a good idea.\n\n\u201cThe same poll gave Obama a 56 percent job approval rating, for example. What this business of Netanyahu saying that somehow it\u2019s bad for Israel and then you wake up and find out that the United States has offered to increase military (aid) to Israel by a billion and a half (dollars per year). How is that going to help anything?\u201d Ms. Goldberg said.\n\nInvestigative journalist Gareth Porter agreed. \u201cThe biggest news in the #IranDeal text is what isn\u2019t there: the content of the new Security Council resolution & its arms embargo language,\u201d Mr. Porter, who recently returned to this country after two weeks in Vienna where the agreement was negotiated said in a statement released by Washington\u2019s Institute for Public Accuracy. \u201cU.S. arms manufacturers have already exploited #IranDeal for $6 billion in new arms contracts with Gulf regimes,\u201d said Mr. Porter who is author of Manufactured Crisis: The Untold Story of the Iran Nuclear Scare.\n\nThe real \u201cuntold story\u201d about the Middle East nuclear race is the fact that Israel already possesses atomic weapons, according to Grant Smith, director of the Washington-based Institute for Research: Middle Eastern Policy. \u201cThis whole idea of talking about a nuclear arms race in the Middle East without admitting who\u2019s racing is bizarre. You can\u2019t talk about a race without admitting that some have not only left the starting line, but have lapped the field,\u201d Mr. Smith said in a statement released by the Institute for Public Accuracy.\n\nMr. Smith reported that the \u201cU.S. Confirmed (the) Existence of Israeli H-Bomb Program in 1987.\u201d That report states: \u201cThe 1987 report\u2019s confirmation of Israel\u2019s advanced nuclear weapons program should have immediately triggered a cutoff in all U.S. aid to Israel under the Symington and Glenn Amendments to the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act.\n\n\u201cUnder two known gag orders\u2014punishable by imprisonment\u2014U.S. security-cleared government agency employees and contractors may not disclose that Israel has a nuclear weapons program. GEN-16 is a \u2018no-comment\u2019 regulation on \u2018classified information in the public domain.\u2019 \u2018DOE Classification Bulletin WPN-136 on Foreign Nuclear Capabilities\u2019 forbids stating what 63.9 percent of Americans already know\u2014that Israel has a nuclear arsenal.\u201d\n\nAll the while, Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal\u2014estimated at between 60 to 400 nuclear weapons has been virtually ignored. Unlike Iran and all the Arab countries, Israel is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Still, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu continues his country\u2019s charade. \u201cToday a terrorist nuclear superpower is born, and it will go down as one of the darkest days in world history,\u201d he said after the agreement was announced.\n\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re really seeing is an attempt to make it appear that somehow or another that we don\u2019t have Jewish support for this, when in fact, nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d Ms. Goldberg continued. \u201cEven in Israel, a majority of Israelis support the pact. The most important issue is that it really does stop the attempt to build a nuclear weapon by Iran. It stops it. It stops it dead cold. And it would have the most stringent and intrusive inspections in monitoring history, of any regime in any time in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident this agreement is a road to peace,\u201d Ambassador Seyed Hossein Mousavian told Pacifica Radio\u2019s \u201cDemocracy Now!\u201d He\u2019s an associate research scholar at Princeton University\u2019s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, former diplomat who, from 1990 to 1997 served as Iran\u2019s ambassador to Germany. From 1997 to 2005, he was head of the Foreign Relations Committee of Iran\u2019s National Security Council.\n\n\u201cThe big issue, as President Obama said, the agreement prevented a war, could (have been) disaster for the U.S., for Iran, for the region and for international community. Second, the deal has closed all possible pathways toward possible militarization, weaponization of Iranian nuclear program. The U.S. and the West, they were worried if Iranian nuclear program in the future would divert toward weaponization. That\u2019s why President Obama\u2019s red line was zero nuclear bomb, no nuclear bomb,\u201d said Mr. Mousavian.\n\n\u201cThis red line was welcomed in Tehran very much, because Iranians, they believe and they were reiterating they have never been after nuclear bomb, and they would be ready to give every assurances that the Iranian nuclear program will remain peaceful forever. After 23 months of tough negotiations, they have finalized 159 pages, which would cover the American red line, which is no nuclear bomb,\u201d Ambassador Mousavian said.\n\nIn addition, the agreement could result in substantial benefits to the American population, according to Dr. Gerald Horne, who holds the Moores chair of History and African American Studies at the University of Houston. Dr. Horne told Margaret Prescod: \u201cThe deal is potentially transformative. If all things work out properly, you\u2019ll see an unleashing of a tidal wave of Iranian petroleum on the market. The price of gasoline at the pump in the United States might fall nationally to $2.25 per gallon, which is like a wage increase for U.S. workers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to wound Texas, because whenever the price of energy goes down, the most conservative state is wounded, and that also happens to be the main opposition to Barack Obama, and not to mention world peace in general. It will further weaken the Saudi\u2019s oil weapon,\u201d Dr. Horne said. \u201cVice President Biden let the cat out of the bag last year when he noted correctly that the Gulf Arabs\u2014particularly the Saudis\u2014are the main supporters of ISIS, which the United States is sworn to fight.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Horne is concerned that Congress may override Mr. Obama\u2019s expected veto, scuttling the agreement. But the president has another important legislative ally in his corner, House Minority Leader Pelosi. \u201cThe historic nuclear agreement announced today is the product of years of tough, bold and clear-eyed leadership from President Obama. I commend the president for his strength throughout the historic negotiations that have led to this point. I join him in commending Secretary Kerry and Secretary Moniz for their leadership,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWithout a deal, we risk even more war in the Middle East,\u201d the president warned at his news conference, \u201cand other countries in the region would feel compelled to pursue their own nuclear programs, threatening a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc916\"", "article_summary": "The Final Call | World NewsOutraged over U.S.- Iran deal, Israel gets billion dollar pay offBy Askia Muhammad -Senior Editor- | Last updated: Jul 23, 2015 - 9:04:55 PMWhat's your opinion on this article?\nAnd Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran, because Iran continues to seek our destruction.\n\u201cThe historic nuclear agreement announced today is the product of years of tough, bold and clear-eyed leadership from President Obama.\nAnd I haven\u2019t heard that,\u201d President Obama told reporters at the White House one day after the agreement was announced.\nsecurity-cleared government agency employees and contractors may not disclose that Israel has a nuclear weapons program."}
