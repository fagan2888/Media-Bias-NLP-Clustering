At that point, the default is supposed to be scrubbed from the borrower\u2019s credit report.\n\nBut problems with the department\u2019s debt management system were so severe after the system upgrade that it was not able to process a single loan rehabilitation between September 2011 and March 2012, according to the GAO. It took until January 2013 for the department to clear a backlog of rehabilitated loans.\n\nThe GAO report faults the department for not fully testing the system before it went live and also for failing to properly oversee its system contractor, Affiliated Computer Services, a Xerox subsidiary.\n\n\u201cDespite known risks, such as concerns about the contractor\u2019s unreliable performance on previous system development efforts, [the] Education [Department] did not have plans for monitoring the upgrade,\u201d Emrey-Arras said.\n\nThe department\u2019s inspector general, Kathleen S. Tighe, has previously sounded the alarm on problems with the department\u2019s debt management system.\n\nAnd in testimony before the House higher education subcommittee on Wednesday, Tighe appeared to strike a tone of exasperation with the department\u2019s handling of the issue, saying she remains concerned about the agency\u2019s \u201capparent lack of oversight and monitoring of this system.\u201d\n\nShe said her office had spent nearly $1 million looking into problems related to the debt management system and had designated it a top priority.\n\nIn addition, Tighe said the department had not yet provided an \u201cacceptable\u201d corrective action plan for making sure the debt management system becomes \u201cfully operational,\u201d a recommendation her office first made in December 2012.\n\nShe also said that despite the department\u2019s original claim that it had completed all corrective actions related to the debt management system, it wrote in its most recent annual report that work on four recommended improvements was, in fact, still in progress.\n\nJames Runcie, the chief operating officer of the department\u2019s Federal Student Aid office, acknowledged previous challenges with the debt management system but also defended the department.\n\nHe said that the loan rehabilitation functions had been \u201cfully restored,\u201d and pointed to record collection rates on student loans as evidence the system was functioning effectively.\n\nHe also said that the department had fined the contractor that completed the system upgrade.\n\nOversight of Debt Collectors\n\nEmrey-Arras, the GAO official, said her staff also found problems with how the department oversees the several dozen companies it hires to collect student loan debts.\n\nThe department\u2019s own quarterly reviews of its collection agencies have identified a range of problems, she said, including agencies providing borrowers with misleading information. In one instance, the department found that a collection agency incorrectly told a borrower that a debit card was required to rehabilitate a loan.\n\nBut, while the department documents and informs the collection agency of such problems, it does not make sure that those collection agencies actually make any changes to their practices, Emrey-Arras said.\n\nTighe, the inspector general, expressed similar concerns about the department\u2019s contracted debt collectors. She noted that her office last year found that the department was doling out bonus and incentive payments to the contractors based only on their estimates and without asking for documentation.\n\nRuncie said in written testimony that the department had strengthened its oversight of the debt collectors and developed a database to track errors.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/03/13/gao-cites-serious-weaknesses-federal-oversight-debt-management-system", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Education Department's oversight of its debt management system has been lacking, say Congressional investigators and the agency's own inspector general.", "title": "GAO cites 'serious weaknesses' in federal oversight of debt management system"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "The Education Department's oversight of its debt management system has been lacking, say Congressional investigators and the agency's own inspector general.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "follow, index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5cc4\"", "article_summary": "The department\u2019s inspector general, Kathleen S.
