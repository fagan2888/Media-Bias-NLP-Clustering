Staffing may create a stumbling block for health care executives as the field attempts to transform how care is delivered, according to a survey of health care human resource executives.

Less than one-fifth of health care HR executives indicated that from their perspective, health care workers always are demonstrating a commitment to patient satisfaction, according to the survey, which was conducted by the American Society for Human Resource Administration and the company HealthcareSource.

About 68 percent of respondents said frontline staffers usually demonstrate such a commitment, 11 percent said sometimes and 2 percent said occasionally.

That was the biggest surprise to come out of the survey, says Dawn Rose, executive director of ASHHRA. That number would be expected to be much closer to 100 percent, Rose says.

There are also signs that organizations could do more to prepare for the changes that are coming, according to the survey. Just 57 percent of respondents believe their organizations are being proactive in adapting to the changing environment, while only 47 percent believe their recruitment methods are effective.

There’s a disconnect in that CEOs often say they recognize that talent management is important, but the application of resources to develop talent may lag, Rose says. “They’re not investing in the technologies, talent or processes” that are going to attract the best candidates, she says.

In particular, creating a brand that’s attractive to both patients and employees is a challenge for the field, which tends to neglect the employee part of the equation. “Health care could be moving faster on that front,” Rose says.

The survey results should draw attention given the role HR professional play. “Health care HR people are frequently the eyes and ears of the organization,’ Rose says.
