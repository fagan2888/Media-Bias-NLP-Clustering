In Iowa, 84 percent of caucus-goers aged 17 to 29 supported Sanders.\n\nIdealism is a wonderful quality. It flourishes most strongly in those who lack memory of what has gone before. Having never been burned by a politician they believed in, they are free to \u201cfeel the Bern.\u201d And so they do.\n\nPolling shows that Hillary Clinton is perceived as stronger than Sanders on every issue, from the economy and health care to immigration and terrorism. But doubts about her honesty undercut respect for her knowledge and experience. No excuses, here; it\u2019s the price of personal decisions made, from the private e-mail server Clinton kept as secretary of state to the huge sums of money she took for speeches to Wall Street bankers.\n\nWhat is known about Sanders suggests he can\u2019t be bought and stands by his convictions. But there are other ways to assess honesty \u2014 like how candid he is about his ability to turn convictions into policy. The Washington Post editorial board called him out on this and he didn\u2019t like it. But he owes it to supporters to do more than urge them to \u201cthink big.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who listen reverently to Professor Sanders lecture on Wall Street immorality and the influence of money on politics should apply some critical thinking to his pronouncements. If those evil economic forces are as potent as Sanders proclaims, how will he vanquish them?\n\nPresident Obama helped bail out Wall Street and the auto industry. His top economic advisers came from the investment banking world. Yet, as others have noted, Obama\u2019s political enemies still branded him a socialist who longed to redistribute wealth. And they thwarted much of what he hoped to accomplish in Congress. The Affordable Care Act, which falls far short of Sanders\u2019 goal for health care reform, passed without a single Republican vote.\n\nImagine what those same political enemies would do to a president who, like Sanders, welcomes the \u201csocialist\u201d label and crows about his desire to shift wealth from rich to poor.\n\nSanders is asking his supporters to trust him when he says he can deliver free college tuition, single-payer health care, a $15 per hour minimum wage, affordable child care for all, and lower drug prices. How will he do it? By imposing a tax \u201con Wall Street speculation,\u201d he said in Keene, as if that could happen with the wave of a presidential wand. By the way, he also plans to stop the Koch brothers and end institutional racism.\n\nBut, of course, he\u2019s leading a revolution. If it carries him to the White House, Wall Street bankers will bow to the will of the people and start offering up their bonuses to help pay off some kid\u2019s college debt. Republicans, too, will see the error of their ways, and stop trying to do what Sanders said they want to do: \u201ccut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy.\u201d\n\nIn Bernie, his supporters trust.\n\nHe owes them more honesty about how hard it will be to deliver on his promises.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.2284031825", "eomportal-id": 347544, "description": "Those who listen reverently to Bernie Sanders lecture on Wall Street immorality and the influence of money on politics should apply some critical thinking to his pronouncements.
