But this year, in this valley, is different.\n\nSeveral of the valley\u2019s biggest special districts are holding elections today. Four of those districts are asking voters to tax themselves. Here\u2019s a look at what districts are voting and how to cast ballots \u2014 it\u2019s too late to mail a ballot, of course, but most still have drop-off options.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the revenue questions:\n\nGypsum Fire Protection District\n\nDistrict officials say they\u2019ve been hit hard by a drop in assessed value over the past several years \u2014 district revenues dropped more than 50 percent starting in roughly 2010 and 2011, with only a modest return as property values have increased.\n\nDistrict officials say they\u2019re operating with old equipment, and often need to search internet auctions for parts for the newest truck, which was made by a manufacturer no longer in business.\n\nThe property tax hike in the valley\u2019s most geographically large district equates to about $84 per year on a home with an assessed value of $300,000.\n\nThis is a mail ballot election, but ballots can be dropped off at either the fire station in Gypsum or at the Edwards office of Marchetti & Weaver, 28 Second St., Unit 213.\n\nEagle County Health Service District\n\nThis is the ambulance district for the entire valley \u2014 that means just about all of us can vote. Supporters of a property tax increase say the district now faces annual budget deficits of about $1.8 million, due to new reimbursement rates in the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe proposed increase is about $30 per year on $500,000 in assessed value.\n\nThe district also has two spots up for election on the five-member board of directors. Incumbents Jeff Kingston and Todd Goulding are running, as is Gypsum resident Pam Schultz.\n\nThis is a mail ballot election, but ballots can be dropped off today at Marchetti & Weaver.\n\nEagle River Fire Protection District\n\nThis is another big district, with boundaries from the top of Tennessee Pass down U.S. Highway 24, then through the valley between Dowd Junction and Wolcott. It doesn\u2019t include Vail.\n\nThis district is asking for a property tax increase to fund three major projects:\n\n\u2022 A new public safety facility in Avon that would be shared with the Avon Police Department. That project could break ground this year.\n\n\u2022 The fire station in Edwards was built as a \u201ctemporary\u201d structure 30 years ago. It needs to be replaced. Work could begin in 2017.\n\n\u2022 The district would also like to build a training facility in Minturn. That project doesn\u2019t have a firm start date.\n\nThe new headquarters is touted as a necessary improvement for both police and fire. Those separate departments are now working out of facilities built in the late 1970s. The new building, near the main Avon Interstate 70 interchange, would speed response times to much of town, supporters say.\n\nThe total request is for $25 million in construction work.\n\nThis increase would add about $47 per year to the tax bill on a home with an assessed value of $500,000.\n\nBallots can still be dropped off at Marchetti & Weaver.\n\nTown of Avon\n\nThe town isn\u2019t required to do this, but is asking voters for approval to help fund the new public safety building. The question asks voters for permission to issue certificates of participation to fund $6.5 million of the new building\u2019s cost. Those certificates would be paid from current town revenue sources.\n\nDrop your ballots at town hall.\n\nEdwards Metropolitan District\n\nThis district, which covers the middle of the Edwards area and the vast majority of its commercial space, is asking voters for a 1 percent sale tax increase. That tax would generate money for matching funds for several projects along U.S. Highway 6 and the Edwards Spur Road. Those roads are both maintained by the Colorado Department of Transportation, which requires local matching funds for any improvements.\n\nIf approved, the 1 percent levy would last until 2040, at which point the tax would drop to 0.5 percent. Beyond funding various intersection projects, the sales tax is also being eyed for trails and other projects.\n\nThe district is also holding a board election, with four people seeking three seats. Incumbents William Simmons and Kara Heide are incumbents seeking re-election. John McCaulley and Kelly Malin are also seeking seats on the board.\n\nDrop your ballots at Marchetti & Weaver.\n\nBoard elections\n\nSeveral of the valley\u2019s districts are also holding elections for their respective boards of directors. Here\u2019s a look at who\u2019s running and how many seats are available:\n\nEagle-Vail Metropolitan District\n\nThis election has generated the most letters to the editor in this newspaper. Voters will choose three members of the five-member board.\n\nDarlynne Littman, Patti Sills, David Warner and appointed incumbent Chuck Toms are running for two available four-year seats.\n\nCarl Luppens, Moses Gonzales, Ruth Borne and Kim Bell Williams are seeking the two-year seat.\n\nBallots can be dropped off at Marchetti & Weaver.\n\nVail Recreation District\n\nThis election will ask voters to select two members to serve four-year terms on the five-member board. Incumbent Bill Suarez is running for re-election. Roland Kjesbo, Stephen Connolly, Brian Rodine and Rodney Johnson are also seeking seats.\n\nCurrent board member Jeff Wiles is leaving.\n\nThis is a polling-place election, with voting in the Grand View Room, atop the Lionshead parking structure.\n\nWestern Eagle County Metropolitan Recreation District\n\nThis is a board election for the district, and there are several candidates for three four-year terms and one two-year term.\n\nJohn McCaulley was appointed to a seat in 2015 and is seeking election for the first time. Robert Ladd is running for a second term. The remaining candidates are Chris Williams, Mikayla Curtis, Christopher Pryor, Elizabeth Jones and Michael Woodworth. Candidates for the two year term are Brian Paul Collett and Michael McCormack.\n\nThis is a polling-place election. Voters can cast ballots at the Eagle County Health Services Building in Edwards, the Eagle Pool & Ice Rink in Eagle and Gypsum Recreation Center. Ballots can also be dropped off at Marchetti & Weaver.\n\nVail Daily Business Editor Scott Miller can be reached at 970-748-2930, smiller@vaildaily.com and @scottnmiller.", "article_metadata": {"description": "EAGLE COUNTY \u2014 Special district elections often pass without much notice.
