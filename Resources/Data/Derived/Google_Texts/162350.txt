One person is dead and three others were injured in an Aurora crash Saturday morning, officials said.

The two-vehicle crash happened at East 6th Avenue and Tower Road, said Aurora Fire Rescue Captain Mike Ackman.

A sedan with three people inside was eastbound on the two-lane section of 6th Avenue when it passed another vehicle into oncoming traffic, said Aurora Police traffic spokesman Sgt. Chris Carleton.

The sedan crashed head-on with an SUV that was traveling west.

The driver of the sedan was killed, Carleton said. The two people inside the sedan were taken to a hospital with serious injuries. One person from the SUV was also taken to a local hospital.

While details on the victims were not yet available, Carleton said no children were involved in the crash.

This is a developing story that will be updated as more information becomes available.
