Still, that is a staggering amount to charge the arm of a publicly supported research institution in a state with the country\u2019s second highest unemployment rate.\n\n\u201cAnything we can do to focus attention on UNLV, that\u2019s extremely important to do, and this certainly will focus attention on UNLV, and that\u2019s why they have these people come,\u201d Reid finally stammered to reporters after being asked if he thought the fee was a good use of money by the foundation, according to The Las Vegas Review-Journal. He quickly added, \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to do with the decision.\u201d\n\nThis latest fee of nearly a quarter of a million dollars for what will probably be a variation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s stump speech is further driving a narrative unwelcome to Democrats\u2014that Hillary and Bill Clinton are raking in big bucks from mostly special interest groups after she complained to ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer earlier this month, \u201cWe came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt.\u201d\n\nShe later tried to walk back those comments, noting on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, \u201cWe understand what that struggle is because we had student debts \u2014 both of us \u2014 we had to pay off, we had to work, I had a couple jobs in law school, he had lots of jobs.\u201d She added, \u201cWe have a life experience clearly different in very dramatic ways from every American, but we also have gone through a lot of the same challenges as many people have.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton 2016 Alert: Watch Your Left Flank\n\nIf she runs, Hillary Clinton is considered a shoe-in for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination \u2013 although the controversy over her family\u2019s rapid accumulation of wealth puts her squarely at the high end of the 1 percent and makes it more difficult for her to be the poster candidate for income inequality.\n\n\u201cIf Mrs. Clinton has Democratic opposition in 2016, I could see this becoming an issue,\u201d said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. \u201cThere is a strong populist faction in the party, though many in the faction have already endorsed Hillary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be much tougher for a Republican to use this against her, even a Republican of modest wealth, since almost all Republicans strongly support capitalism,\u201d Sabato added. \u201cThese massive fees seem excessive to most people, but it would be an odd attack from any GOP nominee, except perhaps to suggest that any pretension by Clinton of being an average American with everyday problems is ludicrous.\u201d\n\nPrecise figures are hard to come by, but the Center for Responsive Politics estimated broadly that Hillary Clinton\u2019s net worth is between $5.2 and $25.5 million as of 2012. Bill Clinton amassed $104.9 million for delivering 542 speeches around the world between 2001 and 2013, according to a new analysis by The Washington Post. Most others put their combined net worth\u2014including real estate, investments, etc. at well over $100 million.\n\nHillary, though, has done quite well for herself since leaving the State Department in February 2013. A report by Mother Jones says she\u2019s made at least 90 speeches, and was paid for at least two dozen of them.\n\nAssuming she charged her usual fee of $200,000 or more per speech, the magazine estimated that Clinton took in nearly $5 million for appearances over 15 months. She\u2019s addressed at least seven colleges and universities in that period and collected fees from at least four of them: Hamilton College on Oct. 4, 2013; Colgate University on Oct. 25, 2013; University of Miami on Feb. 26, 2014; and UCLA\u2019s Luskin Lecture for Thought on March 5 of this year.\n\nSabato said that the fee Clinton is charging UNLV would spark a heated controversy at most public colleges. \u201cMaybe a wealthy alumnus paid the tab, but it certainly looks bad,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI have to brag on UVA [the University of Virginia]. It is one of the few colleges that won't pay commencement speakers a penny, nor even give out honorary degrees . . . . A request for $25,000, much less $225,000, would be laughed off the premises.\u201d\n\nTop Reads From the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A narrative unwelcomed by Democrats is developing quickly: Their likely 2016 presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, is raking in big bucks from mostly special interest groups after she claimed that she and former President Bill Clinton had struggled financially for years.", "title": "The Growing Flap Over Hillary\u2019s Mega Speaking Fees", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/27/Growing-Flap-Over-Hillary-s-Mega-Speaking-Fees", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06152014_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/27/Growing-Flap-Over-Hillary-s-Mega-Speaking-Fees", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06152014_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A narrative unwelcomed by Democrats is developing quickly: Their likely 2016 presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, is raking in big bucks from mostly special interest groups after she claimed that she and former President Bill Clinton had struggled financially for years.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2025\"", "article_summary": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) reportedly was speechless for 15 seconds this week before being able to respond to a question about Hillary Clinton\u2019s latest big-money speaking engagement.\nRelated: Just How Rich Is Hillary Clinton?\nSabato said that the fee Clinton is charging UNLV would spark a heated controversy at most public colleges.\nIt is one of the few colleges that won't pay commencement speakers a penny, nor even give out honorary degrees .\nA request for $25,000, much less $225,000, would be laughed off the premises.\u201dTop Reads From the Fiscal Times:"}
