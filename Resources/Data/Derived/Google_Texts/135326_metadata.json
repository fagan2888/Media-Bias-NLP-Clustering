We spend our time in the communities and we start to tell them things about the Affordable Care Act \u2026 We are seeing lots and lots of people are getting covered for under 100 dollars a month,\u201d said Bill England, state director for Enroll America.\n\nAlong with showing the concentration uninsured it also shows where centers have been set up to get individuals enrolled. England said that these maps are one of the many tools their organization uses to better understand how to get people to sign up for health insurance.\n\n\u201cHealth insurance is important because it acts like a passport. Those who have health coverage are able to go and get a wide range of services including prevention checkups, and things like this and God forbid you have an accident or fall ill you\u2019re covered,\u201d England said.\n\nWith only five weeks left to reach out to those who have no health insurance, Enroll America is also looking for more volunteers.\n\nThe deadline to sign up for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance is March 31.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "As the deadline to sign up for the Affordable Care Act approaches, the activist group Enroll America has released a series of maps it hopes will help", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wesa.fm/post/map-shows-pittsburgh-neighborhoods-where-more-insurance-help-needed", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/medium/public/201402/pgh_map.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "As the deadline to sign up for the Affordable Care Act approaches, the activist group Enroll America has released a series of maps it hopes will help", "title": "Map Shows Pittsburgh Neighborhoods Where More Insurance Help Is Needed"}, "story_id": 281904758, "twitter": {"site": "@905wesa", "card": "summary", "creator": "@905wesa"}, "author": "Jess Lasky", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Map Shows Pittsburgh Neighborhoods Where More Insurance Help Is Needed"}, "nid": 24567, "datePublished": "2014-02-24", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act", "wordCount": 267, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "With only five weeks left to reach out to those who have no health insurance, Enroll America is also looking for more volunteers.\nThe deadline to sign up for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance is March 31.\n\u201cHealth insurance is important because it acts like a passport.\nThe map of Pittsburgh shows that some of the largest concentrations of uninsured can be found in East End and Hill District.\nEngland said that these maps are one of the many tools their organization uses to better understand how to get people to sign up for health insurance."}
