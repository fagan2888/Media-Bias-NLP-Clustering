Whether it\u2019s the world-renowned waters of the Fryingpan River, fast action of the Roaring Fork, scenic cascades of the Crystal River or the big volume \u2014 and fish \u2014 of the nearby Colorado, the odds of finding a fishery that exceeds your expectations are, as they say, off the hook.\n\n\u201cYou have the longest continuous stretch of Gold Medal water in the state, starting at Ruedi Dam on the Fryingpan to where it enters the Roaring Fork in Basalt, then the Fork all the way to Glenwood. That\u2019s more than 40 miles,\u201d Sands said. \u201cBoth rivers are managed as wild trout fisheries and trophy trout fisheries, with rules and regulations in place to sustain the trophy trout population.\u201d\n\nWhat makes Basalt such a stellar fishing destination encompasses the overall character of cold-water fishing in Colorado. With an estimated 9,000 miles of trout streams statewide, about 170 of them designated Gold Medal by Colorado Parks and Wildlife \u2014 those waters that have the greatest potential for trophy trout fishing \u2014 there\u2019s incentive to cast a line in virtually any direction.\n\n\u201cWhat separates Colorado as a destination is that you can travel north, south, east or west and find so much access and water within an hour,\u201d said Landon Mayer, author of \u201cColorado\u2019s Best Fly Fishing\u201d (Headwater, 2011). \u201cWhile other Western states have pockets of great fishing spread out in different areas, here there\u2019s a world-class tailwater that\u2019s 35 minutes from a freestone, that\u2019s right next to amazing still water. It\u2019s no problem to hit a number of great spots even in a single day.\u201d\n\nAsk the guide and guidebook author where he would spend his busman\u2019s holiday and it varies with the season. Come spring, Mayer points his fly rod toward North Park and the Gold Medal water of North Delaney Butte Lake, where lunker brown trout prowl the depths.\n\n\u201cIn the summer, I find myself traveling a fair amount to the freestone rivers like the Roaring Fork and the Arkansas, hitting the caddis, PMD and green drake hatches as summer progresses,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen fall arrives, the Florissant resident stays close to his home waters on the South Platte River and the trophy fishing opportunities on and around the reservoirs of South Park. Come winter, it\u2019s the famous tailwaters of the Taylor River, the Fryingpan and the Arkansas below Pueblo Reservoir.\n\nThose hot spots are but a sliver of our state\u2019s abundance of cold-water fishing commodities, albeit an impressive one. But attempting to pinpoint the paramount fishing in Colorado is a bit like picking out the best flavor at the ice cream shop. They\u2019re all appetizing.\n\nSo, instead of settling on a single flavor, here\u2019s a sample platter of fishing options and suggested base camp communities where you won\u2019t feel weird walking down the street \u2014 or into the ice cream parlor \u2014 in soggy shoes.\n\nBon app\u00e9tit.\n\nScott Willoughby: swilloughby @denverpost.com or twitter.com/willoughbydp\n\nCentral\n\nBase camp: Basalt.\n\nFishing: Roaring Fork, Fryingpan, Crystal, Colorado River, Ruedi Reservoir.\n\nGuide\u2019s choice:\u201cA short window and dry flies \u2026 I\u2019m going to run up the \u2018Pan for a couple hours,\u201d Will Sands said. \u201cIf I\u2019ve got a full day, I\u2019m in my drift boat down the valley on the Fork and/or the Colorado, depending on which river is fishing best and the type of fishing available.\u201d\n\nCall of the wild: The upper Fryingpan above Ruedi is an overlooked and secluded fishing spot.\n\nCall of the mild: Dearhamer Campground at the Fryingpan inlet of Ruedi Reservoir is kid-friendly with plenty of stockers to catch.\n\nGuides/shops: Taylor Creek Fly Shop (970-927-4374, Taylorcreek.com); Frying Pan Anglers (970-927-3441, Fryingpananglers.com); Crystal Fly Shop in Carbondale (970-963-5741, Crystalflyshop.com); Roaring Fork Anglers in Glenwood Springs (970-945-0180, Roaringforkanglers.com).\n\nGrub: Riverside Grill in Basalt Center Circle overlooks the Fryingpan.\n\nSleep: The Green Drake Motel (970-927-4747, green-drake.com); Aspenalt Lodge (970-927-3191, aspenalt.com); Taylor Creek Cabins (rent-cabins-colorado.com/).
