In fact, some research has shown that the workplace has become the greatest single source of stress.\n\nIn the United States, the standard workweek is often cited as 70 hours, not 40. This means that with more time spent on work, less time will be spent with family, friends and engaging in enjoyable personal pursuits. Unlike Europe, the United States does not have a maximum workweek length. We also have significantly fewer paid holidays.\n\nWith technological advancements leading to our 24/7 work day, it seems that work bleeds into the rest of our lives quite often. It also seems that personal time also bleeds into our work lives.\n\nResearchers report that both men and women experience guilt when their family lives intrude onto their work lives (rather than the other way around). This can lead to negative moods, anxiety and other behaviors that can impact job performance.\n\nIn response, an increasing number of workers are demanding that employers do more to reduce the stress of work/nonwork conflicts. Some companies offer wellness programs with fitness trainers, yoga instructors and stretching classes. Other companies offer healthier food options, on-site counseling, longer vacations and flexible schedules.\n\nFlexible work arrangements have been shown to be a very powerful tool for reducing stress and increasing employees\u2019 job and life satisfaction, job engagement, job retention and health.\n\nMost people feel that management has a responsibility to help employees achieve work/life balance. This means that employers will have to continue to find creative options to limit the amount of work/nonwork spillover that occurs to reduce employees\u2019 stress and to ensure that work settings are set up so that employees can fully contribute while at the same time enjoying good physical and mental health.\n\nAs Tony Schwartz notes in his book, \u201cThe Way We\u2019re Working Isn\u2019t Working,\u201d individuals need four sources of energy to operate at their best.\n\nThese include physical, emotional, mental and spiritual energy. As it stands today, our workplaces and jobs are really not designed to allow us to enhance these sources of energy, and in fact often deplete them. So something must change.\n\nJoyce E. A.
