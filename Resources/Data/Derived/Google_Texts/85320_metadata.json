Some argue that the saying even applies to the state\u2019s local governments.\n\nConservatives often contend that more decision making should be done at the local level, but what if local governments overreach their authority?\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has been vocal about his opposition to what he characterizes as an overabundance of regulations implemented at the local level in his state.\n\nDuring remarks at the Texas Public Policy Foundation\u2019s 13th annual Policy Orientation in January, Abbott said that \u201cthe truth is, Texas is being California-ized with bag bans, fracking bans, tree-cutting bans\u2026We are forming a patchwork quilt of bans and rules and regulations that are eroding the Texas Model.\u201d\n\n\u201cLarge cities that represent about 75 percent of the population in this state are doing this to us. Unchecked over-regulation by cities will turn the Texas miracle into the California nightmare,\u201d Abbott continued.\n\n\u201dWe are forming a patchwork quilt of bans and rules and regulations that are eroding the Texas Model,\u201d says @GregAbbott_TX.\n\n\u2018Texas Model\u2019\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, James Quintero, the director of the Center for Local Governance at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, elaborated on what Abbott calls the \u201cTexas Model.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere in Texas, we take great pride in the fact that we\u2019ve implemented conservative principles: low taxes, limited government and free markets,\u201d Quintero said. \u201cThat\u2019s essentially what the \u2018Texas Model\u2019 is.\u201d\n\nQuintero said that while these policies contribute to Texas\u2019 success at the state level, \u201ctoo many\u201d local governments are \u201crunning afoul\u201d of the principles.\n\nAccording to Quintero, big government at the local level is still big government.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re growing government at the local level in unreasonable ways,\u201d Quintero said.\n\nFor example, the city of Dallas issued a ban on plastic and paper bags, mandating that residents use reusable bags or pay a nickel for each disposable bag they use\u2014a measure Quintero says is in violation of existing state law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a rule of law guy,\u201d Quintero said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a situation where local governments flout existing state law.\u201d\n\nIf a city or county wants to implement a regulation or ordinance that goes against existing law, then Quintero says there should be \u201ca robust debate at the Capitol.\u201d\n\nCities are \u201csubsidiaries\u201d of the state, and must \u201crespect\u201d state laws, he said. Reasserting the \u201cprimacy\u201d of state laws protects \u201ccore conservative principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiberty is the principal, local control is the preference,\u201d Quintero said. \u201cIt all comes down to the proper role of government: protecting life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\n\n\u2018Welcome to America\u2019\n\nTom \u201cSmitty\u201d Smith, the Texas director of Public Citizen, told the San Antonio Express-News that Abbott is being hypocritical and \u201ctalking out of both sides of his mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn one hand, when it comes to the federal government telling states what to do, he says \u2018local control,\u2019\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd so we now have Greg Abbott declaring the state is more powerful than cities or local communities and their desires.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Smith likened the governor\u2019s comments to a \u201cStalinist dictatorship.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Abbott] is running around suing the Obama administration advocating for state rights, but when it comes to citizens going to their cities, he claims they shouldn\u2019t have that right,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith is unconcerned about regulations varying from city to city or county to county.\n\n\u201cWelcome to America,\u201d he said, adding that Austin is one of the fastest growing cities in America \u201cin terms of business development,\u201d despite local ordinances such as bag bans.\n\nConflicting Opinions\n\nOne state senator has introduced legislation affirming the preeminence of state laws over local ordinances.\n\nTyranny at the local level is just as bad as tyranny from Washington D.C. or a foreign dictator. #txlege \u2014 Don Huffines (@DonHuffines) March 10, 2015\n\nSen. Don Huffines, R-Dallas, authored SB 343, which if passed, would mandate that:\n\nLocal ordinances must be in \u201cconformity with the state statute or rule on the same subject,\u201d unless specifically exempted by the state.\n\nLocal governments are prohibited from issuing an ordinance \u201cthat conflicts with or is more stringent than a state statute or rule.\u201d\n\nHuffines told The Daily Signal that some \u201coverzealous political subdivisions\u201d have \u201cimproperly restricted economic activity by defying state laws that are designed to foster free enterprise and economic freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cCities must not get away with undermining or contradicting state law. Local control is not a blank check,\u201d Huffines said.\n\nMatt Langston, Huffines\u2019 chief of staff, added that the bill was \u201cpro-business,\u201d and the office is receiving a great deal of positive feedback from constituents.\n\nSome organizations, such as Equality Texas, oppose the legislation on the grounds that it would undo local non-discrimination ordinances\u2014which may or may not have a state-level counterpart.\n\nThe Texas Municipal League, an organization that exists to \u201cto serve the needs and advocate the interests of cities and city officials\u201d said in a statement that cities are \u201cthe government closest to the people:\u201d\n\n\u201cCities provide the services that we cannot do without,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThose services reflect the will of the local taxpayers. They are not the kind of services people think of when they say they want less government. Put simply: City services are the nuts and bolts of our society.\u201d\n\nSB 343 has been referred to the Senate Committee on State Affairs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas Gov.
