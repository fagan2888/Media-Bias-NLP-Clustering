The Islamist group\u2019s sectarian ideology is closely aligned with the Islamic State.\n\nEarlier this week Reuters reported that a Shiite unit of Pakistani fighters known as the Zeinabiyoun were joining the war against Islamic State in Syria. Many come from Parachinar, which has a large Shiite population, unusual in Sunni-majority Pakistan.\n\nRegional sources said there were hundreds of Pakistanis fighting in Syria.\n\nSufyan said Parachinar residents should not travel to Iran or Syria to fight in the war there on behalf of the Shiites.\n\nThe explicit linkage of the Pakistan bombing to the war in Syria will alarm Pakistani officials, who are keen to play down reports that Islamic State is seeking to establish a foothold in their country.\n\nA couple of small militant groups who splintered from the Pakistani Taliban pledged allegiance to Islamic State, but they have not had much impact.\n\nBut across the border in Afghanistan, militants who split from the Taliban and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State have established training camps, taken over territory and clashed with the Taliban.\n\nLike the Islamic State, which set up a cross-border caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi wants to kill or expel Pakistan\u2019s minority Shiites and establish a Sunni theocracy.\n\nThe Lashkar-e-Jhangvi had once enjoyed the open support of Pakistan\u2019s powerful spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, but the group suffered a series of setbacks this year.\n\nThe leader of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, his two sons and several top officials were shot dead in police custody this July; police have said they were trying to escape. Last month, another top Lashkar-e-Jhangvi commander was shot by police while in custody.\n\nBut Sunday\u2019s bombing, if carried out by the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, is proof that the group can still mount devastating attacks.\n\nParachinar local government official Riaz Hussain said Sunday\u2019s blast targeted crowds at a market.\n\n\u201cThe death toll has reached 24 and 70 are wounded,\u201d Amjad Ali Khan, the political head of Kurram Agency, said. Parachinar is the capital of Kurram.\n\n\u201cSome of the injured are in critical condition,\u201d Shafiq Hussain, a health worker at the Agency Headquarters Hospital Parachinar, said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Sunni Islamist group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack.
