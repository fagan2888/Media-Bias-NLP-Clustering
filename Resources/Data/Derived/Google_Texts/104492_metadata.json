The nation\u2019s most unlikely Obamacare success story \u2014 a state system that has provided more than 500,000 Kentuckians with affordable health insurance \u2014 might well be ransacked by a Tea Party candidate named Matt Bevin.\n\nFrom the earliest days, Kentucky\u2019s efforts to implement Obamacare have earned national acclaim. As the troubled roll out of the national health care exchange website was ruthlessly mocked by late night television, Fortune praised \u201cone health exchange success story\u201c: Kentucky\u2019s new state-level marketplace.\n\nUnlike most southern states, Kentucky opted to both set up its own state exchange (the Kentucky Health Benefit Exchange, commonly known as \u201cKynect\u201d) and to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. These efforts, ordered by Gov. Steve Beshear (D) and overseen by Governing magazine\u2019s 2014 Public Official of the Year Carrie Banahan, helped get 521,000 Kentuckians insurance coverage in the first year alone. According to a Gallup poll, by the first half of 2015, Kentucky\u2019s uninsured rate had fallen from 20.4 percent in 2013 to just 9 percent, the second largest drop of any state. Governing f\u00eated Kentucky as \u201cone of the few states that got everything right.\u201d\n\nIn testimonials provided to ThinkProgress by Kentucky Voices for Health, a coalition of health advocacy groups, many Kentuckians agreed. \u201cThank God for Kynect,\u201d said Eddie Alvis, who after years of struggling financially was able to get health insurance, and discovered he had severe asthma. \u201cIt has really empowered me,\u201d said Lynn Young, a Louisville resident who got insured despite her recent unemployment. And Helen Spalding, who lost her job and benefits after a serious car accident, was also able to purchase insurance. \u201cKynect has been here for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s over 300,000 [Kentuckians that are on expanded Medicaid], and Matt Bevin is just going to take it from every single one of them.\n\nBut with Beshear term-limited, Bevin, the GOP nominee, has made it clear he wants to reverse course. The Tea Party-backed candidate vows he\u2019ll do away with both the successful state exchange and the Medicaid expansion that has helped hundreds of thousands get affordable health care \u2014 moves that the governor could likely make unilaterally.\n\nIt\u2019s a prospect that worries many state-based health experts, business groups, and public officials who spoke to ThinkProgress about the upcoming election and the state of Kentucky\u2019s health care system. One of those officials was Beshear himself, who accused Bevin of playing politics with the hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians who now have insurance for the first time.\n\n\u201cIt terrifies me,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cThere\u2019s over 300,000 [Kentuckians that are on expanded Medicaid], and Matt Bevin is just going to take it from every single one of them \u2014 just because he doesn\u2019t like the fact that President Obama was the one that got it passed.\u201d\n\nDespite Kynect\u2019s popularity and growing support among conservatives for the system, the most recent polls show Bevin locked in a tight race with current Attorney General Jack Conway (D), who has indicated he would continue the state\u2019s current health care regime. So the questions are surely worth asking \u2014 who is Matt Bevin? And what would happen to Kentucky\u2019s health care system if he won?\n\nA Long-Time Obamacare Hater\n\nIf Bevin\u2019s name sounds familiar, it\u2019s probably because last year he mounted a primary challenge to Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the current Republican leader.\n\nAmong Bevin\u2019s top priorities was a full repeal of Obamacare. Calling the law \u201calready a disaster,\u201d the manufacturing millionaire vowed to use any means necessary to stop the law, even if it meant voting for a government shutdown.\n\n\u201cWashington politicians say they oppose Obamacare, but they continue to vote for spending bills that fund it,\u201d Bevin wrote on his campaign website at the time. \u201cThis has to stop. Matt will not vote for any spending bills that fund Obamacare. None.\u201d\n\nA year and a campaign later, Bevin has not given up on the crusade. While his message was not enough to unseat a five-term incumbent U.S. senator in 2014, it did generate him enough support to win the gubernatorial nomination this May. His current site features a \u201cBlueprint for a Better Kentucky\u201d that proposes to \u201cbring relief from Obamacare to the taxpayers of Kentucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs governor, I would close the Kynect state exchange and facilitate the transition of enrollees into the federal health care exchange,\u201d Bevin pledges. \u201cClosing Kynect would begin to free Kentucky from this financially ill-advised program and leave Obamacare management in the hands of the federal government.\u201d\n\nA Switch In Time Saves Nothing\n\nBut his promise to switch from Kynect to the federal health insurance exchange would likely be fiscally disastrous, could having a chilling effect on enrollment, and has prompted some experts to question whether Bevin really understand what he is proposing.\n\nBevin calls Kynect and the Medicaid expansion \u201cfinancially ill-advised.\u201d But, as of now, the programs don\u2019t actually cost state taxpayers anything. Kentucky received $253 million from the federal government for the development of Kynect, and private insurance companies pay for the system\u2019s operation.\n\nAs for the Medicaid expansion, the federal government currently pays the entire tab, and will continue to do so until 2017. After 2017, Kentucky will begin paying 2 percent of the cost of the expansion, which will increase yearly until the state eventually pays 10 percent in 2021. By then, the state estimates, the program will have saved enough money and created enough jobs to more than offset the cost.\n\nSo why, then, is Bevin saying the programs are too expensive for the state?\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s ever tried to nail him down on that,\u201d said Al Cross, an associate professor of journalism at University of Kentucky and founder of the website Kentucky Health News. \u201cHe\u2019s difficult to question.\u201d\n\nBeshear chalks these unsubstantiated claims up to Bevin simply not understanding the policies at hand. In his conversation with ThinkProgress, Beshear said Bevin often confuses the actual health benefits exchange \u2014 where people purchase private insurance plans \u2014 with the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which increased the number of people eligible to enroll in the public health insurance program.\n\n\u201cHe mixes the two up in his conversations,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cHis statements in general just talk about Obamacare, and \u2018we\u2019ve got to do away with the whole thing,\u2019 and he doesn\u2019t really distinguish between the exchange and Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThere is also an element of ideological inconsistency in his approach. Bevin embraces a radical \u201ctenther\u201d view of the U.S. Constitution, believing that state governments are not obligated to follow federal laws they do not support. In the same vein, one of his biggest priorities is to fight against what he calls \u201cfederal government overreach.\u201d Still, he proposes to unilaterally eliminate a Kentucky-designed, Kentucky-controlled system and instead cast the state\u2019s lot with the federal bureaucracy.\n\nBevin\u2019s campaign did not respond to multiple ThinkProgress interview requests.\n\nEliminating Kynect: \u2018In A Word, Stupid\u2019\n\nBeshear is far from the only person with some harsh words for Bevin, thanks to his views on Kentucky health care policy.\n\n\u201cBevin\u2019s proposal to do away with Kynect is, in a word, stupid,\u201d said Kentucky Health News\u2019 Cross, who also directs the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a national model. It would take tens of millions of dollars to decommission it.\u201d\n\nHow many millions, exactly? Beshear estimates that the change would cost the state anywhere from $23 million to $25 million. Then, once the change is made, Kentuckians would have to pay more for their insurance \u2014 while Kentucky only charges a 1 percent fee on plans, the federal government exchange charges a 3.5 percent fee.\n\nBevin\u2019s proposal to do away with Kynect is, in a word, stupid.\n\nAside from financial consequences, groups that work to enroll people in health insurance through Obamacare-created exchanges warn of other likely problems for consumers. Enroll America deputy communications director Justin Nisly warned of \u201cuncertainty and confusion for consumers\u201d if a switch occurred.\n\nEmily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, agreed, saying the employees of Kynect are generally local people with relevant regional expertise. \u201cThey become very trusted sources of information,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople come back to their Kynect-ers and let them know how they\u2019ve been doing, and [customers have] shown a lot of appreciation for having that coverage.\u201d\n\nThese concerns might be enough to discourage any state with a functioning exchange from switching to the federal system at this point. But thanks to its technical prowess and proven success, Kynect is not just any state exchange.\n\nEven as the federal exchange stumbled in its early days through technical problems, Kentucky\u2019s online site proved well-tested and durable. A 2014 Time article by Stephen Brill documented this, and in the piece Beshear recalls getting a phone call from President Obama who, half-kidding, asked, \u201cHey, Steve, you have any computer people you can lend me?\u201d\n\nFor the very first time in our history here in Kentucky, every single Kentuckian has access to affordable health insurance.\n\nToday, Beshear says he is \u201cextremely proud\u201d of the system he approved. He likes to point to two reports \u2014 one, a 2013 white paper from before Kentucky expanded Medicaid, which found that expanding Medicaid would infuse $15 billion into the state\u2019s economy and create 17,000 new jobs over the next eight years. The other, conducted a year after the state expanded Medicaid, found that 12,000 health care-related jobs had already been created \u2014 and upped the jobs creation estimate to 40,000 over the next eight years.\n\nAnd aside from the nearly unprecedented enrollment numbers, actual health care services have gone up as well. Last month, the state Department of Medicaid Services released data showing a staggering increase in preventative care services like physical exams, diabetes and cancer screenings, and flu shots. In a state deemed \u201cone of the sickest states in America\u201d a decade ago, these are hugely important improvements.\n\nCREDIT: Dylan Petrohilos\n\n\u201cFrom an economic standpoint, it\u2019s going to really help Kentucky\u2019s economy,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cBut most importantly, from a human standpoint, for the very first time in our history here in Kentucky, every single Kentuckian has access to affordable health insurance, and over a generation, that will make a huge positive impact on our state.\u201d\n\nBevin himself has said little about the benefits that Kynect and the Medicaid expansion have rendered so far, and has indicated that he doesn\u2019t think the state exchange creates jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s absolute nonsense,\u201d he\u2019s quoted as saying in a WDRB article from earlier this year, when confronted with Beshear\u2019s notion that Medicaid expansion would grow the economy.\n\nKynect Is As Popular In Kentucky As Mint Juleps\n\nWhile Bevin\u2019s proposal to dismantle Kentucky\u2019s flourishing health care system may seem out of the blue, Beshear\u2019s decision to build a state exchange was no snap judgement.\n\nJulia Costich, a professor of health management and policy at the University of Kentucky, pointed ThinkProgress to a 2011 stakeholder survey by the state government, which found that 83 percent of respondents with an opinion preferred that the state design its own exchange. Those backers included the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, Kentucky Association of Manufacturers, Kentucky Hospital Association, the Kentucky Medical Association, and several prominent insurance companies.\n\n\u201cAt the time, I\u2019m confident in saying the respondents cannot possibly have anticipated the trouble some other states had with state marketplaces,\u201d Costich said. But after seeing the success of Kynect, she recalled, \u201cI was not alone in saying \u2018Who knew that we could actually do something at a level of competence, of execution that exceeded that of almost any other state in the nation?\u2019\u201d\n\nSince then, Kynect has been noteworthy for its popularity \u2014 even in state that gave Mitt Romney a 60 to 38 victory over Obama in 2012. A May 2014 Marist poll found plurality support for Kynect in the state, despite 57 percent disapproval for Obamacare among the same registered voters.\n\nA June 2015 Public Policy Polling poll showed similar results \u2014 and found its approval equaled that of the mint julep, a Kentucky Derby tradition. Of course many people do not realize that Kynect is functionally the same thing as the Affordable Care Act, which likely contributes to its relative support.\n\nEven Mitch McConnell, who has denounced the Affordable Care act as \u201cone rolling disaster after another,\u201d said in a 2014 debate that he would like to repeal Obamacare completely but keep the state exchange.\n\nMcConnell \u2014 who had defeated Bevin easily in that Republican primary \u2014 endorsed his former rival\u2019s 2015 gubernatorial candidacy and has sent him at least $2,000 in leadership PAC contributions.\n\nBut McConnell is not the only Kentucky conservative to oppose dismantling the state exchange. Last week, Kentucky state Sen. Ralph Alvarado (R) not only warned that a move now to the federal exchange would be \u201cdisastrous,\u201d but even proposed that the state charge its neighboring states to use Kynect\u2019s infrastructure and use the funds to pay the state\u2019s share of the cost of Medicaid expansion. Notably, Alvarado ran for office highlighting his opposition to \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s plans to destroy our health care system with a costly government takeover that will only saddle our children and grandchildren with more debt.\u201d\n\nCross of Kentucky Health News believes the statements from Alvarado and McConnell represent a \u201cnew tune\u201d on Obamacare from Republicans, at least within the Commonwealth.\n\n\u201cThey seem to have accepted that it is going to stay with us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never liked Obamacare, but now it\u2019s been forced upon them and they see constituents are benefiting, and they can\u2019t afford to take it away.\u201d\n\nWe have serious questions as to the financial impact of dismantling a system that seems to be working for Kentucky.\n\nBevin, of course, is not one of those Republicans. In a video on his campaign site, he claimed that Kentucky should not keep Kynect due to its costs. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we offer to our citizens at the state level that they can\u2019t get at the federal level,\u201d it says. \u201cThe only thing we guarantee is that it\u2019s gonna cost taxpayers in the state more.\u201d\n\nBut even the state\u2019s Chamber of Commerce disagrees, deeming a state exchange still a better option than Bevin\u2019s proposed switch.\n\n\u201cDespite the Kentucky Chamber\u2019s serious concerns about the ACA\u2019s impact on business, we do not believe the Commonwealth should cede power to Washington, but chart its own course in health care reform,\u201d Dave Adkisson, the trade association\u2019s president and CEO, told ThinkProgress in an emailed statement. \u201cWe have serious questions as to the financial impact of dismantling a system that seems to be working for Kentucky.\u201d\n\nAside from Bevin, the most significant stakeholder criticism of Obamacare in Kentucky has come from the Kentucky Hospital Association. Though the trade group backed the state exchange as preferable to a federal one and cheered the decline in uninsured Kentuckians, it released a May report warning that declining reimbursement rates are hurting the financial stability of the state\u2019s hospitals.\n\nBut their report largely attributes these problems to other health policies that are unrelated to Kentucky\u2019s decision to work toward implementing Obamacare. For instance, the Affordable Care Act cuts hospital\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates under the assumption that the law\u2019s coverage expansion will reduce the need to absorb the extra costs of treating uninsured patients who can\u2019t pay their bills. On top of that, Costich explained, some of these issues also stem from separate Medicaid managed care reforms in the state that simply \u201chappened to have taken place at roughly the same time\u201d as Obamacare implementation.\n\nMisplaced Loyalties\n\nThough these Kentucky voices strongly oppose Bevin\u2019s plans, he has a strong incentive to hold firm: His out-of-state supporters.\n\nThe Koch Brothers\u2019 Americans for Prosperity, which has spent millions in opposition to the health care law, recently launched an independent expenditure ad campaign aiming to boost Bevin by attacking Conway for supporting Obamacare.\n\nIn addition, the anti-Obamacare Republican Governors Association is bankrolling ads complaining that Conway \u201csupported Obamacare, stating he would have been proud to vote for it.\u201d\n\nAnd while it does not appear either has gotten involved in his 2015 race, Bevin\u2019s two largest independent backers in 2014 were anti-Obamacare groups Senate Conservatives Fund (more than $450,000) and FreedomWorks for America (more than $200,000).\n\n\u201cI understand that, from a political perspective, the Republican candidate cannot possibly do otherwise than to advocate against Medicaid expansion,\u201d the University of Kentucky\u2019s Costich added. \u201cBut the consequences at this juncture, I think, would be pretty grim.\u201d\n\nAn Inferior Model\n\nIf Bevin does dismantle Kentucky\u2019s successful state exchange, he would need another plan to replace it. Though he hasn\u2019t been totally specific on what that plan might be, he has hinted that he favors a system like Indiana\u2019s.\n\nIndiana currently operates under the federal exchange. And while the state did expand Medicaid, the specific terms of that expansion make it one of the most conservative plans in the country. USA Today described Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s (R) Medicaid waiver as one \u201cthat injects personal responsibility into the health care program for the poor\u201d by requiring low-income participants to contribute to the cost of their care. In other words, Indiana has introduced premiums to the public health program, just like the monthly fees that Americans pay for private plans. This, of course, means that some low-income residents are locked out of getting health care altogether, while others have reduced benefits because of their inability to pay.\n\nBut just how successful is Indiana\u2019s health care system compared to Kentucky\u2019s?\n\nCREDIT: Dylan Petrohilos\n\nWhen it comes to participation, Kentucky is winning by a mile. Indiana, which has a population of about 6.6 million, had only 180,529 people enroll in its federally run exchange by the end of March 2015. Meanwhile, at around the same time, Kentucky \u2014 which has a population of 4.4 million \u2014 had enrolled approximately 521,000 people in Kynect plans. Put another way, that means about 2.7 percent of Indiana\u2019s population has signed up for new health care plans under Obamacare, compared to 11.8 percent of Kentucky\u2019s.\n\nKentucky also seems to be far outpacing Indiana in actually reducing its uninsured population. Before Obamacare, 15.3 percent of Indiana\u2019s population was uninsured, compared to 20.4 percent of Kentucky\u2019s, according to Gallup. Considering their respective populations, that means about 1 million people were uninsured in Indiana, while approximately 897,000 people were uninsured in Kentucky.\n\nIf everyone who enrolled through these exchanges had been uninsured beforehand, that would mean Kentucky decreased its uninsured population by a whopping 58 percent, while Indiana only decreased that population by 17.8 percent.\n\nA Real Possibility\n\nBeshear hopes Bevin will not be his successor, in part because of his adamant and seemingly unwavering stance against Kynect. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the benefits or the arguments for or against it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the fact that, who the president was at the time it was passed, makes him automatically against it. And that\u2019s about as short-sighted as you can be. \u201d\n\nBut the end of Kynect is not some far-fetched possibility. The most recent data, a Public Policy Polling survey in June, showed Bevin leading Democratic nominee Jack Conway 40 to 38. With voter turnout typically low in \u201coff-year\u201d Kentucky elections, it is anybody\u2019s guess who will succeed Beshear in January. For hundreds of thousands of people, that result could well determine whether they return to the ranks of the uninsured.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "One Republican state senator says Matt Bevin's proposal to eliminate Kentucky's acclaimed health insurance exchange would be \"disastrous.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "One Republican state senator says Matt Bevin's proposal to eliminate Kentucky's acclaimed health insurance exchange would be \"disastrous.\"", "title": "Kentucky Is Obamacare\u2019s Undeniable Success Story.
