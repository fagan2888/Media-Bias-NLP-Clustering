Citing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, the FDA will require all food retail locations to list caloric information for consumers at point-of-purchase. VendScreen software is an interactive retail outlet for vending machines, offering not only calorie data, but nutritional and product information as well.\n\n\u201cOffering point-of-purchase nutritional information at vending machines was the inspiration for VendScreen\u2019s beginnings,\u201d said Dave Grano, president and CEO of VendScreen, \u201cbut it\u2019s really only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the capabilities we can afford vending machine operators. In addition to helping operators keep ahead of federal regulations, at a fraction of the cost of acquiring new, intelligent machines, VendScreen software offers additional conveniences of cashless transactions, consumer loyalty programs and centralized monitoring.\u201d\n\nOwners and operators with more than 20 vending machines will be subject to the FDA\u2019s new guidelines. According to Vending Times, \u201cthe FDA\u2019s publication of its caloric\u2013content labeling rules has given operators another reason to consider wireless information displays,\u201d such as VendScreen\u2019s retrofit device. Operators who don\u2019t upgrade existing machines with new technology may be limited in their approach to achieving compliance; they may require significant human resources to add calorie rolls or stickers, or significant capital to acquire intelligent machines.\n\n\u201cNutrition information is just one of the many important factors why I\u2019ve chosen to install VendScreen software across my machines,\u201d said Brad Bohlin, owner of AllTexas Vending. \u201cOperators can take steps today to be in full compliance with regulations taking effect in two years\u2019 time,\u201d continued Bohlin, \u201cand they can do so cost efficiently. In addition, they can rest assured that VendScreen\u2019s offerings are dynamic and capable of adding features and options that may be in demand \u2013 from consumers or regulators \u2013 down the road.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith VendScreen, operators can provide consumers with full access to product and nutritional information, and additional features like cashless payment, instant help, loyalty rewards and credit codes for refunds. The software lends itself to an improved user experience, which has led to an overall average sales increase of 15 percent per retrofitted machine.\n\nVendScreen software harnesses industry-leading mobile communications and transactional security standards for consumer data protection, and can be updated wirelessly as customer needs change or new apps become available for smartphones.\n\nAbout VendScreen Inc.\n\nBased in Portland, Oregon, and a graduate of the Wieden + Kennedy Portland Incubator Experiment, VendScreen Inc. is the industry\u2019s leading manufacturer of retrofit touchscreen devices for vending machines. VendScreen devices are powered by a proprietary cloud-based computing platform that enables cashless transactions, dynamic product and nutrition information, on-screen promotions, and centralized remote monitoring.
