The husband and wife were looking to adopt a pet, and when they saw the subway felines were available they put in a basic application with Animal Care and Control of New York City.\n\nKatherine Lynn Arthur and August in their new Brooklyn Heights home.\n\n\u201cWe assumed there would be a person with an inside track who really has their eye on [the cats],\u201d said Ms. Lynn, who works for a theater consulting firm. But the couple was chosen, and they met the cats \u201con the day we took them home, Saturday,\u201d Ms. Lynn said.\n\nThe kittens became instant celebrities in the city, captivating commuters and even drawing responses from mayoral candidates Joe Lhota and Bill de Blasio. (Mr. Lhota, the former Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman who is running as a Republican, took some heat for saying he wouldn\u2019t stop the subways in order to help search for the cats.)\n\nFor the record, Ms. Lynn said \u201cof course [the subways] should have been stopped.\u201d She and Mr. Lubeley are voting for Mr. de Blasio, she said, and that is not just because he said he would have halted the trains. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t hurt that I know he would support stopping for cats,\u201d she said.\n\nThe kittens immediately took to their new home, Ms. Lynn said.\n\n\u201cThey just kind of checked it out. At first we sort of kept them in a smaller area so they could get acquainted to the sounds of the house and smells of the house. They were perfectly content to keep each other company. They groom each other\u2026they sleep with each other,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cArthur keeps August out of too much mischief and August keeps Arthur from being anti -social,\u201d she added.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The adorable kittens that hopped onto the subway tracks at Church Ave. in August -- delaying the B and Q trains for two hours  -- have found a new home.", "title": "Meet the New Owners of the Cute Cats That Stopped the Subway", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/23/meet-the-owners-of-the-cute-cats-that-stopped-the-subway/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AC716_nysubw_G_20131023143845.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Meet the New Owners of the Cute Cats That Stopped the Subway", "description": "The adorable kittens that hopped onto the subway tracks at Church Ave. in August -- delaying the B and Q trains for two hours  -- have found a new home.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "WSJ Staff", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "The adorable kittens that hopped onto the subway tracks at Church Ave. in August -- delaying the B and Q trains for two hours  -- have found a new home.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-23T19:10:17-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/23/meet-the-owners-of-the-cute-cats-that-stopped-the-subway/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-18862", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The adorable kittens that hopped onto the subway tracks at Church Ave. in August -- delaying the B and Q trains for two hours  -- have found a new home.", "title": "Meet the New Owners of the Cute Cats That Stopped the Subway", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/23/meet-the-owners-of-the-cute-cats-that-stopped-the-subway/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AC716_nysubw_G_20131023143845.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-18862", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-24T13:42:38-04:00"}, "article_summary": "But the couple was chosen, and they met the cats \u201con the day we took them home, Saturday,\u201d Ms. Lynn said.\n\u201cWe assumed there would be a person with an inside track who really has their eye on [the cats],\u201d said Ms. Lynn, who works for a theater consulting firm.\nKatherine Lynn Arthur and August in their new Brooklyn Heights home.\nAugust and Arthur were adopted by Brooklyn Heights couple Katherine Lynn, 30 years old, and Keith Lubeley, 33, on Saturday.\nThe kittens immediately took to their new home, Ms. Lynn said."}
