Wendy Davis last week sent the clearest signal yet that she\u2019s eyeing a gubernatorial run, telling supporters in an email blast that she will announce her next steps in early October. Attorney General Greg Abbott is the presumptive GOP nominee and, by all accounts, the clear front-runner in the race to succeed Republican Gov. Rick Perry.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI expect it to be a bruising campaign,\u201d said Texas GOP Chairman Steve Munisteri. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of material on Wendy Davis. I expect it to be within the bounds of appropriate political discussions. She\u2019s going to have a lot of questions to answer.\u201d\n\n( QUIZ: Do you know Wendy Davis?)\n\nMatt Angle, a Davis adviser, said that Republicans \u2014 who have held the governor\u2019s mansion for nearly two decades \u2014 need to brace themselves for a real race if she runs. He contended that Abbott isn\u2019t used to competitive contests and that his team has already blundered.\n\nAngle pointed to Abbott recently tweeting thanks to a supporter who referred to Davis as \u201cretard Barbie,\u201d though he later walked that back. In another instance, Angle noted, an Abbott adviser retweeted a user who said Davis is \u201ctoo stupid to be governor.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly on, it doesn\u2019t look like Abbott really has a firm grip on a statewide race,\u201d Angle, also director of the Lone Star Project, a Democratic group aiming to turn Texas blue, said. \u201cEarly on, there are unforced errors. Wendy Davis is not officially running, and she\u2019s all in his head. Look at his consultants hurling personal insults at her; he retweeted an insult. Just the kind of errors you see made by people running for city council rather than people running for governor.\u201d\n\nDavis catapulted into the national spotlight this summer after mounting a lengthy filibuster that temporarily derailed a restrictive abortion bill. That effort drew attention and plaudits from national Democrats up to President Barack Obama himself, who issued a \u201c#standwithWendy\u201d tweet.\n\n( PHOTOS: Wendy Davis\u2019s filibuster)\n\nSince then, she has appeared in the pages of Vogue, on stage at Washington\u2019s National Press Club and as a speaker at an EMILY\u2019s List event. She represents a state Senate district that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and in appearances like the one at the National Press Club has sought to paint herself as a moderate.\n\nAbbott entered the race with more than $20 million in his war chest, while Davis pulled in about $1 million in the wake of this summer\u2019s filibuster. The attorney general is crisscrossing the state, making the conservative case against Obamacare and government regulations. He is running on a platform of \u201cpreserving Constitutional, traditional values \u2014 like faith, family and freedom for future generations,\u201d as his campaign website proclaims.\n\nAbbott is no stranger to running statewide campaigns \u2014 he\u2019s in his third term as attorney general and is considered a workhorse with sterling conservative credentials. He is paralyzed from the waist down, an issue he confronted head-on in his campaign announcement speech: \u201cSome politicians talk about having a steel spine. I actually have one,\u201d he said \u2014 before \u201cthe whispering\u201d about his health could start, according to one Republican strategist.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Texas AG Abbott kicks off campaign)\n\nObservers say Abbott will champion the Lone Star State\u2019s economic growth and aim to paint Davis as a liberal easily linked to Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\u201cSince announcing for his bid for governor, General Abbott has communicated that his focus will be on the continued growth of the Texas economy to preserve its reputation as No. 1 in the nation,\u201d Abbott spokesman Avdiel Huerta wrote in an email. \u201cTo accomplish this, he believes we need to launch a new era of education reform and expand our transportation and water infrastructure to meet the growing demands of people moving to Texas as a result of our great economic environment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Texas governor\u2019s race is shaping up to be a bloody and expensive contest.", "title": "Davis vs. Abbott: 'Bruising'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/wendy-davis-vs-greg-abbott-97177.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/09/22/130922_wendy_davis_greg_abbott_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections (1447),Texas (550),Greg Abbott (7),Wendy Davis (47)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Texas governor\u2019s race is shaping up to be a bloody and expensive contest.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80e6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of material on Wendy Davis.\nShe\u2019s going to have a lot of questions to answer.\u201d( QUIZ: Do you know Wendy Davis?)\n| AP Photos Davis vs. Abbott: 'Bruising'The Texas governor\u2019s race is shaping up to be a bloody and expensive contest between a high-profile Democrat who fires up the party and a well-funded, well-established Republican.\nAttorney General Greg Abbott is the presumptive GOP nominee and, by all accounts, the clear front-runner in the race to succeed Republican Gov.\nWendy Davis is not officially running, and she\u2019s all in his head."}
