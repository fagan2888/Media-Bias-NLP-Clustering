The goal: educate and challenge you, the reader, to see the issues from all sides of this important issue of Medicaid expansion.\n\nViews from our sister Gannett news sites around The Sunshine State:\n\nFLORIDA TODAY\n\nStop gouging us, Florida House; expand Medicaid and cover the poor\n\nIt's bad enough that you pay for your own health insurance while also covering the unpaid hospital bills for the poor. In Florida, the pain is worse than that.\n\nBy rejecting an expansion of Medicaid, the House of Representatives is standing guard over a broken system that forces you to pay twice to care for the working poor:\n\nWe urge House leaders including Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, and Ritch Workman, R-Melbourne, to stop the gouging. With time running out in the Legislative session, they should at least open negotiations with the Senate on a plan it passed to accept Medicaid dollars and enroll the poor in privatized managed-care plans.\n\nRead more: http://www.floridatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/17/editorial-stop-gouging-us-house-cover-poor/25948631/\n\nMedicaid expansion a prescription for disaster\n\nIn Tallahassee, the issue of Medicaid expansion is quickly becoming one of the most important and contentious of the current legislative session. An interesting dynamic in this debate is that the Florida House and Senate, both controlled by a super-majority of Republicans, are completely opposed to each other.\n\nHealth experts: Let Medicaid help Brevard\n\nExpanding Medicaid in Florida would mean $114 million annually for Brevard County and would cover thousands here who currently have no health insurance, said health care experts at a forum Wednesday.\n\nGuest column: Don't compound bad Medicaid policy\n\nEvery time I hear someone discuss Medicaid expansion in Florida, I harken back to that promise I made and how disingenuous it ended up being. No matter how much I meant it at the time, reality proved otherwise.\n\nThe News-Press\n\nEditorial: Medicaid plan worth a listen for Legislature\n\nIt is a plan being pushed by Sen. Bill Nelson and one that is supported by Lee Memorial Health System President and CEO Jim Nathan. It is a plan that could work if state Republican and Democratic leaders are willing to drop their political gloves and at least listen.\n\nMedicaid Expansion: Just Take the Dang Horse!\n\nFlorida's large number of uninsured adults is a serious issue because it can lead to dangerous medical conditions, financial strain, and an estimated three to six deaths per day. Good preventive care can catch and treat life-threatening conditions and manage chronic illnesses. There are 800,000 Florida residents who are in the insurance \"coverage gap.''\n\nMedicaid expansion wrong for Florida\n\nThere's an old saying that a pig with lipstick is still a pig. So it is with the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion in the Sunshine State, which was unveiled in recent weeks as the so-called \"A Healthy Florida Works\" plan.\n\nPensacola News Journal\n\nViewpoint: Fix our health care\n\nLast week, Sen. Greg Evers, R-Baker, and all of the Florida Senate demonstrated true leadership when they passed a budget that included a comprehensive health care package designed to address the state's worsening health care crisis.\n\nREAD MORE:http://www.pnj.com/story/opinion/2015/04/10/viewpoint-fix-health-care/25570885/\n\nViewpoint: An alternative to Medicaid expansion\n\nDoing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is, in the words of Einstein, the definition of insanity. Unfortunately for Floridians, so too are the calls today to expand our state's Medicaid system under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nREAD MORE:http://www.pnj.com/story/opinion/2015/04/04/viewpoint-alternative-medicaid-expansion/25306175/\n\nTallahassee Democrat\n\nSenate plan for Medicaid, FHIX sound\n\nLast week, the Florida House and Senate issued proposed budgets that are billions of dollars apart. The difference revolves around their positions on the funding of our Medicaid program. Unless resolved, the Medicaid impasse will undo the entire state budget. Our state is facing a crisis and thankfully our leaders in the Senate are putting forth a solid plan to address it.\n\nREAD MORE: http://www.tallahassee.com/story/opinion/2015/03/28/senate-plan-medicaid-fhix-sound/70490024/\n\nDockery: Call it what you want, it's still Medicaid expansion\n\nTwo years ago, as part of the Affordable Care Act, Florida was offered $50 billion over 10 years to expand Medicaid to those low-income families who didn't qualify under the current eligibility requirements. The governor and the Florida Legislature turned it down.\n\nREAD MORE: http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/20/dockery-call-want-still-medicaid-expansion/20716333/\n\n\n\n\n\n====\n\n\n\n\n\nAROUND THE STATE\n\nHere are links from around Florida:\n\nBradenton Herald -- recent Medicaid expansion editorials:\n\nQuit playing politics with Florida's health care costs for working poor\n\nFlorida's health care funding crisis has reached a boiling point over the past week.\n\nRead more here:\n\nhttp://www.bradenton.com/2015/04/08/5733664/quit-playing-politics-with-floridas.html\n\nYet another reason for Florida to accept Medicaid expansion\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has proven to be a resounding and popular success in Florida -- with one major exception.\n\nRead more here:\n\nhttp://www.bradenton.com/2015/02/15/5636094/yet-another-reason-for-florida.html\n\nFlorida lawmakers must act soon on health care coverage for working poor\n\nFlorida's Legislature opens its 2015 session in early March, and one issue should top the agenda: health coverage for the uninsured and underinsured.\n\nRead more here:\n\nhttp://www.bradenton.com/2015/01/28/5605293/florida-lawmakers-must-act-soon.html\n\nFort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel\n\nDancing on graves of poor people\n\nLegislators must accomplish just one task during their annual 60-day legislative session \u2014 pass a state budget.
