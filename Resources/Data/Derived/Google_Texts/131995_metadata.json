The data doesn\u2019t necessarily mean young adults are avoiding relationships entirely. Young people are just less likely to make a serious commitment associated with moving in together.\n\nThe trend hasn\u2019t carried through to Americans in their 30s, who are only a bit more likely to be single than they were a decade ago. Marriage among people in this age group has also declined in popularity, but the percentage of 30-somethings living with a partner has jumped from 7 percent to 13 percent.\n\nThe new data suggests that, if young people don\u2019t feel ready for marriage, they may not feel up for long-term commitment yet, either. (In some cases, that may be because they\u2019re still living with their parents.) \u201cThis doesn't necessarily mean young adults are staying out of relationships, just that they are less likely to be making the more serious commitment associated with moving in together \u2014 whether in marriage or not,\u201d Saad wrote.\n\nThe societal question, she said, is whether those single 20-somethings stay that way into their 30s. A Gallup poll from 2013 suggests that young adults may not be avoiding marriage altogether, but are just pushing it back. In that survey, 56 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34 said they were unmarried but did want to tie the knot at some point. Only 9 percent in the same age group said they were unmarried and wanted to stay that way. The most common reasons people listed for not being married yet included having not found the right person, being too young or not ready to get married and money concerns.\n\nIn other words, they might someday say \u201cI do,\u201d but for now they definitely don\u2019t.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "You\u2019ve probably heard that marriage among young adults has been on the decline, but a new Gallup poll finds that the percentage of 18-to-29-year-olds living with a partner has flatlined in recent years.", "title": "Marriage??
