But, she added, \u201cnondiscrimination protections only function when they are applied equally.\u201d\n\nMormon Church Rick Bowmer / Associated Press The Salt Lake Temple in Salt Lake City. The Salt Lake Temple in Salt Lake City. (Rick Bowmer / Associated Press)\n\nSome groups, such as Equality Utah, an advocacy group for gays and lesbians in a state with nearly 2 million Mormons, lauded the announcement.\n\n\u201cMany within the LGBT community are themselves people of faith,\u201d Executive Director Troy Williams said. \u201cWe look forward soon to the day when all Utahns have the opportunity to live and work freely in the state we call home.\u201d\n\nThe church\u2019s announcement comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this year on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage.\n\nThe court has grappled with high-profile cases involving the boundaries of religious liberty, with complicated results.\n\nIn the Hobby Lobby case last year, it ruled that a Christian business could refuse to provide comprehensive birth-control coverage to employees mandated under the Affordable Care Act. In another case, it rejected the appeal of a New Mexico photographer accused of flouting anti-discrimination laws by refusing to photograph a same-sex wedding.\n\nJonathan Roberts, 38, of Hollywood, a former Mormon missionary, described the announcement as a \u201ccalculated\u201d and \u201cpatronizing\u201d bit of public relations on the part of a church that sees increasing cultural acceptance of gay people and doesn\u2019t want to look bigoted.\n\nRoberts, who is gay, said church leaders were secretive about why they made decisions, but he suspected the announcement was a \u201cpreemptive strike\u201d in anticipation of the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe Mormon Church has an estimated 15 million followers worldwide, with about 6 million in the U.S., where the largest temples are in Salt Lake City \u2014 the church headquarters \u2014 Los Angeles and Kensington, Md. California has about 768,000 members.\n\nIn 2008, the Mormon Church urged followers to give their time and money to help pass Proposition 8, the California measure to ban same-sex marriage, which narrowly passed.\n\nThe courts struck down the measure, and the church faced heated protests \u2014 including protests against individual donors to the campaign \u2014 that equated Proposition 8 with bigotry.\n\nThe proposition\u2019s passage was the catalyst for talks between LGBT and Mormon leaders about ways to improve relations, and \u201cthe more moderate Mormons were hoping to try and make things better,\u201d said Lorri L. Jean, chief executive of the Los Angeles LGBT Center, which organized protests against the measure.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s news conference, the church elders emphasized that their opposition to same-sex marriage had not changed. Mormons believe sex is only permissible in marriage between a man and a woman.\n\nJerry Garns, one of the eight top Mormon leaders in California, said Mormons did not see the church position against same-sex marriage as discrimination.\n\n\u201cI think everyone has someone, a friend, a family member, who is touched by this issue, so of course we discuss it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no real change with the doctrine, but finding a way forward that is harmonious is what we all want.\u201d\n\nPatrick Mason, director of the Mormon studies program at Claremont Graduate University, said the church appeared to have given up the battle against same-sex marriage laws.\n\n\u201cThey have tried to walk a fine line, saying that because of our theological commitments, we can\u2019t accept same-sex marriage, but let\u2019s agree to work together on this whole raft of other issues,\u201d Mason said.\n\n\u201cThis statement is kind of an olive branch saying can we find a way to accept religious liberty and at the same time promote equal and fair treatment of citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the softer approach by the church, some LGBT advocates were skeptical that the announcement represented a meaningful shift.\n\nJean said the church\u2019s insistence on \u201creligious exemptions\u201d was a recipe for discrimination.\n\n\u201cThe exceptions they want are big enough to drive a truck through,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one should be fooled by this.\u201d She described it as a \u201cnon-statement statement that is basically, \u2018We don't think LGBT people should be discriminated against unless we believe they should be discriminated against.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the church\u2019s announcement could help spur change in some conservative states with large Mormon populations.\n\nIn Utah, legislators could face easier going with a proposal to add sexual orientation and gender identification to the state\u2019s anti-discrimination statutes. In previous years, similar legislation has failed to pass.\n\nIn Idaho, the House State Affairs Committee is holding hearings on whether to add \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity\u201d to a state law barring discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations.\n\nJohnny Townsend, a Seattle author who said he was excommunicated from the Mormon Church a generation ago for being gay, sounded cautiously hopeful.\n\n\u201cI think the church is very slowly coming around to realizing it will have to have a kinder, gentler approach to gays and lesbians,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cThey realize they have to make concessions. I think it is a step forward. But so many of the Mormons I know have very strong anti-gay feelings, and it will take more than this to soften them up.\u201d\n\nhailey.branson@latimes.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Mormon Church tries to balance gay rights protections, religious freedom", "date": "2015-01-27", "Description": "Seven years after the Mormon Church led followers on a campaign to outlaw gay marriage in California, church leaders on Tuesday announced their support for job, housing and public accommodation protections for gays and lesbians everywhere.
