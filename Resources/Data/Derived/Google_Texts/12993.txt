An official in Nepal’s defense ministry said Friday that Nepalese forces had found wreckage of a U.S. Marine helicopter that went missing this week while flying relief materials to earthquake-stricken villages there.

Defense Secretary Ishwori Prasad Paudyal said three charred bodies have been pulled so far from the wreckage of the helicopter, which the Nepalese army spotted Friday in a mountainous area east of Kathmandu.

Paudyal said they weren’t likely to find any survivors. There were six U.S. Marines and two Nepalese soldiers aboard the helicopter when it went missing Tuesday evening.
