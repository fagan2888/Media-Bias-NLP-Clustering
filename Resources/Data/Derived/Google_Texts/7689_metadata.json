I am very satisfied with the treatment that I received from him and from Viera Hospital.\u201d\n\nA retired consultant to the government, Fuller, 70, has an active lifestyle with his wife Raelene maintaining their numerous rental properties along with his son.\n\n\u201cWe stay very busy and my two knee replacements now enable me to continue my active lifestyle at a good level.\u201d In his younger years, Fuller was a college football player with the University of Arkansas Razorbacks and has always enjoyed his mobility. Fuller held many high-level positions including Vice President of First Support Services, which operated and maintained government buildings and provided support services for people world-wide.\n\nDr. Greenspoon was recommended to Fuller by a friend.\n\n\u201cDr.Greenspoon first took care of my shoulder surgery and then both my knees,\u201d said Fuller. \u201cI wanted both knees replaced at the same time but Dr.Greenspoon thought it best that we do each separately. He replaced my right knee in March of this year and then the left knee in late June. The Viera Hospital was very professional and the staff were great.\u201d\n\nGreenspoon used the On-Q Painbuster Post-Op Pain Relief System to administer pain medication to Fuller after the surgery.\n\n\u201cThe On-Q System was great and was a big help with my second knee replacement,\u201d said Fuller.\n\nFuller was able to get up and move unassisted within hours after his surgery, thanks to Greenspoon\u2019s surgical experience and expertise.\n\nFuller is now back at it, remodeling his rental properties, sometimes eight hours a day, five to six days a week, doing electrical work, hanging drywall and doing fence work to keep his tenants comfortable.\n\n\u201cThanks to Dr. Greenspoon, I have no plan to slow down \u2013 and look forward to staying active for many years to come.\u201d\n\nFor more information call 321-434-9200 or log on to VieraOrthopedics.com\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "dr. jeffrey greenspoon,hal fuller,homepage,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SPACE-COAST-MEDICINE-FULLER-580-15.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "For Cocoa resident Hal Fuller, Dr. Jeffrey Greenspoon of Viera Sports Medicine & Orthopedic Center is an outstanding surgeon.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA \u2013 For Cocoa resident Hal Fuller, Dr. Jeffrey Greenspoon of Viera Sports Medicine & Orthopedic Center is an outstanding surgeon.\nHal Fuller: \u2018Dr.\nABOVE VIDEO: Hal Fuller of Cocoa, Florida, talks about his two knee replacements performed by Dr. Jeff Greenspoon of Viera Sports Medicine & Orthopedic Center in Viera.\nGreenspoon Is An Outstanding Surgeon\u2019By Space Coast Medicine & Active Living Magazine // September 22, 2014Loading the player ...\nDr. Greenspoon was recommended to Fuller by a friend."}
