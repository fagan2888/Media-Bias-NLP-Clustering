While the news of Danilo Gallinari’s need for another ACL surgery still was sending waves through the Nuggets organization, they are gradually getting good returns on another player out for an indefinite period of time.

Center JaVale McGee, who has been out since early November with a stress fracture in his left tibia, has recently begun some lower body activity, getting some limited work in on an elliptical machine.

“It doesn’t put any pain on my shin because my foot is never leaving the platform,” McGee said. “That’s the only thing I can do. I can’t ride the bike or treadmill.

McGee said he’s encouraged by this step, “being able to get a sweat anaerobically” which has coincided with good returns from x-rays done on his tibia, but was quick to make it known that it remains very early in the process.

“It’s definitely an early step,” McGee said. “I’m just staying positive and trying to stay in shape and get stronger.

There remains no timetable for his return.

“The biggest step is just for it to heal,” McGee said. “So, either way, if I get on the elliptical and go an hour, it doesn’t matter if my shin doesn’t heal.”
