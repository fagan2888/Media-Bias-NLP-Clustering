No, not George Will, I meant a real, not a FAUX News intellectual. Professor Richard Hofstadter, a Professor of American History at Columbia University, was known as \u201ciconic historian of postwar liberal consensus\u201d. Professor Hofstadter wrote one of the seminal series of works of United States political thought, \u2018The Paranoid Style In American Politics\u2019, almost 50 years ago. Like nearly all well considered and well written essays, what Hofstadter wrote then is equally applicable today, perhaps even more so.\n\n\u201cAmerican politics has often been an arena for angry minds. In recent years we have seen angry minds at work mainly among extreme right-wingers, who have now demonstrated in the (Goldwater) movement how much political leverage can be got out of the animosities and passions of a small minority. But behind this I believe there is a style of mind that is far from new and that is not necessarily right-wing. I call it the paranoid style simply because no other word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy that I have in mind.\u201d\n\nWhile most of the paranoid politicians and conspiracies have been right-wing politically, there was a conspiracy against one of the most populist liberal/progressive and charismatic politicians ever, the Kingfisher, Louisiana Governor, U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate, Huey Long. The conspiracy that led to his being shot to death on the steps of the Louisiana State Capital on September 8, 1935 was all about his \u201cShare the Wealth\u201d program ideas that infuriated and scared the 1%-ers of his time. Over 200,000 mourners attended his funeral.\n\nHere are some of the best Kingfisher quotes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for the poor man \u2014 all poor men, black and white, they all gotta have a chance. They gotta have a home, a job, and a decent education for their children. \u2018Every man a king\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s my slogan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say they don\u2019t like my methods. Well, I don\u2019t like them either. I really don\u2019t like to have to do things the way I do. I\u2019d much rather get up before the legislature and say, \u2018Now this is a good law and it\u2019s for the benefit of the people, and I\u2019d like you to vote for it in the interest of the public welfare.\u2019 Only I know that laws ain\u2019t made that way. You\u2019ve got to fight fire with fire.\u201d\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a set of Republican waiters on one side and a set of Democratic waiters on the other side, but no matter which set of waiters brings you the dish, the legislative grub is all prepared in the same Wall Street kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did the opposition have to offer? Nothing. All they could talk about was autocrats and high taxes and state debts. Well we have always had taxes, the state has always been in debt, but never until Huey Long was elected did the people get anything for their money.\u201d\n\nAnd the one that the Tea Party and the Republicans would go to its craziest today.\n\n\u201cA man is not a dictator when he is given a commission from the people and carries it out.\u201d\n\nThe more things change, the more they stay same, don\u2019t they? R.I.P. Kingfisher. I wish someone as progressive, brave and outspoken as you were was around today.\n\nThe list of conspiracy theories is long and often peculiar. The best known was hatched by Senator Joseph McCarthy and his hunt for Communists that he claimed had infiltrated all branches of the federal government. To be called to testify in front of the McCarthy Commission ruined your reputation and life. It was Attorney Joseph Welsh defending his legal associate, Fred Fisher, of being a Communist by McCarthy, who uttered one of the most famous phrases in US political history: \u201cHave you no decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?\n\nThe irony of Senator Ted Cruz closely resembling (and often acting like) Joseph McCarthy has not been lost on many politicians and members of the media.\n\nThere have been many other great political conspiracy theories, too many to list here. Some of the most famous were:\n\nEugene Debs and the Social Worker Party Movement creating a One World Government\n\nDr.Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Moment being accused of leading the Marxist-Socialist government takeover (sound familiar?) by the John Birch Society, the precursor to the Koch Brothers and the Tea Party.\n\nThe Vatican dictating US policy when the Catholic John Kennedy became President\n\nBut did you know that JFK was really killed over a secret briefing that UFO\u2019s had landed on earth?\n\nThere is the long-standing belief that the Trilateral Commission is really in charge and will create an One World Government.\n\nUnless my favorite conspiracy group, the Illuminati, beats them to it first. Any group that has President Barack Obama, The Pope, Queen Elizabeth, George Soros, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z AND Willow Smith in it does have the power to rule the world. I keep waiting for my invitation to join the Illuminati, but none has been forthcoming so far.\n\nSo we can add to the list, the Affordable Care Act leading to the inevitable socialized medicine, climate change not existing, The Muslim Brotherhood running Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department, government austerity leading to economic growth, the Government is coming for your guns, and a wide range of whackballness that has been spewing since President Obama has taken office. Most of this that comes from the minds (or lack thereof) and the mouths of the Tea Party, the right-wing, and its spokespeople, the Bachmann\u2013Palin Underdrive, featuring lead boy singer, Teddy Cruz. Do they have any decency? No.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss what Rafael Cruz said in his speech that the Marxist-Socialist Barack Obama should be sent back to Kenya, as just more right wing, feed the base rhetoric. But there is a viciousness and hatred to it that is chilling. That he is the father of and chief political adviser to the United States Senator, who is likely going to run for President and is the current front-runner for the Republican Party nomination in 2016, means you can\u2019t dismiss what he says because it\u2019s part of a not-so-hidden political agenda. That what he said is being parroted repeatedly on national talk radio to stir up more hatred and paranoia makes it even more pernicious than all the paranoia and conspiracy theories the United States has previously experienced \u2013 combined.\n\n.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted and Rafael Cruz are just two more in a long line of American political paranoiacs.
