The slow movement of the storm, he said, could help produce quite a bit of snowfall and blizzard-like or blizzard conditions: at least three hours of wind gusts of 35 mph or greater and visibility of less than a quarter of a mile because of snow or blowing snow.\n\nThe storm could stall before it tracks out to sea, bringing high wind, heavy precipitation and the potential for coastal flooding, the National Weather Service said. It would be the second wallop for the Northeast after what happened Saturday, when a storm crawling up the East Coast left a slushy, snowy coating from Pennsylvania to New England.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blizzard-like conditions possible in Northeast\u2019s next storm", "title": "Blizzard-like conditions possible in Northeast\u2019s next storm", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Blizzard-like conditions possible in Northeast\u2019s next storm", "title": "Blizzard-like conditions possible in Northeast\u2019s next storm", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/25/blizzard_like_conditions_possible_in_northeasts_next_storm/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/aptopix-winter-weather-pennsylvania.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Blizzard-like conditions possible in Northeast\u2019s next storm", "title": "Blizzard-like conditions possible in Northeast\u2019s next storm", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/aptopix-winter-weather-pennsylvania.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d01\"", "article_summary": "The storm could stall before it tracks out to sea, bringing high wind, heavy precipitation and the potential for coastal flooding, the National Weather Service said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s the potential for a significant snowstorm to impact the entire Northeast U.S.,\u201d meteorologist Patrick Maloit said.\nIt would be the second wallop for the Northeast after what happened Saturday, when a storm crawling up the East Coast left a slushy, snowy coating from Pennsylvania to New England.\nA storm system diving out of the Midwest has the potential to slowly coat from Philadelphia up to Massachusetts and Maine with snow beginning late Sunday night into Monday and intensifying greatly well into Tuesday, the National Weather Service said.\nThe slow movement of the storm, he said, could help produce quite a bit of snowfall and blizzard-like or blizzard conditions: at least three hours of wind gusts of 35 mph or greater and visibility of less than a quarter of a mile because of snow or blowing snow."}
