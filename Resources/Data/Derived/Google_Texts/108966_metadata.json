Who composed it?\n\n\u201cOh, one of our staff members is a former cheerleader. She came up with it,\u201d said McDonnell, whose organization was founded a few years ago to defend religious freedom and promote \u201ca real women\u2019s agenda\u201d of pro-life issues.\n\nPlanning a rally outside the court during oral arguments in the Zubik v. Burwell contraceptive mandate case, best known as the Little Sisters of the Poor case, requires imagination. It\u2019s the first such rally McDonnell has planned, and only the second she\u2019s been involved with since one at the White House two years ago during the Hobby Lobby case.\n\nShe told Catholic News Service that she doesn\u2019t expect a reprise of the noisily competing March 2 rallies in front of the court during the arguments on a challenge to a Texas abortion law. That day, some 3,000 supporters of Planned Parenthood surrounded 200 pro-lifers and attempted to drown out their speeches. To date, no rally in support of the Health and Human Services contraceptive mandate has been announced by any organization.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a happy balance,\u201d McDonnell explained. \u201cThe point of the demonstration is to show the public and the media what the case is about.\u201d\n\nShe hopes to have \u201ca few hundred\u201d in attendance. Plus a single message: \u201cLet Them Serve.\u201d No partisan tone, no politicians. And to ensure a pleasing visual element, at least 100 women religious from different orders.\n\nCatholic speakers will include Mother Mary Assumpta Long of the Dominican Sisters of Mary in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Mother Regina Marie Gorman of the Carmelite Sisters of Los Angeles. A delegation of Little Sisters will be there, but a volunteer from one of their homes will speak in their stead.\n\nThere won\u2019t be singing, but some of the Little Sisters will be handing out cookies. \u201cWe\u2019re really looking forward to a joyful morning,\u201d McDonnell said.\n\nThe 15 scheduled speakers are all women, since the case involves the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act, which requires most employers, including religious employers, to cover contraceptives, sterilization and abortifacients through health insurance. For the Denver-based Little Sisters, this means about 2,700 employees in the 27 nursing homes for the elderly poor they operate nationwide.\n\nHHS has offered what it calls an \u201caccommodation\u201d or \u201cwork-around\u201d that allows objecting employers to acknowledging their opposition to contraceptive coverage by notifying HHS in a letter.\n\nThis triggers an arrangement for a third party to provide the coverage. But the Little Sisters religious order objects to that as well, calling it a burden on the free exercise of religion. So do the six other appellants combining 36 religious nonprofit petitioners, including East Texas Baptist University, Southern Nazarene University and Geneva College, a Presbyterian institution, and the Archdiocese of Washington, the dioceses of Pittsburgh and Erie, Pennsylvania and Priests for Life.\n\nAll cite the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 in their defense.\n\nSister Constance Veit, communications director of the Little Sisters, wrote recently in the Catholic Review, the online publication of the Archdiocese of Baltimore, that the government\u2019s work-around enables \u201cformal cooperation with wrongdoing.\u201d She responded to written questions submitted by CNS.\n\nWhat is the biggest misconception the public has? \u201cIn thinking that this mandate provides universal coverage, and that we are somehow stopping people from getting these services. But the mandate doesn\u2019t cover one-third of Americans,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBig companies like Exxon and Visa are exempt, and the government has exempted its own insurance plans for military families and the disabled,\u201d she continued. \u201cThose employers are allowed to exclude these services for reasons of cost and convenience \u2014 our religious beliefs should get at least as much respect as the government\u2019s desire to save a little money or big business.\u201d\n\nShould the court, following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, come to a 4-4 deadlock that will uphold decisions of the lower courts and not set the case aside for further review, the order would face fines, but its employee health-care coverage won\u2019t stop. \u201cIn the end, all of this is in God\u2019s hands. For 175 years he has protected our ministry to the elderly poor through all kinds of strife and difficulties. We are confident that he will not abandon us now.\u201d\n\nThe pressure for the coverage, Sister Constance insists, comes solely from the government, and not their employees. \u201cMany of them tell us that they chose us specifically because they wanted to work in a religious atmosphere like ours. And they have never pressured us to violate our religion by providing services that go against our Catholic faith.\u201d\n\nThe undisputed highlight of the case so far was the unscheduled Sept. 23 visit of Pope Francis to the Little Sisters\u2019 residence in Washington during his apostolic visit.\n\n\u201cHe spoke with each sister and novice, and encouraged us in our ministry of caring for the elderly. He told us he appreciates our work, particularly for people whom society too often overlooks or forgets. It was a wonderful visit and the Vatican confirmed that part of the purpose was to show support for our efforts to seek protection from this mandate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Catholic Philly", "description": "Planning a rally outside the court during oral arguments in the Zubik v.
