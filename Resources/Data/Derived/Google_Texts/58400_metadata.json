But in Montana \u2014 by some measurements the reddest state in the country \u2014 the Kochs are hitting the skids. Their monster political group, Americans for Prosperity, or AFP, has laid an egg. And Medicaid expansion now has a real chance of happening.\n\nWhat\u2019s gone wrong?\n\nA few things. First, the Kochs underestimated the local population and made a fundamental misreading of the terrain, as have many outside groups that have botched Montana campaigns (starting with Custer and his troops). They sent in a crew of young D.C. hotshots with little understanding of the state\u2019s politics, to run a negative campaign against moderate Republican legislators who support expanding Medicaid. This campaign did nothing but piss off the legislators and their constituents.\n\nPart of this campaign involved organizing a disastrous series of \u201ctown meetings\u201d in the legislators\u2019 districts, at which AFP staffers lectured the locals about the dangers of \u201cObamacare expansion.\u201d Please take a moment to savor the image of a young man from D.C., showing up in a small Montana town, wearing a tailored suit and dress shirt but no tie, and pointy shoes, looking like he\u2019s expecting bottle service at a nightclub, to address an audience of burly men wearing flannel shirts and overalls and likely carrying concealed weapons.\n\nWorse yet, the GOP legislators being targeted by these meetings began crashing them. The AFP organizers would refuse to recognize them or even let them speak. The audiences didn\u2019t like this (everyone gets to speak at public meetings in Montana \u2014 it\u2019s in our Constitution). At one meeting, someone in the audience asked the AFP organizer, \u201cHow can we possibly have a town meeting on this issue but not hear from our legislator?\u201d There was no answer. Many in the crowd walked out. Several of these fiascoes were caught on video. The town hall debacles were front-page news across the state.\n\nNext, it was revealed that the Kochs own a 200,000 acre cattle ranch in Montana that has received more than $12 million of state and federal subsidies since it was founded. Two-thirds of the cattle operation is on public land, which means the Kochs pay grazing fees that are far below market rates while taxpayers make up the difference. (In 2011, the state of Montana proposed raising these fees to get them closer to market, and a guy from the Kochs\u2019 ranch showed up to the hearing to protest this increase.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even GOP legislators are pissed at AFP's campaign to deprive the poor and uninsured of healthcare in this red state", "title": "The Kochs take millions in subsidies in Montana, then try to block Medicaid expansion", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Even GOP legislators are pissed at AFP's campaign to deprive the poor and uninsured of healthcare in this red state", "title": "The Kochs take millions in subsidies in Montana, then try to block Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/25/the_kochs_take_millions_in_subsidies_in_montana_then_try_to_block_medicaid_expansion/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/david_koch2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even GOP legislators are pissed at AFP's campaign to deprive the poor and uninsured of healthcare in this red state", "title": "The Kochs take millions in subsidies in Montana, then try to block Medicaid expansion", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/david_koch2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eric Stern", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AFP, Americans for Prosperity, Koch Brothers, Montana", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1d3\"", "article_summary": "And Medicaid expansion now has a real chance of happening.\nBut in Montana \u2014 by some measurements the reddest state in the country \u2014 the Kochs are hitting the skids.\nThe audiences didn\u2019t like this (everyone gets to speak at public meetings in Montana \u2014 it\u2019s in our Constitution).\nNext, it was revealed that the Kochs own a 200,000 acre cattle ranch in Montana that has received more than $12 million of state and federal subsidies since it was founded.\n(In 2011, the state of Montana proposed raising these fees to get them closer to market, and a guy from the Kochs\u2019 ranch showed up to the hearing to protest this increase.)"}
