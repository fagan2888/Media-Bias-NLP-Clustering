A majority of Americans – 52 percent—disagree with President Barack Obama’s view about the proper size and role of government. Even more – 54 percent – call government “a burdensome part of society that impedes the ability of people to improve their lives.”

The poll was done by the libertarian magazine Reason.

The poll comes in a slew of other polls that reflect declining confidence in both President Barack Obama and his signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.

Interestingly though, this poll shows Obama has a 47 percent approval rating, higher than other polls out, while 50 percent disapprove, slightly lower than what other polls have indicated. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll has Obama’s approval rating at 43 percent and disapproval at 54 percent.

The Reason-Rupe poll taken of 1,011 adults from Dec. 4-8. Princeton Survey Research Associates International did the survey.

According to the Reason-Rupe poll, 55 percent of Americans would prefer going back to the health care system the way it was before Obamacare was enacted. Moreover, almost three-fourths of respondents believe Congress doesn’t understand the health care or how Obamacare affects average Americans.

On the issue of transparency, after reports of data mining on phone and e-mail communications, clashes over press access, and a lack of providing certain information to the public, 57 percent disagree “This is the most transparent administration in history.”
