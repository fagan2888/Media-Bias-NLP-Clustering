Enrollment has proven strong, with nearly 6.8 million people signing up for health insurance on the federally operated exchange alone as of Jan. 9, 2015. The exchange, which supports enrollment for residents of 36 states, has not surprisingly had the greatest number of registrations from the two highest-population states that do not have their own marketplace: Florida (1,190,922) and Texas (859,377). But three other states have also each enrolled roughly 400,000 people.\n\nBehind the numbers\n\nNearly 7 million people enrolled in Obamacare during its first open enrollment period, and this week's update from the Department of Health and Human Services suggests enrollment will handily outpace that number this time around.\n\nThe results so far are encouraging to insurers, including UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), that bet enrollment would rise even if health care plan prices headed higher.\n\nWhen open enrollment ends on Feb. 15, UnitedHealth could prove to be the leading beneficiary of this surge in enrollment because it's offering exchange plans in nearly two dozen states, including each of the top five states for health care.gov enrollment this year: Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.\n\nHealthCare.gov States Cumulative Plan Selections Nov 15 \u2013 Jan 9 Florida 1,190,922 Texas 859,377 North Carolina 434,503 Pennsylvania 408,934 Georgia 398,781 Virginia 298,981 Michigan 290,439 Illinois 272,623 New Jersey 202,732 Missouri 197,539 Ohio 186,232 Indiana 175,447 Tennessee 172,530 Wisconsin 169,704 Arizona 160,466 South Carolina 150,962 Louisiana 126,454 Alabama 126,061 Utah 109,218 Oklahoma 95,165 Oregon 84,360 Mississippi 76,005 Kansas 75,836 Maine 59,126 Nebraska 57,479 Arkansas 52,364 Nevada 47,784 Montana 45,278 New Hampshire 44,976 New Mexico 40,972 Iowa 34,586 West Virginia 26,236 Delaware 19,338 South Dakota 17,196 Wyoming 17,029 Alaska 15,830 North Dakota 14,973\n\nRising tide\n\nIn Florida, 983,775 people signed up for health insurance through health care.gov during the first open enrollment period, which ran from Oct. 15, 2013, through March 31, 2014. That means enrollment in the Sunshine State during the current open enrollment period is already up more than 20% from the last time around -- with another four weeks to go. Perhaps even more notable about that significant increase -- at least from the insurers' perspective -- is that growth came despite health insurance plan prices increasing by an average of 7% in Florida during this enrollment period versus a year ago, according to the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nSimilarly, Texas' enrollment is also running higher than the 733,000 who signed on through health care.gov the first time around. That means that despite health insurance plan prices increasing 5% in the Lone Star State (per the Commonwealth Fund), enrollment is still on track to climb by 17.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, insurance enrollment via health care.gov in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia looks set to grow by 21%, 28%, and 26%, respectively.\n\nMeasuring the impact\n\nExchange enrollment figures suggest the administration has a good shot at exceeding the 9 million enrollment prediction it made in November for the federal and state exchanges. If so, insurers and their investors could profit handsomely this year. According to the Commonwealth Fund, the average national silver-level exchange plan (the most common tier selected by enrollees) will cost a 40-year-old nonsmoker $314 per month, or $3,768 for 2015. That means that insurers are likely to post billions of dollars in premium revenue growth this year.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "12:46", "date": "2015-01-24T17:46:00Z", "description": "Healthcare.gov enrollment is highest in Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia during this enrollment period.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_single-control_50", "author": "Todd Campbell", "promo": "Healthcare.gov enrollment is highest in Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia during this enrollment period.", "twitter": {"site": "@themotleyfool", "description": "Healthcare.gov enrollment is highest in Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia during this enrollment period.", "title": "Is Obamacare Enrollment Highest in Your State? --  The Motley Fool"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "Healthcare.gov enrollment is highest in Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia during this enrollment period.", "title": "Is Obamacare Enrollment Highest in Your State? --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/01/24/is-obamacare-enrollment-highest-in-your-state.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F155937%2Fobamacare-enrollment-2015-jan-9.JPG&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "headline": "Is Obamacare Enrollment Highest in Your State?", "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-health-care", "STORY_UID": "9b2545c8-9c2c-11e4-a248-0050569d4be0", "pitch": 1381, "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "gsa_date": "2015 01 24", "tickers": "UNH,ANTM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That means enrollment in the Sunshine State during the current open enrollment period is already up more than 20% from the last time around -- with another four weeks to go.\nMeanwhile, insurance enrollment via health care.gov in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia looks set to grow by 21%, 28%, and 26%, respectively.\nSimilarly, Texas' enrollment is also running higher than the 733,000 who signed on through health care.gov the first time around.\nBehind the numbersNearly 7 million people enrolled in Obamacare during its first open enrollment period, and this week's update from the Department of Health and Human Services suggests enrollment will handily outpace that number this time around.\nThe second open enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act began on Nov. 15, 2014, giving millions of Americans another opportunity to buy health insurance through online federal and state marketplaces."}
