The case isn\u2019t about liberty; it\u2019s about paperwork.\n\nHere\u2019s their argument in a nutshell: The law merely requires the Little Sisters of the Poor to certify their religious objection to the third-party administrator of their self-insurance plan. Ordinarily, this certification would then require the third-party administrator to provide \u201cfree\u201d abortifacients to the Little Sisters\u2019 employees, but since the third-party administrator is exempt from this requirement (because they\u2019re administering a \u201cchurch plan\u201d) and says it won\u2019t provide the abortion pills, then this case is about nothing at all \u2014 nothing but a requirement that the Little Sisters fill out a piece of paper to get their government benefit.\n\nHere\u2019s the government\u2019s brief:\n\nApplicants cannot establish that it is indisputably clear that such a RFRA claim would succeed. Indeed, that reading of RFRA, if accepted, would seemingly invalidate any scheme in which an individual or entity with religious objections is required to complete a certification of entitlement to an opt-out in order to secure the opt-out. That cannot be correct.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: The certification is not an \u201copt out,\u201d it\u2019s a document that actually empowers a third party to provide free abortion pills. In that way, it\u2019s more like a voucher than an opt-out. Imagine if the government said to a religious employer, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to require you to pay for abortions, but we will require you to provide employees with a document that entitles them to a free abortion at the Planned Parenthood clinic down the street.\u201d Would anyone think for a moment that respected religious liberty? Yet that\u2019s the essence of the government \u201caccommodation\u201d here.\n\nThe Little Sisters object to providing an abortion/contraception voucher \u2014 a voucher that could be redeemed for free abortifacients at the discretion of a third-party administrator.\n\nSo, no, this is not an argument about a form. After all, religious entities (including the Little Sisters of the Poor) fill out forms without objection all the time. It\u2019s about power \u2014 whether the Obama administration can force a Catholic charity to empower a third-party to provide free medical services that indisputably and gravely violate the deeply-held religious principles of nuns who are doing good works for the \u201cleast of these.\u201d\n\nThis article is crossposted on National Review.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ)", "language": "en-us", "og": {"site_name": "American Center for Law and Justice", "description": "A key theme of the Obama administration\u2019s 37-page response to the Little Sisters of the Poor\u2019s request for an injunction against the HHS abortion-pill...", "title": "A Central Deception in the Obama Administration\u2019s Case Against the Little Sisters of the Poor | American Center for Law and Justice", "url": "http://aclj.org/obamacare/central-deception-in-obama-administrations-case-against-little-sisters-of-the-poor", "image": "http://media.aclj.org/fs/RTX139OW.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@aclj", "image": {"src": "https://7676076fde29cb34e26d-759f611b127203e9f2a0021aa1b7da05.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/fs/RTX139OW.jpg"}, "description": "A key theme of the Obama administration\u2019s 37-page response to the Little Sisters of the Poor\u2019s request for an injunction against the HHS abortion-pill...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A Central Deception in the Obama Administration\u2019s Case Against the Little Sisters of the Poor | American Center for Law and Justice"}, "google-translate-customization": "b9e3cfed32f5d748-542d1652bc3059d9-gd4d1c5bb4fc58f82-8", "revisit-after": "1 day", "article": {"section": "ObamaCare", "published_time": "2014-01-03T20:43:18.000Z"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "description": "A key theme of the Obama administration\u2019s 37-page response to the Little Sisters of the Poor\u2019s request for an injunction against the HHS abortion-pill..."}, "article_summary": "After all, religious entities (including the Little Sisters of the Poor) fill out forms without objection all the time.\nA key theme of the Obama administration\u2019s 37-page response to the Little Sisters of the Poor\u2019s request for an injunction against the HHS abortion-pill Mandate, boils down to this: It\u2019s just a form.\nHere\u2019s their argument in a nutshell: The law merely requires the Little Sisters of the Poor to certify their religious objection to the third-party administrator of their self-insurance plan.\nThe Little Sisters object to providing an abortion/contraception voucher \u2014 a voucher that could be redeemed for free abortifacients at the discretion of a third-party administrator.\nBut here\u2019s the problem: The certification is not an \u201copt out,\u201d it\u2019s a document that actually empowers a third party to provide free abortion pills."}
