Participants answered questions, were weighed, as well as measured for body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. In order to measure mortality, researchers referenced death records collected by Korea\u2019s National Statistical Office.\n\nThe results showed the 12.6 percent of participants with metabolic syndrome at baseline were nearly twice as likely to die from cardiovascular disease in comparison to participants without metabolic syndrome; 542 subjects had died when researchers followed up with program participants three years later. The risk of death was even greater for women with metabolic syndrome.\n\nBut interestingly, when researchers factored out participants with diabetes or high blood pressure, this wasn\u2019t the case.\n\n\"The analysis tells us diabetes and high blood pressure are significant factors that elevate the risk of death from cardiovascular disease among people with metabolic syndrome,\" Dr. Eun-Jung, study co-author, said in a press release. \"Younger people who have metabolic syndrome should be aware of the risk, particularly those who have diabetes and high blood pressure.\"\n\nThe Endrocrine Society estimates 22.9 percent of adults in the U.S. have metabolic syndrome. The Society adds the average medical cost for someone with metabolic syndrome is a little over $40,000 versus the average $33,000 individuals without diabetes, high blood pressure, or additional risk factors have to pay.\n\nHowever, metabolic syndrome doesn\u2019t only worsen cardiovascular disease. One study found a \u201cborderline significant relationship between metabolic syndrome and glaucoma,\u201d while another study suggested there may be a relationship between metabolic syndrome and breast cancer.\n\nThere are a wide range of treatments available to help individuals control their risk factors, from surgery to lifestyle intervention; an individual\u2019s treatment will vary depending on their personal needs. Generally, modifying eating habits, physical, and sedentary activity are recommended to mitigate these risk factors for disease.\n\nSource: Sung K-C, K, Rhee E-J, et al.
