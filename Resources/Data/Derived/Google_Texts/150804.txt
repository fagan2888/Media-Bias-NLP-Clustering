WASHINGTON â€” General Motors, or GM, is recalling an additional 284,000 older Chevrolet cars due to a potential fire hazard. The number of recalls for the American automaker stands at 29 for this year.

Reuters reported that at least thirteen deaths were linked to a defective ignition switch.

GM has recalled 2.6 million vehicles worldwide, but a majority within the U.S. The latest recall is for 284,913 Aveo and Optra cars ranging from the 2004 to the 2008 models. The defect is an issue with the daytime running lights that could potentially overheat and could cause a fire.

At least 70 lawsuits have been filed against the automaker since the problems began to arise.
