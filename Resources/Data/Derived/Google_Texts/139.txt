PORT CHESTER, N.Y. (AP) â€” New York day laborers and young men at a boy's home are building a wooden chair, altar and lectern that Pope Francis will use when he celebrates Mass in Madison Square Garden this September.

The workers who made the chair said Thursday they feel honored and humbled. The workers, from Del Bosco Workers and Obreros Unidos de Yonkers, are building the chair in a garage in Port Chester.

New York Archbishop Cardinal Timothy Dolan said on Thursday in a visit to the site that he was proud of them. He also traveled to Lincoln Hall Boys Haven, in Lincolndale, New York, where young men there are building an altar and lectern the pope will use at the Mass.

The finished chair will be light brown with a white back.
