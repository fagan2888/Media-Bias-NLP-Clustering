In the U.S. Latinos now count for 10 percent of the voting population. In swing Colorado, over the last three presidential elections, the Latino voting population grew from 8 percent to 14 percent. In swing Nevada: 10 percent to 18 percent.\n\nWhy can\u2019t the mainstream GOP do something? Because, you know: Holding the line against any immigration reform that might pass and please Latinos (i.e. reform that does more than \u201csecure the border\u201d and \u201cenforce the laws on the books\u201d) is a cornerstone Tea Party issue, and the Tea Party shows (1) no signs of letting up on pressuring the mainstream GOP on immigration and (2) all signs of continuing to dominate GOP primary campaigns.\n\nFrom the front-lines just this week:\n\nUniversity President and Bush Administration veteran Ben Sasse became the anti-Obamacare Palin-populist who won a Nebraska three-way primary on his way to becoming the \u201cnext Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nFormer Maryland state senator Alex Mooney \u2014 who moved to deep-red West Virginia and rallied the Tea Party there \u2014 beat out two GOP primary opponents for the certain chance to represent the state\u2019s second congressional district.\n\nAnd also of note: Anti-illegal immigration firebrand and one-man cottage industry Tom Tancredo is running in the lead in the Colorado Republican primary for governor.\n\nWhat does it look like inside this conservative-politics civil war? If you\u2019re not signed up as a subscriber to a Tea Party-style email list and you don\u2019t make a habit of listening to talk radio or reading Tea Party blog Red State, here\u2019s a fairly raw artifact from the trenches, a fundraising letter from Nevada-based Western Representation PAC. The claims are unsupported. The tone is unmistakable. The target is the mainstream GOP:\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "The GOP is speeding into another presidential election year facing the same \"Latino problem\" that destroyed any chance for victory in 2012.
