Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Congress approved an 11th-hour deal late last night to end the 16-day partial government shutdown and pull the nation back from the brink of an historic default. The spending measure passed the Senate and House of Representatives after Republicans dropped efforts to use the legislation to force changes in the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. Obama signed the spending bill last night.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: But, once again, I want to thank the leadership for coming together and getting this done. Hopefully next time it won\u2019t be in the 11th hour. One of the things that I said throughout this process is, we\u2019ve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The spending bill offers only a temporary fix. It funds the government until January 15th and raises the debt ceiling \u2019til February 7th.\n\nWe go now to Washington, D.C. We\u2019re joined by longtime Democratic Congressmember John Conyers of Michigan, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, has served more than 48 years in Congress, longer than any other African-American lawmaker, one of the longest-serving lawmakers in Congress.\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now!, Congressmember Conyers. Talk about the significance of this crisis for the moment being averted and what it cost the country.\n\nREP. JOHN CONYERS: Top of the morning, Amy.\n\nWe finally, after 16 days, at the last hours, were able to get to some agreement that is really very short-lived. The continuing resolution only lasts 'til the middle of January\u2014on Martin Luther King's birthday, ironically\u2014and the debt ceiling expires on February 7th. So, this is merely kicking the can down the road, as they say.\n\nI think it\u2019s important, but I\u2019m still trying to rationalize how the non-tea-party Republicans in the House can let the tea-party-oriented members in their caucus control everything. And it\u2019s really kind of disappointing, because you can\u2019t negotiate whether\u2014over a dispute over one measure, which creates healthcare for millions of Americans that can\u2019t afford it, that we would close down the funding of the entire government. This is a tactic that is so obviously out of place and makes the legislative process literally unworkable. And so it\u2019s my hope that we can figure out a way to get this rolling again.\n\nSpeaker Boehner is in an incredible position, and his legacy is going to be determined by whether he continues to cave in to the ultra-conservatives in his caucus or not. To his credit, it seemed to me that he wanted to be more cooperative, but he was afraid of even being dismissed from the speakership. I think he\u2019s over that kind of a hump, but it\u2019s at a cost of $24 billion, 800,000 people out of work. And then the government, after we signed it late last night, they say, \"All government workers, please come to work the very next day.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN: When you say cost of $24 billion, why did it cost the country, this shutdown?\n\nREP. JOHN CONYERS: Well, the shutdown took funding wherever there was federal funding, which is laced into so many of the important programs\u2014for young people, for schools, for healthcare. And all of those people that would have been working would have been getting income and spending it. And so, that\u2019s where the cost figure comes from, from Standard & Poor\u2019s.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And there\u2019s another $3 billion. Clearly, Senator Mitch McConnell, who is being credited with helping to resolve this conflict, got a big payment back for Kentucky, a $3 billion earmark\u2014\n\nREP. JOHN CONYERS: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014for a dam.\n\nREP. JOHN CONYERS: Yes, it\u2019s\u2014there were\u2014there are a lot of things that were filtered into it that really had nothing to do with it. But we\u2019re still wrestling, in the minds of many legislators, the issue between austerity and investment. And to me, that argument has been resolved in favor of investment, but there are still people that think that we can save our way. And this overemphasis on the national debt, to me, ignores the fact that we lost jobs. We lost work. We need a full employment bill. It\u2019s my hope that we can take the aim to create full employment for everybody in America and put it number one on our domestic agenda, so that we create jobs and that we train people for important work and how to work.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Now, Congressmember Conyers, President Obama has agreed to put Social Security and Medicare on the table. You rallied with members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and retiree advocates against the proposed chained CPI Social Security cuts. So, this certainly isn\u2019t over.\n\nREP. JOHN CONYERS: No, no, not at all. And, you know, the president has been stable, and he and Majority Leader Reid, they set a good example for us. And I think that he\u2019s got to really create a legacy that has a lot more to do with putting everybody back to work. The recession is not over yet. The recovery is slow. Unemployment is still way too high. And there\u2019s so much more that we could do.\n\nAnd to think that you would have so many members, 144 in the House and 18 in the Senate, who would say, \"Well, there\u2019s nothing wrong with shutting down the whole government, not raising the debt ceiling, and really hurting the credit rating of the largest, most powerful country in civilization.\" And it\u2019s just unimaginable, the actions that they would turn to to get their way on a very small and modest bill, \"Obamacare.\" We\u2019re talking about universal healthcare for everybody, single-payer. That\u2019s what the new direction is. And yet, this kind of \"everything or nothing, and we\u2019re going to get our way on any bill,\" that kind of an attitude destroys, really, or compromises the democratic legislative process\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Do you think we\u2019ll see\u2014\n\nREP. JOHN CONYERS: \u2014in a very big way.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Do you think we\u2019ll see single-payer in your lifetime? I mean, you\u2019re celebrating almost 50 years in Congress. In the next 50 years that you serve?\n\nREP. JOHN CONYERS: I think we\u2019re on the way to single-payer because it\u2019s been proven in all of the studies in the countries that have it that it\u2014that it\u2019s cost-effective and it\u2019s healthier for people. It saves money. We spend far more money than anybody in the world on\u2014of countries on healthcare. And our results are really not that encouraging.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We\u2019re going to go to\u2014\n\nREP. JOHN CONYERS: So, I\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We\u2019re going to go to break, but we\u2019re asking you to stay with us for the hour, because we\u2019re going to go back in time to a case that has been unresolved for 28 years, one that you\u2019ve been involved with from the very beginning\u2014\n\nREP. JOHN CONYERS: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014calling for hearings and an investigation. And it\u2019s the death of Alex Odeh, who was one of the leaders of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, blown up by a pipe bomb when he opened the door to his office and received a package. This was in Orange County, California. We\u2019re going to talk about the call for a new investigation in his assassination.
