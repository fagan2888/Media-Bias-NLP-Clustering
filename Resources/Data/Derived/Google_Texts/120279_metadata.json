Though not contagious to humans, CWD is spread among most deer-like species through the exchange of bodily fluids, including urine. Unregulated bottled doe-in-estrus scents, it is believed, could spread the CWD prions.\n\nDuring a recent interview about deer lures and concerns about CWD, Brackett challenged the need for a urine scent ban and the widely accepted belief that the disease is fatal.\n\n\u201cThere has never been an animal die of CWD,\u201d Brackett said. \u201cNever, never, never.\u201d\n\nFor accuracy, he was asked to repeat the claim and expand on it.\n\n\u201cI was fortunate enough to learn from a person who was one of the first people to discover CWD. I picked his brain for nine days,\u201d said Brackett. \u201cThe fact is, what does with CWD do \u2026 they\u2019re not dying from it. I think we\u2019ve got a lot bigger problems than urine being spread.\u201d\n\nWith no single universally accepted authority on chronic wasting disease, Brackett said, \u201cpeople are just going to guess and guess.\u201d Pressed for more information on his theory, Brackett suggested the disease is the result of human activity.\n\n\u201cIf you trace back CWD and where it comes from, it\u2019s from nuclear testing out West,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck \u2026 \u201d\n\nBrackett\u2019s \u201cFear No Evil\u201d show airs on a cable channel received by nearly 40 million U.S. households and in more than 50 countries, according to an Outdoor Channel website.\n\nWayne Laroche, director of the Game Commission\u2019s Bureau of Wildlife Management, said he agrees with Brackett that there\u2019s a lot still to learn about chronic wasting disease. But one point, he said, is undeniable.\n\n\u201cGoogle CWD and go to any site,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery one of them says the same thing: always fatal.\u201d\n\nAmong scientists from leading universities and federal and state wildlife agencies, the lethality of chronic wasting disease is undisputed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention refer to CWD as \u201ca fatal wasting syndrome.\u201d The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service calls it \u201ca progressive, fatal, neurological disease,\u201d and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees deer farms, describes a \u201cprogressive death.\u201d In Brackett\u2019s home state, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources reports that as of last summer a total of 538 deer were confirmed to have died from exposure to the \u201cfatal neurological disease.\u201d\n\nResearch continues. In 2015, the University of Texas Health Science Center found that when infectious single-protein prions bind to plants, they can be eaten and transferred orally. Despite hunters\u2019 use of commercial deer attractants, studies on deer olfactory communication cast doubt on their effectiveness.\n\n\u201cWhen comparing rutting buck urine, human urine, estrous doe urine and \u2018new car\u2019 scent, there was no difference in visitation [of mock scrapes],\u201d said Game Commission deer biologist Jeannine Fleegle. \u201dThe conclusion was that deer were visiting out of curiosity and not out of sexual attraction.\u201d\n\nIn a low but growing number of states, CWD control includes banning urine-based deer attractants It\u2019s a growing concern for manufacturers of some hunting products.\n\n\u201cThere is not a commercial test available to detect prions in urine. Removing them would be nearly impossible,\u201d said Fleegle.\n\nThe Game Commission has confirmed CWD at deer farms in Adams and Jefferson counties, and in free-ranging wild deer in Blair and Bedford counties.\n\nThe Allegheny Sport, Travel and Outdoor Show runs Feb. 17-21 at Monroeville Convention Center.
