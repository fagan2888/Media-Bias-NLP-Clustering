Yoga can do wonders for mental and physical health, which is exactly why the Prison Yoga Project wants to bring the ancient practice to prisons. Yoga that incorporates mindfulness and other embodiment practices can release Complex Trauma, a common condition in the incarcerated population, and alter damaging behavioral patterns. You can help provide prisoners with yoga manuals to further their practice here.\n\n4. Sustainability in Prisons Project\n\n6. Code.7370\n\nThe Last Mile believes that jobs are the key to breaking the cycle of incarceration. An estimated one million software engineering positions will open up in 2020, leading the nonprofit to launch Code.7370, the first computer coding curriculum in a U.S. prison, last year. Inmates at California\u2019s San Quentin State Prison will learn the ins and outs of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python, while building resumes that might soon interest Silicon Valley startups\n\nFor more information, watch WIRED\u2019s short film on the innovative coding project:\n\n7. The Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program\n\nThe Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program creates partnerships between universities and correctional systems in an effort to \u201cdeepen the conversation and transform our approaches to crime, justice, freedom, [and] equality.\u201d College students sit beside inmates as peers for the duration of a semester-long course. Most notably, class participants collaborate on a final project, encouraging teamwork and mutual understanding. Not only do undergraduates get the chance to reexamine their stereotypes of prison, but inmates also benefit from regular access to higher education. Both groups benefit from new friendships and participation in an ongoing, evolving dialogue. This year over 100 universities and colleges will offer Inside-Out courses globally.\n\nMichelle Alexander, author of \u201cThe New Jim Crow\u201d explains precisely what makes Inside-Out unique and effective: \u201cIt\u2019s so important that we end the separation between \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 \u2014 those labeled \u2018prisoners,\u2019 \u2018criminals,\u2019 \u2018felons.\u2019 It is this separation and demonization of the \u2018others\u2019 \u2014 and our failure to truly see, hear, and engage with those who have been locked up and locked out \u2014 that makes it easy for us to remain in deep denial about what we, as a nation, have done. Inside-Out challenges that denial in a powerful way.\u201d\n\n8.
