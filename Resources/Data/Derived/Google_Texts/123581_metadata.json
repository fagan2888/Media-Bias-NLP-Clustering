But union workers are criticizing the plan, which they argue could drive up costs for some seniors who\u2019ll need to find coverage in the private market.\n\n\u201cThe changes in the Affordable Care Act make it no longer necessary for the city to provide supplemental prescription drug coverage as of 2020,\u201d said Andrew Kleine, the city\u2019s budget director. Kleine acknowledged that some seniors could pay more after the change.\n\n\u201cIt will depend a lot on to what extent they use brand name versus generic drugs,\u201d Kleine said. \u201cThe more generics you use, you could end up paying less. The more brand-names you use, you could end up paying more. We think, on balance, most retirees won\u2019t see significant change in their costs.\u201d\n\nBecause the federal government is phasing in the increased coverage, Baltimore is beginning to see health care savings. City officials say they project saving between $7.4 million and $9.2 million a year between 2016 and 2019.\n\nOnce the city stops paying for prescription drugs under Medicare in 2020, officials expect to save $17.3 million for the city budget.\n\nThe plan is the latest in a series of cuts and overhauls of the costly municipal health care system, including an audit that cut 1,600 spouses, children and others from coverage and programs requiring city workers to pay more while incentivizing cheaper drugs. Maryland Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said last year that nearly half of Baltimore\u2019s municipal employees and retirees have a \u201ccritical or chronic\u201d illness \u2014 a distinction that contributes to the high cost of providing their health insurance.\n\nCity officials say their policy changes have reduced the unfunded liability for health care from $2.5 billion to $1.3 billion.\n\n\u201cThe whole series of reforms we made are saving us $100 million a year,\u201d Kleine said. He added the budget office has more plans to cut down on prescription drug costs, noting the city pays about $1 million a year for erectile dysfunction pills for its workers and retirees.\n\nGlenard S. Middleton, whose union represents many city workers, said the cumulative effects of the city\u2019s health care cuts have hurt retirees.\n\n\u201cThe average worker that is retired now is living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are folks who gave their lives to the city. If they have to go out on their own, it\u2019s not going to be as good of coverage.\u201d\n\nKristin Barcak, the city\u2019s 10-year financial plan project manager, said the Affordable Care Act could provide more desirable coverage for some seniors.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have more flexibility in the marketplace,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can choose a plan that best meets their needs.\u201d\n\nlbroadwater@baltsun.com\n\nTwitter.com/lukebroadwater", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "City plans to stop paying for Medicare prescription drugs", "Description": "Officials say cut, made possible by Obamacare, will save $17.3 million a year; unions say plan could hurt retirees", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Baltimore Sun", "author": "Baltimore Sun", "og": {"site_name": "baltimoresun.com", "description": "Baltimore officials this week sent about 40,000 letters to city employees and retirees, telling them the city will no longer pay for prescription drugs under Medicare as of 2020.", "title": "City plans to stop paying for Medicare prescription drugs", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bal-city-to-no-longer-pay-for-medicare-prescription-drugs-20141022-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5448712f/turbine/bal-city-to-no-longer-pay-for-medicare-prescription-drugs-20141022", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp01.15", "twitter": {"site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/81755777", "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-10-23", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2949\"", "article_summary": "Baltimore officials this week sent about 40,000 letters to city employees and retirees, telling them the city will no longer pay for prescription drugs under Medicare as of 2020.\nOnce the city stops paying for prescription drugs under Medicare in 2020, officials expect to save $17.3 million for the city budget.\nCity officials say their policy changes have reduced the unfunded liability for health care from $2.5 billion to $1.3 billion.\nGlenard S.
