The issue has waxed and waned over the years, but to date, full-on price controls of Rx\u2019s in public pharmaceutical programs has never taken hold. Tom Norton\n\nToday, however, as several historical and contemporary factors continue to line up, I think we may be on a pathway to change all that. In fact, we may take major steps towards Rx price controls for all public drug programs as early as 2016.\n\nConsider these historic public Rx price control progressions\u2026\n\nCalifornia\n\nThe Rx industry has always paid close attention to the prescription drug policies that are adopted by the State of California. Why? Simple. It\u2019s the largest state in the nation, and has a long history of being the first to adopt Rx public policy that the rest of the county is frequently not quite ready to accept, but often ends up following.\n\n1988 was one of those \u201cCalifornia policy moments\u201d. It occurred when the California MediCal (Medicaid) program, then and now, among the largest in the nation, began discussing the idea of \u201ccontrolling the price of Medicaid drugs through rebates.\u201d\n\nThe \u201crebate\u201d would be achieved by extracting \u201cdiscounts\u201d from the manufacturers who wanted to sell their Rx\u2019s on the MediCal formulary. If they didn\u2019t rebate, they didn\u2019t sell. Needless to say, the industry didn\u2019t care for this idea.\n\nHowever, in 1989 one Rx manufacturer determined they could make the \u201crebate\u201d scheme work for them. The firm calculated that if they were first to offer MediCal a \u201crebate\u201d for one of their leading Rx\u2019s, they could essentially \u201ccorner\u201d the market for that important indication.\n\nAnd so it happened. The company was Merck -- and the product \u201ccornered\u201d on the MediCal formulary via MediCal\u2019s first \u201crebate\u201d was the highly successful anti-cholesterol Rx, Mevacor. The rest is history.\n\nMerck\u2019s decision caused a rush by other manufacturers to sign up for MediCal\u2019s \u201crebate\u201d, even though there was considerable concern expressed within the industry that California\u2019s \u201crebate\u201d deal set a \u201cvery bad public sector precedent\u201d.\n\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 1990\n\nVery quickly, the idea of price controlling all Medicaid drugs, based largely on the successful California \u201crebate\u201d program, was adopted and passed by Congress in OBRA \u201890. The new law mandated that the industry sell Rx products to every state Medicaid program in the nation \u201cat the very best price available to any purchaser\u201d (See p. 15). Although the industry was ultimately able to avoid the V.A.\u2019s \u201cfixed pricing\u201d as the new \u201cbest price\u201d, eventually the OBRA \u201990 discount did end up at a significant 15% off versus retail prices.\n\nToday, Medicaid rebates driven by both federal and state laws have gone way beyond that 15% level. Collectively, the average is now running at about a 40% rebate (See p. 7).\n\nSo, by 1990, all Medicaid Rx\u2019s were basically in a \u201cprice controlled\u201d realm.\n\nMedicare Part D\n\n10 years later, the cry for price controls rose again, this time over the price of drugs prescribed for senior citizens. Seniors loudly claimed that \u201cprescription drugs were cheaper in Canada\u201d and demanded US access to the Canadian Rx\u2019s. In response, several states and cities set up Rx importation schemes with Canadian generic firms.\n\nMore dramatically, it was often stated during this period that retirees were \u201ceating cat food in order to afford their Rx drugs\u201d.\n\nPresident George W. Bush, who faced the \u201cseniors\u2019 prescription drug issue\u201d during his 2000 presidential campaign, decided to put the matter rest. Bush felt if the Republicans went into the 2004 campaign with reasonably priced Rx\u2019s available for all Medicare seniors, it would net out as a positive for Republicans in 2004.\n\nSo Medicare Part D, designed to provide low cost drugs to all Medicare patients, was born. It was a grand theory, but one that was certainly controversial. Again, Rx manufacturers voiced serious concerns about this new entitlement and what it would ultimately do to pricing. However, as was the case in California in 1989, the industry caved on Part D.\n\nSoon after enactment, however, the drug manufacturers came face-to-face with a new acronym closely associated with the new Part D program. That acronym was \u201cPBM\u201d\u2026pharmaceutical benefit manager\u2026a term industry product managers soon came to associate with deep discounts on Part D drugs.\n\nObamacare\n\nA few years later in 2008, Obamacare was passed. Although most of the pharmaceutical industry viewed the new law as an existential threat to its continued existence, the business nevertheless decided to \u201cdeal\u201d with the Administration. In the end, it was agreed that in exchange for big pharma\u2019s broad support of Obamacare, the Administration would \u201cguarantee\u201d that no Medicaid, or V.A.-like price controls would be placed on Medicare prescriptions.\n\nFollowing passage, however, it became quickly became clear the industry faced challenges with the new law. For example, the legislation contained several mandates such as the use of \u201cevidence based medicine\u201d, as well as an entire \u201cPCORI\u201d bureaucracy, both dedicated to lowering Rx costs.\n\nAdditionally, there was soon evidence that Obama, or some future president, would eventually renege on the Rx Obamacare Rx \u201cdeal\u201d and go after price controls on Medicare prescriptions.\n\nCalifornia, (Again)\n\nMeanwhile, back in California, following the extreme disruption of the 2015 MediCal drug budget by the very expensive \u201cspecialty drug\u201d, Sovaldi, a little noticed bill was introduced in California by an obscure, freshman California Assemblyman named David Chiu. The bill, AB 463, \u201crequired drug manufacturers to file annual reports for their most expensive products that reveal all their costs, from research to development to marketing, as well as profits and price increases.\u201d\n\nIt all sounds innocuous enough, but it clearly was not. Specifically, the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) was directed to gather the following from all Rx companies selling drugs in California:\n\nTotal research and development costs paid by the manufacturer or any predecessor manufacturer in the development of the qualifying drug\n\nTotal marketing and advertising costs\n\nTotal cost for materials and manufacturing\n\nTotal costs paid by government sources in the development of the drug, including subsidies and grants\n\nCumulative history of the Average Wholesale Price and Wholesale Acquisition Costs for the drug\n\nTotal profit attributable to the drug\n\nPresumably, following analysis of all this data, OSHPD will present the manufacturer with a \u201crecommended\u201d price for the Rx, as determined by the State of California.\n\nAB 463 was pulled by Assemblyman Chiu in May, but the assemblyman says given the current \u201cRx pricing environment\u201d, he will reintroduce his measure next session.\n\nProbably of more concern, however, is another California price control action known as the \u201cThe California Drug Price Relief Act\u201d. It was introduced through California\u2019s vibrant ballot proposition process and calls for the State of California not to purchase any drugs for any state Rx program that are not provided at the V.A. \u201cfixed price\u201d rate.\n\nNote: As of Aug. 19th, the needed number of California signatures to get the issue on the ballot (366,000) had been obtained. On Nov. 8, 2016, the measure will be voted on by all California voters. Remember, in California initiatives are binding.\n\nPopular Sentiment\n\nFinally, and thinking in particular about these California developments, a recent nationwide poll published by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the greatest \u201chealthcare\u201d concern of American\u2019s today is not the emergence of Obamacare, but rather the \u201cpricing of Rx pharmaceuticals\u201d. The results are not only surprising, they are compelling. Check out the general convergence of both Republican and Democratic sentiment on many \u201cdrug price control\u201d options, including public transparency on setting prices, and Medicare price controls.\n\nThe 2016 Pathway to Public Rx Price Controls\n\nSo how does the pathway to public Rx price controls lay out for 2016? Here\u2019s my best bet:\n\n\u2022 The U.S. drug industry will continue to price its new \u201cspecialty drugs\u201d at whatever the market will bear. These pricing policies will foster continued, general outrage by American public towards the Rx industry.\n\n\u2022 As a direct result, somewhere, likely California, the public\u2019s outcry will play out in civic action. It will either take the form of a pricing transparency bill, or perhaps a mandate that a state pay only V.A. fixed rate pricing for publicly purchased Rx\u2019s. Given the intensity of the August KFF findings, and how the industry is currently responding, I believe it\u2019s actually possible that both actions could succeed in California in 2016.\n\n\u2022 Assuming I am correct on this last point, it will only be a matter of time before similar concepts are introduced in Congress \u2014 just as the California rebate idea was in 1990. In Congress, the Rx price control target will be\u2026Medicare Rx\u2019s.\n\n\u2022 If Medicare Rx price controls are created, it will only be a short while until every private payer in the country is using the new \u201cMedicare prescription drug reimbursement rate\u201d as the floor for what they will pay for Rx\u2019s in private healthcare settings.\n\nAt that point, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, in both its public and private markets, will essentially be operating in a price-controlled environment. And with that, the era of \u201cfree market pricing\u201d for the American Rx industry will quietly pass into history.", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "The issue of drug price controls in public prescription programs has long been a point of contention.
