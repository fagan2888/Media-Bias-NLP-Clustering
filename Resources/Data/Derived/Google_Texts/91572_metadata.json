John Hickenlooper \u2014 who opposed the referendum that legalized marijuana in his state \u2014 said Monday he hasn\u2019t seen the economic fallout he feared.\n\nHickenlooper, whose priority has been luring businesses and entrepreneurs to Denver, Boulder, and other hubs, had worried a view of Colorado\u2019s as the stoner state could \u201cdistort all the work that we\u2019ve done\u201d in presenting a pro-business image, he said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen it yet,\u201d he said of the feared negative economic impact. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have been so aggressive and rigorous with implementing the regulations.\u201d\n\nThe referendum legalized the use of marijuana, as well as possession of up to an ounce, for all Colorado residents over 21. Titled \u201cAmendment 64,\u201d it went into effect on Dec. 10, 2012, after passing by a 9% margin of the popular vote the previous month, though legal sales of marijuana didn\u2019t begin until January of this year.\n\nHickenlooper, to the fury of the referendum\u2019s supporters, opposed it, but has worked with the nascent legal industry to impose a strict regulatory and tax regime \u2014 and he said the industry has been as cooperative as he always thought it would be.\n\n\u201cWe predicted that this would be an industry that would function like any other industry \u2014 that they would be no more or less driven or acquisitive than any other industry and they would be no more or less given to regulation and supporting regulation,\u201d Hickenlooper said between bites of breakfast burrito at a long desk in his Capitol office. \u201cThey look at their self-interest just like another business, but it\u2019s a whole different framework: No one has ever had a self-interest like this, where they have got to protect the right to do in a state what\u2019s illegal nationally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe industry was a great supporter of our very stiff tax rates; generally they\u2019ve been supportive of our pretty stiff regulation,\u201d he said.\n\nColorado residents can purchase up to an ounce of marijuana only from specialty licensed retail shops. Currently, only already-existing medical marijuana dispensaries are eligible for a recreational license, though this restriction will lift in October of this year. Retailers must properly label all products with clear information regarding warnings, serving size, and potency, and any marijuana magazines must be treated like pornography by being placed behind the counter. Additionally, those who choose to grow their own plants at home are limited to six plants, with only three flowering at any given time.\n\nHickenlooper said his main remaining worry is polling suggesting that legalization has persuaded young people that marijuana is perfectly safe, when many neurologists believe it can impair a developing brain.\n\nHe also said the benefits of tax revenues from the legal product can be overstated.\n\n\u201cThe other governors tease me, they say, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be so rigorous if I had $130 million in tax revenue projected,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to how the world thinks of your state as a place to build a business.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper, indeed, is running for reelection on a platform of economic growth and pro-business management. His state weathered the economic crisis better than most, and his regular emails to supporters bely much concern that marijuana has derailed its growth.\n\n\u201cWhile the rest of the country\u2019s economy is slowly picking back up, we\u2019re thriving here in Colorado,\u201d he wrote earlier this month.\n\nWeed also appears unlikely to be a central election issue. Hickenlooper opponent Bob Beauprez recently told ABC News that he\u2019d look for \u201ca way to agree with\u201d Hickenlooper on marijuana regulation.\n\nHickenlooper said he was \u201csurprised\u201d that Beauprez, a former congressman, had chosen to enter the race. \u201cI would have thought he would have supported a lot of our economic development stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nColorado, though, is the fulcrum of nearly every other divisive issue in the country: Hickenlooper is under assault from the right for his support of gun control, and from the left for backing the natural gas extraction technique known as fracking. Republicans, in particular, see an opportunity in tying Hickenlooper to the Affordable Care Act, which he supports, although Colorado\u2019s state-run health insurance exchange has not been as troubled as HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that it is going to be a difficult year for Democrats and I am going to be painted with that same brush,\u201d he said. And while he pointed to a rare decrease in the rate of growth in health care costs as a sign that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s cost-control measures are working, he says he doesn\u2019t expect that to help much with the politics. He also said he doesn\u2019t anticipate wanting President Obama (or any other out-of-state figure) to campaign for him.\n\n\u201cAs a campaign thing, when I walk into a room and say how many people hate the ACA, half of the hands or two-thirds of the hands in the room go up,\u201d he said.\n\nHickenlooper also quietly came out for marriage equality toward the bottom of a press release March 3, a decision he described Monday as a \u201cnuance\u201d and natural evolution from his longtime support for equal civil marriage rights, while leaving churches free to make their own decisions.\n\n\u201cThe debate had changed sufficiently that I think people can understand that supporting civil marriage is a way of saying I support every single right for every single person,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3094437, "userid": 238321}, "description": "Hickenlooper had worried about damage to Colorado's image...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
