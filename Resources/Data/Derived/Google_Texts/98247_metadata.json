Provided\n\nDavid Mark Reagan has a history of using girlfriends as punching bags, beating them bloody after drinking himself into a booze-soaked rage.\n\nThree women accused the 55-year-old painter of pummeling them at various times over the past seven years. Arrested in four domestic assaults and convicted of three, Reagan spent little time behind bars before he was back on the street again.\n\nReagan was free on bail, awaiting another trial on a domestic violence charge, when Charleston police say he raped and choked the life out of his latest girlfriend inside their West Ashley apartment on Aug. 20.\n\nWhile 52-year-old Kathy Hawkins\u2019 nude body lay on the living room floor, Reagan used her credit card to go buy an 18-pack of Budweiser at a convenience store, according to an arrest affidavit.\n\nReagan is being held without bail on charges of murder and first-degree criminal sexual conduct. While he sat in the Charleston County jail Wednesday, friends and family buried Hawkins, a divorced mother of one who was well-known in Charleston\u2019s food and beverage industry.\n\nHawkins taught for 15 years at Johnson & Wales University before the school closed its Charleston campus in 2006. She taught the art of running a commercial dining room, a skill she also plied at 82 Queen St. and other well-known restaurants around town.\n\nMim Runey ran the Charleston school and is now Johnson & Wale\u2019s chief operating officer and president of the university\u2019s Providence campus. She recalled Hawkins as a \u201chappy and energetic\u201d person with a true passion and talent for teaching. Others agreed.\n\n\u201cShe was truly a source of greatness for a lot of chefs who have moved on to be really something,\u201d said Phillis Kalisky Mair, who worked with Hawkins at Cypress restaurant downtown. \u201cThis is so sad.\u201d\n\nStories like these, however, are all too common in South Carolina, which ranked second-worst in the nation last year in the rate of women killed by men.\n\nThe cycle of abuse can be very difficult to break, and Elmire Raven, executive director of the My Sister\u2019s House battered women\u2019s shelter, expects little improvement in South Carolina\u2019s ranking when domestic homicide numbers are tabulated later this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to strengthen the laws,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is obviously a need to do more because women are still being killed.\u201d\n\nLong criminal record\n\nReagan, a craggy-faced man with salt-and-pepper hair, has a criminal history dating to 1977, when he was convicted of driving under the influence, according to State Law Enforcement Division records. Over the years, he also racked up convictions for marijuana possession, passing bad checks, resisting arrest, possessing a stolen vehicle, driving under suspension, disorderly conduct and criminal domestic violence, records show.\n\nReagan\u2019s first domestic violence arrest occurred in September 2006, about a week after his brother beat their 86-year-old mother to death with a cast iron frying pan at her Woodland Shores Drive home on James Island. His brother is serving a 35-year prison sentence for that crime.\n\nOn Sept. 6, 2006, Reagan returned to his West Ashley home from a night on the town and reportedly punched, kicked and kneed his live-in girlfriend, sending her to the hospital with bruises and three broken ribs, according to an arrest affidavit.\n\nHe was charged with criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature but later pleaded guilty to a charge of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature. Circuit Judge Thomas Hughston gave Reagan a five-year suspended sentence, placed him on two years probation and ordered him to get substance abuse counseling.\n\nHe was arrested in another domestic incident on St. Margaret Street in January 2010, accused of biting a new live-in girlfriend on the head and hand and tearing out a clump of her hair, court documents show. The woman told police that Reagan shouted at her, \u201cYou don\u2019t know who you\u2019re (expletive) with. I\u2019ve done this before. My brother killed my mother. I have it in me,\u201d according to an arrest affidavit. Reagan received 30 days in jail for the assault, SLED records show. It is unclear from records who sentenced him.\n\nHe was charged with domestic violence again in October of that year, this time for attacking Hawkins, who was now sharing an apartment with him on Royal Palm Boulevard. He pinned her to a bed while drunk, pummeled her face and body and threw her into two walls when she tried to escape, an arrest affidavit and police reports stated.\n\nReagan pleaded guilty to criminal domestic violence, and Circuit Judge Markley Dennis, giving him credit for the 60 days he had spent in jail, sentenced him to time served, court records show.\n\nIn January, Reagan was charged again with assaulting Hawkins while drunk at their apartment, police said. He had accused her of being unfaithful and allegedly beat on her face and grabbed her by the throat, according to an arrest affidavit.\n\nHawkins approached the 9th Circuit Solicitor\u2019s Office in June and requested that the charge be dismissed, but prosecutors declined, authorities said. Reagan was awaiting trial on that charge when he was charged with Hawkins\u2019 killing.\n\nTied to the crime\n\nInvestigators determined she had likely been killed up to 48 hours before her body was found by a neighbor inside her apartment, which was strewn with wine bottles and other debris, a report stated.\n\nNeighbors told police they had seen Reagan going in and out of the apartment around the time frame of the killing. They told investigators Reagan and Hawkins had been heavy drinkers and that Reagan appeared to be very drunk when they last saw him, police reports stated.\n\nDetectives determined that Hawkins\u2019 credit card had been used several times after her death, particularly at a convenience store on Rutledge Avenue. Video from the store showed Reagan stocking up on beer with her card, an arrest affidavit stated.\n\nA clerk at the store told investigators Reagan had visited the store on Aug. 22 and 23, grabbing an 18-pack of Bud each day. She said he seemed very pleasant, but noted that he had two or three cuts on his face, according to police reports.\n\nAn acquaintance of Hawkins told police \u201cher boyfriend beat the devil out of her quite a few times,\u201d according to a police report. She was a heavy drinker but had talked of going to rehab in Columbia just a week before her death, he told police.\n\nRaven, of My Sister\u2019s House, said it can be tempting in cases of domestic abuse to wonder why the person didn\u2019t just leave their attacker and choose another path. But emotional ties, controlling personalities and a host of other factors can get in the way of that happening. In the end, it is a decision that person must make for themselves, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it is difficult for most people looking in to understand,\u201d she said, \u201cbut unless you\u2019ve been in that person\u2019s shoes, unless you\u2019ve lived that person\u2019s life and gone through her journey, you just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nReach Glenn Smith at 937-5556 or Twitter.com/glennsmith5.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "West Ashley man accused of raping, killing girlfriend has history of abuse, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nCharleston, \r\nWest Ashley, \r\nWest Ashley,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "David Mark Reagan has a history of using girlfriends as punching bags, beating them bloody after drinking himself into a booze-soaked rage.", "title": "West Ashley man accused of raping, killing girlfriend has history of abuse", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20130903/130909945/west-ashley-man-accused-of-raping-killing-girlfriend-has-history-of-abuse", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20130903/PC16/130909945/AR/0/AR-130909945.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20130903/PC16/130909945/AR/0/AR-130909945.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "David Mark Reagan has a history of using girlfriends as punching bags, beating them bloody after drinking himself into a booze-soaked rage.", "title": "West Ashley man accused of raping, killing girlfriend has history of abuse", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20130903/PC16/130909945/AR/0/AR-130909945.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 130909945}}, "keywords": "West Ashley man accused of raping, killing girlfriend has history of abuse , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nCharleston, \r\nWest Ashley, \r\nWest Ashley", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-03T00:01:00Z", "modified_time": "2013-09-02T17:44:00Z", "author": "Glenn Smith"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "David Mark Reagan has a history of using girlfriends as punching bags, beating them bloody after drinking himself into a booze-soaked rage."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1410\"", "article_summary": "A clerk at the store told investigators Reagan had visited the store on Aug. 22 and 23, grabbing an 18-pack of Bud each day.\nHe was charged with criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature but later pleaded guilty to a charge of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.\nDavid Mark Reagan, 55, of West Ashley, is charged with killing Kathy Hawkins, 52, at their Royal Palms Boulevard apartment on Aug. 20.\nAn acquaintance of Hawkins told police \u201cher boyfriend beat the devil out of her quite a few times,\u201d according to a police report.\nReagan\u2019s first domestic violence arrest occurred in September 2006, about a week after his brother beat their 86-year-old mother to death with a cast iron frying pan at her Woodland Shores Drive home on James Island."}
