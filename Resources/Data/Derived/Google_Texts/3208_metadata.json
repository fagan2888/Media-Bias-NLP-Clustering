That\u2019s why we\u2019re working with law enforcement and they are looking at each incident individually as well as a whole, seasonal pattern.\u201d\n\nBest said all of the incidents were similar. Visitors returned to their cars to find their belongings missing. In some cases, car windows were smashed to give the thieves access.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we take very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect three things at our state parks: They should be safe, they should be clean and they should be fun.\u201d\n\nPark officials are putting up signs next week urging park visitors to be careful with what they leave in their cars.\n\n\u201cWe want folks to take the precautions,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a sign of the times, whether it\u2019s at a state park or a mall or any public parking area. We need to be cautious to reduce our risk of being a target.\u201d\n\nBest said the state has increased its ranger presence in the area and is working with the Androscoggin County Sheriff\u2019s Department to get additional patrols through the area.\n\n\u201cWhen they see people pull in, especially if they leave their windows down or are stowing their valuables, they approach them,\u201d Best said. \u201cPeople need to be very careful wherever they are. Our staff is doing their best about raising awareness, but they can\u2019t be everywhere all the time. People need to be careful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "POLAND, Maine \u2014 A rash of car break-ins this summer has state park officials urging Range Pond visitors to be careful about what they bring with them.
