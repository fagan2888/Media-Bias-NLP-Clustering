Researchers say that the exchanges might be the best option for workers and businesses, since it reduces the administrative burden for companies, and offers benefits like consumer decision for workers.\n\n\u201cEarly tremors in the market suggest a coming paradigm shift from a business-to-business model toward a business-to-consumer model of purchasing healthcare,\u201d the report said.\n\nRight now, more than 150 million Americans receive health coverage through their employers, but health policy experts and researchers expect that to change in the years ahead as the ACA begins to take hold. For instance, the employer mandate \u2013requiring businesses with 50 or more full-time workers to offer coverage to their full-time employees or pay a stiff penalty--will take effect in January of next year. So employers will have to decide whether to provide direct coverage or search for alternatives.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Mandate for Companies Under 100 Workers Delayed\n\nThis year, under the first open enrollment period, more than 8 million Americans signed up for health coverage on the exchanges, and that number is supposed to increase each year\u2014especially if employers are eyeing the exchanges as well.\n\n\u201cThe marketplace concept has captured the attention of employers with promises of cost control, enhanced employee experience and freedom from the day-to-day burdens of managing plan benefits,\u201d the report said. \u201cPrivate exchanges also represent an opportunity for businesses to move more easily from a defined insurance benefit to a defined contribution.\u201d\n\nThe idea of more companies shifting away from employer-based plans has actually been endorsed by some of the health care law\u2019s lead architects. Earlier this year, Ezekiel Emanuel, former Obama administration official, predicted in his book, Reinventing American Health Care that employers will gradually begin to shift their employees onto the public exchanges. Emanuel calls the move an \u201cunintended\u201d but \u201cpositive\u201d consequence of the law.\n\nThere are also other ways employers are trying to rein in their health costs. In another report released this week by the Kaiser Family Foundation, researchers found that other employers are going a different route to try to control their health costs\u2014like workplace wellness programs that encourage workers to live healthier lifestyles. The Kaiser survey found that at least 36 percent of companies with more than 200 workers, and 18 percent of businesses over all, have some sort of wellness program. Some programs offer discounts on health coverage to workers who complete health-risk assessments, others penalize poor performance or charge people more for high-risk health behaviors like smoking.\n\nThe New York Times noted a separate analysis by the Rand Corporation earlier this year found that about half of all companies with 50 or more employees have wellness programs.\n\n\n\nTop Reads From the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As new provisions under Obamacare began to take effect, more and more employers are co", "title": "Businesses Consider Dumping Employee Health Coverage", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/11/Businesses-Consider-Dumping-Employee-Health-Coverage", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06182013_Obamacare_Tax_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/11/Businesses-Consider-Dumping-Employee-Health-Coverage", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06182013_Obamacare_Tax_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As new provisions under Obamacare began to take effect, more and more employers are co", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd347a\"", "article_summary": "Some programs offer discounts on health coverage to workers who complete health-risk assessments, others penalize poor performance or charge people more for high-risk health behaviors like smoking.\nRight now, more than 150 million Americans receive health coverage through their employers, but health policy experts and researchers expect that to change in the years ahead as the ACA begins to take hold.\nA new survey of 1,200 businesses released today by the PricewaterhouseCoopers Health Research Institutes (PWC) found that one third of employers are now considering shifting their employees onto private health exchanges.\nAs new provisions under Obamacare began to take effect, more and more employers are considering shifting their workers onto private health exchanges\u2014instead of offering the traditional employer-based plans.\nSo employers will have to decide whether to provide direct coverage or search for alternatives."}
