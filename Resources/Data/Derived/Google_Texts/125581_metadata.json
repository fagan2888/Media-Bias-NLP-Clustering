(Stephan Savoia/AP)\n\nThose who came to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s appearance at the American Constitution Society\u2019s convention Saturday night looking for clues about how the court would decide its important remaining cases didn\u2019t find much more than this:\n\nShe certainly seemed in a good mood.\n\nThe Supreme Court in the next two weeks will announce whether the Affordable Care Act survives a challenge to the subsidies that millions of people use to purchase health insurance, and whether gay couples have a legal right to marry nationwide.\n\nIn a gentle interview with her former law clerk and now California Supreme Court Justice Goodwin Liu, there was no discussion of Obamacare.\n\nAsked about the public\u2019s rapid acceptance of gay rights, she repeated her view that it was a natural response to gay Americans being more open about their sexuality.\n\n\u201cGay people stood up and said, \u2018This is who I am,\u2019\u201d Ginsburg said, and Americans saw that the person was a neighbor, a child\u2019s best friend or maybe even their own children. They were \u201cpeople we know and love and respect.\u201d\n\nAs she was speaking, the gay pride parade was rolling through downtown just a few blocks away, and the Capital Hilton, where the ACS was meeting, was flying a rainbow flag just below Old Glory.\n\n\u201cThe court is not a popularity contest, and it should never be influenced by today\u2019s headlines,\u201d Ginsburg said. But she added that it \u201cinevitably it will be affected by the climate of the era.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s part of the explanation of why the gay rights movement has advanced to where it is today \u2014 the climate of the era.\u201d\n\nConservatives have criticized Ginsburg for such comments while the court is considering whether the Constitution forbids states from limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples. Ginsburg has officiated at several same-sex marriages in places where the unions are legal, leading some to call for her recusal from the case.\n\nThere was no criticism from a ballroom packed with the liberal legal establishment and adoring law students who Liu noted regard the leader of the court\u2019s left wing as an icon.\n\nLiu showed slides of T-shirts celebrating the Notorious RBG, as the popular Tumblr account has dubbed her. Another says \u201cYou Can\u2019t Spell Truth Without Ruth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d agreed Ginsburg, who was 60 when she joined the court. \u201cAn icon at 82.\u201d\n\nGinsburg said law clerks had to explain that her new nickname was based on the late rapper the Notorious B.I.G., but she noted that they were both \u201cborn and bred in Brooklyn.\u201d\n\nNext month the opera \u201cScalia/Ginsburg,\u201d based on her relationship with her friend and antagonist Justice Antonin Scalia, will get its premiere. And she talked about an upcoming movie that will star Natalie Portman and focus on Ginsburg\u2019s work as a crusading feminist lawyer. At its center will be a gender discrimination case she took on with her late husband, Martin Ginsburg.\n\nPortman told the justice that the project was briefly delayed, Ginsburg said, because the actress had insisted that the director be a woman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At a legal convention, the justice discussed gay rights but said nothing about Obamacare.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "At a legal convention, the justice discussed gay rights but said nothing about Obamacare.", "title": "Looking for clues to Supreme Court\u2019s final rulings in Ginsburg\u2019s good mood", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/looking-for-clues-to-courts-final-rulings-in-ginsburgs-good-mood/2015/06/14/b9690b46-1288-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/14/National-Politics/Images/Harvard_Ginsburg-078a2-4352.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scotusreporter"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/looking-for-clues-to-courts-final-rulings-in-ginsburgs-good-mood/2015/06/14/b9690b46-1288-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "courts", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139"}, "eomportal-uuid": "b9690b46-1288-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "courts"}, "article_summary": "On May 29, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg participated in an interview during a luncheon at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard.\nIn a gentle interview with her former law clerk and now California Supreme Court Justice Goodwin Liu, there was no discussion of Obamacare.\nAsked about the public\u2019s rapid acceptance of gay rights, she repeated her view that it was a natural response to gay Americans being more open about their sexuality.\n(Stephan Savoia/AP)Those who came to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s appearance at the American Constitution Society\u2019s convention Saturday night looking for clues about how the court would decide its important remaining cases didn\u2019t find much more than this:She certainly seemed in a good mood.\nAnother says \u201cYou Can\u2019t Spell Truth Without Ruth.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d agreed Ginsburg, who was 60 when she joined the court."}
