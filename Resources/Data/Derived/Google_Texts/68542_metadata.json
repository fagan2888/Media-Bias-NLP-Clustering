He has plunged into business and entrepreneurial ventures involving consulting, the paid lecture circuit and energy development. He has developed real estate, advised international investment banks and joined high-paying corporate boards.\n\n------------\n\nFOR THE RECORD:\n\nJeb Bush: An article in Section A on Dec. 26 about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's financial affairs quoted a spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, as saying that an investment fund, BH Global Aviation, was set up overseas to protect it from having to comply with U.S. business regulations. Actually, Campbell said the fund was structured that way because its only investment, Hawker Pacific, has no operations in the United States and therefore does not need to make U.S. corporate filings. \u2014\n\n------------\n\n\n\nBut as he considers a run for president in 2016, Bush has begun to unwind some of his financial affairs, apparently to avoid the kind of criticism that hobbled fellow Republican Mitt Romney in his unsuccessful bid for the White House in 2012.\n\nBush is quitting Tenet Healthcare Corp. \u2014 a company that has profited from Obamacare \u2014 and is ending a consulting contract with Barclays Bank to focus on his political future. Aides say he also has stopped giving highly paid speeches to focus on traveling America, meeting with potential donors and testing what a friend calls a \u201cvisionary\u201d brand of campaigning.\n\nBut Bush\u2019s business record, enmeshed in international finance and some troubled former ventures in south Florida, could end up complicating his return to politics and his hopes to follow his father, George H.W. Bush, and his older brother, George W. Bush, into the Oval Office.\n\nLast year, he took a step into the rarefied world of private equity and offshore investments, joining with former banking executives and a Chinese airline company to make bets on natural gas exploration and shipping. One of the funds was set up in the United Kingdom, a structure that allows the company to shield overseas investors from U.S. taxes.\n\nDuring the 2012 race, Romney drew ceaseless attacks from Democrats for his lucrative work at Bain Capital, a pioneering venture capital company that bought scores of troubled companies, took over their management and sometimes laid off employees while garnering huge fees and payouts.\n\nBut Bush and his aides argue that his investments and entrepreneurial ventures are different because he isn\u2019t taking control of companies and restructuring them.\n\n\u201cThese are all growth investments that the governor has worked on,\u201d said Bush\u2019s spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell.\n\nBush\u2019s latest undertaking is as a partner in three privately held funds that have raised a total of $127 million for investments in domestic and foreign companies. Bill Parish, an investment advisor in Portland, Ore., says the funds are fairly small in the private equity world.\n\nBut in the heat of a political campaign, Parish said, opaque investment vehicles, especially involving overseas accounts, inevitably will raise questions about the identities of his investors and the nature of their businesses.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s smart, he\u2019s going to take care of it and shut them down,\u201d Parish said.\n\nCampbell said the 61-year-old former governor is \u201creviewing all his engagements and his business commitments\u201d now that he\u2019s begun to focus on a potential race. \u201cThat\u2019s a natural next step,\u201d she said.\n\nBorn and raised in Texas, Bush moved in 1981 to Miami, where his wife\u2019s family lived, and went to work for a wealthy Cuban-born businessman, Armando Codina. Both had worked on George H.W. Bush\u2019s failed bid for the Republican Party\u2019s 1980 presidential nomination, and Codina ultimately made the younger Bush a partner in a south Florida real estate development firm.\n\nIn 1986, Bush got into politics when he was named Florida\u2019s commerce secretary. He quit in 1988 to help his father, then the vice president, win the White House. In 1994, the younger Bush lost his first race for the governor\u2019s mansion, but four years later he won, and ultimately became Florida\u2019s first two-term Republican governor.\n\nAfter leaving office in 2007, he set up Jeb Bush and Associates, a management consulting firm. His son, Jeb Bush Jr., serves as managing partner. Bush has said the firm\u2019s clients range from Fortune 500 companies to small tech startups, but Campbell declined to discuss the company\u2019s business or identify its clients.\n\nThat same year, Bush also was hired as an advisor to Lehman Brothers, the New York investment bank and financial services firm. When Lehman collapsed in bankruptcy in 2008 amid the global financial crisis, Bush shifted to Barclays, the London-based multinational banking and financial services giant that bought Lehman Brothers\u2019 North American divisions.\n\nHe got involved in a venture that provides disaster response services. He and two partners also set up another company, Maghicle Driverless, that is trying to develop self-driving vehicles for passengers and cargo.\n\n\u201cHe was grabbing at a lot of things to make money quickly,\u201d said Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida.\n\nNow Bush has begun to pull back.\n\nCampbell, the Bush spokeswoman, said he will leave Barclays by Dec. 31 to focus on a possible presidential run. She said his work for Lehman Brothers and Barclays was mostly offering clients \u201chis perspective on the impact of economic trends, regulations and policies.\u201d\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Bush resigned from the board of directors of Tenet Healthcare Corp., also effective Dec. 31, according to a corporate filing. The Dallas-based company actively supported the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and has seen its revenue rise from it, an issue that could draw fire in Republican primaries.\n\nBush earned cash and stock awards worth nearly $300,000 from Tenet in 2013, according to corporate filings. He also sold Tenet stock worth $1.1 million that year, the records show.\n\n\u201cMr. Bush is not resigning on account of any disagreement with Tenet,\u201d the company said.\n\nBush remains on the board of directors of a Florida-based timberland owner, Rayonier, which paid him about $200,000 last year, according to the company\u2019s proxy statement.\n\nSome of Bush\u2019s business ventures have gone badly.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Jeb Bush eases out of some businesses, such as firm helped by Obamacare", "Description": "As Jeb Bush considers a run for president in 2016, he has begun to unwind some of his financial affairs, apparently to avoid the kind of criticism that hobbled fellow Republican Mitt Romney\u00bfs unsuccessful bid for the White House in 2012.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "When Jeb Bush completed two terms as governor of Florida in 2007, he reported his net worth at $1.3 million, about $700,000 less than when he took office.", "title": "Jeb Bush eases out of some businesses, such as firm helped by Obamacare", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-jeb-bush-money-20141225-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-549c50a5/turbine/la-na-jeb-bush-money-20141225", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp11.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82392300", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-12-25", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "Some of Bush\u2019s business ventures have gone badly.\nBush is quitting Tenet Healthcare Corp. \u2014 a company that has profited from Obamacare \u2014 and is ending a consulting contract with Barclays Bank to focus on his political future.\nAfter leaving office in 2007, he set up Jeb Bush and Associates, a management consulting firm.\nThat same year, Bush also was hired as an advisor to Lehman Brothers, the New York investment bank and financial services firm.\nCampbell, the Bush spokeswoman, said he will leave Barclays by Dec. 31 to focus on a possible presidential run."}
