Marketing materials like emails, articles, and even videos can be scheduled to post when you need them to so that you are free to do other things. Borderless ecommerce techniques allow you to connect with your customers worldwide.\n\nBefore marketing your business on the internet, it is important to have a plan and create the assets you need to market. Assets are online properties where your business may be found. According to Priya Shah at Business2Community, the first, and a must have asset, is your website. A website is the home for your business online and the foundation for your internet marketing plan.

These strategies include search engine optimization of your website, creating business pages, and using specific industry portals for your business. Google, Facebook, and Twitter allow you to create a social marketing strategy to distribute your content and connect with your audience.\n\nGoogle allows you to use several different internet marketing strategies to market your business. They include indexing your site in the search engines, building a business page to showcase your business, and advertising to help you drive traffic to your business quickly.\n\nFacebook provides many of the same internet marketing opportunities since it offers fan pages and ads, and it is the top social marketing website online. Twitter allows for microblogging, which are short messages approximately 140 characters long, that allow you to communicate with and connect to your audience. Twitter also offers paid advertising opportunities for those who want to drive traffic quickly.\n\nInternet marketing tools help automate many of your internet marketing strategies and complete marketing tasks quickly.
