Here's help\n\nIf there's one thing that seems to unite employers and employees right now, it's that there is confusion when it comes to health care.\n\nEmployers struggling with rising costs now have a lump of potential taxes, fines, fees and requirements. Deadlines have moved \u2014 for example, the 2015 requirement for employers to offer qualified plans.\n\nEmployees are getting a lot of communication from insurance companies, from their employer and the things written in the papers. Meanwhile, there are things that apply to folks at small companies that don't apply to folks at large companies.\n\nThere's no easy answer for anyone.\n\nHowever, there are people who study this for a living. And there are employers that have ideas and strategies. There are resources for employees as well. That's the basis for this project.\n\nCrain's Detroit Business is proud to partner with the Greater Detroit Area Health Council on this HealthFacts project. The goal is to make information available.\n\nIn this collaboration, GDAHC has been a resource to Crain's for ideas on health care, the impact of the Affordable Care Act and the perspective of health care providers.\n\nCEO Kate Kohn-Parrott, formerly the director of benefits at Chrysler Group LLC, offers some advice to employees.\n\nIn addition to this package of stories, there has been a series of webinars through the year. Six employer-related webinars were hosted, and the second employee-related webinar will occur Thursday. Register at crainsdetroit.com/webinars. And this series will continue with a series of speakers addressing 2014 health care strategies at the Crain's Health Care Leadership Summit.\n\nThe event, to be held Oct. 29 at the San Marino Club in Troy, will approach the health care situation with ideas of innovative ways that the health care community is approaching challenges right now.

A look at hoe employers are charting their strategies.\n\nHow that \"Cadillac\" plan could become a train: With a 2018 tax facing employers who spend more than $10,000 on an employer, reducing costs will be a priority.\n\nCase study: Ansara Restaurant Group\n\nCase study: Key Safety Systems\n\nMassachusetts comes to Michigan: Some elements of the Affordable Care Act resemble an early plan in Massachusetts. Business and health care leaders from Massachusetts visited with local health care leaders and offered advice on how to adapt.\n\nDelays and changes: The U.S. government has delayed, by one year, the rule that businesses with 50 or more full-time workers must offer a qualified health plan for employers. What happens now?\n\n5 key strategies for communicating health care reform\n\nTop things for employers to look for in 2014\n\nTop 5 categories of questions that employers need to ask for 2014\n\nFor employees\n\nFasten your seatbelts: Employees should expect changes, lots of information and plenty of options over the next few years when it comes to health care. An overview.\n\nWhat to expect: Some advice from Kate Kohn-Parrott, former benefits director of Chrysler and current president and CEO of the Greater Detroit Area Health Council.\n\nWhat to know: A few key points on what employees should know about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPlenty of questions: A recent survey shows 69 percent of employees in the Detroit area want more information about health care.\n\nEmployee Q&A: Some of the basic questions that employees might have about benefits, answered by a consulting firm.\n\nCalculating the credit\n\nGlossary of important terms\n\nWhat it means for Michigan\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "If there's one thing that seems to unite employers and employees right now, it's that there is confusion when it comes to health care.Employers struggling with rising costs now have a lump of potential taxes, fines, fees and requirements.
