(Photo: istock/Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare)\n\nWith several initiatives underway to encourage and support mothers and infants, breastfeeding has become a Tallahassee community focus.\n\nA new Breastfeeding Policy Group began meeting in September with the goal of promoting policies to help mothers breastfeed for a longer time period, and Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare is progressing with its efforts to earn Baby-Friendly accreditation.\n\nThe breastfeeding initiation rate has climbed to 80 percent in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control, but the rate drops dramatically with less than 20 percent of moms continuing to breastfeed at six months.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding until age six months. Solid foods should be introduced around six months, but babies should continue to breastfeed for a year or as long as mother and baby want to continue, according to the AAP.\n\nA number of barriers prevent mothers from continuing to breastfeed, including difficulty pumping at work, a lack of support, difficulty accessing pumps and even public harassment.\n\n\u201cIt happens more than you think,\u201d said Dykibra Gaskin, public health nutrition program director for the Leon County Department of Health. \u201cWe get calls about women being in a store or in a restaurant and being told they can\u2019t breastfeed there. A lot of companies just don\u2019t know the law.\u201d\n\nUnder state statute, \u201cA mother may breastfeed her baby in any location, public or private, where the mother is otherwise authorized to be, irrespective of whether the nipple of the mother\u2019s breast is uncovered during or incidental to the breastfeeding.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also provided workplace protections. Employers with 50 or more employees must provide a private place for mothers to pump up to one year after a child\u2019s birth. That space cannot be a bathroom.\n\nEven with those changes, moms face challenges, Gaskin says.\n\n\u201cThey worry about being seen as someone who\u2019s not pulling her weight with the workload. They don\u2019t want to rock the boat and have a lot of anxiety. Do they have enough time to pump? Will their boss be supportive?\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires health plans to cover breast pumps for nursing mothers, but until recently, Medicaid in Florida did not require plans to cover pumps, leaving Medicaid moms with fewer options.\n\nA hospital-grade pump can cost upwards of $200. Breastfeeding mothers returning to work must pump multiple times a day to maintain their milk supply, so a quality pump is essential.\n\nThe Breastfeeding Policy Group, which includes doctors and other health-care providers and representatives from local human service agencies, is examining these and other issues and plans to advocate on behalf of moms.\n\n\n\nTMH progressing with accreditation\n\n\n\nEnsuring mothers and infants have a good start in breastfeeding is a focus at TMH.\n\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and the World Health Organization established the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative to encourage and recognize hospitals and birth centers that offer a high level of care for breastfeeding.\n\nHealth care experts and scientists agree breastfeeding is the best way to feed babies, and breast milk is known to reduce the risk of infant death and other chronic illnesses.\n\n\u201cFor the great majority of mothers and babies, the mother's breast milk really is the very best for that baby,\u201d said Dr. Tanya Evers, an OBGYN and faculty member of the TMH Family Medicine Residency Program. \u201cThe benefits cannot be replicated by even the most expensive formula. Women have been given the privilege of providing this gift to their children. My hope is that during the process of achieving and maintaining Baby Friendly status at TMH, we as a health care community can maximize our efforts in supporting mothers and babies in this important endeavor.\u201d\n\nTo be designated \u201cBaby-Friendly,\u201d hospitals must meet strict criteria that include a comprehensive written breastfeeding policy, training for staff and help for women to begin breastfeeding within an hour after birth.\n\nAchieving accreditation is a multi-year process, said Connie Styons, administrator of women and children\u2019s services. Steps TMH has already taken include delaying baths for newborns and giving them immediate skin-to-skin contact with mothers to initiate bonding and breastfeeding.\n\nNurses at TMH are completing training, which includes 15 hours of the curriculum approved by Baby-Friendly USA Inc. Nurses are also receiving training with lactation consultants. The effort includes a wide range of hospital staff, not just those directly connected to labor and delivery or family care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting everybody on the same page so we can help mothers around the clock,\u201d Styons said.\n\nPhysicians will also undergo training. The most success in breastfeeding occurs when health care providers talk about breastfeeding during prenatal care, Styons said.\n\n\u201cIf a mother doesn\u2019t read or ask or understand, or if no one mentions breastfeeding to her during the prenatal period, she may perceive it as not as important,\u201d she said.\n\nOnce mothers are discharged, TMH can refer them to local breastfeeding support groups. TMH and Capital Regional Medical Center, as well as other local organizations, have groups that meet weekly. The hospitals also have lactation consultants available.\n\nTMH\u2019s goal is to apply for accreditation by January. The next step would be a site visit and evaluation.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.tdo.com/1Sns1fS", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare continues to pursue \"Baby-Friendly\" designation.", "og": {"site_name": "Tallahassee Democrat", "description": "Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare continues to pursue \"Baby-Friendly\" designation.", "title": "Barriers prevent\u00a0babies from getting mother\u2019s milk", "url": "http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2016/04/18/women-face-challenges-breastfeeding-recommended-time/82609740/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tallahassee.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare continues to pursue \"Baby-Friendly\" designation.", "title": "Barriers prevent\u00a0babies from getting mother\u2019s milk", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffe0b278876434138caf277291ffaf0980e106b5/c=0-845-4016-4861&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/18/Tallahassee/Tallahassee/635965762033809538-breastfeeding-iStock-000040130748-XXXLarge.jpg", "creator": "@tdonline", "site": "@tdonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=828466230", "fb": {"app_id": 176414652381033}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Breastfeeding mothers returning to work must pump multiple times a day to maintain their milk supply, so a quality pump is essential.\nThe most success in breastfeeding occurs when health care providers talk about breastfeeding during prenatal care, Styons said.\nA number of barriers prevent mothers from continuing to breastfeed, including difficulty pumping at work, a lack of support, difficulty accessing pumps and even public harassment.\nHealth care experts and scientists agree breastfeeding is the best way to feed babies, and breast milk is known to reduce the risk of infant death and other chronic illnesses.\n(Photo: istock/Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare)With several initiatives underway to encourage and support mothers and infants, breastfeeding has become a Tallahassee community focus."}
