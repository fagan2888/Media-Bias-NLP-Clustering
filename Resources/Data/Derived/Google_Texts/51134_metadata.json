Big-shot producer Scott Rudin tells Sony co-chair Amy Pascal he thinks Angelina Jolie is \u201ca minimally talented spoiled brat\u201d? A-List director David Fincher is as difficult as Hitler was anti-Semitic? Tell us more!\n\nIn a new column for Time, I argue that as hacks become more common and more public, expect people to become in general to become more forgiving:\n\nEven a few decades ago, the release of nude photos was enough to cost Miss America her crown. However mortified they might be personally, none of the celebrities outed in the nude picture hack can claim much if any damage to their professional life. So it is with Hollywood hypocrisy and scandalous personal behavior, which has never been in short supply. Short of revelations of serious crime\u2014such as the rape allegations Bill Cosby is facing\u2014the public will simply consume any behind-the-scenes drama as something akin to a bonus track on a DVD. If anything, expect seemingly unauthorized \u201chacks\u201d to become strategically deployed to pique curiosity about projects. Certainly,The Interview is a more interesting movie when we know that studio executives wanted to tone it down. And expect Hollywood players\u2014phonies that they are\u2014to be the most forgiving of all. Rudin and Pascal have already apologized for their \u201cracially insensitive remarks\u201d and Pascal has begun a ritualized apology tour by phoning the Rev. Al Sharpton and promising to go on the tax-avoiding MSNBC host\u2019s show. Pascal has even managed to air kiss Angelina Jolie, the object of withering scorn in one of the most widely discussed email exchanges with Rudin. Most important, though, Rudin and Pascal have reportedly also forgiven each other for their harsh comments. Because in Hollywood, after all, it\u2019s who you know that counts most of all.\n\nRead the whole thing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "It was only a few months ago that everybody was livid when A-list celebs were hacked and naked selfies flooded the internet like Nigerian get-rich-quick", "title": "The Sony Hack Will Define Hypocrisy Downwards", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/12/12/the-sony-hack-will-define-hypocrisy-down", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_12/angelina-jolie-amy-pascal-post.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It was only a few months ago that everybody\nwas livid when A-list celebs were hacked and naked selfies flooded\nthe internet like Nigerian get-rich-quick emails used to.
