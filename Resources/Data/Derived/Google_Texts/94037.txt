Pa­tients ““ par­tic­u­larly minor­it­ies and those on Medi­care ““ are not act­ively mak­ing de­cisions about their treat­ments and pro­ced­ures be­cause doc­tor-pa­tient com­mu­nic­a­tion is poor, ac­cord­ing to a study presen­ted Thursday to Med­PAC, the Con­gres­sion­al ad­vis­ory com­mit­tee on Medi­care.

The res­ult is a great­er ex­pense for Medi­care and a lack of em­power­ment among pa­tients.

“Once pa­tients un­der­stand the risks and be­ne­fits of ex­pens­ive pro­ced­ures, they tend to opt for more con­ser­vat­ive treat­ment op­tions,” said Rita Red­berg, a Med­PAC mem­ber and pro­fess­or at the Uni­versity of Cali­for­nia San Fran­cisco School of Medi­cine.

It’s the reas­on phys­i­cians and hos­pit­als are res­ist­ing train­ing pro­grams that would teach care pro­viders to in­clude pa­tients in the de­cision-mak­ing pro­cess, Red­berg said, be­cause they lose money when pa­tients choose less-costly op­tions.

The de­lib­er­a­tions of the 17 Med­PAC mem­bers will be presen­ted as re­com­mend­a­tions to Con­gress and the De­part­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices.

Im­prov­ing health lit­er­acy, or the abil­ity of pa­tients to un­der­stand their health care and make in­formed de­cisions, is a stated pri­or­ity for HHS Sec­ret­ary Kath­leen Se­beli­us.

It’s a pri­or­ity that could come with sig­ni­fic­ant fin­an­cial im­plic­a­tions for the United States. In 2007, a team of re­search­ers es­tim­ated that low health lit­er­acy costs the U.S. between $106 and $236 bil­lion an­nu­ally. A num­ber of factors ac­count for those costs, in­clud­ing a pa­tient’s in­ab­il­ity to find the best pro­vider, treat­ment and ser­vices for his or her con­di­tion. The re­search­ers ar­gue the sav­ings would be enough to in­sure all of the more than 47 mil­lion pa­tients who were un­in­sured in the U.S. in 2006.

There’s room to grow ““ only 22 per­cent of Amer­ic­ans are re­por­ted to be “pro­fi­cient” when it comes to their un­der­stand­ing of health care costs and ser­vices, ac­cord­ing to a U.S. De­part­ment of Edu­ca­tion study.

Low-in­come adults are dispor­por­tion­ally af­fected. Health lit­er­acy was lower on av­er­age for adults liv­ing be­low the poverty level than those liv­ing above, the DOE’s 2003 Na­tion­al As­sess­ment of Adult Lit­er­acy found. As in­come in­creased, so did health lit­er­acy.

Ra­cial and eth­nic minor­it­ies had lower av­er­age health lit­er­acy scores than White adults, the study showed. Forty-one per­cent of His­pan­ic adults and 24 per­cent of Black adults had be­low ba­sic levels of health lit­er­acy, com­pared with 9 per­cent of White adults.

Those num­bers com­ple­ment Med­PAC’s find­ings that His­pan­ic and Black pa­tients re­port poorer com­mu­nic­a­tion with pro­viders than Whites and the 2012 Na­tion­al Health­care Dis­par­it­ies Re­port which found that His­pan­ic and Black pa­tients were less likely to be asked their pref­er­ences in treat­ment de­cisions.

The health lit­er­acy prob­lem also poses a chal­lenge for the suc­cess of the Af­ford­able Care Act. Once the ex­changes open on Oct. 1, the mil­lions of new pa­tients ad­ded to the sys­tem in the com­ing years are ex­pec­ted to have high rates of health il­lit­er­acy, as many of them may not have had health in­sur­ance be­fore.

How to in­form pa­tients ““ and who to hold ac­count­able for health in­form­a­tion ““ re­mains con­tro­ver­sial. Some Med­PAC mem­bers ar­gued that health lit­er­acy wasn’t only the re­spons­ib­il­ity of the pa­tient, but also the pro­vider, to ex­plain health op­tions in ways pa­tients can un­der­stand.

“What if pa­tients were treated with dig­nity and re­spect?” said George Miller, a Med­PAC mem­ber and CEO of Com­mUnity­Care in Aus­tin, Tex. “Maybe then they’d feel em­powered.”

The con­sensus among the group was that pa­tient en­gage­ment was an im­port­ant is­sue that needs to be ad­dressed, but they were un­sure how Medi­care would play a role.

“Health lit­er­acy is a re­spons­ib­il­ity of the Medi­care pro­gram in that we should be pay­ing for care that sup­ports shared de­cision-mak­ing,” said Mary Naylor, Med­PAC mem­ber and a pro­fess­or at the Uni­versity of Pennsylvania School of Nurs­ing.

But that, com­mis­sion mem­bers said, leaves the ques­tion of how Med­PAC would meas­ure suc­cess, and provid­ing fin­an­cial in­cent­ives for pa­tient-in­clu­sion ap­peared con­ten­tious.

The com­mis­sion will wrap up its meet­ing Fri­day at the Ron­ald Re­agan Build­ing, In­ter­na­tion­al Trade Cen­ter in the Ho­ri­zon Ball­room.
