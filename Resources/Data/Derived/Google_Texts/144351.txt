The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has caused headaches for the health care industry since it was passed — and benefits professionals have not been immune. Since the law’s passage, many employers — large and small — have ended long-term and short-term relationships with their benefits brokers. Some employers have simply moved employees over to PPACA’s exchanges, while others have opted for self-funding or simply found a better deal with someone else.

“It’s always been a part of the business, but it’s accelerated greatly over the past year, year-and-half,” says John Gaglione of Group Plan Solutions in Pekin, Ill. “It’s been a difficult time in the employee benefits business for a lot of agents. Ever since 2008, when the market crashed, there have been a number of companies ending business relationships. There’s not much you can do about it.”
