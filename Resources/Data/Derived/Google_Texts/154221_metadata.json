Bridge\u2019s successful scramble to the end zone for another apparent tying conversion was erased by a holding call, sending the crowd of 14,571 at Ladd-Peebles Stadium into a frenzy.\n\nBrendon Clements then intercepted Bridge\u2019s desperation heave into the end zone and the Midshipmen recovered the ensuing onside kick to ensure victory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of our guys. South Alabama is a good football team,\u201d said Navy head coach Ken Niumatalolo. \u201cWe knew we were going to have to battle them today. They had some turnovers in the first half, and we had some turnovers in the second half. It was a hard-fought game. \u201c\n\nSouth Alabama\u2019s head coach Joey Jones commented on the result of the final drive. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously pretty tough when you have a team that fights its guts out to get down there,\u201d said Jones. They fought their tails off to win the ball game.\u201d\n\nSouth Alabama (6-6) looked sharp on its opening possession, an 8-play, 73-yard drive capped by Terrance Timmons four-yard TD run for a 7-0 lead at 10:56 of the first quarter.\n\nSouth\u2019s Maleki Harris recovered the seventh fumble of his career on an errant pitch by Reynolds at the 25 on the ensuing Navy possession and Aleen Sunanon kicked a 34-yard field goal for a 10-0 lead.\n\nNavy (6-5) went for a fourth-and-1 at its own 45 with 6:20 left in the first and was stopped, but Bridge was intercepted by Myer Krah at the Navy 45 and he returned 31 yards to the South 29. A late hit tacked on an extra 15 yards and Navy was in business at the South 14.\n\nCopeland capped a quick two-play drive with a 13-yard TD run to cut it to 10-7 with 4:56 left in the first quarter. Bridge hit Smith on a 3-yard scoring pass with 35 seconds left in the quarter to make it 17-7.\n\nBridge threw his second interception of the game and Reynolds sprinted 67 yards to the end zone for a 17-14 score with 7:32 left in the half. Chris Swain gave Navy the lead for good when he bolted in from 34 yards out with 3:07 left in the half.\n\nCopeland\u2019s 3-yard TD run made it 28-17 lead with 9:04 left in the third, before Suanon kicked a 40-yard field goal to make it 28-20 with 3:43 left in the third.\n\nGeoffrey Whiteside fumbled on Navy\u2019s next possession and safety Jeremy Reaves recovered at the 41, but the play was overturned on replay.\n\nReynolds took it in from there for a 35-20 lead with 1:46 left in the third. Danny Woodson\u2019s 7-yard TD catch cut it to 35-27, but Reynolds got his third TD from 1-yard out midway through the fourth quarter for a 42-27 lead.\n\nBridge threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to Smith to cut the difference to 42-34 with 5:31 left.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Keenan Reynolds ran for three touchdowns Friday afternoon, and Navy survived a pair of South Alabama two-point conversion attempts that were both wiped out by penalties in the final seconds for a 42-40 win.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Keenan Reynolds ran for three touchdowns Friday afternoon, and Navy survived a pair of South Alabama two-point conversion attempts that were both wiped out by penalties in the final seconds for a 42-40 win.", "title": "Navy holds off South Alabama 42-40", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/28/navy-holds-off-south-alabama-42-40/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/28/navy-south-alabama-footballjpeg-09363.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/28/navy-south-alabama-footballjpeg-09363.jpg", "description": "Keenan Reynolds ran for three touchdowns Friday afternoon, and Navy survived a pair of South Alabama two-point conversion attempts that were both wiped out by penalties in the final seconds for a 42-4", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Navy holds off South Alabama 42-40"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Navy, Joey Jones"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a54\"", "article_summary": "A late hit tacked on an extra 15 yards and Navy was in business at the South 14.\nSouth Alabama is a good football team,\u201d said Navy head coach Ken Niumatalolo.\nMOBILE, Ala. \u2014 Keenan Reynolds ran for three touchdowns Friday afternoon, and Navy survived a pair of South Alabama two-point conversion attempts that were both wiped out by penalties in the final seconds for a 42-40 victory.\nChris Swain gave Navy the lead for good when he bolted in from 34 yards out with 3:07 left in the half.\nBridge threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to Smith to cut the difference to 42-34 with 5:31 left."}
