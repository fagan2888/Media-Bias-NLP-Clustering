But on Sunday, GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump handed the party\u2019s leaders what might be their best opportunity to keep their hold on the GOP and force Trump and his most rabid supporters into the political wilderness.\n\nRelated: Trump and Christie Steal Rubio\u2019s Thunder\n\nTrump, appearing on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, was asked three times by host Jake Tapper if he would decline the endorsement of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and other white supremacists. Three times, Trump demurred, absurdly claiming that he wasn\u2019t familiar enough with Duke or the KKK to take a position.\n\nIt may or may not have been the worst moment of the Trump campaign from a public relations perspective. For example, it didn\u2019t stop tens of thousands of people from filling a Madison, Alabama football stadium to watch him speak on Sunday evening. Nor did it deter U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who has had his own trouble with remarks about the KKK, from endorsing Trump at the rally.\n\nHowever, heading into the crucial Super Tuesday primaries tomorrow, it gave the GOP a powerful chance, if its leaders will take it, to repudiate his candidacy on the grounds of racism. Or, at least, openly pandering to avowed racists.\n\nTo be clear, this would be a strategic choice. There are, after all, myriad reasons to repudiate Trump\u2019s candidacy: his demonstrated lying, his appeals to xenophobia, fear and ignorance -- the list goes on. But for the leaders of the party to attack Trump on many of those points has always been problematic.\n\nRelated: With a Stream of Misspelled Tweets, Trump \u2018Chocks\u2019 Off Debate Critics\n\nPart of Trump\u2019s act involves presenting himself as a foe of the Republican Establishment. He insists that he will shake up a party that has ignored his supporters\u2019 wishes and needs. Were that party, as an Establishment, to attack him on a broad front, it would only reinforce his narrative.\n\nTrump\u2019s xenophobic rants appeal to his supporters\u2019 very real concerns about illegal immigration, and the party can\u2019t afford to belittle that. Pointing out that he\u2019s lying to them with impunity suggests that GOP leaders think Trump\u2019s Republican supporters are stupid. Blasting him for promising to order the armed forces to commit war crimes in the battle against ISIS risks being seen as ignoring their fear of terrorism.\n\nBut going after Trump for being racist \u2013 or at least associating himself with people who support racism \u2013 is a narrower target. Many people willing to defend their candidate\u2019s positions on immigration and terrorism would be far less comfortable publicly defending someone who is seen as appealing directly to racism.\n\nWould it cost the GOP some of its voters? Yes, undoubtedly. But here\u2019s the thing: The Republican Party has already been dramatically changed by Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2013 that just isn\u2019t apparent yet.\n\nRelated: Four Major Blind Spots Trump Voters Need to Correct\n\nShould Trump win the nomination, many members of the GOP, disgusted with the tone and substance of his campaign, are going to sit out the election rather than vote for him, or bolt the party altogether. There are already very public rumblings about efforts to form a separate conservative party.\n\nIf Trump scores a major victory on Tuesday and in the major states that vote on Mar. 15, but loses the nomination, he\u2019s not going to go quietly. Whether it happens in the primary itself or in a brokered convention, it\u2019s a virtual certainty that if Trump is denied the nomination, he will claim that the party elites conspired against him and that the nominee, whoever it is, is illegitimate. Many of his supporters, already angry at the GOP elites before Trump even entered the race, will stay home in November.\n\nIn the end, Trump has effectively forced a choice on the Republican Party. That choice isn\u2019t about whether or not the 2016 election will splinter the party \u2013 that\u2019s already happened. The only real question which lines it will splinter along.\n\nThe members of the GOP who value its history as the party of Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Reagan, might prefer to hang on to the party name and to the voters they don\u2019t mind being publicly associated with rather than striking out to create a new conservative brand.\n\nRelated: If Voters Keep Digging, They\u2019ll Find Trump Buried Some Really Bad Deals\n\nThe price of holding on to the Republican Party\u2019s brand equity, though, will be the purposeful alienation of Donald Trump\u2019s most rabid supporters from the GOP.\n\nThe next move belongs to the party\u2019s elders and to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. The RNC has, understandably, been reluctant to intervene in a primary election. But if Priebus likes the view from his office, it might be time to break that precedent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In the end, Trump has effectively forced a choice on the Republican Party.
