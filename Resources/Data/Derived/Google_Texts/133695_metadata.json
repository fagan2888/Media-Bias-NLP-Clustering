That's up from his 53 percent approval rating in May, and far better than his 45 percent approval from September 2014.\n\nPresident Barack Obama walks to Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base Oct. 9, 2015, in Maryland.

In earlier years, he was trying to take compromise positions and get things through the Congress by working with the Republican side. I think voters here didn't like the positions he was taking.\"\n\nObama wishes he could have such numbers nationwide -- 45 percent of Americans approve of his job performance while 50 percent disapprove, according to the latest averages of nationwide polls compiled by Real Clear Politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Field Poll also found more Californians approve than disapprove of the president's handling of both the nation's economy -- 58 percent to 36 percent -- and foreign policy, 49 percent to 42 percent. Unsurprisingly, Democrats are overwhelmingly supportive while Republicans are overwhelmingly opposed.\n\nRegionally, the Bay Area holds Obama in the highest esteem, with a 72 percent approval rating; he's least popular in the Central Valley, at 48 percent. He also fares better among younger voters, minority voters and female voters.\n\nThe poll's margin of error is 3.2 percentage points.\n\nObama arrived in San Francisco on Friday night for a Democratic National Committee fundraiser. He'll hold another DNC fundraiser Saturday morning with rapper Kanye West at the city's Warfield Theater before heading down to Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\nJosh Richman covers politics.
