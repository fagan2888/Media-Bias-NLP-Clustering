Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich were joined by Reps. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n and Michelle Lujan Grisham in saying the state\u2019s actions disrupted care for the most vulnerable residents.\n\n\u201cAs we have consistently conveyed via countless phone calls, letters and in-person meetings, an overwhelming body of evidence indicates that this disruption was unwarranted and reckless,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe state Human Services Department characterized the delegation\u2019s request as a \u201cpartisan stunt\u201d and said federal officials have reviewed the matter and found that the state acted in accordance with anti-fraud regulations under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe companies in question overbilled the state millions of dollars in Medicaid funding that should have been used to help those in need,\u201d agency spokesman Kyler Nerison said.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s behavioral health system was upended in 2013 when Republican Gov. Susana Martinez\u2019s administration froze payments to the nonprofits after an audit raised questions about fraud and abuse. The audit had alleged $36 million in Medicaid funding was mishandled by the providers.\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Office launched an investigation, but the state Human Services Department eventually replaced the nonprofits with companies from Arizona. The providers protested, saying their due-process rights were violated because they were denied hearings by the department.\n\nMany of the nonprofits have since filed lawsuits against the department.\n\nTen providers were vindicated this month when New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas announced that an investigation turned up some regulatory violations but no pattern of fraud.\n\nThree others had been cleared previously. Investigations into two more are pending.\n\nThe senators and representatives said in their letter that Balderas\u2019 findings confirmed their long-standing concern that irregularities surrounding the Human Services Department\u2019s actions undermined the legitimacy of its auditing process.\n\nNerison disputed that. \u201cThe attorney general has simply said he can\u2019t prove that the overbilling was the result of fraud \u2013 even though one of the companies lent public money to its CEO to buy a private plane,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this month, the department said it would review Balderas\u2019 findings on the regulatory violations. It also vowed to continue trying to recoup misspent and overbilled Medicaid funds from the providers.\n\nThe members of the delegation also renewed their request Friday for oversight by federal officials and called for a verification process to ensure any state investigation into allegations of fraud meet certain standards.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Delegation Dems call state actions \u2018reckless\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Susan Montoya Bryan | The Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/726696/lawmakers-want-federal-probe-of-suspension-of-medicaid-funds.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/17/BC-NM-XGR-Immigrant-Drivers-Licenses-IMG-jpg.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Delegation Dems call state actions \u2018reckless\u2019", "title": "Updated: Lawmakers want federal probe of suspension of mental health funds"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In a letter sent Friday to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, Sens.\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Office launched an investigation, but the state Human Services Department eventually replaced the nonprofits with companies from Arizona.\n.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........Democrats in New Mexico\u2019s congressional delegation are calling for a federal investigation into the withholding of Medicaid payments from 15 nonprofits that provided behavioral health services to needy residents.\nThe senators and representatives said in their letter that Balderas\u2019 findings confirmed their long-standing concern that irregularities surrounding the Human Services Department\u2019s actions undermined the legitimacy of its auditing process.\nThe state Human Services Department characterized the delegation\u2019s request as a \u201cpartisan stunt\u201d and said federal officials have reviewed the matter and found that the state acted in accordance with anti-fraud regulations under the Affordable Care Act."}
