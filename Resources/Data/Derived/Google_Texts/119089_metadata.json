Who cares what Barack Obama said about ObamaCare in 2009, or what Hillary Clinton said about Benghazi in 2012? The past is dead and gone.\n\nUnless they decide to resurrect it, of course. Former Mozilla Corporation CEO Brendan Eich learned that the hard way today. He\u2019s the \u201cformer\u201d CEO because he was forced out by an angry mob. The mob was angry because he made a $1000 donation supporting California\u2019s Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage, back in 2008. The measure passed with 52 percent of the vote, which presumably means over half of California is unfit to work for Mozilla.\n\nFor the crime of holding the same position on gay marriage as Barack Obama did at the time \u2013 a position he hasn\u2019t even discussed much, and has never attempted to impose upon Mozilla in any way \u2013 Eich got to meet with Mister Mayhem. He resigned from both his corporate CEO post and the board of the Mozilla nonprofit organization on Thursday, after the sound of thundering jackboots became too loud for the company to ignore. Mozilla announced his departure in a blog post:\n\nMozilla prides itself on being held to a different standard and, this past week, we didn\u2019t live up to it. We know why people are hurt and angry, and they are right: it\u2019s because we haven\u2019t stayed true to ourselves. We didn\u2019t act like you\u2019d expect Mozilla to act. We didn\u2019t move fast enough to engage with people once the controversy started. We\u2019re sorry. We must do better. Brendan Eich has chosen to step down from his role as CEO. He\u2019s made this decision for Mozilla and our community. Mozilla believes both in equality and freedom of speech. Equality is necessary for meaningful speech. And you need free speech to fight for equality. Figuring out how to stand for both at the same time can be hard.\n\nThere\u2019s more argle-bargle about the company\u2019s wonderful commitment to \u201ca wide diversity of views,\u201d all of which is utterly meaningless drivel, because you just canned a guy after a mob declared his personal beliefs are unacceptable. Nothing anyone says about diversity or tolerance matters after that. It\u2019s all just window dressing for something profoundly ugly and intolerant. America used to be so much better than this. Remember \u201cI disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it?\u201d\n\nIn this case, it wasn\u2019t even about what Eich was saying. He wasn\u2019t even exercising his free-speech rights on the matter of same-sex marriage. He became CEO two weeks ago, didn\u2019t give his first interviews until yesterday, and said he preferred not to talk about the social issue that had nothing to do with his job. The movement to oust him was launched because two years ago, someone dug up the records of the thousand-dollar donation he made in 2008.\n\nOne of the first (and, as it turns out, last) interviews he gave as Mozilla CEO was to the UK Guardian:\n\nThe new CEO of Mozilla, the not-for-profit organisation behind the Firefox web browser, declined on Tuesday to offer a rationale for his 2008 donation in support of California\u2019s gay marriage ban, insisting he would remain in post despite a backlash over his appointment. Giving interviews for the first time since he was announced as the new boss of Mozilla on 24 March, Brendan Eich repeatedly refused to be drawn on his stance on gay rights amid a widespread row over his $1,000 donation in support of the successful Proposition 8 ballot measure. \u201cSo I don\u2019t want to talk about my personal beliefs because I kept them out of Mozilla all these 15 years we\u2019ve been going,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they\u2019re relevant.\u201d The first week of Eich\u2019s tenure had been marked by a series of public statements by Mozilla staff protesting his appointment, the resignation of three of Mozilla\u2019s directors, and a denunciation from dating site OkCupid, which urged all Firefox users to change browsers. Eich said OkCupid\u2019s move was \u201crash\u201d, and was keen to downplay other moves since his appointment. Though his stance on equal marriage had been made public through his donation, Eich said he did not believe it was relevant to his role at Mozilla, and said the organisation\u2019s own code of conduct precluded him discussing his views. \u201cI agree with people who say it wasn\u2019t private, but it was personal,\u201d he said of the donation. \u201cBut the principle that I have operated by, that is formalised in our code of conduct at Mozilla, is it\u2019s really about keeping anything that\u2019s not central to our mission out of our office. \u201cIf I stop doing that now I think I would be doing wrong that code of conduct and doing a disservice to Mozilla. And I really do think it\u2019s an important principle of inclusiveness for Mozilla to succeed.\u201d\n\nAlas, it turns out \u201cinclusiveness\u201d is not viewed as an important ingredient as Mozilla\u2019s success. Fascist conformity is more their style. And if you support what just happened to Eich, you are a fascist. It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re totally convinced of your own righteousness \u2013 so was every fascist to come before you.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if outraged same-sex marriage supporters were pushing back against an outspoken adversary (as if that would make it okay, coming from people who loudly declare themselves champions of diversity!) The man was literally minding his own business \u2013 he\u2019s one of the founders of Mozilla. He created the Javascript programming language. And because he dared to participate in the political process of his state six years ago, vengeance was taken upon him \u2013 rather obviously to frighten others who might dare to dissent from the preferred opinion of the mob. That\u2019s the fascist M.O., as every single one of Eich\u2019s tormentors would instantly agree, if they found themselves on the wrong end of it.\n\nI have seen no accusations that Eich was creating any sort of hostile work environment for gay employees, but evidently it\u2019s just peachy to create a hostile work environment for him. He was purged for beliefs he holds passively today, because once upon a time, he agreed with a sizable majority of Californians about the importance of preserving the existing definition of marriage, and donated a little money to that cause. An article at tech website Re/Code says Mozilla Executive Chairwoman Mitchell Baker didn\u2019t know Eich was opposed to same-sex marriage until stories about his 2008 donation appeared in the media. That doesn\u2019t make him sound like an overbearing sort.\n\nRe/Code writer Kara Swisher judges that Mozilla\u2019s \u201ccrisis\u201d was \u201cnot helped much by a series of Eich interviews this week, in which he declined to apologize and used what can only be described as pretzel logic about how a clearly tolerant community like Mozilla should also support what many now consider intolerant beliefs.\u201d\n\nThat only seems like \u201cpretzel logic\u201d if you\u2019re a fascist. People who actually believe in tolerance and intellectual diversity have no difficulty understanding the deep sickness of declaring someone a non-person because he disagrees with them. You\u2019ll find a few of Eich\u2019s persecutors who say he might have been able to hang on, if he had publicly recanted his marriage beliefs and apologized for ever holding them. That\u2019s not exactly helping you slip out of those jackboots, kids.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "No one gets to prattle about their commitment to \"tolerance\" and \"diversity\" after something like this.", "title": "Mob rule: Mozilla CEO forced out over $1000 Prop 8 donation made six years ago | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/brendan_eich-480x270.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/04/03/mob-rule-mozilla-ceo-forced-out-over-1000-donation-made-six-years-ago/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "No one gets to prattle about their commitment to \"tolerance\" and \"diversity\" after something like this.", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/brendan_eich-480x270.jpg", "description": "No one gets to prattle about their commitment to \"tolerance\" and \"diversity\" after something like this.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe61\"", "article_summary": "The mob was angry because he made a $1000 donation supporting California\u2019s Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage, back in 2008.\nFormer Mozilla Corporation CEO Brendan Eich learned that the hard way today.\nHe\u2019s the \u201cformer\u201d CEO because he was forced out by an angry mob.\nThe measure passed with 52 percent of the vote, which presumably means over half of California is unfit to work for Mozilla.\n\u201cI agree with people who say it wasn\u2019t private, but it was personal,\u201d he said of the donation."}
