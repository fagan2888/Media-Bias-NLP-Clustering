The terrifying reality of stop-and-frisk wasn\u2019t just the risk of violence or humiliating treatment\u2014it was the chance that a police stop could upend your life. \u201cThey arrest you and build up all these little, petty things \u2026 and after a certain time, now OK, you have three of these, it\u2019s a felony,\u201d explained another interviewee. \u201cWhen you put a felony on somebody you\u2019re telling a person basically you\u2019re just a hard-core criminal. You can\u2019t get [a] job. If you want to work in a bank, well you can forget that.\u201d For many Americans, an arrest for marijuana possession\u2014a minor crime that isn\u2019t even punished in parts of the country (read: college campuses)\u2014can ruin your life\n\nIn New York, stop-and-frisk wasn\u2019t just a criminal justice issue\u2014a question of equal treatment under the law\u2014it was an economic one, too. Which is why then-candidate Bill de Blasio found success with his message of economic equality and criminal justice reform. For him and his supporters, they were two sides of the same coin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAll of this is apropos a recent column in the New York Times from Noam Scheiber, a liberal writer and former editor at the New Republic. Pointing to the mayor\u2019s middling approval ratings\u201449 percent, according to the latest survey from Quinnipiac\u2014and in particular his flagging support from the city\u2019s whites, Scheiber argues that de Blasio has misstepped in his focus on stop-and-frisk and the city\u2019s police.\n\nSpecifically, Scheiber sees de Blasio as abandoning a key strand of his campaign that could have bolstered his standing with the city as a whole, instead of dividing it along racial lines:\n\nFrom the get-go, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign fused two distinct strands of progressivism. The first was economic populism, not least his criticism that Michael R. Bloomberg had placed the interests of Wall Street and the wealthy above those of average New Yorkers.\n\nThe second was what some have called \u201cidentity group\u201d liberalism, which appealed to black and Latino voters as blacks and Latinos, not on the basis of economic interests they shared with whites. The centerpiece of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s identity-group agenda was his promise to win better treatment for minorities at the hands of the police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nVoters were thrilled with de Blasio\u2019s economic populism, notes Scheiber, but not as enthusiastic with his promise of police reform. In a poll released just after his inauguration, Scheiber points out, \u201cEighty-three percent were concerned about income inequality (though few listed it as their top concern). But only 48 percent of voters said that Mr. de Blasio would be able to ease the Police Department\u2019s \u2018stop and frisk\u2019 tactics without sacrificing public safety.\u201d\n\nFor de Blasio, Scheiber argues, the better play would have been to keep the focus on inequality and push hard for higher taxes on the rich and new programs for middle- and low-income New Yorkers, instead of spending political capital on an issue with an impossibly steep racial divide.\n\nOn its face this is an easy argument to support, bolstered by the incredible tension between de Blasio and the New York Police Department. If the cost of a unified city government were less sympathy with protesters, I\u2019m sure many observers would pay it.\n\nThe problem comes when you begin to think about the supposed divide between economic populism and \u201cidentity group liberalism.\u201d Again, in the lived experience of most New Yorkers\u2014at 25.5 percent black, 28.6 percent Latino, and 12.7 percent Asian, the city is decidedly majority-minority\u2014that divide doesn\u2019t exist. Police reform is economic populism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFor many New Yorkers (as well as many Americans), arrests have been disastrous, closing opportunities for jobs, housing, and public benefits. In Punishment and Inequality in America, his study of the prison system as a social phenomenon, Harvard sociologist Bruce Western emphasizes this point. \u201cIncarceration redirects the life path from the usual trajectory of steady jobs with career ladders that normally propels wage growth for young men,\u201d he writes. \u201cMen tangled in the justice system become permanent labor market outsiders, finding only temporary or unreliable jobs that offer little economic stability.\u201d\n\nWhy is it \u201cidentity group\u201d politics to appeal to black and Latino preferences but just \u201cpolitics\u201d to speak to the concerns of whites?\n\nA promise to improve policing\u2014to end arbitrary arrests and needless contact\u2014is a form of economic populism, an explicit commitment to integrating minority groups, protecting them from arbitrary power, and bringing them into the mainstream economy.\n\nMore broadly, it\u2019s not as if de Blasio could have laid fallow on reform. The issue was pushed into his hands by the police officer who killed Eric Garner and the grand jury that declined to indict him. The elected leader of a largely black and Latino city, de Blasio had to honor his campaign promises, even if it cost him white support. And it\u2019s clear the mayor knows this is dangerous terrain for his administration. It\u2019s why, since his initial remarks on the Garner grand jury, he\u2019s been judicious with his rhetoric, working (unsuccessfully) to repair his frayed relationship with the NYPD.\n\nBut even if you believe there\u2019s a distinction between economic populism and \u201cidentity group liberalism\u201d\u2014and that de Blasio should have gone for the former over the latter\u2014race is still a problem. The Affordable Care Act is arguably a kind of economic populism. It gives its benefits to a huge cross-section of society, from poor Latino workers in East Palo Alto to middle-class whites in Lexington, Kentucky. Despite this, notes Scheiber in his piece, Obamacare is a racialized policy, understood\u2014like welfare\u2014as a giveaway to the so-called undeserving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe same is true of economic liberalism writ large. There\u2019s a reason \u201c47 percent\u201d was a right-wing trope before it was a Mitt Romney gaffe\u2014millions of Americans see the welfare state in starkly ethnocentric terms, where a policy that benefits minorities is necessarily one that disadvantages the majority, and where efforts to improve economic life for ordinary Americans are derided as \u201cgifts\u201d to presumably unproductive citizens.\n\nScheiber suggests de Blasio could have gotten around this obstacle with an exclusive focus on the hyper-rich. But there are limits to this approach. What happens when de Blasio starts to talk about the spending part of \u201ctax and spend?\u201d And what about the political trade-offs? In a world where the mayor stays mum on police reform, does he alienate his minority supporters?\n\nThis last question raises a much larger one about Scheiber\u2019s argument. In a majority-minority city, why is it \u201cidentity group\u201d politics to appeal to black and Latino preferences but just \u201cpolitics\u201d to speak to the concerns of their white counterparts?", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Reforming the NYPD is economic populism for New York City\u2019s minorities.", "fb-share": "Why de Blasio Was Right to Take On Criminal Justice Reform", "sailthru.author": "Jamelle Bouie", "description": "\u201cPeople actually lose their employment because they weren\u2019t able to come into work,\u201d said one New Yorker in a 2011 interview with the Center for Consti ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "\u201cPeople actually lose their employment because they weren\u2019t able to come into work,\u201d said one New Yorker in a 2011 interview with the Center for Consti ...", "title": "Why de Blasio Was Right to Take On Criminal Justice Reform", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/bill_de_blasio_was_right_to_focus_on_police_reform_better_policing_is_economic.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/150126_POL_Blasio.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cPeople actually lose their employment because they weren\u2019t able to come into work,\u201d said one New Yorker in a 2011 interview with the Center for Consti ...", "title": "Why de Blasio Was Right to Take On Criminal Justice Reform", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/bill_de_blasio_was_right_to_focus_on_police_reform_better_policing_is_economic.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/150126_POL_Blasio.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@jbouie", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-26T14:18:52Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Why de Blasio Was Right to Take On Criminal Justice Reform", "sailthru.headline": "Why de Blasio Was Right to Take on Criminal Justice Reform", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Why de Blasio Was Right to Take On Criminal Justice Reform\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/bill_de_blasio_was_right_to_focus_on_police_reform_better_policing_is_economic.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/150126_POL_Blasio.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100150126003\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-26T14:18:52Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Jamelle Bouie\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"politics\",\n    \"police\",\n    \"bill de blasio\",\n    \"race\",\n    \"new york\",\n    \"crime\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Why de Blasio Was Right to Take On Criminal Justice Reform", "keywords": "Bill de Blasio, de Blasio NYPD, de Blasio criminal justice reform, de Blasio populism, de Blasio campaign, de Blasio police reform, de Blasio NYPD accountability, de Blasio Eric Garner, de Blasio police union, de Blasio popularity, de Blasio approval ratings, de Blasio blacks, de Blasio Latinos, de Blasio whites", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "Bill de Blasio, de Blasio NYPD, de Blasio criminal justice reform, de Blasio populism, de Blasio campaign, de Blasio police reform, de Blasio NYPD accountability, de Blasio Eric Garner, de Blasio police union, de Blasio popularity, de Blasio approval ratings, de Blasio blacks, de Blasio Latinos, de Blasio whites", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.description": "\u201cPeople actually lose their employment because they weren\u2019t able to come into work,\u201d said one New Yorker in a 2011 interview with the Center for Consti ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/150126_POL_Blasio.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6ee\"", "article_summary": "AdvertisementVoters were thrilled with de Blasio\u2019s economic populism, notes Scheiber, but not as enthusiastic with his promise of police reform.\nThe Affordable Care Act is arguably a kind of economic populism.\nThe first was economic populism, not least his criticism that Michael R.
