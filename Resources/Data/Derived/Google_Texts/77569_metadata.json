There's no cost to the consumer; independent insurance agents and brokers are paid commissions by the insurance companies that get the new customers.\n\nThe variety of factors that should be considered include which doctors, drugs and hospital systems are covered by the plans.\n\n\"The people that are really getting killed are the part-time employees,\" he said. They don't reach the poverty threshold, about $11,770 a year, to qualify for subsidies and Tennessee hasn't accepted federal Medicaid dollars to expand coverage for those living below the poverty level.\n\n\"We just feel like it's such a wonderful opportunity for people to get covered,\" Felsenthal said. \"If they don't get covered, they are going to get fined.\"\n\nThat fine for those who can but choose not to be covered will be at least $695 for the year.\n\nWhile advice about selecting plans is available from insurance industry sources, a nonprofit group, Get Covered Tenn, is using a $1.6 million federal grant to spearhead in-person assistance in Memphis, Shelby County and the 94 other counties in Tennessee.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Subsidies could cushion steep increase in Obamacare rates for some", "og": {"url": "http://www.commercialappeal.com/business/medical/subsidies-could-cushion-steep-increase-in-obamacare-rates-for-some-2319662d-0ad6-3837-e053-0100007f0-337749411.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/Biz+qa+obamacare.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "A 23 percent rise in a benchmark Obamacare plan should still be affordable for those getting subsidies, brokers say.", "title": "Subsidies could cushion steep increase in Obamacare rates for some"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/memphisnews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/Biz+qa+obamacare.jpg", "description": "A 23 percent rise in a benchmark Obamacare plan should still be affordable for those getting subsidies, brokers say.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Subsidies could cushion steep increase in Obamacare rates for some"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ca-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Despite steep hikes in the cost of individual health coverage in Tennessee, federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act still make health insurance affordable, but too few low-income consumers are aware of them, advocates say.\n\"We just feel like it's such a wonderful opportunity for people to get covered,\" Felsenthal said.\n\"In most cases people who get subsidies will find the subsidies increasing to offset the premium increases.\"\nBy Kevin McKenzie of The Commercial AppealA 56-year-old man with no health insurance, a $10-an-hour job at a cleaners and two teenagers called Felsenthal Health Insurances Services on Tuesday and received upbeat news.\n\"It will have a big impact on people who don't get subsidies,\" said Chuck Hudspeth of Hudspeth Benefits Group, who markets his services as the \"Obamacare Answer Man.\""}
