Birth defects in children have been noted from woman who were pregnant and infected with Zika virus.\n\nNester says that some agencies are offering refunds or credits for people worried about the viruses.\n\nIn a release from the KDHE about the Kansas infection, it reads: \"The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) received confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the first person in the state to test positive for Zika virus. The individual is an adult from southwest Kansas and has travel history to a country with local Zika virus transmission. The person subsequently developed an illness consistent with Zika virus infection and was tested per guidance from CDC and KDHE.\n\n'Kansas is prepared for the Zika virus, and we are working with health care providers across the state to respond to both suspected and confirmed cases, said Susan Mosier, MD, MBA, FACS, KDHE Secretary and State Health Officer. 'I urge everyone who is considering travel to a country with Zika transmission to be aware of the situation and take precautions to protect themselves and prevent mosquito bites.'\n\nThe list of affected areas includes many countries in the Caribbean and South and Central America. The list continues to change and can be found at CDC.gov .\n\nZika virus infection typically causes a mild illness in those who develop disease. Approximately 80 percent of those infected never show symptoms of the disease, with 20 percent showing mild symptoms. There is no vaccine to prevent infection and no specific antiviral treatment for Zika virus infection. The most common symptoms include fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes. The best way to prevent Zika virus is to prevent mosquito bites.\n\nPregnant women can be infected with Zika virus in any trimester and there have been increased cases of microcephaly possibly associated with Zika virus infections. Pregnant women should consider postponing travel to areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. Pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with Zika virus should talk to a health care provider even if they don\u2019t feel sick. CDC and KDHE have guidance to help doctors decide what tests are needed for pregnant women who may have been exposed to Zika virus.\n\nWhen traveling to countries where Zika virus or other viruses spread by mosquitoes are found, take the following steps:\n\n\u00b7 Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants\n\n\u00b7 Stay in places with air conditioning or that use window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside\n\n\u00b7 Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors\n\n\u00b7 Use insect repellents containing an EPA-registered active ingredient on skin and clothing, including DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol or IS 3535.\n\n\u00b7 If you are using sunscreen, apply sunscreen before applying insect repellent\n\n\u00b7 Treat clothing and gear with permethrin or purchase permethrin-treated items\n\nSpread of Zika virus has also been reported through sexual contact. Take steps to prevent sexual transmission with proper use of a condom. If a pregnant woman is concerned that her male partner may have or had Zika virus infection, she should talk to her health care provider.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Biologist says mosquitoes native to Kansas do not carry Zika virus", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "Biologist says mosquitoes native to Kansas do not carry Zika virus", "title": "UPDATE: Confirmed case of Zika virus in Kansas", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Confirmed-case-of-Zika-virus-in-Kansas-371801472.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/49B/056/49B05637439D426486811D22867735CB", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C92/D60/C92D60CAB8EB4B07B703E86960993BDC.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Biologist says mosquitoes native to Kansas do not carry Zika virus", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Confirmed-case-of-Zika-virus-in-Kansas-371801472.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/zika25.jpg", "title": "UPDATE: Confirmed case of Zika virus in Kansas", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Confirmed case of Zika virus in Kansas", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Confirmed case of Zika"}, "article_summary": "Pregnant women can be infected with Zika virus in any trimester and there have been increased cases of microcephaly possibly associated with Zika virus infections.\nThe Kansas Department of Health and Environment confirms that a person from southwest Kansas tested positive for Zika virus.\nThere is no vaccine to prevent infection and no specific antiviral treatment for Zika virus infection.\nA professor at Friends University tells KAKE News that the mosquitoes that carry Zika virus are not usually found in Kansas.\nThe best way to prevent Zika virus is to prevent mosquito bites."}
