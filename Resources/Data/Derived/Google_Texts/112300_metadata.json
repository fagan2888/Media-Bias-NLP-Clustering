Skehan happens to be attending the desk, there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll persuade you to spend the night in the area.\n\nAt 61, Skehan, executive director of the Hartford Area Chamber of Commerce, is a tornado of vivacious enthusiasm, and the subject he is most passionate about is Vermont. The sprightly P.J. \u2014 Patrick Joseph \u2014 came to Vermont from his native Ireland as a glassblower with Simon Pearce back in 1981, and rose through the ranks to become general manager before leaving in 2004. It\u2019s not inconsequential that Simon Pearce became a global brand during Skehan\u2019s tenure.\n\nHe\u2019s now focusing that business acumen on the Chamber, which covers the five villages of Hartford: Quechee, White River Junction, Hartford Village, West Hartford and Wilder.\n\nDuring a recent conversation, Skehan talked a mile a minute, jumping from one subject to another as if jumping across stones in a brook. He\u2019s the quintessential ad man, except every word spoken in his lilting Irish brogue comes across as completely sincere.\n\n\u201cOne of my aims for our chamber is getting more involved in economic development,\u201d Skehan began. \u201cThe business part can be difficult because Vermont doesn\u2019t have a great reputation for being business-friendly, and it\u2019s always very competitive with New Hampshire because we don\u2019t have all the incentives that New Hampshire has, but we make up for it with the quality of life. And at the chamber, we get creative. We\u2019re looking at creative ways to grow businesses.\u201d\n\nSkehan, who took over as executive director in 2013, cited using social media more effectively and working with other chambers to add value for his members. Membership fell off in recent years because the health insurance offered through the chamber was replaced with Obamacare. Still, Skehan said, the chamber turned a profit last year, and he confirmed the organization is in good financial shape.\n\nAside from dues, the chamber\u2019s biggest moneymaker is the annual balloon festival, but bad weather has taken its toll on attendance and profits in the past few years. While hoping they have \u201cthe luck of the Irish\u201d on their side with future weather conditions, Skehan is looking for ways to develop the festival beyond balloon flights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a hot air balloon, craft and music festival,\u201d Skehan said. \u201cThis year we\u2019ll have paragliding and parachute jumping demos, plus hang-gliding, and we\u2019re increasing entertainment with more bands, and kids entertainment like jugglers, clowns, magicians and dancers.\u201d\n\nThe festival, scheduled for June 17-19, also will feature local artisans such as potters and glassblowers, and Skehan is working on getting more vendors to take part. The goal is to have five balloon ascensions, but if the weather doesn\u2019t cooperate, Skehan wants to ensure that families have plenty of other activities to keep them busy.\n\nLooking beyond the festival, the Chamber is developing new events, such as the murder mystery train, which was included in Hartford\u2019s Glory Days Festival last year. It sold out and turned a tidy profit, and plans are underway for a repeat next September.\n\n\u201cYou have to think outside the box,\u201d Skehan said about his approach. \u201cYou have to be open to working with other chambers, to collaborate not just with other chambers but with other businesses.\u201d\n\nThe words collaborate and partnership were sprinkled liberally throughout Skehan\u2019s comments, particularly when talking about the chamber\u2019s monthly after-hours mixers, which he often plans in conjunction with other area chambers, including Lebanon, Hanover and Woodstock.\n\n\u201cMixers have always been around, right? Skehan explained. \u201cThere are a lot of business groups out there and in a small area like we\u2019re in, the more collaboration, the better. It\u2019s beneficial to all the members because there\u2019s a bigger melting pot.\u201d\n\nSkehan said his members are facing a labor shortage, due in part to the flight of young people from Vermont, and a lack of affordable housing. While crediting the Vermont Chamber of Commerce and legislators for their efforts, Skehan also is looking for local solutions, and he sees education as a key factor.\n\nThe Community College of Vermont recently hosted a breakfast mixer for chamber members, and Skehan said attendees were surprised at how much CCV offers \u2014 both in terms of producing an educated workforce, and offering affordable continuing education for employees.\n\nSkehan also is bullish on the Hartford Area Career and Technology Center.\n\n\u201cEveryone is complaining they can\u2019t find good people, and everyone thinks they have to go to college,\u201d Skehan said. \u201cThere\u2019s all this potential there with electricians, carpenters, hairdressers, chefs and IT people, and there\u2019s a big demand in the trades now. Vocational training had a stigma for years, but (the Hartford Area Career and Technology Center) does tremendous work and it\u2019s underutilized.\u201d\n\nThe most serious issue currently facing the chamber is that of people taking their lives by jumping off the Quechee Gorge bridge, which is just steps away from the visitors center. Recently, a bill to identify suicide prevention measures was passed in the Vermont House and sent to the Senate. Under the bill, the Agency of Transportation would conduct a review and report its findings by the first of the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sensitive and difficult subject,\u201d Skehan said. \u201cInitially word was out that the businesses around here are more concerned about how the bridge looks. It\u2019s a historic bridge, and some of the business folks were upset that the Legislature didn\u2019t involve them (in the process). We have a beautiful bridge that over a quarter-million people visit per year, and we want it to be known for its beauty, not because people commit suicide off of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tragic for everyone involved, and I can\u2019t imagine the pain of the families. It\u2019s traumatic for the first responders and for us. We care about it and want to be part of the solution,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Hartford Area Chamber of Commerce has roughly 220 members, including about 40 nonprofit organizations. Eighty percent of the members are small businesses, and Skehan\u2019s enthusiasm went into overdrive discussing them.\n\nNot diminishing the role of larger organizations, such as Northern Stage, Skehan credits small-business owners with the revitalization of White River Junction, which he says has been a boon to the chamber.\n\n\u201cA lot has come from the town (of White River Junction), but it\u2019s been driven by people like Matt Bucy, who owns Tip Top; David Briggs, who owns the Hotel Coolidge; and Kim Souza, who owns Revolution. Kim\u2019s been heavily involved and her store typifies what White River has become. It\u2019s eclectic. It\u2019s funky. Suddenly it\u2019s hip to be in White River,\u201d he said.\n\nSkehan said most member business are small one- or two-people operations, and he gets energized thinking of how to help them get to the next level. A large part of his job is promotion and marketing, and he acknowledges that the visitors center is an asset. More than 100,000 people flow through its doors every year, and Skehan said they are a captive audience.\n\n\u201cMany of them stop in to use the restroom, but they can easily be channeled into visiting an attraction like Billings Farm, the Vermont Institute of Natural Science or the Montshire (Museum),\u201d Skehan said with delight. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have a problem sending them over the river. In a small area like this, the more collaboration we do, the better. I\u2019m here to sell the whole area.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, two visitors from Connecticut popped in for some information, and Skehan talked them into trying out a few trails behind the visitors center.\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance they wound up spending the night.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Enterprise", "description": "Day-trippers to Quechee be warned: If you venture inside the Visitors Center on Route 4 and P.J.
