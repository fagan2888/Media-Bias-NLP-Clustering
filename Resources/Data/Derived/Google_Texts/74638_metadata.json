However, procrastinating paying your taxes can be very stressful. The IRS estimates that 20 to 25 percent of Americans wait until two weeks before the filing deadline to complete them. These people often run into a number of problems, which can include the following:\n\nFailure to properly prepare their returns, which can lead to overpayments.\n\nMaking mistakes that can trigger an audit.\n\nFacing hardship after having to pay significant amounts of money.\n\nFacing fees for late payments or mistakes.\n\nYou should be trying to stay on top of your taxes the entire year to avoid running into these types of problems. This is especially important if you are running your own business, because you are entirely responsible for managing your own taxes.\n\nTips to Prepare for Your Taxes Year Round\n\nThere are a number of things that you can do throughout the year to minimize the stress around tax time. Here are some tips that you will want to follow.\n\nUnderstand Tax Implications of Investing and Spending Decisions\n\nYou want to be fully aware of any tax implications when investing or spending money. Some expenditures can be written off as deductions, such as energy efficient vehicles, donations to recognized charities and some of the money you spend towards a new home.\n\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}\n\nOn the other hand, investing decisions can also affect your tax return. The rules can be very complex if you are getting dividends or incurring capital gains after selling any of your stocks. You need to thoroughly educate yourself on the tax rules beforehand.\n\nDon\u2019t Base Your Estimated Obligations Off the Previous Year\n\nYou may have paid $3,000 in taxes the prior year. That doesn\u2019t mean that you should expect to pay $3,000 this year. You may have received a raise from work, which not only increases your taxable income, but could also place you in a higher tax bracket. The tax margins could also have changed.\n\nYou need to try your best to come up with an accurate estimate of your income, because you could find yourself owing twice as much as you planned come tax time.\n\nStay Insured!\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has changed a lot of things. One of the things that they changed is that the IRS now charges a tax penalty to anyone that didn\u2019t have adequate health insurance for at least 10 months of the year. The fine changes every year. For 2016, the tax penalty is either 2.5 percent of household income or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child under 18.\n\nIt\u2019s important to make sure that you are covered all year if you don\u2019t want to face this fine. There are several forms of acceptable health insurance:\n\nA compliant plan through your work.\n\nA plan on Healthcare.gov or your state health exchange.\n\nMedicaid\n\nMedicare\n\nKeep in mind that if you get healthcare through the exchanges, then the IRS can provide tax credits to you for your premiums. You have the option to either deduct them from your tax obligations when filing or receive the subsidies throughout the year.\n\nWhat Are Your Options if You Fall Behind?\n\nAccording to recent data, about 7 percent of people have to request filing extensions because they procrastinated too long. They may end up paying unnecessary fees or risk getting audited. Fortunately, there are a number of options they can consider. You can work closely with a CPA or tax attorney to help protect you. You can also contact the IRS and advise them of any hardships that are impairing your ability to pay taxes on time.\n\nThe IRS also offers some different options for you if fall behind. They will even allow you to pay your taxes using a credit card through their website. This process is much quicker, which is important if you are behind on your taxes. You won\u2019t have to worry about it being postmarked after the deadline and incurring a fee, which is a problem for many people sending checks. It\u2019s also much more convenient, since you can handle everything online.", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Diana Hope"}, "dcterms.title": "Why 25% of Americans Fall Behind on Their Taxes", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/community/blogs/diana-hope/why-25-of-americans-fall-behind-on-their-taxes", "type": "article", "updated_time": "2016-01-16T15:45:00+00:00", "site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "Why 25% of Americans Fall Behind on Their Taxes"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/community/blogs/diana-hope/why-25-of-americans-fall-behind-on-their-taxes", "card": "summary", "title": "Why 25% of Americans Fall Behind on Their Taxes"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/community/blogs/diana-hope/why-25-of-americans-fall-behind-on-their-taxes", "dcterms.creator": "Diana Hope", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-16T15:45+00:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[\"Deductions\",\"Tax tips\"]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Blogs\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":\"\"},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_26212\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T15:54:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-07T21:06:04+00:00"}, "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "Blogs", "sft-tag": "Tax tips", "sft-date": "Jan 16th 2016", "sft-type": "Blogs", "sft-title": "The Importance of Managing Your Taxes Year Round", "recs": {"category": "Blogs", "articleid": "node-26212", "publishtime": "2016-01-16T15:54:32:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Diana Hope"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "You can also contact the IRS and advise them of any hardships that are impairing your ability to pay taxes on time.\nThe IRS estimates that 20 to 25 percent of Americans wait until two weeks before the filing deadline to complete them.\nThey will even allow you to pay your taxes using a credit card through their website.\nThis is especially important if you are running your own business, because you are entirely responsible for managing your own taxes.\nYou should be trying to stay on top of your taxes the entire year to avoid running into these types of problems."}
