Jim Jordan, R-Urbana, next year.\n\nThe 62-year-old Garrett retired in June after 24 years as an Oberlin Schools teacher. Garrett \u2014 defeated 122,215 votes to 59,112, or 67 percentage points to 33 percentage points \u2014 said retirement will allow her more time to raise money and win over some 300,000 independent voters in the district. Garrett admits to having doubts.\n\n\u201cBut every time I think I\u2019m unworthy, I think about Jim Jordan, who has a lot of experience attending to his personal agenda and voting against the interests of the very people who put him there,\u201d Garrett told about 50 supporters at her campaign kickoff at New Russia Township Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a fresh perspective and making the needs of the people the priority.\u201d\n\nGarrett has an uphill battle against the 51-year-old Jordan, who took office in 2007. The 4th District was redistricted by state Republicans in 2011 with Amherst, Elyria and Oberlin making up the Lorain County portion of the district. Democrats accused Republicans of gerrymandering to ensure permanent majorities in the House of Representatives.\n\nBesides political geography, Garrett also faces a huge money disparity. Jordan spent about $1 million in last year\u2019s campaign, compared to just $44,108 spent by Garrett, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIn Oberlin, Garrett won handily last year \u2014 Jordan joked before the election about increasing his Oberlin votes from four to five \u2014 but Jordan dominated the rest of the district. Jordan was unavailable Sunday night, but Jordan spokesman Darin Miller wrote in an email that Jordan\u2019s views are representative of the district\u2019s residents.\n\n\u201cHe hears every day from people across the spectrum that the irresponsible practice of borrowing and spending like there\u2019s no tomorrow has to stop before it bankrupts our country,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Congressman Jordan has been a leader in trying to change Washington, standing up to the Washington power brokers and special interests in order to protect our tax dollars.\u201d\n\nGarrett conceded that independent voters outside of Oberlin lean Republican.\n\nNonetheless, she said some believe the Republican Party and Jordan are too extreme.\n\nJordan heads the Freedom Caucus, a conservative group of some 40 House members from 25 states who were instrumental in the 2013 government shutdown. The shutdown cost taxpayers $24 billion, according to Standard & Poors, a financial rating company. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to hold the government hostage for his own personal agenda,\u201d Garrett said.\n\nThe caucus also was instrumental in the impending resignation of House Speaker John Boehner, R-West Chester, and has threatened another shutdown if Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t defunded. Garrett ripped Jordan\u2019s grilling of Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards at a Sept. 29 congressional hearing. Citing a sting video by an anti-abortion group, Republicans accused Planned Parenthood of profiting from fetal tissue research, which is illegal.\n\nGarrett said Jordan\u2019s support for forcing pregnant incest and rape victims who want abortions to give birth is extreme.\n\n\u201cHe once said to my face, \u2018If a woman gets pregnant as a result of rape, it\u2019s an act of God,\u2019\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI believe God gives each and every one of us the right to be captains of our own destiny.\u201d\n\nMiller denied Jordan \u2014 who in 2013 introduced a bill to give Constitutional rights to fertilized eggs and fetuses \u2014 made the statement to Garrett. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to take Ms. Garrett seriously when she tells such a complete and utter lie,\u201d Miller said.\n\nGarrett also criticized Jordan\u2019s votes against equal pay for women and numerous votes to defund the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. Garrett said Obamacare doesn\u2019t go far enough and she supports single-payer health care.\n\nUnder a single-payer system, health care is government-run with costs deducted from paychecks. Insurance companies, co-pays and out-of-pocket costs are eliminated from the process.\n\nRegarding climate change, Garrett said in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy and other extreme weather, Jordan\u2019s denial of climate change wasn\u2019t just ignorant, but dangerous.\n\nGarrett, who said she wondered how she could protect her students after the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre in Connecticut, said she supports renewing the assault weapons ban, which Jordan opposes. She also favors immigration reform and opposes mass deportations. Garrett said Jordan\u2019s opposition to reform is un-Christian.\n\n\u201cI am really tired of Jim Jordan claiming to be a Christian and demonstrating none of the basic Christian values,\u201d she said.\n\nGarrett said she began her campaign early to raise money faster. Garrett said her goal is to raise $100,000 as quickly as possible to demonstrate she is a viable candidate to PACs and big unions.\n\nLast year, Garrett said those groups ignored her because her campaign didn\u2019t demonstrate enough grass-roots support. \u201cThis time, we are going to show them that we have that support,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chronicle-Telegram", "description": "NEW RUSSIA TWP. \u2014 Trounced in her election bid last year, 4th Congressional District Democratic candidate Janet Garrett vowed Sunday to run harder this time to unseat U.S. Rep.
