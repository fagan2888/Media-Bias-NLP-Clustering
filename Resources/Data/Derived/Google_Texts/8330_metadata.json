It was intended to reduce \u201credundant, inconsistent, or overlapping\u201d regulations.\n\nThe order was hailed as \u201cunprecedented\u201d by the president and former Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) administrator Cass Sunstein. However, Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at American Action Forum, found that the action was hardly unique and has had the opposite effect of its intended purpose.\u201cHas Washington actually cut red tape? On net, final rules from Order 13563 have added more than $10.2 billion in costs, mostly from new regulations labeled as \u2018retrospective,\u2019\u201d Batkins said. \u201cFinal rules have cut 7.9 million hours of paperwork, but Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act have easily outpaced those deregulatory gains.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cderegulatory measures\u201d resulting from the executive order actually add over $10 billion in costs to the economy. For example, a final rule imposing energy standards for transformers carries a $5.22 billion cost to comply and 58,320 hours of paperwork.\n\nTaken with the proposed regulations under the executive order, the total burden to the economy would reach $13.7 billion.\n\nPresident Obama promised that the order would reduce paperwork in a January 2011 Wall Street Journal editorial.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also getting rid of absurd and unnecessary paperwork requirements that waste time and money,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the system as a whole to make sure we avoid excessive, inconsistent, and redundant regulation.\u201d\n\nThe order has added 1.5 billion hours of paperwork to comply with its regulations. \u201cAs for the aggregate level of red tape, in fiscal year 2010, the federal government imposed 8.8 billion hours of paperwork,\u201d the report said. \u201cToday, that figure is 10.3 billion hours, a 17 percent increase, despite this \u2018unprecedented reform.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would take more than 750,000 employees working full-time to complete the new annual paperwork added since 2010,\u201d Batkins said.\n\nRegulations under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) take 653 million hours of paperwork to comply, a 26 percent increase since the executive order was issued.\n\nOther rules intended to save regulatory costs have resulted in millions of hours of extra paperwork. A \u201cPositive Train Control\u201d rule that removed some regulatory provisions for rail safety saved $645.7 million but resulted in 3.9 million additional hours of paperwork.\n\nThe report also found that the administration is recycling regulations in order to achieve savings, citing at least 39 proposed or final rules that were initiated before the executive order, and 15 that were introduced under the George W. Bush administration.\n\nSunstein claimed in 2011 that the executive order would achieve $10 billion in savings. Batkins did note that the effort has led to cost cutting, including $940 million in savings and 9.8 million less paperwork hours from a Medicare and Medicaid hospital reform rule.\n\nOverall he found $8.7 billion in savings, still short of the regulatory burden that has resulted from the administration\u2019s plan to cut red tape.\n\n\u201cThe White House has repeatedly claimed that Order 13563 is unprecedented, but a cursory review of the record proves there is nothing unique about their efforts,\u201d the report said. \u201cEvery President since Jimmy Carter has issued an executive order on regulatory reform, and even President Carter urged agencies to \u2018periodically review\u2019 existing regulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s deregulatory measures have actually resulted in more than 1.5 billion hours of paperwork and $10.2 billion in new net costs,\u201d Batkins said. \u201cThe only aspect of recent regulatory reform that is unprecedented is that the administration has the temerity to recycle old regulations and claim them as part of a historic \u2018retrospective review.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "1.5 billion more hours of paperwork in 3 years", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "An executive order issued by President Barack Obama that was designed to \u201ccut red tape\u201d has added $10.2 billion in regulatory costs to the economy, according to a new report.
