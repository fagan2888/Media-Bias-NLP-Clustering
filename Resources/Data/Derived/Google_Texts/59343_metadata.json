His latest book is: \u201c The Power of RELENTLESS! \u201d Dubbed by the media as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist,\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years. Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nDonald,\n\nThis is an open letter from conservative voters rooting for you to win. This is a gameplan for victory. We are begging you to\u2026\n\nFirst, stop answering questions about your personal life.\n\nSecond, stop answering questions about your business bankruptcies. The people in the media and your critics on the left that are asking these questions have never had a bankruptcy because they\u2019ve never started a business in their lives. They get a safe weekly paycheck. They\u2019ve never once put their money where their mouth is. They\u2019ve never created one job, let alone thousands. They\u2019ve never paid the health insurance of one other person, let alone thousands. They\u2019ve never built or bought one building. They\u2019ve never pumped billions into the economy. In order to fail in business, you first have to risk millions of dollars to start a business. They miss that point completely!\n\nThird, stop answering questions about abortion. What an overwhelming majority of American voters care about is the economy, economy, economy \u2026 and jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nJust stick to \u201cThe Great 8\u201d- eight simple solutions you\u2019ll fight for in your first year as president of the United States. If you\u2019re asked anything else, just keep going back to these eight simple points.\n\nRemember the rule so many politicians have violated: \u201cKISS- Keep It Simple Stupid.\u201d Relentlessly stay on message. If the media asks you about anything else, here\u2019s your answer\u2026\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of problems in this country. A president can\u2019t do everything at once. No one ever has. Let\u2019s start with important stuff that\u2019s quickly doable. We\u2019ll deal with the rest later. It\u2019s time for The Great 8 \u2026 and the rest can wait.\u201d\n\nWhy should you stick to \u201cThe Great 8\u201d? Because no presidential frontrunner can withstand 200 more days (prior to the first vote in Iowa) of \u201cgotcha\u201d questioning and withering attacks by the liberal media with an agenda to elect a Democrat.\n\nSo please, Donald, STICK TO THE SCRIPT!!!!\n\nMy new book \u201cThe Power of RELENTLESS\u201d is out.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is exhibit A for RELENTLESS. He sticks to his message. His sticks with his principles. He sticks to his agenda \u2013 to cripple capitalism, redistribute wealth, and fundamentally change America. He sticks to his goals \u2013 even after losing in a landslide. He refuses to give up, or give in. He won\u2019t even slow down. It\u2019s straight ahead, petal to the medal.\n\nDonald Trump is also relentless. Trump must use Obama\u2019s own tactics against him. Obama won the presidency twice by campaigning against George W. Bush, not John McCain or Mitt Romney. Learn from him. Attack Obama, his policies and tragic results 24/7. Obama should be Trump\u2019s number one target.\n\nThe media is covering up for Obama. The economy is horrible. We\u2019re not in recovery. We\u2019ve never been out of the Great Obama Depression. The media won\u2019t tell you the truth. Nor do they explain how low Obama\u2019s ratings really are. Remember that Obama was repudiated just 10 months ago in a massive landslide. Since then, the economy is worse. The only jobs are crappy, low-wage, part-time jobs. And they only go to illegal immigrants. A new study just released proves that of the one million jobs created in America for women since 2007, all one million went to foreigners. That means 100 percent of female job gains in America for almost the last decade went to foreigners.\n\nThat\u2019s the true Obama economy.\n\nAmong middle class and working class voters, Obama is loathed. Yet every Democrat contender has the exact same agenda and policies as Obama. Whether it\u2019s Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden or Micahel O\u2019Malley they all support four more years of Obama policies. Go on the attack 24/7 against four more years of Obama\u2019s socialism, income redistribution, taxes, regulations, debt and the disaster of Obamacare. Stick to that attack 24/7.\n\nThen announce \u201cThe Great 8.\u201d The simple ideas and policies you\u2019ll fight for in year one of your presidency.\n\n1. I will build a wall.\n\nBUILD A WALL and they will come- voters that is. You must keep \u201cthe wall\u201d as your No. 1 issue.\n\nThe biased liberal media has lied and covered-up the truth for years: most of America is on your side. This could be the one issue both black Democrats and white conservatives agree on \u2013 illegal immigration is killing jobs for American citizens.\n\nYou needs to keep it simple: \u201cI will build the wall, secure the border, deport illegal aliens who commit felonies, and stop anyone already here illegally from getting welfare. We\u2019ll also make English the official language of the United States. We\u2019ll deal with rest of immigration issues later.\u201d\n\n2. I will be \u201cThe JOBS President.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll build a team of 10 of the most brilliant business leaders in U.S. history. Together, we will create millions of jobs. We\u2019ll turn it around with the ideas of this amazing brain trust. And we\u2019ll have one important rule: no government bureaucrats involved.\n\n3. I will repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nObamacare is destroying the U.S. economy- killing jobs, raising taxes, imposing regulations, dramatically raising insurance premium prices and prescription drug prices for middle class Americans. I will repeal it. I\u2019ll appoint Dr. Benjamin Carson to head this huge project. He is only one qualified to save the U.S. healthcare system. We need a brain surgeon \u2013 no joke. We happen to have the best one in the world.\n\n4. I will give the American people a simple Reagan-esque low flat tax.\n\nThe same low flat tax should apply to both individual taxpayers and corporations. We will give the money back to the people. It\u2019s YOUR money, not governments.\n\n5. I will cancel every single regulation imposed by Obama and Bush \u2013 we\u2019ll go back to Bill Clinton levels.\n\nThis is as moderate and reasonable of an idea as it gets. You want jobs? Regulations are strangling business. Businesses either close their doors, or move jobs offshore. The biggest regulation years in history were all under Obama and the last year of Bush. I\u2019ll wipe \u2018em all out. Regulations are strangling the economy. If Democrats liked the economy under Bill Clinton, GREAT! Then let\u2019s go back to his last day in office. Start there \u2013 with only those regulations. It\u2019s time for a re-set.\n\n6. I will make people on welfare find any kind of WORK.\n\nWe have to level the playing field. It\u2019s not fair to give people welfare and then allow them to not work, while the rest of us go to work each day. Everyone that needs welfare in America will get it, but they have to work. PERIOD.\n\n7. I will hold our government accountable.\n\nIn America no one is above the law. People have to trust government. If politicians break the law, they must pay the price just like rest of us mere mortals. Obama talks about \u201cfairness.\u201d So I\u2019m going to level the playing field between the people and the politicians.\n\nYou need to say:\n\n\u201cI will investigate and prosecute Obama for the massive IRS conspiracy.\n\n\u201cI will investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton for all of her many scandals \u2013 including the Benghazi lies and cover-up; 32,000 deleted emails; risking the national security of America with classified emails on a personal server; as well as billions of dollars in bribes accepted at The Clinton Foundation while Hillary was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cAnd from this day forward Congress has to live by same rules as the American people. Anything Congress passes applies to Congress too.\u201d\n\n8. \u201cI will always support Israel and I will cancel the Iran Treaty. Period.\u201d\n\nEnd of story.\n\nThen you must RELENTLESSLY tell the press\u2026\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I will talk about. The rest can wait. We\u2019ll deal with all the rest after my first year. But I\u2019ll take care of these eight in my first year. If the media asks me about anything else \u2026 I\u2019ll go back to these eight. Period.\n\n\u201cNo more distractions.\n\n\u201cNo more talk about what names I called people. Or my business bankruptcies. How ridiculous. You can talk about it. I won\u2019t. I will only talk about these great eight steps to save America in my first year.\u201d\n\nWayne Allyn Root is known as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist.\u201d Wayne\u2019s latest book is: \u201cThe Power of RELENTLESS!\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, bestselling author, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years.
