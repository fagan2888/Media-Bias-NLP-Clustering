Bloomberg noted that since he came to New York City in 1966, there always been some sort of new existential crisis.\n\n\"We'll never make any money again, there's this calamity, there's that calamity,\" he said. \"But they keep creating new products and you know the earnings of these big banks...they're still making a lot of money.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bloomberg, Obama, Obamacare, Wall Street, regulation, Dodd-Frank, banks, healthcare, reform, Congress, michael bloomberg, barack obama, health care, health care reform", "author": "Jesse Solomon", "og": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/10/investing/bloomberg-financial-regulation-obamacare/index.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "CNNMoney", "description": "Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg calls Obama's signature financial and healthcare reform bills 'dysfunctional' at a financial conference Monday.", "title": "Bloomberg slams Dodd-Frank, Obamacare"}, "section": "investing", "title": "Bloomberg slams Dodd-Frank, Obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-10T04:41:14", "date": "2014-11-10 04:41:14", "vr": {"category": "investing", "type": "Article"}, "keywords": "Bloomberg, Obama, Obamacare, Wall Street, regulation, Dodd-Frank, banks, healthcare, reform, Congress, michael bloomberg, barack obama, health care, health care reform", "twitter": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/10/investing/bloomberg-financial-regulation-obamacare/index.html", "title": "Bloomberg slams Dodd-Frank, Obamacare", "description": "Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg calls Obama's signature financial and healthcare reform bills 'dysfunctional' at a financial conference Monday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNMoney"}, "viewport": "width=1140", "description": "Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg calls Obama's signature financial and healthcare reform bills 'dysfunctional' at a financial conference Monday."}, "article_summary": "Related: Wall Street reform law only half doneBut despite the heightened scrutiny, life on Wall Street isn't so bad.\nThe harsh regulation on Wall Street is hurting Main Street, Bloomberg argued.\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg thinks President Obama's financial and health care reforms need a lot of improvement.\n\"The trouble is if you reduce the risk at these institutions, they can't make the money they did,\" Bloomberg said.\nBloomberg noted that since he came to New York City in 1966, there always been some sort of new existential crisis."}
