Meanwhile, the remainder of the grants will be awarded in the coming years.\n\nThe report said that although agency employees are required to report any potential waste or fraud within the grant program to their managers, it\u2019s up to their managers to pass those suspicions onto the inspector general. Because of this, auditors say they may be overlooking some potential fraud and waste.\n\n\"As a result, FRA cannot be certain that it is appropriately safeguarding federal investments,\" the auditors said.\n\nOn top of that, the RFA workers don\u2019t have any guidelines in place to help them identify when a grant might be considered vulnerable to waste, fraud or abuse.\n\nThe report also said that the agency has nothing in place requiring employees to document best practices to identify waste, fraud or abuse among the grants.\n\nRelated: Obamanomics 101\u2014A Reckless Risk on High Speed Rail\n\n\"Because FRA has not determined its risk tolerance \u2026 or setting response strategies when amending grant agreements, the agency may be exposing federal investments to unacceptable levels of risk,\" the auditors said. The IG recommended that the agency develop guidance to help improve oversight over the grants. DOT officials concurred.\n\nThe federal government has received a barrage of criticism in recent years for management of its high-speed rail projects that seem to be going nowhere fast. Just last year, The New York Times reported that a combination of setbacks and little to no support from states has slowed the projects to a grinding halt.\n\nIn August, Congress rejected the Obama administration\u2019s request for an additional $10 billion for high-speed rail. Likewise, three governors canceled their federal funding for the projects\u2014saying they were too expensive.\n\nNow, the latest report on lax oversight of the grants for high-speed rail could further slow the projects\u2019 momentum.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Auditors are flagging the Department of Transportation for lax oversight of the $10 bi", "title": "Lax Oversight of $10 Billion High Speed Rail Grants", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/07/Lax-Oversight-10-Billion-High-Speed-Rail-Grants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06122011_High_Speed_Rail_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/07/Lax-Oversight-10-Billion-High-Speed-Rail-Grants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06122011_High_Speed_Rail_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Auditors are flagging the Department of Transportation for lax oversight of the $10 bi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Auditors are flagging the Department of Transportation for lax oversight of the $10 billion in grants going toward high-speed rail projects across the country.\nNow, the latest report on lax oversight of the grants for high-speed rail could further slow the projects\u2019 momentum.\nIn August, Congress rejected the Obama administration\u2019s request for an additional $10 billion for high-speed rail.\nRelated: Obama\u2019s $11 Billion High Speed Rail to NowhereSo far, the RFA has approved about $5.5 billion in grants for at least 65 projects that either are in the process of being completed or are already finished.\nThe federal government has received a barrage of criticism in recent years for management of its high-speed rail projects that seem to be going nowhere fast."}
