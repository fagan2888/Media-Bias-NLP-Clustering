When confronting a deadline, you and I must take action or pay a penalty.\n\nFor example, the deadline for open enrollment to obtain medical coverage under the Affordable Care Act is Jan. 31.\n\nThe deadline to file your federal tax return next year is April 18. (It is three days later this year because Washington D.C. will be commemorating a local holiday, Emancipation Day, on Friday, April 15.)\n\nCollege students and their parents face a June 30, 2016, deadline to file a federal financial aid application.\n\nAnd so it goes.\n\nGenerally, if you miss a deadline you pay some sort of penalty. Penalties can run the gamut from additional costs \u2014 such as those incurred when filing a late tax return \u2014 to forfeiting the chance to obtain health insurance, student financial aid or other forms of government assistance.\n\nHowever, there is a different set of rules for a private corporation seeking to complete a major transportation project \u2014 one that fits nicely into the federal government's long-term plan to expand passenger rail service.\n\nIn this real-world scenario, a deadline is meaningless and movable.\n\nAll Aboard Florida \u2014 aka Brightline \u2014 is facing a Jan. 1 deadline to sell $1.75 billion of tax-exempt bonds to help finance its Miami-to-Orlando passenger rail project. The rail company has requested an extension from the U.S. Department of Transportation, which allocates bonds for such projects.\n\nIs there any doubt the Department of Transportation will extend the deadline?\n\nNone whatsoever.\n\nIf you're pinning your hopes of stopping the project on the expiration of the Jan. 1 deadline, prepare to be disappointed. The federal government has been greasing the skids for this project from the beginning. Uncle Sam isn't about to let something as benign as a deadline get in the way.\n\nRemember: The Department of Transportation moved the original deadline from July 1 to Jan. 1. No doubt it is poised to extend the deadline again.\n\nSeveral factors have frustrated All Aboard Florida's efforts to sell the bonds in a timely manner. These include the size of the offering and a slowdown in the corporate bond market.\n\nThe rail company needs more time to market and sell the bonds. And the federal government is philosophically obligated to comply with the request.\n\nLest we forget, the U.S. Department of Transportation is operating in accordance with the National Rail Plan, which it drafted in 2009. One of the goals of the plan is \"to connect communities with high-speed and intercity passenger rail where population densities and competitive trip times create markets for success.\"\n\nTen potential high-speed corridors received special designation from federal officials. The Miami-Orlando-Tampa route is one of them.\n\nBottom line? The federal government is predisposed to help facilitate the All Aboard Florida project, which is slated for completion in late 2017. And selling these bonds is a critical financial component of the project.\n\nThree things we know with certainty:\n\nThe sun will come up tomorrow. With 32 daily trains and no train stops planned for our region, All Aboard Florida is a bad deal for the Treasure Coast. The Department of Transportation will extend the company's deadline to sell the bonds.\n\nRich Campbell is the Shaping Our Future columnist for Treasure Coast Newspapers.
