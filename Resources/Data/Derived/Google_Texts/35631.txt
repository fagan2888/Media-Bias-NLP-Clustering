A New Jersey man has pleaded guilty to manslaughter charges in a multi-vehicle crash in Newark that killed two people.

The Essex County prosecutorâ€™s office says James Sterling, also known as James Megget, pleaded guilty Thursday to two manslaughter counts stemming from the Nov. 19, 2012 crash.

Prosecutors say the 30-year-old Elizabeth resident was driving a minivan that hit an ambulance in Newark, setting off a multi-vehicle crash involving a food truck and a county transportation bus.

Killed in the crash was ambulance attendant Keith Chipepo, a 30-year-old resident of Montclair. A patient in the ambulance, 58-year-old Martha Conley of Newark, died days later from injuries suffered in the crash.

Sterling is facing a 13-year prison sentence under terms of a plea agreement. His sentencing is scheduled for September 16.
