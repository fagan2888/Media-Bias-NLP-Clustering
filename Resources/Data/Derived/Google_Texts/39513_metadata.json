In December, the economy added just 75,000 jobs, a meager gain that many economists had initially blamed on bad weather.\n\nOne worrisome sign is a sudden freeze in hiring in health care, one of the nation\u2019s fastest growing industries over the past two decades. Health-care providers cut jobs for the first time on record, raising questions about whether the rollout of Obamacare is roiling the industry.\n\nAlso read: Reactions to the payrolls report\n\nGovernment also eliminated the most jobs in 15 months, with the U.S. Post Office accounting for a large chunk of the decline.\n\nThe jobless rate reached the lowest post-recession level in January. See more charts here.\n\nThe nation\u2019s unemployment rate, meanwhile, dropped to 6.6% from 6.7% in December, the Labor Department said Friday. That\u2019s the lowest level since October 2008, and in a good sign, the decline occurred because more people found jobs and not because the labor force shrank again.\n\nIn another bit of good news, the so-called labor force participation rate edged up to 63.0% after retouching a 35-year low of 62.8% in December.\n\nThe participation rate reflects the percentage of people who hold a job or are looking for one. A surprisingly sharp decline in participation over the past few years is largely responsible for the falling unemployment rate.\n\nIn U.S. markets, investors shrugged off the lower-than expected increase in employment and stocks SPX, +0.83% advanced. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast an increase of 190,000 jobs.\n\nKate Warne, an investment strategist at Edward Jones, said investors aren\u2019t convinced the economy is slowing, and if it is, investors probably would expect the Federal Reserve to reverse course and pump more stimulus into the economy in a move that would help stocks.\n\n\u201cIt will take more than a month or two of weak data to conclude the jobs market is becoming weaker,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a yellow flag, not a red flag.\u201d\n\nInside the report\n\nThe private sector once again generated all the employment growth, adding 142,000 jobs in January. That\u2019s up sharply from 89,000 in December but well below the norm over the past year.\n\nHiring rose the fastest in January in professional and business services, construction and manufacturing.\n\nThe number of professional jobs created in January jumped by 36,000. The industry has been the fastest growing since the recession ended in mid-2009.\n\nBuilders boosted payrolls by 48,000 last month after a 22,000 drop in December, and manufacturers hired 21,000 workers. Both of these industries are prone to weather-related fluctuations in hiring.\n\nBars, hotels and restaurants also added 24,000 jobs in the first month of 2014.\n\nEmployment fell in the retail sector, however, as companies cut 13,000 jobs. In the past month, Macy\u2019s said it would eliminate several thousand positions and discounter Loehmann\u2019s said it would go out of business.\n\nGovernment jobs fell by 29,000 in January, including a 9,000 decline in Postal workers. It was the biggest drop in government jobs since October 2012.\n\nAverage hourly wages of U.S. workers, meanwhile, rose 5 cents, or 0.2%, to $24.21 in January. In the past 12 months hourly wages have risen 1.9% \u2014 enough to keep ahead of inflation but too little to give consumers much to cheer about. The average workweek was flat at 34.4 hours.\n\nEmployment gains for December and November, meanwhile, were mixed. The number of new jobs created in December was barely changed at 75,000 compared to a preliminary read of 74,000. November\u2019s figure was revised up to 274,000 from 241,000.\n\nThe U.S. had added an average of 154,00 jobs a month since November. Yet the pace of hiring has tapered off from the 194,000 average for all of 2013.\n\nAlso read: It\u2019s OK that Obamacare leads to some quitting their job\n\nJob interviews are getting weirder\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The U.S. added 113,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate fell again to a new post-recession low, but the pace of hiring appears to have slowed over the past few months, according to government figures released Friday.
