In Iowa, 33.7 million chickens and turkeys have died of the disease or been euthanized to prevent its spread, and more than 1,500 workers are expected to lose their jobs. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad has requested that four counties be declared federal disaster areas.\n\nIowa\u2014the nation\u2019s largest egg producing state\u2014has lost 25 million of the nation\u2019s leading flock of 60 million egg laying hens.\n\nAnd for consumers? There has been an uptick in the price of eggs. Julie Bolhuis, owner of Heavenly\u2019s A Creative Bakery in Iowa Falls, Iowa, told The Daily Signal, \u201cWe have to buy eggs no matter what. We\u2019re a bakery. Everything has eggs in it.\u201d\n\nBolhuis says Heavenly\u2019s goes through at least 3-4 cases of eggs per week. The bakery gets as many eggs as possible from a local farmer\u2014who has not significantly raised egg prices\u2014but Bolhuis must go through a food vendor to get the rest.\n\n\u201cWe have to suck it up and pay triple the price,\u201d Bolhuis said.\n\nThe family-owned bakery now pays $45 per case of 15 dozen eggs compared to the previous $15 per case. A report released last week by the U.S. Department of Agriculture says Iowa egg production dropped 21 percent in May alone.\n\nBolhuis says the bakery sticks to its formulas for its famous sugar cookies and other recipes but makes fewer of each item to allay the costs.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just eggs. Bolhuis said Heavenly\u2019s, which also serves breakfast and lunch, was unable to order the turkey it normally uses for its sandwiches because of the problem and had to substitute another kind.\n\nAccording to the Iowa Department of Agriculture, at least 30 countries have put restrictions on accepting U.S. poultry exports, including a ban on all U.S poultry products by China, South Korea, South Africa and Thailand.\n\nBolhuis said she wants to hold off on price increases in hopes the situation will return to normal soon. But it\u2019s not easy.\n\n\u201cAll food businesses get hit in one way or another at some point,\u201d Bolhuis said. \u201cIt\u2019s whether you can weather the storm and make adjustments. It\u2019s part of playing the game in the food business. You\u2019re not in control.\u201d\n\nFarm owners are learning the same lesson as Bolhuis and her bakery.\n\nThe infected barns need to go through an extensive cleaning and disinfecting process before repopulating bird flocks can begin. When asked about the projected length of the rebuilding process for farm owners, Olson said, \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell. In some cases we anticipate farms to be repopulated yet this year. Some estimates have been in order to be fully repopulated it might take up to 12, 18 or even 24 months.\u201d\n\nLastly, Olson emphasized, \u201cI want to remind everybody that the food is safe to eat and that there is no human health consequence to this disease. It\u2019s very serious for the birds that are infected, but it is only an avian disease not a human disease.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Farmers, bakers and others struggling to deal with 20-state outbreak of avian flu and the devastation it has caused for egg and poultry markets.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Farmers, bakers and others struggling to deal with 20-state outbreak of avian flu and the devastation it has caused for egg and poultry markets.", "title": "Avian Flu: 'Worst Animal Disease Outbreak in History of Iowa'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150629_birdflu.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-29T18:34:44+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1SYCqhw"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Farmers, bakers and others struggling to deal with 20-state outbreak of avian flu and the devastation it has caused for egg and poultry markets.", "title": "Avian Flu: 'Worst Animal Disease Outbreak in History of Iowa'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150629_birdflu.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "Agriculture", "published_time": "2015-06-29T17:37:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T18:34:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iowa Department of Agriculture, Avian flu, eggs, turkey, chicken, Terry Branstad, Julie Bolhuis, Heavenly's, Iowa City"}, "article_summary": "Iowa\u2014the nation\u2019s largest egg producing state\u2014has lost 25 million of the nation\u2019s leading flock of 60 million egg laying hens.\nA report released last week by the U.S. Department of Agriculture says Iowa egg production dropped 21 percent in May alone.\nRandy Olson, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association, called it the \u201cworst animal disease outbreak in the history of Iowa and potentially the history of the U.S.\u201d He said the last 2 \u00bd months have \u201cbeen in some state of a new normal \u2026 trying to manage through this disease outbreak.\u201dThe Avian Flu has been felt by farmers, employees and communities in Iowa and throughout the nation.\nIt\u2019s very serious for the birds that are infected, but it is only an avian disease not a human disease.\u201d\nJulie Bolhuis, owner of Heavenly\u2019s A Creative Bakery in Iowa Falls, Iowa, told The Daily Signal, \u201cWe have to buy eggs no matter what."}
