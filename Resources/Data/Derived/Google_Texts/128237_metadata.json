Wilkes, a 42-year-old Army reservist, will testify before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee along with fellow whistleblowers Brandon Coleman and Joseph Colon, and the brother of psychologist Chris Kirkpatrick.\n\nThe event promises high drama. Senators will likely grill the whistleblowers\u2019 detractors \u2013 officials from the VA and the VA\u2019s Inspector General. The senators will no doubt want to know how the VA allowed secret waiting lists designed to mask long wait times for patient care, along with other malfeasance and cover-ups while the staffers responsible remain employed.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel (OSC) will sit at the same witness table and testify \u2013 just days after issuing a scathing letter to President Obama on the VA\u2019s nationwide \u201cpattern of deficit patient care\u201d and \u201cfailure to take appropriate discipline.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most troubling aspect of whistleblower retaliation within the VA is that, in the end, it\u2019s the veterans who ultimately suffer when the courageous employees who expose wrongdoing are punished,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-WI, chairman of the committee. \u201cI hope this hearing will highlight how the lack of a permanent watchdog allows whistleblower retaliation to spiral out of control.\u201d\n\nThe VA\u2019s Inspector General (IG) is supposed to investigate claims of wrongdoing at the VA as an alleged independent agency; the OSC actually is a separate agency, grants whistleblower status and reports to the president.\n\nAs for the whistleblowers, they have mixed feelings of relief and delight to be testifying on Capitol Hill after years of allegations that have gone nowhere.\n\n\u201cThe Inspector General has proven to be useless. The more we can expose them the better,\u201d charged Wilkes, who until recently, remarkably found himself under a criminal investigation by the IG for accessing evidence to prove his whistleblower claims.\n\n\u201cThey have to get on board and stop covering up for the VA or bring in an agency that is truly independent,\u201d Wilkes said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it will take to clean up the VA because the VA has proven that it can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nOSC investigations are not automatic. They happen when government employees \u2013 rather than the federal agency they work for \u2013 ask for whistleblower protection because they witnessed incidents that could be illegal or inhumane. Not all of the complaints result in a full-fledged investigation with an open case.\n\nVA complaints have doubled in recent years. About 40 percent of the OSC\u2019s workload of 5,237 cases last year pertained to the VA, comparted to 20 percent from several years ago, said OSC spokesperson Nick Schwellenbach.\n\nUsually cases are resolved with little fanfare. However, last week the OSC issued a widely publicized report that backed up claims by Phoenix VA hospital\u2019s Dr. Katherine Mitchell who spoke out last year about abuses. According to the blistering report, emergency room triage nurses were \u201cgrossly unqualified\u201d and other employees were \u201ccomplicit in significant patient neglect.\u201d\n\nWilkes is still waiting for a conclusion to his case. In 2013 he told supervisors that wait times were excessive for mental health patients but his complaints were ignored. The following year he obtained copies of a secret wait list with 2,700 names, including 37 who died while awaiting appointments. When he gave the evidence to the Inspector General, investigators seemed uninterested in pursuing his claims \u2013 instead telling Wilkes that he was under a criminal investigation for accessing unauthorized data, Watchdog discovered.\n\nIt was then that the OSC granted Wilkes whistleblower status. Months later, the IG abruptly dropped its criminal probe without explanation. He remains at the VA, but in a demoted position with an office ostracized from other workers.\n\nColon was threatened with termination last year from the Puerto Rico VA when he revealed that the hospital director was arrested for drug possession and intoxication. Kirkpatrick committed suicide in 2009 after he was fired for reporting that VA doctors were overmedicating patients in Wisconsin.\n\nAnd in Phoenix, Coleman was suspended in January from his job as a counselor when he reveled that suicidal veterans were being turned away without care. He remains out of work because he has refused the VA\u2019s overtures to reinstate him. He says returning to his job would mean working alongside the very people he complained about, Coleman says.\n\nThe OSC says one of the major issues facing the VA is its refusal to terminate or reassign employees involved in egregious behavior.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking for accountability in the VA and to protect the whistleblowers,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop until I get action. Even if we don\u2019t get it this time, I\u2019m going to keep going. I think it\u2019s a privilege and not a right to work for the VA.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A Senate committee is set to grill top officials from the VA and its Inspector General after hearing sordid whistleblower testimony.", "title": "VA whistleblowers get their day on Capitol Hill - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/09/marine_veteran_flag.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-21T11:31:20+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/238962/whistleblowers/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Arizona", "tag": "Brandon Coleman,Chris Kirkpatrick,Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs,Homeland Security,hospital,Joseph Colon,Katherine Mitchell,Puerto Rico,Senate,Shea Wilkes,Shreveport,Tori Richards,VA,Veterans Affairs", "published_time": "2015-09-21T04:00:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-21T11:31:20+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A Senate committee is set to grill top officials from the VA and its Inspector General after hearing sordid whistleblower testimony.", "title": "VA whistleblowers get their day on Capitol Hill - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/09/marine_veteran_flag.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "A Senate committee is set to grill top officials from the VA and its Inspector General after hearing sordid whistleblower testimony."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe48ac\"", "article_summary": "Senators will likely grill the whistleblowers\u2019 detractors \u2013 officials from the VA and the VA\u2019s Inspector General.\n\u201cI\u2019m asking for accountability in the VA and to protect the whistleblowers,\u201d Coleman said.\nAs for the whistleblowers, they have mixed feelings of relief and delight to be testifying on Capitol Hill after years of allegations that have gone nowhere.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it will take to clean up the VA because the VA has proven that it can\u2019t be trusted.\u201dOSC investigations are not automatic.\n\u201cThe Inspector General has proven to be useless."}
