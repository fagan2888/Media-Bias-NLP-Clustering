Believe it or not, these soulless robots have prepared an actual talking-points memo for the occasion replete with tips on how to plan your \u201ctalk.\u201d My favorite: \u201cIntegrate the talk into family time.\u201d Good advice \u2014 and for my money, the more dramatic the integration, the better. When your cousin pulls out baby pictures of her newborn and tries to pass them around, grab her arm gently but firmly and say, \u201cHey \u2014 isn\u2019t there something more important we should be discussing?\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be fazed by the stunned silence that follows. That\u2019s your opening to grab your iPad and start the Powerpoint on enrollment that you\u2019ve prepared.\n\nI like the idea that you, by dint of having donated to Obama and happily swallowed endless lies about keeping your plan and your provider network, are necessarily the \u201cvoice of reason\u201d at the dinner table this year. In the unlikely event that you find yourself seated across from one of these benighted schmucks, you can play it three ways: One: Deflect. Change the subject. Bring up \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d or how boring the NFL is this year or whether maybe Orwell had a point about statism\u2019s insidious power to dehumanize people by reducing them to cogs in a government propaganda machine. Two: Engage. Ace has prepared a helpful talking-points memo of his own in case you find yourself at a loss upon being pitched on O-Care by the same arrogant little sh*t who called you ignorant for doubting that the program would work at Thanksgiving dinners past. (If Ezra Klein has any conservative relatives, he or she is about to have the best Thanksgiving ever.) Three: If there are people at the table considering buying a plan on the exchange, wait patiently until they\u2019re done cursing Obama for having forced their insurer to cancel their old coverage and then prepare them for how to shop on the exchange. For starters, don\u2019t believe the prices quoted on Healthcare.gov:\n\nThe troubled federal website allows visitors to anonymously surf the site for exchange plans sold in their areas and provides them with estimated prices for each health plan. (Just click on the \u201cSee Plans Now\u201d button on the homepage and follow instructions.) But here\u2019s the problem: The monthly premium estimates provided on the website do not consider a person\u2019s specific age, household size or tobacco use \u2014 all critical factors when estimating premiums\u2026 For our family of four, HealthCare.gov offers six Silver plans: four Independence Blue Cross plans and two Aetna plans. (We considered only the Silver plans to keep it simple.) The HealthCare.gov estimates ranged from $708.84 per month to $982 per month. Now, HealthCare.gov doesn\u2019t ask for ages or even an age range when providing plan information and premium estimates for family coverage. All it wants to know is the visitor\u2019s home state and county. ValuePenguin.com asks for a little more information. Besides county and state, window shoppers have to provide household size, as well as ages and tobacco use for all family members. That website\u2019s estimates were higher \u2014 much higher. A whopping 69 percent higher for each exchange plan. The premium range: $1,201.44 to $1,666 per month. (And, remember, that\u2019s for a family of nonsmokers.)\n\nThey might be eligible for a subsidy, but then again they might not. And their subsidy might be illegal depending upon where they buy the plan: If they get it from Healthcare.gov or directly from an insurer, the rug could be pulled out from under them next year. Buying one of the cheaper \u201cbronze\u201d plans on the exchanges will help cut their cost, but they need to be careful and read the fine print. The bronze plans are the ones with the highest deductibles and the smallest provider networks. They might be better off with silver or even gold, if they can afford it. At around this point, someone at the table\u2019s going to pipe up and say, \u201cBut why are they so expensive?\u201d That\u2019s when the real fun begins.\n\nActually, I think that last bit explains why OFA is doing this, as creepy as it seems. They know ObamaCare\u2019s going to come up at a lot of dinner tables this year and they know that most of what\u2019s said won\u2019t be happy. The talking-points memo isn\u2019t meant to be followed to the letter \u2014 I hope \u2014 it\u2019s just a way of nudging liberals to encourage people to reserve judgment when the subject does come up. In fact, given that young adults are (a) O-Care\u2019s target consumers and (b) the demographic that\u2019s probably most likely to click on a link from OFA, the whole \u201ctalking-points memo\u201d is really just a way to encourage the people reading it to sign up themselves. There\u2019s a lot of \u201cyoung healthies\u201d out there to be gouged before this boat will float.\n\nThere \u2026 sure is a lot of this stuff floating around on lefty sites right now, though. Exit quotation:\n\nDevoting our whole show on Wednesday to how to talk about politics, news with conservative family members. Should be fun! \u2014 Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) November 25, 2013\n\nUpdate: Via Mark and Mollie Hemingway, \u201cThe 5 Most Insane Obamacare Talking Points You Can Expect To Hear From Your Crazy Uncle This Week.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a sample response you might use. \u201cThat would be great. Except that I\u2019m going to be washing dishes and cleaning up for a bit. How about you go into the guest room and use the computer in there to sign me up. As soon as you\u2019re done, you can have some pie.\u201d The key is to get them to make a commitment not to come out until they\u2019ve finished signing you up. Remember their conversation tip \u2014 Ask them to make a plan, and commit to it. Ask them to commit to finishing the sign-up before they come out of the room. Since nobody can actually sign up for Obamacare, they\u2019ll be busily trying to operate the web site for the duration of your visit.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Enrollment.", "title": "OFA: Be sure to use Thanksgiving dinner to convince relatives to buy a plan on the ObamaCare exchange", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/25/ofa-be-sure-to-use-your-thanksgiving-family-gathering-to-convince-relatives-to-buy-a-plan-on-the-obamacare-exchange/", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/of.jpg", "height": 479}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-25T23:11:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-26T00:08:06+00:00"}, "keywords": "enroll, enrollment, mandate, ObamaCare, ofa, plan, premiums, Thanksgiving,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe022c\"", "article_summary": "A whopping 69 percent higher for each exchange plan.\nOFA: Be sure to use Thanksgiving dinner to convince relatives to buy a plan on the ObamaCare exchangeposted at 6:11 pm on November 25, 2013 by AllahpunditVia Jonah Goldberg.\nThe HealthCare.gov estimates ranged from $708.84 per month to $982 per month.\nNow, HealthCare.gov doesn\u2019t ask for ages or even an age range when providing plan information and premium estimates for family coverage.\n(If Ezra Klein has any conservative relatives, he or she is about to have the best Thanksgiving ever.)"}
