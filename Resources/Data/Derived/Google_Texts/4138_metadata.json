Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) believes that Cuba must improve its human rights before receiving warmer ties with the U.S.\n\nWasserman Schultz also said that her timeline for a diplomatic thaw differs from President Obama\u2019s, according to The Daily Signal Thursday.\n\n\u201cMy view is different from President Obama\u2019s,\u201d she told Daily Signal contributor David Brody.\n\n\u201cI believe a relationship with the United States should be earned \u2026 perhaps we should make sure that some of these human rights concessions are secured prior to moving forward,\u201d added the Democratic National Committee chairwoman.\n\nObama announced last week that the U.S. and Cuba both plan on opening embassies in one another\u2019s borders after five decades without them.\n\nThe landmark decision follows the president\u2019s initial call for restoring diplomatic relations last December.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic step forward in our efforts to normalize relations with the Cuban government and people,\u201d Obama said on July 1.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be imprisoned by the past,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen something isn\u2019t working, we can and will change.\u201d\n\nWasserman Schultz said that despite her misgivings, the Obama administration\u2019s thaw with Cuba is a rare opportunity for improving human rights conditions.\n\n\u201cAnytime we\u2019re at the negotiating table with any nation like Cuba that has as horrendous a human rights record as they do, it\u2019s an opportunity to be able to assert our view that making sure that any nation in the world should have freedom of their elections, that people should have the right to elect a person of their choice, that they should be able to speak freely, even if it is against the actions of their government and not be subject to arrest, that they should be able to make sure they can move freely throughout their country,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo President Obama\u2019s policy allows us to be able to press those priorities at the negotiating table,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Obama administration cleared a major hurdle for restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba by dropping it from the State Department\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism in May.\n\nCritics argue that Obama\u2019s decision ignores alleged human rights abuses under Cuban leader Ra\u00fal Castro.\n\nFormer Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) are particularly opposed to the move given their state\u2019s large population of Cuban exiles fleeing the Castro regime.\n\nBush suggested on Wednesday he is unlikely to keep open any embassy the Obama administration launches if he wins the presidency next year.\n\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d he said when asked about maintaining an active embassy in Havana.\n\nRubio, meanwhile, called Obama\u2019s Cuba policies a \u201cFaustian bargain\u201d in a New York Times op-ed published the same day.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Florida rep. believes Cuba must improve its human rights before receiving warmer ties with the U.S.", "description": "The Florida rep. believes Cuba must improve its human rights before receiving warmer ties with the U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Florida rep. believes Cuba must improve its human rights before receiving warmer ties with the U.S.", "title": "DNC chairwoman criticizes Cuba thaw", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/247422-dnc-chairwoman-criticizes-cuba-thaw", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/wasserman-schultz-debbie_031814aw_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-09T17:16:13-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-09T17:16-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/247422-dnc-chairwoman-criticizes-cuba-thaw", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-09T16:13-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mark Hensch", "author": "Mark Hensch", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-09T16:13:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-09T17:16:13-04:00"}, "keywords": "Cuba, DNC, President Obama, Ra\u00fal Castro, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Debbie Wasserman Schultz,President Obama, Rep.
