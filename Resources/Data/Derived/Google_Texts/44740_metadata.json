Of those one, a 60-year-old woman, remained \u201cvery\u201d critically injured Saturday afternoon, according to Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson.\n\nThe driver of the SUV, who appeared to be a man in his 20s, suffered serious arm injuries and had to be extricated from his vehicle, Jackson said. The man has not been formally arrested, though police said they expect to take him into custody.\n\nThe SUV was traveling north in the southbound lanes of South Colorado Boulevard for about half a block before impact, Jackson said.\n\nAccent Optics is on the northwest corner of Colorado and East Amherst Avenue.\n\nJackson said there is no indication the driver of the SUV tried to brake or slow down before hitting the building.\n\n\u201cAt this point we are not sure why he was traveling on the wrong side of the street,\u201d he said.\n\nAbby, an employee at the Steele Street Bank and Trust across the street, who declined to give her last name, heard the crash and ran outside where she saw from 15 to 20 bystanders running towards the optics store.\n\nShe said she saw an elderly woman exit the wreckage looking dazed who said that her husband was still inside the shop. Abby said the woman was followed by a man \u201ccompletely covered in blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of debris,\u201d Abby said. \u201cI thought it was smoke at first, but then I realized it was insulation and construction debris all over the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was kind of surreal,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething that you see on television that happens to other people.\u201d\n\nThe accident happened around 10:08 a.m. Saturday, said Division Chief Joseph Gonzales of the Denver Fire Department.\n\nAt least six fire trucks were on the scene Saturday morning and teams were shoring up a corner of the building.\n\nSouthbound Colorado Boulevard was reopened around 1 p.m. after being shut down at Amherst during the investigation. The SUV narrowly missed a lamp post and a fire hydrant before it it the corner of the building.\n\nPolice originally had said that five people were injured in the crash, later revising that count at a press conference Saturday afternoon. It is unknown which drug or drugs that police believe the driver had used.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jesseapaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Four people injured, 2 seriously, as SUV crashes into Denver building", "title": "Four people injured, 2 seriously, as SUV crashes into Denver building", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/12/four-people-injured-2-seriously-as-suv-crashes-into-denver-building/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140712__CD13CARINTOBUILDING__AC29788xp1.jpg", "height": 494}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140712__CD13CARINTOBUILDING__AC29788xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-12T10:57:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:50:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccda0\"", "article_summary": "Southbound Colorado Boulevard was reopened around 1 p.m. after being shut down at Amherst during the investigation.\nThe SUV was traveling north in the southbound lanes of South Colorado Boulevard for about half a block before impact, Jackson said.\nOf those one, a 60-year-old woman, remained \u201cvery\u201d critically injured Saturday afternoon, according to Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson.\nThe SUV narrowly missed a lamp post and a fire hydrant before it it the corner of the building.\nJackson said there is no indication the driver of the SUV tried to brake or slow down before hitting the building."}
