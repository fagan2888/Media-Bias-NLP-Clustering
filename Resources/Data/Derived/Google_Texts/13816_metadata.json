REUTERS/Brian Snyder (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTR4889W\n\n4357639\n\nNew Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was just trying to take the focus off her own vote for Obamacare during Thursday night\u2019s debate, but she ended up inadvertently providing a talking point against every Senate Democrat running for reelection in November.\n\nRepublican Senate hopeful Scott Brown was taking aim at Shaheen for her pivotal vote for Obamacare in 2010 when Shaheen jumped in indignantly and made things easy for him.\n\n\u201cShe was the deciding vote,\u201d Brown began to say of the health-care law.\n\n\u201cThere were 60 of us,\u201d Shaheen interrupted, \u201cEverybody was a deciding vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Brown countered. \u201cEvery Democrat voted, and yes \u2014 every Democrat was the deciding vote, for a terrible bill that\u2019s crushing businesses.\u201d\n\nThe health-care law passed by 60 votes \u2014 the slimmest margin possible. Had just one Democrat changed their mind, Obamacare wouldn\u2019t be the law of the land today.\n\nGOP candidates in Senate races across the country have been using the 60-vote threshold against incumbent Democrats. Brown\u2019s been making the case that Shaheen was the deciding vote for the health-care law for months; the same line of reasoning has been used against Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu and Colorado Sen. Mark Udall.\n\nA majority of the American public at large disapproves of Obamacare, and the same goes in New Hampshire as well. An October 10 poll by the University of New Hampshire found that just 32 percent of New Hampshire adults approve of the health-care law, while 52 percent oppose it.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Taking every Democrat down with her", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "New Hampshire Democratic Sen.
