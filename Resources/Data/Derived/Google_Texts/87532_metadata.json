Not anymore. Associated Press-GfK polling found a spring and summer of discontent with the president\u2019s handling of world events.\n\nObama\u2019s consistently low marks across crises such as the fighting in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas could benefit Republicans aiming to win control Congress in the fall.\n\n\u201cThe problem is saying something and not doing anything \u2014 making grandiose threats and never following any of them up,\u201d said Dwight Miller, 71, a retiree and volunteer firefighter in Robertson County, Texas. Miller, who describes himself as a libertarian-leaning Republican, says Obama should either stay out of other nations\u2019 business or commit to going \u201call in.\u201d\n\nIn Hawaii, another retiree, Kent Killam, also worries about the U.S. response to cascading troubles in Ukraine, the Middle East and elsewhere. But he blames former President George W. Bush for eroding the nation\u2019s clout abroad and Republican lawmakers for limiting Obama\u2019s ability to act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going well at all,\u201d said Killam, 72, a Democratic-leaning independent. \u201cOn the other hand, I don\u2019t think he has too many options.\u201d\n\nThe foreign conflicts that have consumed so much of Washington\u2019s attention lately aren\u2019t rated as especially pressing by most Americans surveyed for the AP-GfK poll. It\u2019s unclear how their unhappiness with Obama\u2019s performance will affect the midterm elections in November.\n\nAsked about world trouble spots:\n\n\u201442 percent say the conflict between Israel and Hamas is \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d important to them; 60 percent disapprove of the way Obama has handled it.\n\n\u201440 percent consider the situation in Afghanistan highly important; 60 percent disapprove of Obama\u2019s handling of it.\n\n\u201438 percent give high importance to the conflict in Ukraine; 57 percent disapprove of what Obama has done about that.\n\n\u201438 percent find the situation in Iraq of pressing importance; 57 percent disapprove of Obama\u2019s handling of it.\n\nOpinion of Obama\u2019s foreign policy has slid nearly as low as his overall approval rating.\n\nJust 43 percent were OK with the president\u2019s handling of foreign relations in the new poll, while 40 percent approved how he\u2019s doing his job overall. AP-GfK polls in March and May show a similar picture.\n\nThe late-March poll, which came after Russia seized upon an uprising in Ukraine to annex the Crimean Peninsula, marked a significant drop from January\u2019s 49 percent foreign policy rating. In September 2012, shortly before Obama\u2019s re-election, it was 57 percent.\n\nRepublicans line up more uniformly behind their party on foreign policy than Democrats do.\n\nAsked whom they trust more to protect the country, 71 percent of Republicans chose their party. Only 39 percent of Democrats said their party most; about as many Democrats trusted both parties equally.\n\nSixty-three percent of Republicans have more confidence in their party in an international crisis, while 44 percent of Democrats put faith in their party alone. Most Democrats did prefer their party for managing the U.S. image abroad \u2014 51 percent said it would handle that better.\n\nAbout half of independents don\u2019t trust either major party in a world crisis.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re both a little bit more aggressive than they need to be in using armies instead of going through the U.N.,\u201d said Cameron Wooley, 18, of Orlando, Florida, who\u2019s still deciding whom to support when she votes for the first time this year.\n\n\u201cMaybe if we didn\u2019t spend these massive chunks of our budget on the military we wouldn\u2019t have the other concerns we have because of money,\u201d Wooley said. An aspiring opera singer attending the University of North Florida in the fall, she would like to see some of that defense money handed over to the states to spend on things like education and roads.\n\nOnly about half of those polled see foreign relations as highly important right now, and concern about the United States\u2019 relationship with other countries hasn\u2019t increased despite recent news.\n\nJay Lofstead, a Democrat in Albuquerque, New Mexico, wants to see more involvement in the world\u2019s problems, and he gives Obama a mixed review.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see him get more involved on a humanitarian basis in more areas, not military support \u2014 no financial support, no weapons \u2014 but strictly humanitarian aid,\u201d said Lofstead, 44, a supercomputer researcher at Sandia National Laboratories, who stressed that he speaks only for himself.\n\nThe AP-GfK Poll was conducted July 24-28, 2014, using KnowledgePanel, GfK\u2019s probability-based online panel designed to be representative of the U.S. population. It involved online interviews with 1,044 adults, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points for all respondents. It is larger for subgroups.\n\nRespondents were first selected randomly using phone or mail survey methods, and were later interviewed online. People selected for KnowledgePanel who didn\u2019t otherwise have access to the Internet were provided with the ability to access the Internet at no cost to them.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Foreign policy used to be a bright spot in Americans' dimming opinion of President Barack Obama.
