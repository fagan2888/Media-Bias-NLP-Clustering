We can choose not to deport the 11 million individuals, the vast majority of whom have never harmed anyone. On the contrary, they've produced and purchased goods and services, not to mention enriching their communities. And the last time I looked, the presence of those peaceful folks has not kept us from being a country. (If not being a country means there's no government to bomb and deport people, then put me down for that.)\n\nOnce again, Trump's words bear no resemblance to reality. We should be used to this by now. He's the Bullshitter-in-Chief.\n\nFortunately, most if not all of his rivals think mass deportation is an insane idea\u2014not that they're any great shakes on immigration. They all support \"securing the border,\" and I can't recall any of them condemning government sanctions for private enterprises that hire people who lack government papers (E-Verify).\n\nBefore continuing with Trump's horrendous proposal, we ought to acknowledge that Ted Cruz also distinguished himself on this issue during the debate when he said, to hearty applause:\n\nI understand that when the mainstream media covers immigration, it doesn't often see it as an economic issue. But, I can tell you for millions of Americans at home watching this, it is a very personal economic issue. And, I will say the politics of it will be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande. Or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press. Then, we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation. [Emphasis added.]\n\nIf, as I've been told, Cruz in his younger years attended seminars on free-market economics, we can chalk up his nativist fear-mongering to sheer demagoguery (or perhaps poor memory) rather than economic illiteracy.\n\nWhere is this economic calamity from immigration? If you think immigrants generally and substantially depress wages, see Bryan Caplan here, Ben Powell here, and Dave Bier here. Spoiler alert: the leading anti-immigration labor economist says the worst harm is a long-run 4.8 percent wage decline for high school dropouts; gainers include high-school graduates and those with some college education. As an economist friend says, if an unskilled Mexican who can't speak English threatens your job, you've got a bigger problem than immigration. (See more articles here. If you like video, see this.)\n\nBut back to Trump and mass deportation. The first thing to note is that it would cost a hell of a lot of money. Ben Gitis and Laura Collins of the American Action Forum write,\n\nDepending on how the government conducts its apprehensions, it would need to spend $100 billion to $300 billion arresting and removing all undocumented immigrants residing in the country, a process that we estimate would take 20 years. In addition, to prevent any new undocumented immigrants going forward, the government would at a minimum have to maintain current immigration enforcement levels. This results in an additional $315 billion in continuing enforcement costs over that time period. That's not cheap.\n\nMore important, however, is that Trump would need a pumped-up police state to pull off the deportation 11 million people, many of whom have been in the country, and integrated into their communities for many years. They aren't walking around wearing patches on their clothing saying, \"UNDOCUMENTED.\" (I should be careful about giving Trump ideas.)\n\nAs Rich Cromwell writes at The Federalist, a conservative website, \"The great conservative savior who wants to 'Make America Great Again' primarily plans to do so by creating vast new swathes of bureaucracy and swelling the police state.\"\n\nWhat will Trump do when targets of deportation take refuge in sanctuary cities and churches? Will police SWAT teams or the Delta Force storm these places? That will be lovely international publicity for the USA.\n\nAnd think of the violence done to families. Children born in the United States are citizens under the 14th Amendment's birthright-citizenship principle\u2014regardless of what Trump says. (The exception are the children of foreign diplomats.) Trump threatens to deport those kids too, but it's not going to happen. His proposed violence against families and communities is a recipe for social strife fueled by bigotry. Can't you see local vigilantes offering to give the feds a hand? That's some way to make America great again.\n\nKeeping in mind that Trump promises to deport the 11 million in less than two years and that bureaucracies are notoriously inept, Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute foresees the bumbling detention and even deportation of many American citizens:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "If elected president, Donald Trump says he would create a \"deportation force\" to carry out his pledge to expel more than 11 million people from America.", "title": "Trump's Operation Police State", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/11/15/trumps-operation-police-state", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1447458255925.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1447458255925.jpg", "title": "Trump's Operation Police State", "description": "If elected president, Donald Trump says he would create a \"deportation force\" to carry out his pledge to expel more than 11 million people from America.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-11-15T13:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/sheldon-richman"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "We can choose not to deport the 11 million individuals, the vast majority of whom have never harmed anyone.\nMore important, however, is that Trump would need a pumped-up police state to pull off the deportation 11 million people, many of whom have been in the country, and integrated into their communities for many years.\n(If not being a country means there's no government to bomb and deport people, then put me down for that.)\nAnd the last time I looked, the presence of those peaceful folks has not kept us from being a country.\nFortunately, most if not all of his rivals think mass deportation is an insane idea\u2014not that they're any great shakes on immigration."}
