Gaudreau has 57 points (20 goals) after getting an assist Saturday in the Flames\u2019 3-2 overtime loss to Columbus. He has five goals and 13 points in 10 games this month. The defending Hobey Baker Award winner (NCAA player of the year) played three seasons at Boston College.\n\nBackground: Gaudreau is from Salem, N.J., and played one season (2010-11) for current University of Denver coach Jim Montgomery with the Dubuque Fighting Saints of the United States Hockey League (junior-A). Gaudreau and his BC Eagles hammered Montgomery and the Pioneers in the first round of the NCAA Tournament a year ago.\n\nChambers\u2019 take: Gaudreau, 21, is the best small forward to join the NHL since Martin St. Louis in 1998-99. St. Louis came out of the University of Vermont in 1997 as an undrafted free agent and signed with Calgary. The Flames wisely drafted Gaudreau in the fourth round (104th overall) in 2011.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Johnny Gaudreau,NHL,Spotlight", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Johnny Gaudreau had a goal and two assists in a 4-1 victory over Philadelphia on Thursday to overtake Nashville's Filip Forsberg for first place in NHL rookie scoring.", "title": "Johnny Gaudreau: Spotlight on the Calgary Flames left wing", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/03/21/johnny-gaudreau-spotlight-on-the-calgary-flames-left-wing/21084/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/03/Johnny-Gaudreau-495x346.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Johnny Gaudreau had a goal and two assists in a 4-1 victory over Philadelphia on Thursday to overtake Nashville's Filip Forsberg for first place in NHL rookie scoring.", "title": "Johnny Gaudreau: Spotlight on the Calgary Flames left wing", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/03/21/johnny-gaudreau-spotlight-on-the-calgary-flames-left-wing/21084/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/03/Johnny-Gaudreau-495x346.jpg", "creator": "@mikechambers", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Johnny Gaudreau had a goal and two assists in a 4-1 victory over Philadelphia on Thursday to overtake Nashville's Filip Forsberg for first place in NHL rookie scoring."}, "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Johnny Gaudreau, left wing, FlamesWhen: The Avalanche plays Calgary on Monday at the Saddledome in the third and final meeting of the teams this season.\nSt. Louis came out of the University of Vermont in 1997 as an undrafted free agent and signed with Calgary.\nGaudreau has 57 points (20 goals) after getting an assist Saturday in the Flames\u2019 3-2 overtime loss to Columbus.\n\u201cJohnny Hockey\u201d is a 5-foot-9, 150-pound rookie, but he is a force for the Flames.\nThe Flames wisely drafted Gaudreau in the fourth round (104th overall) in 2011."}
