Brian Sandoval. The two are at near-opposite ends of the political spectrum, presenting a real choice for voters.\n\n\u201cThey said they were serious, and I said, \u2018Come on, come on,\u2019 \u201d Spearman said, sounding a bit incredulous at the repeated attempts to recruit her. \u201cThere were several people who did approach me. I was flattered.\u201d\n\nBut Spearman said no, that she was too involved in the four-year state Senate term she won by smashing John Lee, a conservative Democrat who now is mayor of North Las Vegas, taking 63 percent of the primary vote. Also, Spearman is busy finishing her doctoral dissertation in business administration.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on that,\u201d Spearman said, joking that she tries to set aside \u201c20 minutes a day for sleep.\u201d\n\nThe attempted recruitment of Spearman, who is well respected by her legislative colleagues, is an example of the vast net cast by U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and the Nevada Democratic Party in their failed yearlong search for a viable candidate to take on Sandoval in the Nov. 4 general election.\n\nSpearman said she never spoke with Reid, but a Democratic insider said the senator was asking about her.\n\nAsked about her last week in Washington, Reid was cagey. He smiled when asked if Spearman was approached.\n\n\u201cYou should talk to her,\u201d Reid said, refusing to acknowledge whether that was a \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nWas it a good idea to give Sandoval a pass?\n\n\u201cI can only put up what I can put up,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI tried. That\u2019s how we wound up.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the June 10 Democratic primary for governor was won by \u201cnone of these candidates,\u201d with 30 percent of the vote. Robert Goodman, the state\u2019s economic development director in the 1970s, received 25 percent of the vote. Analysts assume that neither the 79-year-old Goodman nor David Lory VanDerBeek, the Independent American Party candidate, can beat Sandoval.\n\nReid courted top Democrats, including Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto and Secretary of State Ross Miller, the son of former Gov. Bob Miller. Term limits prevent Cortez Masto from seeking a third stint as attorney general, but she decided to sit out this election, biding her time for a better chance to climb the political ladder, eyeing the governor\u2019s job or a House or Senate seat. Miller is running to replace her.\n\nAt least a dozen politicians, from members of Congress to state lawmakers to Clark County officials, were vetted or floated as the Democratic Candidate Who Would Be Governor.\n\nNone wanted the job.\n\n\u201cThe party always feels it has to mount a credible candidate, but in this case it would be suicide,\u201d said former Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones, a Democrat who lost a 1998 bid to become Nevada\u2019s first female governor.\n\nIn late February, just before the candidate filing period opened, Reid told reporters in Carson City he was \u201cstill working on it,\u201d and would produce a credible contender.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a respectable Democrat and someone that people know,\u201d Reid said.\n\nA WOMAN WANTED\n\nState Sen. Tick Segerblom, D-Las Vegas, another progressive, offered publicly to take on Sandoval. Reid took a pass. Insiders say he was intent on recruiting a woman to run.\n\nFormer Assembly Speaker Barbara Buckley was mentioned as a potential candidate, but she was not asked to run. She has been saying no since 2009, when Democrats first tried to recruit her to run against Sandoval. She has said she is too occupied with work at a Las Vegas law center and with raising her two sons, the youngest of whom is 14.\n\nInstead, Rory Reid, the senator\u2019s son and a former Clark County commissioner, ran and lost badly.\n\nState Sens. Debbie Smith, D-Sparks; Ruben Kihuen, D-Las Vegas; and former state Sen. Sheila Leslie, D-Reno, also were on the senator\u2019s list.\n\n\u201cI quickly and firmly said I was not interested,\u201d said Leslie, who supervises specialty courts in Washoe County and was one of the most liberal members of the Nevada Legislature before losing a Senate race in 2012.\n\nNevada Treasurer Kate Marshall, a party loyalist, was mentioned but instead is running for secretary of state. Democrats see the post as highly important since the job entails overseeing elections.\n\nDemocrats considered Henderson City Councilwoman Debra March, but she has baggage.\n\nMarch in late 2011 backed Josh Reid\u2019s hiring as Henderson city attorney. That move came under fire because the City Council lowered basic job requirements so he could qualify for the $200,000-a-year post. Harry Reid also lobbied Henderson Mayor Andy Hafen on his son\u2019s behalf.\n\nThen-U.S. Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., considered the governor\u2019s race for a hot second after her 2012 loss to U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., Democrats in the know say. But she was discouraged because it was too soon after her defeat, and she might not have time to raise enough money.\n\nSandoval, by comparison, has raised at least $3 million, and has given some of the cash to other GOP candidates he favors.\n\nBerkley last week said she\u2019s happy that she became Touro University\u2019s CEO and provost for Nevada and California in December.\n\n\u201cI signed a 3-year contract with Touro,\u201d Berkley wrote in a text message when asked about the governor\u2019s race. \u201cLoving the job and not thinking of public life as gov or in any other position for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nTwo other strong female politicians weren\u2019t asked to run, although they might have given Sandoval a tough time. Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., lost a close gubernatorial race in 2006 to Republican Jim Gibbons, who served one term and was trounced by Sandoval in the 2010 GOP primary.\n\nA spokesman for Titus said she is happy representing the heavily Democratic 1st Congressional District.\n\nClark County Commissioner Chris Giunchigliani, a former state lawmaker, said she wasn\u2019t approached about running for governor.\n\n\u201cI like the local, hands-on aspect of my job,\u201d she said, adding that if she had been asked \u201cI would have said, \u2018Thanks for thinking of me, but no thanks.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTOSSING IN THE TOWEL\n\nReid\u2019s hopes for a credible candidate were publicly dashed Feb. 17 when Clark County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak announced he would not run for governor. The senator had been directly talking to Sisolak, a Democrat who enjoys crossover support as a fiscal conservative who doesn\u2019t toe the union line.\n\n\u201cI just decided that the timing is not right,\u201d Sisolak said then. \u201cI love my job and I\u2019ve got a lot I want to do still.\u201d\n\nA Democrat involved in the recruiting process said Reid and others in his party then decided it would be wise to give Sandoval a pass and focus on down-ticket races, although the lack of a hot contest at the top of the ballot could dampen Democratic turnout.\n\nReid maintains that is not a concern.\n\n\u201cThe one thing it has done is focus attention on the lieutenant governor\u2019s race,\u201d Reid said. \u201cSo I think that will bring out some votes.\u201d\n\nReid backs Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, D-Las Vegas, an up-and-coming Latina who is expected to tap a growing Hispanic vote. Nearly 20 percent of Nevada voters are Hispanic.\n\nSandoval backs state Sen. Mark Hutchison, R-Las Vegas, an attorney who represented Nevada for free all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court in its lawsuit against President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe race is considered a proxy fight. Reid is up for re-election in 2016 and wants to ensure Sandoval doesn\u2019t mount a Senate challenge safe in knowing his office will go to another Republican.\n\nSo focused on blocking a potential Sandoval threat in 2016, the Nevada Democratic Party website doesn\u2019t even list the governor\u2019s race or mention Robert Goodman as one of \u201cour candidates.\u201d The attorney general\u2019s race gets top billing, followed by lieutenant governor.\n\n\u201cThe feeling was that no one could beat Sandoval, and thus having even a semicredible candidate would just give him the excuse to raise more money,\u201d said one Democratic insider, explaining internal party thinking on condition of anonymity. \u201cAnd when he won handily it would enhance his credibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think everyone was approached at some point; but without Miller or Cortez Masto or Sisolak, it just wasn\u2019t a good option to run someone as opposed to running no one.\u201d\n\nSteve Tetreault of Stephens Washington Bureau contributed to this report.
