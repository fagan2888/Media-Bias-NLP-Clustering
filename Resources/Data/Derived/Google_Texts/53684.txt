The speaker's latest criticism, presented in the form of a typical dictionary entry, defined the rule as a “one-size-fits-all regulation from the Obama administration” that in addition to placing a burden on financial planners would also restrict “access to quality investment advice for upwards of 7 million Americans.” On Feb. 28, Ryan referred to the proposed DOL rule when he tweeted to his 583,000 followers that “this one rule could hurt millions of middle-class savers.”
