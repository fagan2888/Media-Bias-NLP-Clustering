Though police have said they are working on a motive, a nephew who lived with her, Jacob Penn, said she snapped under the pressure of her brother trying to evict her. The brother, Rurik Davis, who lived down the street on the rancheria, had apparently taken over as tribal chairman and was among the dead.\n\nIt was not known whether Rhoades had a lawyer. She was being held at an undisclosed location because the husband of one of the dead, the only nonrelative to be shot, works at the Modoc County Jail, said Sheriff Mike Poindexter.\n\nRhoades has yet to appear in court, where she would be given a lawyer if she could not afford one herself. Her father, Larry Lash, declined comment.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs sent a team to Alturas on Saturday to provide grief counselling for anyone wanting it, said agency spokeswoman Nedra Darling.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Woman held in California tribal shooting had reputation as a bully", "title": "Woman held in California tribal shooting had reputation as a bully", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/22/woman-held-in-california-tribal-shooting-had-reputation-as-a-bully/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140222__00010301_H17079915p1.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140222__00010301_H17079915p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-22T17:48:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T15:02:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "CEDARVILLE, Calif. \u2014 Practically everyone in this town in the high desert of northeastern California\u2019s Surprise Valley knew Cherie Lash Rhoades.\nA leader of the Cedarville Rancheria, she worked in the tribe\u2019s gas station and convenience store and wore brightly colored tank tops that showed off her tattoos.\nThe brother, Rurik Davis, who lived down the street on the rancheria, had apparently taken over as tribal chairman and was among the dead.\nRhoades has yet to appear in court, where she would be given a lawyer if she could not afford one herself.\n\u201cShe bullied her way through life,\u201d said Sandra Parriott, a lifelong resident and owner of two downtown markets."}
