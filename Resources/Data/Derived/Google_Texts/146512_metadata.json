At the same time, we recognise the deeply held views on these issues, and we are committed to securing women's access to important preventive services at no additional cost under the Affordable Care Act, while respecting religious beliefs,\" Burwell said, according to the Washington Times.\n\nBut Americans United for Separation of Church and State does not think Burwell's announcement can temper religious challenges to the contraception mandate.\n\nThe group's executive director, the Reverend Barry W. Lynn, blamed the Supreme Court for making such challenges possible with its Hobby Lobby ruling.\n\n\"The administration had to respond to this ruling, and today's regulations are a good-faith effort to protect women,\" Lynn said in an official statement, according to the Guardian.\n\nEven some pro-abortion groups expressed opposition to the new rules, arguing that they give too much \"power over the healthcare decisions of the women they employ.\"\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, argued that the regulations demonstrate why \"the Supreme Court's deeply harmful ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby is completely unacceptable.\"\n\nThis concern, the Washington Post reported, prompted Murray to introduce a new bill in Congress, which would override the US Supreme Court decision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite the changes made to address religious concerns about contraceptive mandate under Obamacare last week, several religious groups continue to oppose the signature healhcare law of the Obama administration.", "title": "Religious groups press opposition to  Obamacare contraceptive mandate", "og": {"image": "http://d2.christiantoday.com/en/full/33131/pro-life-activists-rejoice.jpg", "description": "Despite the changes made to address religious concerns about contraceptive mandate under Obamacare last week, several religious groups continue to oppose the signature healhcare law of the Obama administration.", "title": "Religious groups press opposition to  Obamacare contraceptive mandate"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "p": {"domain_verify": "035da258d4370c219fc1e27db5605a75"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "Keywords": "christian news,christianity,evangelical,Obamacare contraceptive accommodation,Obamacare,Affordable Care Act,Obama's healthcare law,Abortion,Contraception,birth-control pills", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "ReutersDespite the changes made to address religious concerns on the Obamacare contraceptive mandate last week, several religious groups continue to oppose the signature healthcare law under the administration of US President Barack Obama.\nBut Americans United for Separation of Church and State does not think Burwell's announcement can temper religious challenges to the contraception mandate.\nThe Becket Fund for Religious Liberty said efforts of the Obama administration to address concerns on the birth-control mandate are not enough to ensure religious groups will not be forced to provide contraception to women.\nAdvertisementBurwell explained the changes to the healthcare law will make it easier for religious organisations not to cover birth control for women.\nEven some pro-abortion groups expressed opposition to the new rules, arguing that they give too much \"power over the healthcare decisions of the women they employ.\""}
