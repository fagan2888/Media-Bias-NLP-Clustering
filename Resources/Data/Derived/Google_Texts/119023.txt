The MamaNatalie birthing simulator kit promises to be the most realistic and cost-effective option for healthcare professionals looking to mimic the delivery process, according to its manufacturer Laerdal Global Health.

“Providing realistic and affordable training in maternal and newborn care, the MamaNatalie® birthing simulator and her newborn baby help you introduce simulation,” Laerdal.com states.

“User-friendly realism of the simulators and engaging role plays will make the learning sessions efficient and unforgettable for learners and facilitators alike.”

The Helping Babies Breathe training program in Tanzania has been using MamaNatalie since 2010, and has reduced newborn deaths linked to asphyxia by 47 percent, ABC News reported. Winner of this year’s INDEX, a design award given to innovations that create “sustainable solutions to global challenges,” Laerdal donated its $132,000 in prize money to the International Confederation of Midwives for the benefit of similar pregnancy and delivery training programs.

Priced at around $750, the MamaNatalie Complete (Brown Skin) Kit includes a crying baby attached to an umbilical cord, fake baby bump, fake placenta, fake blood, and a fluid collection tray with assorted items. The user can manually control fetal heart sounds, delivery of placenta, baby positions in birth tract, uterine firmness, and blood loss.

Throughout 2013, for each MamaNatalie simulator purchased in a country with high social and economic status, Laerdal will donate another kit to health programs in developing countries. The company has already made 1,000 donations this year.

"Appropriately skilled, birth attendants could save 800 of the 1,000 maternal deaths that occur every day,” the company’s website explains.
