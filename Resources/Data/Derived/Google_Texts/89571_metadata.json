On Thursday, Oct. 15, 1964, the Yankees played the Cardinals at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. It was the deciding game of that year\u2019s World Series, and, off the field, it seemed that all hell was breaking loose.\n\nBefore NBC broadcast (\u201cin living color\u201d) the first pitch of Game 7, by the Cardinals\u2019 Bob Gibson, the competing dramas had already begun. President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s longtime chief aide, Walter Jenkins, had been jailed in what The New York Times, on its front page, called a \u201cmorals case.\u201d It was just three weeks before a presidential election, and L.B.J.'s campaign was doing damage control.\n\nWhen Johnson\u2019s recordings of his private conversations were released decades later, they revealed the president\u2019s first telephone briefing by his then-consigliere, the Washington lawyer (later a Supreme Court justice) Abe Fortas, about Jenkins\u2019s liaison with another man at a Washington Y.M.C.A. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe this!\u201d Johnson told Fortas. He asked, \u201cWas a fee involved?\u201d Until the day he died, L.B.J. was privately certain that Jenkins had been \u201cframed\u201d by the Republicans.\n\nCapitalizing on Jenkins\u2019s arrest, Johnson\u2019s opponent, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, fulminated that Americans required \u201cclear and constant evidence of the highest morality\u201d in their government. One Goldwater aide told a reporter that the Jenkins case could have a \u201cterrific impact\u201d on the campaign. Others in Goldwater\u2019s campaign warned that the presidential assistant\u2019s secrets had made him susceptible to blackmail by a foreign power.\n\nLuckily for Johnson\u2019s candidacy, Jenkins turned out \u2014 by amazing coincidence \u2014 to have served in an Air Force Reserve squadron on Capitol Hill under Goldwater, whose glowing reports to the Pentagon on Jenkins\u2019s good character were hastily photocopied at L.B.J.'s behest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLady Bird Johnson told her husband that she wanted to make a statement of sympathy and support for their friend Walter. The anxious L.B.J. tried to restrain her, but the first lady spoke out anyway.\n\nJohnson then boasted to reporters that he had treated Jenkins with compassion. Reflecting widely held attitudes toward homosexuality in 1964, he said, \u201cWe Democrats felt sorry for him, and thought it was a case of sickness and disease, and didn\u2019t try to capitalize on a man\u2019s misfortune.\u201d\n\nThat Thursday afternoon, as the Cardinals-Yankees game wore on, no one scored for the first three innings. NBC\u2019s play-by-play coverage, provided by Harry Caray and Curt Gowdy, was interrupted by a news bulletin: The Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had been ousted in a Kremlin coup the day before.\n\nIt was only two years after Khrushchev had backed down in the Cuban missile crisis, removing offensive weaponry under ultimatum from President John Kennedy. With Khrushchev\u2019s exit, some American officials were now expressing worry that the new Soviet government \u2014 whose just-announced leaders were Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin \u2014 might try to avenge the Cuba episode by encouraging a new confrontation with the United States that could conceivably risk a third world war.\n\nBut with the relatively primitive communications technology available in 1964, a White House scandal or Kremlin reshuffling could not distract a World Series fan for long. Before cable television news or widespread all-news radio, let alone the Internet, Americans had to wait to learn more about such stories from that now-extinct species called the evening newspaper, or perhaps from the CBS Evening News or Huntley-Brinkley Report. (ABC television news was not yet fully competitive in 1964.)\n\nTherefore, after NBC\u2019s brief interruption on Khrushchev\u2019s ouster, many millions of baseball viewers continued to watch or listen to the Cardinals face the Yankees without distraction. Had they turned to one of the two other national networks, they might have found soap operas. Such dominance of the airwaves in 1964 helped to buttress baseball\u2019s place in American life.\n\nMoscow was not the only place where tectonic plates were shifting that Thursday. At a testing site called Lop Nur, the government of what was still called Red China performed its first successful nuclear explosion. At the time, many American strategists regarded the danger of Chinese nuclear weapons with maximum alarm; China\u2019s leader, Mao Zedong, had publicly expressed nonchalance about using them.\n\n\u201cSo what if we lose 300 million people,\u201d Mao had once bragged to Khrushchev. \u201cOur women will make it up in a generation.\u201d (There had even been low-level, confidential feelers between Washington and Moscow about a joint military effort to destroy some of China\u2019s nuclear installations.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnderscoring the melodramatic sense that the world was being rearranged in a single day, British voters rejected their longtime Conservative government, then led by Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home. It would be the first time America\u2019s chief ally had been led by a Labor government since 1951.\n\nCoping, inside the White House, with these harrowing developments, President Johnson sought comfort from the evangelist Billy Graham by telephone, and bemoaned his fate to Lady Bird, saying to her, \u201cI\u2019ve got the Russians on one side of me\u201d and \u201cthe Chinese are dropping bombs around, contaminating the atmosphere,\u201d and \u201cdisease hit\u201d Walter Jenkins, \u201cthe best man I ever knew.\u201d\n\nNow we take you back to St. Louis. In Busch Stadium that afternoon, the home team was closely matched by the Yankees, who benefited from home runs by Mickey Mantle, Phil Linz and Clete Boyer. But the Cards, propelled by homers by Boyer\u2019s brother Ken and another by Lou Brock, won by 7-5, which gave them the 1964 Series.\n\nAfter the Yankees left the field in defeat, their organization added one more geopolitical shock to the day\u2019s convulsions: They fired their manager, Yogi Berra.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140905110005, "twitter": {"description": "The
