They came back with a plan that, at least in part, relies on a tax increase to generate more money for roads.\n\nThe Republican-led House\u2019s plan, which on Wednesday was passed out of a specially created committee to fast-track road funding legislation, will funnel more than $1 billion annually to road repairs by 2019 with about two-thirds of that money coming from the state\u2019s general fund. But, among other measures, the proposal also eliminates special tax credits for low-income families to bring in $117 million more in revenue for the roads.\n\nOf course, this ever crafty group doesn\u2019t call that a tax increase.\n\nWe question, how is it not? And why are we asking people who budget every dollar and cent each month to feed their families and pay their bills to take this hit?\n\nWiping away the tax breaks for already struggling families isn\u2019t the only problem we see with this plan. House lawmakers want to strip funding from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, an agency that this editorial board views as vital to the state\u2019s growth. The House\u2019s plan cuts $135 million from the organization\u2019s annual budget, amounting to about one-quarter of its funding.\n\n\u2014 Click here for full editorial\n\nfrom the Midland Daily News\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act became law in March 2010, the Midland Daily News wrote a number of editorials, issuing caution and skepticism about Obamacare.\n\nWould it really lower health costs?\n\nWould Americans be able to keep their doctor, as President Obama had promised?\n\nWould it negatively impact the economy, and place a heavy financial burden on small businesses?\n\nThose were just some of the questions that we asked.\n\nNow, there\u2019s this recent news item: Health insurers seek big premium hikes for Obamacare plans in 2016.\n\nAccording to news reports, the insurers have cited higher-than-expected care costs from customers they gained under the Obamacare\u2019s coverage expansion and the rising cost of prescription drugs and other expenses as reasons for proposing the increases, many of which are in the double-digit percentages.\n\n...The cost of health care is dramatically on the rise. And to us, at least, that comes as no surprise.\n\n\u2014 Click here for full editorial\n\nRead or Share this story: http://bcene.ws/1MjkGcw", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Reactions to the Legislature\u2019s plan for roads, health care costs.", "og": {"site_name": "Battle Creek Enquirer", "description": "Reactions to the Legislature\u2019s plan for roads, health care costs.", "title": "Other voices: Michigan editorial roundup", "url": "http://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/story/opinion/2015/06/08/voices-michigan-editorial-roundup/28709229/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/battlecreekenquirer.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Reactions to the Legislature\u2019s plan for roads, health care costs.", "title": "Other voices: Michigan editorial roundup", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0a1d64a72b5a3e459914f0d40c42ad05c0c7c157/c=470-0-3491-3021&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/08/BattleCreek/B9317656760Z.1_20150608180406_000_G53B18PQE.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@bcenquirer", "site": "@bcenquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=901491591", "fb": {"app_id": 179053648786175}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6e7\"", "article_summary": "House lawmakers want to strip funding from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, an agency that this editorial board views as vital to the state\u2019s growth.\n...The cost of health care is dramatically on the rise.\nSeveral large cities can be seen in the image, including Minneapolis-St. Paul at left center edge, Chicago at the southern tip of Lake Michigan, and Detroit between Erie and Huron.\nWiping away the tax breaks for already struggling families isn\u2019t the only problem we see with this plan.\nThey came back with a plan that, at least in part, relies on a tax increase to generate more money for roads."}
