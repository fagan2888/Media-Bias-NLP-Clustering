They're looking for new health insurance, but not on the federal website.\n\nA Florida woman has been trying desperately to log in to the new federal health insurance website but can\u2019t get through. There\u2019s the salesman in Indiana whose premiums have gone up but who\u2019s afraid to try the website because of news coverage about its failures. Then there\u2019s the lawyer in Iowa who doesn\u2019t see the point of switching insurers, even though her premiums have doubled.\n\n\n\nThree people, three different barriers keeping them away from what President Barack Obama is telling them is their best hope for affordable health insurance.\n\nJoAnn Smith, a medical transcriptionist in Clearwater, Fla., is desperate for health insurance and has been trying for two months to log on to HealthCare.gov to buy some, but with no success.\n\n\u201cOn the first day, I went on and I got all the way to a sign-in page and I was so excited,\u201d Smith told NBC News. \u201cAnd then it was like, \u2018please wait\u2019 forever.\u201d\n\nLike millions of Americans, Smith got caught in the now-notorious website hangups and glitches.\n\nShe\u2019s tried every week or so since then. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t been able to create an account,\u201d says Smith, who\u2019s 60 and whose income has fluctuated from $60,000 to $20,000 a year in recent years and whose employer doesn\u2019t provide health insurance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried, I\u2019ve tried,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery time I try to create a new one, and every time it comes back saying \u2018This account has been used.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which operates the website, has added a \u201creset\u201d button to help people like Smith, who often have created multiple aliases as they have tried to get on to the site and buy insurance. \u201cYay!\u201d Smith said when she heard about this new feature.\n\n\u201cI could hardly contain myself at work \u2026 I was so excited about trying again,\u201d she said the next day. \u201cSo I tried to create an account, didn't work, found a thing that said \u2018type forgot my username at log-in.\u2019 That didn't work.\u201d After a few instant message exchanges, Smith decided to try the call center.\n\n\u201cThe lady I dealt with was so nice and patient,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got all the way to the last page of the application and she was getting ready to sign it for me, when my name came out wrong, and once she tried to go back to fix it, guess what? Computer crashes,\u201d she said.\n\nJoAnn Smith of Clearwater, Fla. has been trying to buy insurance on HealthCare.gov for months.\n\nShe\u2019ll keep trying. Smith\u2019s husband is covered by a bare-bones policy but she is paying for her own care \u2014 she doesn\u2019t need much \u2014 out of her pocket. \u201cI was thinking I was going to have to keep going (without insurance) till I was 65,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAs far as I know I am in good health but since I haven\u2019t seen a doctor for years I could be all full of diseases,\u201d she said.\n\nSmith is precisely the type of person the Affordable Care Act is aimed at. She\u2019s one of the more than 40 million Americans who go without health insurance, gambling that they won\u2019t get sick or be hurt in an accident.\n\n\u201cMost of the places I worked, they pretty much screw you with insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cThey pretend you are an independent contractor or they pretend you don\u2019t work enough \u2014 all these excuses.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is so eager to go to the mat with a balky website.\n\n\u201cWith the negative publicity in recent months, regarding the website, we have been waiting to see if they can improve its performance,\u201d says Larry Biddle, an independent salesman living in Zionsville, Ind.\n\nBiddle, 63, says he\u2019s been paying $652 per month for what he calls catastrophic coverage from Anthem Blue Cross for himself and his wife Kathi, who\u2019s 62. He\u2019s one of the millions of people who buy their own health insurance and who got cancellation letters from their providers.\n\n\u201cWe got a letter in September from Anthem that said our policy does not fulfill the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, so that, effective Feb. 1, if we did nothing they would offer us a comparable plan for $1,671 a month,\u201d Biddle told NBC News. \u201cThat\u2019s about $1,000 a month more.\u201d\n\nBiddle may opt to change to a new plan that costs about $88 a month more than he's currently paying, but that \u201cgrandfathers\u201d in some of the old coverage rules that don\u2019t meet all the strict new requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including rules for covering screening, rules prohibiting caps on coverages and requirements to cover mental health conditions.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t looked at HealthCare.gov. \u201cAs of Dec. 1, 2014, if we do nothing, we are going to have to go with their $1,600 a month policy or I will have to go onto the Obamacare website,\u201d he said.\n\nWhy not look now? The government says it\u2019s much better than during its first two rough months of rollout. \u201cWe have not done it yet because it\u2019s been such a mess,\u201d Biddle says. \u201cI truly don\u2019t believe it\u2019s that much better.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead, Biddle is putting his trust in his insurance agent.\n\nPremiums have been rising for everyone in recent years -- a rise that started before the Affordable Care Act. Currently, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, employer-sponsored health insurance costs between about $15,000 to $16,000 for an average worker. Workers at bigger firms pay more. Coverage is about $5,600 a year for a single person.\n\nKathryn Mahoney of Waterloo, Iowa puts her trust in her insurance company. The 51-year-old lawyer has been paying for her own health insurance for years. \u201cI have a private policy that I\u2019ve carried with Wellmark Blue Cross/Blue Shield since 1997,\u201d she said. \u201cThe premiums reached up to $2,891.40 a quarter or $963.80 a month. That is $11,565.60 a year.\u201d\n\nThe company told Mahoney that the requirements of the Affordable Care Act were forcing it to raise premiums. \u201cIn 2006 and 2007 I paid $5,832 for my health insurance per year,\u201d she said. \u201cFor all sorts of reasons, your premiums go up all the time. Wellmark tells you it\u2019s not because you are using your insurance and you are, like, \u2018Well, right,\u2019\u201d Mahoney said, expressing skepticism.\n\nMahoney said the insurance company told her it was forced to raise rates again this past year because of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirements that insurers take all comers, even if they have preexisting conditions, and because it forbids them to cap coverage once customers spend a certain amount.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t looked at options offered by other companies. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust anyone else,\u201d Mahoney says. \u201cI have always had great experiences with them. \u2026They are so trustworthy. They are not going to leave the market tomorrow.\u201d\n\nFor Mahoney, continuity is important.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what other health care there is out there. But I am not going to sign up for Acme health care,\u201d she added. Wellmark has offered her a new policy that will cost her around $6,000 a year, but with less generous prescription drug coverage.\n\nShe agreed to let NBCNews see what might be available on HealthCare.gov for a woman her age in her county. Mahoney earns too much to get a government subsidy, but the federal government website offers 30 different health insurance plans for her.\n\nThey range from a bare-bones bronze plan costing $235 a month or $2,820 a year but with a $6,300 deductible before she can see a doctor or fill a prescription without a co-pay, to a gold $5 co-pay plan offered by Unity Point Health costing $343 a month or $4,116 a year with a $1,750 deductible and a $3 per prescription co-pay; to a CoOportunity Health Platinum plan costing $608 a month or $7,250 a year with a $500 per year deductible and a $10 deductible for generic medication.\n\n\u201cI could go on the website and I could look around and I could check,\u201d Mahoney says. \u201cBut I am not the kind of person who will read everything. I am not a good comparison shopper. I just want something that works.\u201d\n\nMahoney believes the Affordable Care Act will eventually lower premiums. \u201cAll legislation is never rolled out perfectly,\u201d she said. \u201dIt\u2019ll take a while, but it eventually will work itself out.\u201d\n\nMark Schone contributed to this article\n\n\u00b7 Follow NBCNewsHealth on Facebook and on Twitter\n\n\u00b7 Follow Maggie Fox on Facebook and on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Florida woman has been trying desperately to log in to the new federal health insurance website but can\u2019t get through.
