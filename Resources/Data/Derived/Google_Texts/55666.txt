Apple has been ordered to pay more than $3,000 to a London man who said he was driven to tears after his honeymoon pictures and other personal files were erased from his phone during a routine repair.

District Judge Ruth Fine awarded Deric White £1,200, or roughly $1,800, in compensation plus £773 ($1,165) in legal fees Monday after finding Apple “negligent in the treatment of the claimant’s telephone, causing the claimant loss of photographs of particular sentimental value and the loss of all his contacts.”

Mr. White, 68, began pursuing legal action against the tech giant late last year after he brought his iPhone into an Apple store in London. All photos of his £7,500 honeymoon, along with about 15 years worth of contact information he had accumulated, were accidentally purged from his phone by a store employee, he said.

“My wife was in tears and I started crying when I realized what had gone,” Mr. White said in court, The Sun reported. “My life was saved on that phone. I lost my favorite video of a giant tortoise biting my hand on honeymoon in the Seychelles.”

Mr. White initially asked Apple to pay him £7,000 in damages, then lowered his demands to a new computer screen and printer worth about £1,000. Apple wouldn’t settle out of court, however, and insisted on bringing the issue before a judge.

“This could easily have been settled if common sense had come into the arena,” Judge Fine said. “Apple has failed to act at all appropriately during these proceedings and has been totally unreasonable.”

Mr. Whitetold The Sun that he hopes the ruling against Apple “has wiped the smirk off their faces.”
