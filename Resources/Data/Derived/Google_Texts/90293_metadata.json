In our region, we have the most safaris and animals. But we are now going to invade those forests. Our people cannot keep suffering.\u201d\n\nMr. Mugabe told his guests that he would only allow white game reserve owners to stay in the country if the U.S. lifted economic sanctions that have been imposed since 2002.\n\n\u201cWe can do things for ourselves. We don\u2019t need the white man to continue to guide us,\u201d he said, the Telegraph reported.\n\nBoth the U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Mr. Mugabe, his wife and members of his inner circle after reports of his human rights abuses spread, detailing forced evictions being carried about by the despot.
