This has been a very jumpy indicator over the last several months, with expectations plummeting in February and then spiking back up in March.\n\nUnfortunately, pessimism appears to be back in April. In the most recent edition of the survey, the median household expected spending to increase just 3.78% over the next year, far lower than March's median household expecting 4.51% growth, and the lowest reading in the last two years.\n\nWhile this is a very bumpy series, household consumption is a huge part of the US economy. If consumers don't see themselves increasing purchases overly much in the next year, there could be a slowdown.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Andy Kiersz", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Households expect less growth in spending.", "creator": "AndyKiersz", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/survey-of-consumer-expectations-april-2015-5", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5550c93969bedde46f02b68f-506-253/this-is-a-bad-sign-for-anyone-hoping-for-a-consumer-spending-surge.jpg", "title": "This is a bad sign for anyone hoping for a consumer spending surge", "site": "themoneygame", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "moneygame,clusterstock", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "New York Fed, Consumer spending, Charts, Andy Kiersz", "description": "Households expect less growth in spending.", "author": "Andy Kiersz", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-11", "sailthru.title": "This is a bad sign for anyone hoping for a consumer spending surge", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5550c7dfecad047b292ae3b3-50-50/this-is-a-bad-sign-for-anyone-hoping-for-a-consumer-spending-surge.jpg", "news_keywords": "New York Fed, Consumer spending, Charts, Andy Kiersz", "tbi-image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5550c7dfecad047b292ae3b3/this-is-a-bad-sign-for-anyone-hoping-for-a-consumer-spending-surge.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-05-11", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/andy-kiersz"}, "sailthru.description": "Households expect less growth in spending.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Households expect less growth in spending.", "title": "This is a bad sign for anyone hoping for a consumer spending surge", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/survey-of-consumer-expectations-april-2015-5", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5550c93969bedde46f02b68f-1190-625/this-is-a-bad-sign-for-anyone-hoping-for-a-consumer-spending-surge.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "This is a bad sign for anyone hoping for a consumer spending surge", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5550c7dfecad047b292ae3b3/this-is-a-bad-sign-for-anyone-hoping-for-a-consumer-spending-surge.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "moneygame"}, "article_summary": "One of the questions on the New York Fed's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations asks respondents how they expect their household spending to change over the next year.\nIn the most recent edition of the survey, the median household expected spending to increase just 3.78% over the next year, far lower than March's median household expecting 4.51% growth, and the lowest reading in the last two years.\nThis has been a very jumpy indicator over the last several months, with expectations plummeting in February and then spiking back up in March.\nThe American consumer is feeling pessimistic.\nIf consumers don't see themselves increasing purchases overly much in the next year, there could be a slowdown."}
