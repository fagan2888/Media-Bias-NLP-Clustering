One big issue came up quite a bit yesterday.\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Jerry Moran (Kan.) said the new Senate GOP majority will first focus on the basic tasks of governing\u2026. But he added that GOP leaders would also set their sights on ambitious goals such as tax reform. \u201cTax reform is a great opportunity for the Senate and the House to come together,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s still a huge opportunity for the Senate to find common ground on tax reform,\u201d Moran added. \u201cI think the country\u2019s economy, people\u2019s jobs, significantly demand that tax reform.\u201d\n\nIn the new op-ed from House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the nation\u2019s top two GOP lawmakers added that addressing \u201cthe insanely complex tax code\u201d is one of the Republicans\u2019 biggest priorities.\n\nBest of all, President Obama also expressed an interest in tax reform, highlighting the issue as a priority during his White House press conference.\n\nTaken together, one might be tempting to think something might actually get done on this issue.\n\nBut that\u2019s extremely unlikely, and it\u2019s important to understand why.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a quick look at recent history . It\u2019s easy to forget, but soon after Obama\u2019s re-election, Republican leaders identified tax reform as an area for possible bipartisan compromise. House Republicans gave tax reform the special H.R. 1 designation, a symbolic bill number intended to convey its significance. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.), to his credit, invested three years of his life on a plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s federal tax code, and unlike the usual Republican m.o., he actually presented a real reform plan.\n\nSoon after, Boehner and his team killed the bill , concluding that it\u2019d be an unwelcome distraction from election-year priorities such as Benghazi and complaints about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBy March 2014, Republican officials thanked Camp for working so diligently on tax reform, then declared his plan dead . According to Camp\u2019s own GOP allies, his plan would receive no debate, no hearing, and no vote.\n\nAsked in the spring about the substance of Camp\u2019s tax-reform bill, Boehner said, quite literally, \u201c Blah, blah, blah, blah .\u201d\n\nNow, however, Republicans have returned to the issue as a possible area of compromise. Maybe they mean it this time? It\u2019s possible, but there\u2019s a reason tax reform isn\u2019t going to happen, and the president touched on it briefly yesterday:\n\n\u201cWe all agree on the need to create more jobs that pay well. Traditionally, both parties have been for creating jobs rebuilding our infrastructure \u2013 our roads, bridges, ports, waterways. I think we can hone in on a way to pay for it through tax reform that closes loopholes and makes it more attractive for companies to create jobs here in the United States.\u201d\n\nThis may sound quite sensible, but it\u2019s exactly why bipartisan tax reform is probably impossible. It goes like this:\n\n1. Both parties see value in cleaning up the tax code and scrapping loopholes.\n\n2. Cleaning up the tax code and scrapping loopholes would generate new revenue.\n\n3. The parties have diametrically opposed visions on what to do with the money.\n\nFor Democrats, it makes sense to use the revenue generated by tax reform to invest in job creation. After all, we need to make infrastructure investments anyway, and taking advantage of these resources would mean making the investments without raising tax rates or cutting spending elsewhere.\n\nFor Republicans, any new revenue generated by tax reform must go to new tax cuts.
