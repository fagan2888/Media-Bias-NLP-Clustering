Traffic remained negative, decreasing 1.2 percent industry-wide.\n\nSeptember\u2019s lackluster results put \u201can exclamation point on a crappy quarter,\u201d said Larry Miller, a former Wall Street securities analyst and founder and chief executive of the MillerPulse report.\n\nMiller blamed September\u2019s results on the uncertainty created by the \u201cpolitical theater\u201d in Washington, as lawmakers came to loggerheads over the debt ceiling, funding the Affordable Care Act and the resulting government shutdown.\n\n\u201cAs the government and the media focused more on the shutdown, people got a little more cautious about their spending,\u201d he said, noting that sales trends took a deeper dive toward the end of the month as the government shutdown loomed.\n\n\u201cWe saw similar drops in average check indicators during the last debt ceiling debate\u201d in 2011, added Miller. \u201cWe saw the same drop-off in dessert, appetizer and alcohol sales. Fortunately it snapped back pretty quickly two or three months later.\u201d\n\nIn addition to weak sales and traffic, operators also saw check averages erode, including softer alcohol, appetizer and dessert sales. A net 19 percent of operators surveyed saw alcohol sales decline in September, compared with a net 12.5 percent of operators reporting an increase in alcohol sales in August.\n\nOn a two-year basis, same-store sales slowed in September to 3.1 percent, from 4.4 percent in August, the report said.\n\nAll segments weakened in September compared with August, but the fast-food sector remained the strongest, with a same-store sales increase of 3 percent, though that was a decline from 3.7 percent in August.\n\nCasual dining suffered the most, with a 0.3-percent decline in same-store sales, down from an increase of 0.2 percent in August.\n\nThe fast-casual sector saw same-store sales increase only 0.2 percent, compared with 1.9 percent in August. Fine dining same-store sales rose only 0.9 percent, compared with a 2.3-percent increase in August.\n\nOnly the fast-food segment saw traffic increase, rising 0.8 percent in September. Traffic at casual-dining restaurants fell 1.1 percent, and dropped 2.5 percent among fast-casual restaurants. Fine dining reported a 3-percent decline in traffic.\n\nStill, operators indicated that they expect sales to improve over the next six months, although sentiment on sales was lower than last month for quick-service operators, which in the report includes both fast food and fast casual. The exception was in the fine-dining segment, where most operators expected the situation to remain the same, the report found.\n\nFifty-four percent of those surveyed said their outlook for October is positive, compared with 22 percent who expect trends to get worse.\n\nMillerPulse, an exclusive partner with Nation\u2019s Restaurant News, is a leading provider of industry performance data.\n\nRegister for MillerPulse at millerpulse.com\n\nContact Lisa Jennings at lisa.jennings@penton.com.\n\nFollow her on Twitter: @livetodineout", "article_metadata": {"description": "All segments weakened in September, but fast food remained strongest, NRN-MillerPulse finds", "title": "Government shutdown takes toll on restaurant sales, traffic", "og": {"url": "http://nrn.com/millerpulse/government-shutdown-takes-toll-restaurant-sales-traffic", "image": "http://nrn.com/site-files/nrn.com/files/uploads/2013/10/stockfinance-chartpromojpgcropdisplay.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "All segments weakened in September, but fast food remained strongest, NRN-MillerPulse finds", "title": "Government shutdown takes toll on restaurant sales, traffic"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "7d22d9073ed6d094c7c5d663db02d457"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=593080516", "keywords": "Finance, MillerPulse, Latest Headlines, Same-store sales"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6da\"", "article_summary": "On a two-year basis, same-store sales slowed in September to 3.1 percent, from 4.4 percent in August, the report said.\nOnly the fast-food segment saw traffic increase, rising 0.8 percent in September.\nThe fast-casual sector saw same-store sales increase only 0.2 percent, compared with 1.9 percent in August.\nA net 19 percent of operators surveyed saw alcohol sales decline in September, compared with a net 12.5 percent of operators reporting an increase in alcohol sales in August.\nFortunately it snapped back pretty quickly two or three months later.\u201dIn addition to weak sales and traffic, operators also saw check averages erode, including softer alcohol, appetizer and dessert sales."}
