Griffin said the ecosystem will be open to device and healthcare software providers.\n\nPhilips Healthcare is a leading manufacturer of health monitoring devices, many of which can now be connected and used by patients at home.\n\nPhilips and Salesforce.com are far from alone in seeing an opportunity for Internet-of-Things-style connected applications. Earlier this month Apple entered the mobile health technology field, previewing an iOS 8 app called Health and a companion HealthKit cloud API for integrating data from multiple apps and monitoring devices. Apple's initiative got instant credibility through partnerships with hospital software company Epic Systems and the Mayo Clinic.\n\nGriffin cited a litany of conditions that call out for better health-monitoring options, including rising cost and time pressures confronting providers, the introduction of 8 million more patients to the US healthcare system through Obamacare, and the emergence of accountable care models based on patient-care outcomes.\n\n\"We see the emergence of new models that move risk from payers to providers and patients,\" said Philips CEO van Houten in a joint media conference with Marc Benioff. \"It's the emergence of accountable care in the United States and in many other countries in the world, and providers need to optimize their care-delivery processes.\"\n\nApproximately 75% of US healthcare costs go to treating chronic diseases like COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), diabetes, and other ailments that patients live with for up to 30 years, van Houten said. Such diseases will be a starting point for many health-monitoring applications such as eCare Coordinator and eCare Companion.\n\nPhilips Healthcare will take the lead in promoting the new platform to providers and developers in the healthcare industry, but Griffin said Salesforce customers, including Banner Eye Care and the University of California, San Francisco, will be among the first customers.\n\nInformationWeek's new Must Reads is a compendium of our best recent coverage of the Internet of Things.
