To the delight of all the Jon Stewart fans out there, including me, the comedian/actor/writer/producer/TV host returned to the satirical news program to sit down with Noah and, just like the old days, he did not pull any punches.\n\nOn this past Monday\u2019s episode, Stewart decided to use his time to discuss a topic near and dear to his heart: health care for 9/11 responders. Efficient and affordable care for people who risk their lives in the face of almost certain danger may seem like fair compensation. However, Congress has failed to renew the James Zadroga 9/11 Health & Compensation Act, which provides health benefits for 9/11 responders.\n\n\u201cThese first responders, many sick with cancers and pulmonary disease, have had to travel at their own expense to Washington, D.C., to plead for our government to do the right thing,\u201d Stewart told Noah. \u201cPlead!\u201d\n\nThroughout his career Stewart has been an outspoken advocate for the treatment of veterans and 9/11 first responders. Not only has he gone on record to criticize the White House\u2019s proposal to remove veterans from Veterans Administration roles if they have private insurance, but he also took action by breaking a Senate deadlock over a bill that provides 9/11 emergency workers with health care and benefits.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, where every politician, actor, or TV personality claims to be a man or woman of the people (as long as those people pledge their support), it\u2019s nice to know some are actually taking action.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "jon, stewarts, return, daily, show, he, takes, congress, not, renewing, health, coverage, 911", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Jon Stewart returned to \"The Daily Show\" to eviscerate Congress for not renewing health care benefits for 9/11 responders.", "title": "Jon Stewart Is Not Happy About 9/11 Responders Losing Health Coverage", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/jon-stewarts-return-daily-show-he-takes-congress-not-renewing-health-coverage-911-364478", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/08/jon-stewarts-return-daily-show-he-takes-congress-not-renewing-health-coverage-911.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jon Stewart returned to \"The Daily Show\" to eviscerate Congress for not renewing health care benefits for 9/11 responders.", "title": "Jon Stewart Is Not Happy About 9/11 Responders Losing Health Coverage", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/jon-stewarts-return-daily-show-he-takes-congress-not-renewing-health-coverage-911-364478", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/08/jon-stewarts-return-daily-show-he-takes-congress-not-renewing-health-coverage-911.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/08/jon-stewarts-return-daily-show-he-takes-congress-not-renewing-health-coverage-911.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-12-08T17:16:22-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-08T17:16:21-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Jon Stewart returned to \"The Daily Show\" to eviscerate Congress for not renewing health care benefits for 9/11 responders."}, "article_summary": "However, Congress has failed to renew the James Zadroga 9/11 Health & Compensation Act, which provides health benefits for 9/11 responders.\nOn this past Monday\u2019s episode, Stewart decided to use his time to discuss a topic near and dear to his heart: health care for 9/11 responders.\n\u201cPlead!\u201dThroughout his career Stewart has been an outspoken advocate for the treatment of veterans and 9/11 first responders.\nMonths have passed since Jon Stewart\u2019s retirement from Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show, and his fans have been left in a state of inexorable despair (even though new host Trevor Noah is coming along well).\nEfficient and affordable care for people who risk their lives in the face of almost certain danger may seem like fair compensation."}
