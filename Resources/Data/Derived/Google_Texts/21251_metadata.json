Telemedicine\n\nIf you live far from a doctor, the office is closed, or it\u2019s just not a convenient time, telemedicine might be the answer. Telemedicine \u2013 in the form of a phone consultation or \u201cvirtual visit\u201d a la Skype or FaceTime \u2013 is relatively new, but the concept has been gaining momentum among doctors, according to Dr. Joseph C. Kvedar, founder and director of the Center for Connected Health in Boston, Mass.\n\nThrough telemedicine, a doctor could check your child\u2019s throat for infection, do a follow-up visit for acne, or even send a prescription to the pharmacy. Yet experts say telemedicine will never replace traditional medicine. \u201cThis isn\u2019t in any way a substitute for the relationship you have with your doctor face to face when you need it,\u201d Kvedar said.\n\n2. Wearables\n\nGadgets that use sensors to measure and track your steps, calories, heart beat, body temperature, and even sleep, are one of the fastest growing areas in the digital health market. There are even kid-friendly pedometers that allow kids to upload their stats and get rewards for their progress.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing fitness wearables help people take their overall fitness seriously and make it kind of fun,\u201d said Robin Raskin, founder of Living in Digital Times.\n\nNext up? Look for these gadgets in smart watches too.\n\n3. There\u2019s an app for that\n\nFrom apps that can help diagnose your child\u2019s symptoms or send blood pressure readings to your doctor, to weight-loss programs that use photos of meals to estimate calories, apps will be a big part of your family\u2019s health.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe next time you go to your doctor, you may be just as likely to get an app as an aspirin,\u201d Raskin said. In fact, by 2015, 500 million smartphone users worldwide will be using a health care app, according to a report by research2guidance. And as the Food and Drug Administration continues to oversee and approve mobile medical apps, expect to see more of them.\n\n4. The Internet of things\n\nThe Internet of Things \u2013 products that combine a physical device, cloud-based data, and a mobile device to analyze and track health stats \u2013 is expected to be a big part of our lives. For example, a scale that captures your daily weight, tracks it on your mobile device and then allows you to share your progress with your community, can help you lose weight. The Internet of Things will also show up in heart monitors, blood glucose monitors and even stethoscopes.\n\n5. Medical records all in one place\n\nWeb-based personal health record sites and free apps from insurance companies are some of the best and newest ways you can keep track of your child\u2019s immunizations, lab results, and prescriptions. These programs also allow you to share this information with your child\u2019s doctors and school.\n\n6. Health and safety at home\n\nSensors are also helping moms care for and keep their children safe at home. Instead of an invasive thermometer, new digital thermometers scan the forehead for a fever, for example. Sensor technology is also showing up in medicine bottles that sound an alarm if your child tries to open them.\n\nJulie Revelant is a health journalist and a consultant who provides content marketing and copywriting services for the healthcare industry.
