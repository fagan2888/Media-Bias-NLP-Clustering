Taroudant, Morocco- Three FEMEN activists interrupted an Islamic conference held Thursday March 20 in Berlin in the framework of the Berlin Islam Week event, according to the Dailymail.

The same source said that the FEMEN activists “charged into the hall with slogans attacking ‘religious oppression’ and Sharia law daubed on their bodies.”

The images showed three topless protesters on stage before the speakers of the conference with anti-Islam messages written on their bodies and waving with banners above their heads.

The security forces intervened immediately and dragged the protesters out of the conference hall while a veiled woman was recording with her mobile phone.

“Although [the protest] was intended as an act of deliberate provocation, we did not defer to it,” a spokesman for Berlin Islam Week told MailOnline.

‘The audience, mainly from the Muslim community, reacted to the disturbance appropriately, so that we all were very quickly able to eventually continue the program of the Islam Week,’ the spokesman added.

Founded by a Ukrainian, FEMEN claim that, through their naked protests, they fight against “religious oppression, patriarchy and gender inequality.”

Berlin Islam Week, which aims to promote religious dialog, is open to all religions including atheists.
