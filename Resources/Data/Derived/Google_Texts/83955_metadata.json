But I\u2019d rather take my chances, slim as they might be, at gaining a top-three draft pick.\n\nTop-seeded Golden State and Atlanta could lose in the opening round but you wouldn\u2019t bet on it. There have been only five such one-versus-eight upsets, most recently in 2012 when Philadelphia took advantage of Derrick Rose\u2019s absence and beat Chicago in six games.\n\nThe Miami Heat, coming off four consecutive trips to the NBA Finals, tried to scratch and claw into the postseason but missed the playoffs for the first time since 2008. That \u201cfailure\u201d could result in a top-10 pick, moving the franchise ahead much further than a best-of-seven series against the Hawks.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are teams like the New York Knicks and Philadelphia 76ers, which engaged in a season-long version of \u201cRace to the Top\u201d for the No. 1 pick. But the Knicks faltered and failed to keep the big picture, winning back-to-back contests recently \u2014 their first two-game win streak since Feb. 27-28 \u2014 and thereby jeopardizing their odds of having the most ping-pong balls in the draft lottery.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure people are upset with us,\u2019 coach Derek Fisher told reporters Monday after the Knicks beat Atlanta. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you can ever go out there and basically try and not play your best. Those two things don\u2019t go together.\u201d\n\nIn this case, winning games and improving the outlook don\u2019t go hand-in-hand, either.\n\nOn Saturday, the Knicks owned the league\u2019s worst record and best odds of getting the No. 1 pick; they would pick no lower than fourth. Entering Wednesday, they had an outside shot of dropping all the way to No. 6, a doomsday scenario that would mirror their season but be less rewarding.\n\n\u201cThat has no bearing on these guys\u2019 lives and their careers and their livelihoods \u2014 who we pick next year,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThis is about them, and they went out and played that way.\u201d\n\nI would argue that landing Jahlil Okafor or Karl-Anthony Towns would have a significant bearing on, say, Dwayne Wade\u2019s or Carmelo Anthony\u2019s career and livelihood. A single impact player can change the fortune of NBA teams much more than teams in other major pro sports.\n\nIn the Western Conference, only the Spurs, Lakers and Mavericks have captured titles since Michael Jordan retired. Without Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant, San Antonio and Los Angeles wouldn\u2019t have split 10 of the last 16 championships.\n\nFans in any NBA city are crazy to root for a few extra wins instead of a better shot at the next 10-time all-star or future Hall of Famer. The story line plays out annually in the league\u2019s lower-echelon outposts, where hardcore followers compute the changing odds with each meaningless victory.\n\nThe implications were heightened and more complex in instances this season. Miami needs to finish with a top-10 pick or else ship it to Philly, which made Wednesday\u2019s Heat-Sixers finale a lose-win proposition for both teams.\n\nThe Lakers potentially benefited from each loss down stretch because they keep their pick if it\u2019s in the top five. Otherwise, the selection goes to \u2026 surprise, Philadelphia, which proudly brought up the rear for much of the season. That gave the Sixers twice as many reasons to fall down in their season finale \u2014 a better chance at the No. 1 pick and Miami\u2019s first-rounder as well.\n\nPhilly\u2019s early-season putridness led to much hand-wringing about NBA teams tanking to improve their odds in the lottery. But that\u2019s no surefire way to success.\n\nMinnesota is en route to its 10th consecutive drawing. Considering the rugged West, the Timberwolves can easily make it 11 straight next year, possibly entering the season with the league\u2019s back-to-back-to-back No. 1 picks, yet being no closer to the playoffs than the Knicks or Sixers.\n\nBut it\u2019s a lot easier to sell hope and progress with Okafor or Towns uniforms in the team store.\n\nSo while some fans in Miami and other \u201cwe-just-missed\u201d cities are bummed about sitting home, those with long-term views consider it a blessing. Though their squads are highly unlikely of moving into the top three \u2014 the best non-playoff team has a 1.8 percent chance of making the leap \u00ad\u2014 being in the lottery beats near-certain futility in the postseason.\n\nYou know the chant among smart fans in those instances or more dire circumstances?\n\n\u201cJust lose, baby.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While some fans in Miami and other \"we-just-missed\" cities are bummed about sitting home for the playoffs, those with long-term views consider it a blessing.", "Author": "Deron Snyder", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "While some fans in Miami and other \u201cwe-just-missed\u201d cities are bummed about sitting home for the playoffs, those with long-term views consider it a blessing.", "title": "SNYDER: Teams missing out on NBA playoffs aren\u2019t really missing anything", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/15/snyder-teams-missing-out-nba-playoffs-arent-really/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/14/586b2efdbd3c9a10730f6a706700b0a7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/14/586b2efdbd3c9a10730f6a706700b0a7.jpg", "title": "SNYDER: Teams missing out on NBA playoffs aren\u2019t really missing", "description": "While some fans in Miami and other \"we-just-missed\" cities are bummed about sitting home for the playoffs, those with long-term views consider it a blessing.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, NBA, Nba, New York Knicks, Philadelphia"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00c1\"", "article_summary": "A single impact player can change the fortune of NBA teams much more than teams in other major pro sports.\nPhilly\u2019s early-season putridness led to much hand-wringing about NBA teams tanking to improve their odds in the lottery.\n9 seed in each NBA conference, who earn lottery picks instead of likely first-round beatdowns!\nThe Miami Heat, coming off four consecutive trips to the NBA Finals, tried to scratch and claw into the postseason but missed the playoffs for the first time since 2008.\nBut it\u2019s a lot easier to sell hope and progress with Okafor or Towns uniforms in the team store."}
