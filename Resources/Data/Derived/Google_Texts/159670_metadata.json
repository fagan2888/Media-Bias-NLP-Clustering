That\u2019s the day the online marketplaces, or \u201cexchanges,\u201d open for business.\n\nMost of the 48 million people in the United States who lack health insurance will be able to buy coverage through their state\u2019s exchange or get free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), depending on household income. By law, Americans must have health insurance beginning Jan. 1, 2014, or pay a penalty.\n\nHere are answers to some basic questions about the Oct. 1 rollout.\n\nWhat exactly happens on Oct. 1?\n\nEach state\u2019s health insurance exchange goes \u201clive\u201d on the Web Oct. 1. That means people can start signing up for coverage by filling out a form that will ask questions about family size, age of family members, and household income.\n\nWhat if the government shuts down on Oct. 1?\n\nAn impasse in Congress could lead to a lapse in federal government funding beginning Oct. 1, the first day of the 2014 fiscal year. But Mr. Obama said Sept. 27 that the exchanges will open on time, \u201cno matter what.\u201d The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is funded mostly through multiyear and mandatory spending, so it is largely shielded from the slings and arrows of the annual budget process.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, about 40 million more Americans will be able to finally buy quality affordable health care, just like anybody else,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThose marketplaces will be open for business on Tuesday, no matter what, even if there's a government shutdown. That's a done deal.\u201d\n\nWhat can someone do in advance to get ready?\n\nHealthcare.gov, a website run by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is already up and running. Someone with access to the Web can visit that site and get information that will provide guidance about where to get coverage. Plan and cost information will be posted on Oct. 1.\n\nThe nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation also has an interactive program, called the Health Insurance Subsidy Calculator, which can give someone an idea of what to expect on their state\u2019s exchange. The program asks about state of residence, family size, household income, age, and tobacco use, and provides an estimated annual cost for the different levels of coverage.\n\nWhat if someone doesn\u2019t have access to the Web?\n\nAnyone can call HHS\u2019s toll-free number to reach a customer service representative 24/7. The number is 1-800-318-2596.\n\nWhen does the coverage go into effect?\n\nCoverage goes into effect Jan. 1, 2014. But the open enrollment period run for six months, Oct. 1, 2013, through March 31, 2014.\n\nWhat if someone discovers now that they\u2019re qualified for Medicaid?\n\nSomeone who learns that they or their family now qualify for coverage under government low-income programs \u2013 either Medicaid or CHIP \u2013 can enroll immediately.\n\nThe ACA provides for the expansion of Medicaid by raising the income limits for eligibility, but expansion does not go into effect until Jan. 1. The US Supreme Court ruled in June 2012 that states could opt out of Medicaid expansion if they want; so far, 26 states have decided to expand eligibility for Medicaid, owing to the generous federal subsidies.\n\nCould Oct. 1, the first day of enrollment on the health insurance exchanges, be chaotic?\n\nThere has been a lot of media coverage focused on problems and delays in implementing the law. In July, the Obama administration announced a one-year delay of the mandate for large employers to cover their workers. And on Sept. 26, the administration announced that online enrollment in the marketplace for small businesses (fewer than 50 employees) will be delayed until Nov. 1.\n\nBut Obama administration officials maintain that they\u2019re ready for online enrollment for individuals and families to begin Oct. 1. Still, don\u2019t expect a flood of enrollments right when the bell rings.\n\n\u201cOctober will be light for enrollment,\u201d says David Simas, deputy senior adviser for communications at the White House. \u201cNovember will be a little bit better. December, as people know [they] can now sign up and get coverage in a few weeks, will be better.\u201d\n\nMr. Simas expects a dropoff in enrollment in January and February, with another increase in March right before the enrollment period ends.\n\nWhat about immigrants?\n\nPeople in the country illegally are not eligible to enroll in coverage via the exchanges. Legal immigrants, including people with green cards, are eligible. But they cannot enroll in Medicaid until they have been in the US for five years.\n\nAlso in the Obamacare 101 series:\n\n\u2022 What to know if you already have health insurance\n\n\u2022 How the federal subsidy works\n\n\u2022 What to know if you opt out of buying health insurance\n\n\u2022 What owners of small businesses need to know\n\n\u2022 When will the enrollment glitches be fixed?\n\n\u2022 What college students need to know\n\n\u2022 Seven ways you can sign up, despite Web woes\n\n\u2022 Enroll by March 31 to avoid penalty, White House clarifies", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "404a21d1045d3942939988331e316181", "sailthru.author": "Linda Feldmann", "description": "Oct. 1 is the first day the uninsured can shop on the new online marketplaces, or 'exchanges,' for health-care coverage.
