For the same period this year we delivered 13,438 Medicaid visits \u2014 a 15 percent increase. An increase in visits is a good indicator that patients are successfully enrolling.\u201d\n\nThe clinic hasn\u2019t seen an uptake in privately insured patients, which is no surprise given that 96 percent of patients seen at PCHC live at or below the poverty level.\n\n\u201cPCHC accepts all commercial plans available in Pueblo but that population is very well-served by the local physician community. We accept private plans because this allows our established patients to maintain their relationships with their primary care providers as they transition from one type of coverage to another,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for a patient to bounce back and forth between being uninsured, covered by Medicaid or covered by a private plan over time due to job changes and other life events. By taking all plans, PCHC can continue to maintain access for the patient with his or her care provider.\u201d\n\nMoore said patients at PCHC have access to care regardless of their insurance coverage or ability to pay, so any delays in gaining Medicaid coverage won\u2019t negatively affect them.\n\n\u201cWe still have a sliding fee scale system in place for patients who have not gained coverage. Maintaining the patient-provider relationship and assuring the patient that they will have access to care regardless of his or her experience gaining coverage is of foremost concern to PCHC,\u201d he said.\n\nlorettas@chieftain.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chieftain.com/news/2465139-120/medicaid-patients-pchc-moore", "site_name": "http://www.chieftain.com", "image": "http://www.chieftain.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=rkrKGmcUWaIYsI1LLSlJP8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYsQfSnVHuJkahWjQCFEhX1FWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article", "title": "Pueblo Community Health Center patient numbers soar"}, "fb": {"admins": 166812535600, "app_id": 323205824384149}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Chieftain.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd942\"", "article_summary": "BY LORETTA SWORD THE PUEBLO CHIEFTAINFederal health reform has helped nearly 3,000 formerly uninsured patients at Pueblo Community Health Center to qualify for Medicaid, according to PCHC Director Donald Moore.\n\u201cHowever, we have been experiencing a steady increase in the number of Medicaid patient clinic visits since January,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cFor the period January through March 2013, we provided 11,651 Medicaid visits.\nThey identified 4,500 uninsured patients who might be eligible for Medicaid and began reaching out to them last October, Moore said.\nFor the same period this year we delivered 13,438 Medicaid visits \u2014 a 15 percent increase.\n\u201cPCHC accepts all commercial plans available in Pueblo but that population is very well-served by the local physician community."}
