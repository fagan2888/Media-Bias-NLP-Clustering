Bill O’Reilly sent his perennially collar-popped bro Jesse Watters out to interview Hillary Clinton fans lined up to get her autograph at a recent book signing in New York. It’s a time-tested rubric for “The O’Reilly Factor”: Send a caricature of neo-conservatism out in search of caricatures of bleeding-heart liberals, and ask them condescending (sometimes sexist) questions. Then edit in a few clips from movies to provide extra-condescending commentary on everyone’s answers to make everyone involved sound as stupid as possible. Fun!

The last time one of these segments came on our radar Watters was in Denver trolling this year’s 420 celebration . This time he left the pink collar-popped polo at home, apparently thinking a regular man-suit was a better troll at a Hillary event. The most satisfying shut-down of his annoying smugness comes after managing to ask a young woman the offensive question, “Do you have a crush on Bill Clinton” and getting the answer, “I have a crush on Hillary.” He doubles down on the asshole factor, asking incredulously, “Yeah? Do you go that way?” “I am bisexual,” she answers, “so yes.”

After stumping someone with the question “What would you say is Hillary Clinton’s biggest accomplishment as Secretary of State?” and editing in some crickets he segues into the inevitable Benghazi. Always Benghazi. Not to make any point, mind you—just to keep the word floating there as a rally cry against her impending candidacy. Can’t blame him—O’Reilly’s cohorts are going to need something new now that “Obamacare” isn’t going to cut the mustard anymore.

Watch above to piss yourself off, and then look at this and forget about the whole thing.
