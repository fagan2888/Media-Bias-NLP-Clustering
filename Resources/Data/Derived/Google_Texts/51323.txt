Tea party Republican lawmaker Mike Lee repeated a conservative mantra — that Barack Obama is running a lawless presidency — but he said there’s little that can be done.

The senator from Utah, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” called the president’s repeated executive changes to the Affordable Care Act “a shameless act, a shameless power grab.”

Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., defended the president’s actions, saying he’s merely “making sure laws are written and executed” to help Americans. If Obama’s actions “were against the Constitution, somebody would have sued him by now,” he said, disregarding reality.

Host Chris Wallace pointed out that last???? week marked “the 24th time he [Obama] has unilaterally changed or delayed his health care law without going back to Congress.” A change by any other name is still a change.

Fox reported:

However, he said critics would have a tough time winning in court because Congress lacks the so-called “legal standing” to present the case and they would have a “tough time” finding somebody hurt enough by the delays to be a good plaintiff. “The president knows this is wrong,” said Lee, among the most outspoken ObamaCare critics. “What gives him the ability to rewrite the law?”

If members of Congress were to sue the president, a judge would likely rule Congress’ impeachment process is a more appropriate venue than the courts.

But that prospect doesn’t hold out much hope, either. Even if the House voted to impeach Obama, the process would be stopped dead in its tracks by the iron hand of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.
