That settlement was announced Wednesday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nThe bank agreed last month to pay $920 million and admit fault in a deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other U.S. and British regulators, AP reported.\n\nA JPMorgan Chase spokesman declined to comment, Politico reported.\n\nJPMorgan Chase posted a loss in the third quarter.\n\nOn Oct. 11, Mr. Dimon said of the third-quarter loss, according to the bank\u2019s website: \u201cWhile we had strong underlying performance across the businesses, unfortunately, the quarter was marred by large legal expense. We continuously evaluate our legal reserves, but in this highly charged and unpredictable environment, with escalating demands and penalties from multiple government agencies, we thought it was prudent to significantly strengthen them. While we expect our litigation costs should abate and normalize over time, they may continue to be volatile over the next several quarters.\u201d\n\nIn that same prepared statement at the time, the CEO said: \u201cThe Board continues to seek a fair and reasonable settlement with the government on mortgage-related issues \u2014 and one that recognizes the extraordinary circumstances of the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual transactions, which were undertaken at the request or encouragement of the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nThe settlement, which isn\u2019t yet finalized, may be announced next week, Bloomberg.com reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "JPMorgan Chase has reached a tentative $13 billion settlement with the Justice Department regarding several mortgage issues, various media reports said Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "JPMorgan Chase has reached a tentative $13 billion settlement with the Justice Department regarding several mortgage issues, various media reports said Saturday.", "title": "JPMorgan Chase reaches tentative $13B settlement with Justice Department: reports", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/19/jpmorgan-chase-reaches-tentative-13b-settlement-ju/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/16/jpmorgan-trading-lossjpeg-0ca37.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/16/jpmorgan-trading-lossjpeg-0ca37.jpg", "description": "JPMorgan Chase has reached a tentative $13 billion settlement with the Justice Department regarding several mortgage issues, various media reports said Saturday.", "card": "summary", "title": "JPMorgan Chase reaches tentative $13B settlement with Justice Departme"}, "Author": "Maria Stainer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Business Finance, Jpmorgan Chase, James Dimon"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdade1\"", "article_summary": "JPMorgan Chase has reached a tentative $13 billion settlement with the Justice Department regarding several mortgage issues, various media reports said Saturday.\nJPMorgan Chase at first was discussing an $11 billion settlement to the Justice Department over mortgage-backed securities, The Associated Press reported.\nA JPMorgan Chase spokesman declined to comment, Politico reported.\nJPMorgan Chase posted a loss in the third quarter.\nThe settlement was reached Friday night in a call involving Attorney General Eric Holder and JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, a source familiar with the negotiations said, Politico reported."}
