And yet these successes come in the midst of continued discrimination and lack of opportunity for Black women, a cradle-to-prison pipeline that impacts them disproportionately, and a system of mass incarceration that exacts a heavy toll on them.\n\nAt the gala, Obama did not offer new policy proposals to address Black women, but rather discussed the need for a greater focus on helping Black women, who are more likely to suffer from illness, find themselves in low-paying jobs or behind bars. Further, the president touted his efforts towards criminal justice reform, raising the minimum wage and healthcare in helping to overcome the discrepancies between women of color and their white counterparts.\n\nPresident Obama discussed the role of women in the civil rights movement, who did the hard work but were often invisible and did nor receive the credit they were due. He expressed his support for the effort to place a Black woman on the $10 bill, while also offering that such efforts are far from what is necessary to help Black women. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure they are getting some ten dollar bills,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they are getting paid properly.\u201d\n\nObama made the case for better job training and more mentorship programs to encourage women of color to pursue careers in math and science. He noted that his wife often worried that she would be labeled too assertive or \u201ctoo angry\u201d as she pursued her career. His primary focus, though, was on Black women who were struggling to get by on minimum wage salaries or trying to overcome abuse.\n\nRegarding criminal justice, the President made the case for a greater push to combat violence against women. He noted that Black women are incarcerated at twice the rate of white women, and are ensnared in a \u201csinister sexual abuse to prison pipeline\u201d where victimized women are imprisoned as a result of committing crimes through their trauma.\n\nFurther, Obama expressed the need for more mentoring programs and job training to encourage math and science careers for women of color. In addition, President Obama addressed critics who suggested he was anti-law enforcement due to his recent statements against racially discriminatory policing.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate them and we love them,\u201d Obama said of the police. \u201cThey deserve our respect. I just want to repeat that because somehow this never gets on television. There is no contradiction between caring about our law enforcement officers and making sure the laws are applied fairly.\u201d\n\nValerie Jarrett, senior adviser to the president and chair of the White House Council on Women and Girls, reflected on the president\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cHe recognizes that oftentimes, the average person isn\u2019t aware of the contributions that African American women have made to our society. And so, it was a bit of a history lesson it terms of the civil rights marches and how segregated they were, where women weren\u2019t allowed to even march on the same side of the street as men, yet they were the underpinning of the movement,\u201d Jarrett told Melissa Harris-Perry on MSNBC. \u201cHe talked about the fact that women have made a lot of progress, women of color\u2013our high school graduation rates are going up, our dropout rates are going down, our teenage pregnancy is going down, entrepreneurship is flourishing among women of color, but yet there are still disparities that have to be addressed. So I thought he thought it was a perfect forum and a great opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe Obama senior official also noted that 12 million women of color have benefited under the Affordable Care Act, with its emphasis on preventative care. Jarrett noted that Black women suffer disproportionately from chronic illnesses such as breast cancer and cervical cancer. In addition, she mentioned that Black girls are disproportionately expelled and suspended, and find themselves in prison. She also commented on Obama\u2019s remarks regarding the effect of shaming stereotypes on Black girls.\n\n\u201cWell, because we can\u2019t ignore it, because no matter how talented our young people are, sometimes they are not seen through the lens that they should be seen through,\u201d she said. \u201cThe First Lady gave a very powerful commencement speech at Tuskegee University earlier this summer, and she said look: Even as the First Lady, people say hurtful and dreadful things. And you have to have the inner strength and inner resilience to know who you are, empower yourself, and not let what other people say about you or how they treat you affect your energy and commitment and resilience and determination.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "Black women were the focus of President Obama\u2019s remarks to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation at its 45th annual gala in Washington, D.C. on September 19.
