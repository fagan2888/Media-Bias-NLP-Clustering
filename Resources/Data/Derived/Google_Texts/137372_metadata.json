House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has said the proposal won\u2019t make it into the tax debate at least until 2017, when a new occupant will be in the White House, and Republicans will attempt to revamp the entire tax code.\n\nCampaign Issue\n\nWhile Obama has pushed for raising the tax since first taking office, the issue got a boost from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who said at a news conference last month that \u201chedge fund guys have to pay up.\u201d\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush, another Republican contender, made taxing carried interest as ordinary income part of his campaign platform. Bush\u2019s plan also would lower rates on both ordinary and capital income, significantly softening the blow of the carried interest change.\n\nCritics of Obama\u2019s plan include Republicans in Congress and hedge fund executives on Wall Street.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama is obsessed with raising taxes to pay for more Washington spending,\u201d Cory Fritz, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said in an e-mail.\n\nIndustry Reaction\n\nEliminating the carried-interest tax advantage will \u201cadversely affect the treatment of startup ventures, small businesses, interests in real estate and natural resources, and additional enterprises,\u201d James Maloney, a spokesman for Private Equity Growth Capital Council, a Washington trade group.\n\nTaxing as ordinary income the profits interest that private-equity managers receive in the companies they take over and manage would raise $17.7 billion over a decade, according to the Treasury Department. Those profits now are subject to a 23.8 percent top tax rate on gains rather than the 43.4 percent rate that applies to wages.\n\nObama said that revenue could be used to double the number of workers in job-training programs and aid millions of college students.\n\nHe said the administration is still in talks with Ryan and New York Democratic Senator Charles Schumer, who is poised to become the party\u2019s leader in the chamber, on reworking the U.S. tax code.\n\nThe president also asked the business group to put pressure on Republicans to come to terms on a federal budget for the next fiscal year that will end the across-the-board spending limits put in place in an earlier deal.\n\nSpending Caps\n\nObama wants Congress to lift spending caps that restrict the budget for domestic health, research and education programs. He has threatened to veto every spending bill Republicans have produced so far because they would provide less money for the government than he requested.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t reverse the cuts that are currently in place, a lot of the drivers of growth that your companies depend on, research, job training, infrastructure, education for our workforce,\u201d will shrink, he told the business leaders.\n\nObama also expressed confidence in completing the Trans- Pacific Partnership trade accord this year\n\nHe also took an indirect jab at Trump and other Republicans, who he said are campaigning by taking an unjustifiably dour view of the state of the U.S. economy. Obama did so by turning around Trump\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s great, right now,\u201d Obama said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "donald, trump, carried, interest, obama", "pubdate": "2015-09-16T16:56:01", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "President Barack Obama, seizing on a lifeline from Republican presidential candidates, is dusting off his campaign to end a tax break exploited by private-equity managers, venture capitalists and some hedge fund executives.\r\nUsing the backdrop of a budget fight with Congress...", "title": "Obama Renews Carried Interest Tax Fight With Trump's Help", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/donald-trump-carried-interest/2015/09/16/id/691899/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=c8adc199-922c-4e4a-bfa5-d596bd5aab5d&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/donald-trump-carried-interest/2015/09/16/id/691899/", "title": "Obama Renews Carried Interest Tax Fight With Trump's Help", "description": "President Barack Obama, seizing on a lifeline from Republican presidential candidates, is dusting off his campaign to end a tax break exploited by private-equity managers, venture capitalists and some hedge fund executives.\r\nUsing the backdrop of a budget fight with Congress...", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1442422561, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "donald, trump, carried, interest, obama", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2015-09-16T16:56:01"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/donald-trump-carried-interest/2015/09/16/id/691899/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Obama Renews Carried Interest Tax Fight With Republican Help"}, "article_summary": "Bush\u2019s plan also would lower rates on both ordinary and capital income, significantly softening the blow of the carried interest change.\nUsing the backdrop of a budget fight with Congress that is threatening a government shutdown, Obama made his pitch to some of the nation\u2019s top chief executives to tax income earned by fund managers, called carried interest, as ordinary income instead of capital gains.\nPresident Barack Obama, seizing on a lifeline from Republican presidential candidates, is dusting off his campaign to end a tax break exploited by private-equity managers, venture capitalists and some hedge fund executives.\nCritics of Obama\u2019s plan include Republicans in Congress and hedge fund executives on Wall Street.\nObama did so by turning around Trump\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\u201cAmerica\u2019s great, right now,\u201d Obama said."}
