DENVER (AP) — Marijuana regulators in Colorado have already tightened rules on popular forms of edible pot by requiring manufacturers to make it easier to tell how much of the drug consumers are eating.

Now they’re writing new rules on what the products themselves look like. A third and possibly final workgroup meeting Monday is hammering out rules on identifiable markers or colors for edible marijuana products so they won’t be confused with regular foods.

Lawmakers have ordered state pot regulators to require pot-infused food and drink to have a distinct look when it’s out of its packaging. Regulators are looking for ways to make sure no one accidentally eats or drinks the drug.

Denver Police released a video earlier this month warning parents about lookalike pot-infused candies at Halloween.
