My name is Will Hurd.\n\nMy hope is to be elected representative of Texas\u2019 23rd Congressional District.\n\nBecause, like you, I want to get this mess in Washington cleaned up once and for all.\n\nFor\n\ntoo long, we\u2019ve had an administration in DC that spends too much and\n\nlistens too little, that thinks the answer to every question is more\n\ngovernment. But when we can\u2019t trust that government to protect our\n\neconomy \u2026 secure our borders \u2026 to provide basic services to our\n\nveterans, we know something has to change. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)\n\nNow, the president expects you to go to the polls and stick with the people who have stuck with him. To stick with the politicians who helped him push through ObamaCare\u2026who helped him block solutions that would create jobs.\n\n\u201cThese are all folks who vote with me,\u201d he said.\n\nBut don\u2019t we want representatives who vote with us? Don\u2019t we want to send to Washington leaders who will take on the tough issues and focus on getting things done?\n\nI\u2019ve been in real fights \u2014 as an overseas officer in the CIA, I witnessed folks struggling for freedom and stared down those trying to end our way of life.\n\nAnd working in the private sector trying to help companies compete, I see how our government is threatening our economic security.\n\nWe need to clean up the mess of debt and waste by balancing our budget and simplifying our tax code.\n\nWe need to reduce the burdens on middle class families and small business owners who are trying to achieve the American Dream.\n\nWe need to ensure our ability to be energy independent.\n\nAnd we need to make border security, countering drug traffickers and fighting cyber criminals all national priorities.\n\nIt is time we come together to do these things.\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t need more politicians who vote in lock step with the president. We need new energy to keep our country strong, at home and abroad.\n\nFellow Texans and Americans, this is the opportunity we face in ten days time. This is our moment.\n\nLet\u2019s stand together and take our government back from the bureaucrats in Washington and put the power where it belongs: In the hands of the people. Thank you for listening. ####\n\nPrevious Weekly Remarks by both parties are available by clicking here.\n\nRELATED:\n\nWhite House caught altering an official Obama transcript\n\n\n\nPoll finds Americans are disgusted with their political media\n\nObama speaks and the Democrat audience flocks to the exits\n\nMedia study finds liberals far less tolerant than normal people", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Candidate Will Hurd gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksGood morning.
