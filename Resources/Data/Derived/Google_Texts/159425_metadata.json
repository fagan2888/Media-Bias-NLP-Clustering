He was recently at the reelection announcement of one of the biggest liberals in the Louisiana House, Barbara Norton.\n\nThe guys over at Cajun Conservatism have a writeup of the Caldwell-Norton love fest.\n\nThis week, Louisiana\u2019s Republican-In-Name-Only Attorney General Buddy Caldwell stood side by side with hard-left Democrat State Representative Barbara Norton at her re-election announcement in Shreveport. Norton is a prominent member of the Democratic Caucus and the Legislative Black Caucus. Infamously known for believing \u201cshall\u201d does not mean \u201cgot to\u201d in legislative language, Norton has been one of the Legislature\u2019s staunchest supporters of Obamacare, gun control, and higher taxes. So it comes as no surprise that Caldwell, who serenaded and praised Mary Landrieu at Washington Mardi Gras, would endorse another leftist. After all, Caldwell was a Democrat elected official for over 30 years before changing his registration to save his taxpayer-funded job.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Caldwell has gone to bat for Louisiana\u2019s far-left. His infamous \u201cBuddy system\u201c, which hires trial lawyers that donate to his campaigns to represent the state. Most of the time, Caldwell\u2019s hired guns have been used to sue the business community\n\nCaldwell is just an old-time crook and a closet Democrat as well. Louisiana will have a choice whether or not they want to continue with this or change to a more conservative direction.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Hayride", "description": "The allegedly Republican Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell continues to prove his real colors are Democrat blue.
