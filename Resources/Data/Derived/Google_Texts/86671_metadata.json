But coach John Fox led the opinion that there wasn\u2019t any reason to panic.\n\nAfter all, the Broncos struggled in all three phases of the game while losing 37-28.\n\nThe Bengals had 206 return yards \u2014 134 on three kickoff returns and 72 on three punt returns. Fox said better special-teams play is required in Denver\u2019s regular-season finale against Oakland on Sunday, and he believes he has the personnel to make the necessary improvements.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been awful all season,\u201d Fox said. \u201cIt was a little bit problematic with our coverage teams both on punts and kickoffs, but I think the more concerning one was the kickoff coverage. The (special teams) have been pretty consistent all season long, but it wasn\u2019t one of our best efforts.\u201d\n\nFox noted that he has some young players on special teams who weren\u2019t maintaining their assignments.\n\nIn addition to the Broncos having poor kick coverage, Connor Barth missed a 49-yard field goal at a critical time. That snapped his string of 11 consecutive makes.\n\nBritton Colquitt noted that it wasn\u2019t only about a coverage problem, and that he could have done a better job by having better hang time on his punts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that goes into it other than the coverage,\u201d said Colquitt, who discounted any problems resulting from the rain. \u201cI could have done more to help. (The Bengals) don\u2019t like to fair catch. They took their chances and got a couple of good returns.\u201d\n\nDavid Bruton has been a key special-teams contributor all season. He preferred to look at the performance against the Bengals as \u201ca bad day\u201d and not as a trend.\n\n\u201cAll three of our units didn\u2019t play up to the level needed to win the game. But the sky isn\u2019t falling. We have some issues to address, but we definitely have the personnel to get the job done,\u201d said Bruton, a veteran safety.\n\nJacob Tamme, who plays on the kickoff-coverage team, expects the Broncos\u2019 special teams to rebound Sunday against the Raiders with a good performance at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of players who take pride in playing on special teams,\u201d said Tamme, a veteran tight end. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us were really pleased with the performance Monday night. None of our units played as well as what was needed. But we\u2019ve done a lot of solid things. There are a couple of plays along the way that we\u2019d like to have back. But that\u2019s not just with the special teams.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 highlights on special teams this season include recovering four fumbles and blocking two kicks.\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos expect, need special-teams upgrade in finale vs. Raiders", "title": "Broncos expect, need special-teams upgrade in finale vs. Raiders", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/26/broncos-expect-need-special-teams-upgrade-in-finale-vs-raiders/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141226_091540_britton-colquitt.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141226_091540_britton-colquitt.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-26T21:34:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:33:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But that\u2019s not just with the special teams.\u201dThe Broncos\u2019 highlights on special teams this season include recovering four fumbles and blocking two kicks.\n\u201cIt was a little bit problematic with our coverage teams both on punts and kickoffs, but I think the more concerning one was the kickoff coverage.\n\u201cWe have a lot of players who take pride in playing on special teams,\u201d said Tamme, a veteran tight end.\nJacob Tamme, who plays on the kickoff-coverage team, expects the Broncos\u2019 special teams to rebound Sunday against the Raiders with a good performance at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been awful all season,\u201d Fox said."}
