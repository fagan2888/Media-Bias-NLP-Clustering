More Doing.\u201d That\u2019s the Home Depot slogan. But after reading this NRO op-ed I co-authored with the Hoover Institution\u2019s Dr. Henry I. Miller, you might think it should be, \u201cMore Caving. Less Flooring.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, Lowe\u2019s, \u201cNever Stop Improving,\u201d would be \u201cNever Stop Giving Up.\u201d\n\nWhy? Because these home improvement mega-chains would rather stick their consumers with higher prices and inferior products, than take on left-wing activists.\n\nAs we wrote,\n\nBoth of the nation\u2019s retail hardware behemoths, Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, recently sold out to activists in ways that are the corporate equivalent of a dog\u2019s putting his tail between his legs and slinking away from a bully. Home Depot announced that by the end of this year it will stop selling vinyl flooring that contains a class of chemicals called phthalates. It described the move as an effort to \u201ccontinually challenge our suppliers to develop new, innovative options for our customers.\u201d Baloney. What the company did was abandon both science and its customers under pressure from the activist group Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, which sponsors the \u201cMind the Store\u201d campaign that has been strong-arming retailers to remove safe, useful, and affordable products from shelves.\n\nDetermined not to lag in the Stupid-Strategy Sweepstakes, Lowe\u2019s announced not only that it will follow Home Depot\u2019s lead on phthalates, but also that it will phase out the sale of products that contain neonicotinoid pesticides \u2014 which are widely used on turf and ornamental products as well as on corn and soybean seeds \u2014 supposedly because of their adverse effects on pollinators. \u201cLowe\u2019s will include greater organic and non-neonic product selections, work with growers to eliminate the use of neonic pesticides on bee-attractive plants it sells and educate customers and employees through in-store and online resources,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe people who need education are the ones at Lowe\u2019s who decided to phase out \u201cneonics\u201d to protect bees. Contrary to oft-repeated claims, honeybee populations are not declining. According to U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization statistics, the world\u2019s honeybee population rose to 80 million colonies in 2011 from 50 million in 1960. In the U.S. and Europe, honeybee populations have been stable (or even rising slightly over the past couple of years) during the two decades since neonics were introduced, according to U.N. and USDA data. Statistics Canada reports an increase to 672,000 honeybee colonies in Canada, up from 501,000, over the same two decades.\n\nWhen retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s capitulate to pressure groups rather than stand up for science, they actually harm consumers. Products won\u2019t become any safer, while the replacements will often be of inferior quality, more expensive, or, most likely, both. The European experience with neonics illustrates the flaw in Lowe\u2019s reasoning: The EU\u2019s politically motivated ban on neonics, which began in 2013, has forced farmers to resort to older, more toxic, less effective pesticides \u2014 primarily pyrethroids, which had been largely phased out. Moreover, European farmers are now seeing a resurgence of insect predation, and insect infestations may lead to a 15 percent drop in this year\u2019s European harvest of canola, the continent\u2019s primary source of the vegetable oil used in food and as biodiesel.\n\nHome Depot and Lowe\u2019s aren\u2019t responding to \u201cconsumer demand\u201d or being environmentally responsible; they are simply seeking the path of least resistance, knowing consumers are unlikely to protest much when their floors become marginally more expensive or somewhat less durable, or when they need to shift to alternative pest-control products. They just want to get the pesky activists off their backs.\n\nMarket forces actually work; if the replacement products that activists want us to use were better, cheaper, or safer, we\u2019d use them without a pressure campaign directed at retailers. And if the original products were actually harming consumers, zealous regulators (and the plaintiffs\u2019 bar) would have acted. When activists can\u2019t get their way via science, regulation, or litigation, they resort to propagandistic tactics like this one.\n\nHistory tells us that the approach works \u2014 for the activists. These campaigns for what have been dubbed \u201cregrettable substitutions\u201d \u2014 substitutions that have undesirable outcomes \u2014 have become standard operating procedure. Activists thump their chests, get their way, and go on to raise more money to fund the next campaign. Companies give in to avoid negative press, and cast their cowardice as corporate social responsibility.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if consumers benefit when big retailers, under pressure, remove popular products. Consumers who, for whatever reason, want phthalate-free floors or BPA-free bottles already have choices. There are no shortages of so-called \u201cgreen\u201d products available \u2014 for a price. But a small group of vocal activists shouldn\u2019t dictate the availability of safe products the rest of us want \u2014 simply because stores such as Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s want to avoid confrontation with groups that are in the business of confrontation.\n\nThis is part of a pattern. The \u201cSafer Chemicals, Healthy Families\u201d bullies have a track record of spreading misleading information about the safety profile of chemicals in products that benefit consumers. Their baseless fear-mongering plays to the psychological phenomenon of \u201closs aversion,\u201d in which people perceive the pain of loss more than they do the pleasure of gain. Their junk science has targeted a wide range of chemicals, including those found in cleaning supplies, furniture, children\u2019s toys, food packaging, water bottles, and even commonly used food ingredients.\n\nIf the Home Depots and Lowe\u2019s of the world continue to cave to these campaigns, consumers will be the losers. Activists will consign us to a life of more expensive products that aren\u2019t safer or better. And inevitably, other activists will attack the replacement chemicals \u2014 the regrettable substitutions \u2014 for their risks, real or imaginary. There will be plenty of regrets for everyone, except the activists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/resource/HomeDepotLogoW.png?fileId=26230361", "description": "&#8220;More Saving.
