Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, said. \u201cIt is, rather sadly, a recipe for economic and fiscal disaster in the years to come.\u201d\n\nThe budget\u2019s passage offered a rare bright spot for Speaker John A. Boehner and his deputies after a series of humiliating debacles on the floor, most recently on homeland security funding and immigration, because of rebellions from his right flank.\n\nBut it only came after they scrambled to solve a simmering dispute over defense funding, with the Pentagon\u2019s backers insisting the military needs more money. In the end, Mr. Price offered a new version that boosted a war-funding account to $96 billion, allowing a workaround to avoid spending caps that Congress and Mr. Obama agreed to several years ago.\n\nBudget watchdogs called it an embarrassing gimmick but, at least for the short-term, it papered over the fight between defense and deficit hawks.\n\nThe White House said the action by House Republicans \u201cmade clear that once again, their priority is to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires and return our economy to the same top-down economics that has failed the American people before.\u201d\n\n\u201cHouse Republicans voted in favor of locking in draconian sequestration cuts to investments in the middle class like education, job training and manufacturing,\u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. \u201cHouse Republicans also failed to responsibly fund our national security, opting instead for budget gimmicks.\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders hope to rack up a second victory Thursday with passage of a long-sought deal to make the Medicare payment system more predictable for doctors and seniors.\n\nThat plan would repeal an 18-year-old budget tool that\u2019s overridden each year with a so-called \u201cdoc fix,\u201d even when the formula calls for a cut to physicians\u2019 pay.\n\nCongressional budget scorekeepers said the bipartisan bill will cost $214 billion over the next decade, with about $140 billion tacked onto the deficit, and the rest covered by wealthier Medicare recipients and cuts to providers.\n\nConservative groups like the Heritage Foundation said the deal added too much debt with uncertain savings down the road, but several GOP lawmakers said it would be more prudent to scrap the formula and avoid annual fixes.\n\nPresident Obama offered formal support for the Medicare proposal Thursday, which could undercut Senate Democrats who were pressing for a better deal. They wanted to see the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program authorized for four years instead of two, and some of them dislike language banning community health centers from spending federal funds on abortion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my pen ready to sign a good bipartisan bill,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a White House event celebrating the fifth birthday of his health overhaul.\n\nMr. Obama has been less happy with the GOP budget, opposing many of the cuts.\n\nThe president\u2019s own plan calls for tax hikes and spending increases \u2014 but his budget never reaches balance, leading GOP leaders to deem it unserious.\n\nThe House budget checks off familiar items on Republicans\u2019 wish list: encouraging work requirements for welfare recipients, turning Medicaid into a block grant program to empower states to make changes, restoring billions of dollars in Obamacare cuts to Medicare and turning the country\u2019s health insurance for seniors into a voucher-type system beginning in 2024, when the government would use a premium-support model to try to reduce costs and foster more decision-making by the elderly.\n\nWhile the budget is nonbinding, it creates the chance for Congress to use a process known as \u201creconciliation,\u201d which allows lawmakers to pass bills carrying out the budget\u2019s instructions without having to face the prospect of a filibuster in the Senate.\n\nDemocrats used that tool to help pass Obamacare in 2010, and many Republicans want to use reconciliation to pass a repeal. The legislation would still face an Obama veto, but GOP lawmakers said the showdown is worth it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to sign it, but we\u2019re going to make the president own what he\u2019s done to this country \u2014 destroying the health plans and the doctor-patient relationships of millions of people,\u201d Rep.
