(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File)\n\nWhen pressed to describe his 2012 campaign foibles on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press\u201d on Sunday, Mitt Romney\u2019s response covered what for many political obsessives might have felt like some familiar territory.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest mistake I made was not focusing very early on minority voters,\u201d Romney said. \u201cAs a conservative group of people, our policies are designed to help people get out of poverty and to see rising incomes.\u201d\n\nThat comment somewhat contradicts his own post 2012-election claims that Obama won because of \u201cgifts\u201d to minorities. Back then, Romney said that Obama followed the \u201cold playbook\u201d of using targeted initiatives to woo specific interest groups.\n\n[Mitt Romney convenes 2016 contenders, donors for Utah retreat]\n\nBut that aside, the idea that Republicans need to do a better job appealing to voters of color certainly isn't new -- nor is talking about it openly. In fact, it dates back decades. And Republicans are still failing to find answers.\n\nIn 1983, Lionel Sosa, a Hispanic Republican and political consultant, was talking to President Ronald Reagan about a planned reelection bid when Reagan said something that continues to guide Republican outreach to Latinos today. Reagan listened to Sosa\u2019s presentation and then boiled it down to something like this: 'Latinos are Republicans \u2013 they just don\u2019t know it yet.' When Sosa told me that story decades later in 2012, it still made him chuckle.\n\nThat anecdote is telling, as it speaks to a party that still has a tough time grasping its growing losses among minority voters -- and the real reasons for them.\n\nSaying that the party needs to re-frame its ideas and doing so are, of course, two very different tasks. But Romney has a prescription, which he laid out in a separate interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe:\" He said Republicans need to talk about things like the importance of business in different, household-level terms like jobs and economic security.\n\nThat could help, but it also obscures the real reason Democrats dominate among minorities: policies. And increasingly, data suggest that no amount of repackaging is going to produce major minority voter gains for Republicans. Only actual platform revisions and policy changes -- real shifts in the party\u2019s positions -- seem capable of a job this big.\n\nJust about this time last year, Pew Research Center staff asked a group of just over 10,000 adults questions to try to gauge something they called \u201cpolitical values\u201d -- core ideas that guide what sorts of policies individual voters support. In essence, Pew measured ideological consistency.\n\nThe survey asked voters to rank how strongly they agreed or disagreed with statements like, \u201cGovernment regulation of business usually does more harm than good.\u201d That question alone revealed a vast divide between Republicans and Democrats, with 68 percent of Republicans telling pollsters they agreed and just 29 percent of Democrats doing the same.\n\nAssembling all the data, the survey found that as a whole Americans lean slightly more liberal than conservative, with 34 percent registering consistently left of center and 27 percent consistently to the right.\n\nBut for African-American voters, this margin was far wider, with 48 percent of those who answered the pollster\u2019s questions registering consistently liberal, versus just 7 percent as conservative. Among Latino voters, the split wasn\u2019t quite so large, but still substantial. A full 39 percent of Hispanic voters leaned consistently to the left, while just 11 percent leaned regularly to the right.\n\nIt also seems that existing Republican voters, who are overwhelmingly white and increasingly conservative, might be making matters even more complicated for Republican candidates. Pew found evidence that since 1994, the share of Democratic Party voters who take conservative positions on a number of issues has receded. During that same time period, the portion of Republicans who do the same has, on all but a few issues, grown. In short, the two party's voters are moving further apart on most issues.\n\nWith those conditions in place, no candidate will have an easy time holding on to the party's existing base and bringing in voters who have supported Democrats.\n\nPew's findings comport with others that provide a more detailed view of voter beliefs by race. Exit polls in 2012, for example, asked voters whether they agreed with the idea that abortion should be legal in all or almost all cases; 55 percent of white voters put themselves in that category, compared to 75 percent of black voters, 72 percent of Asian voters and 66 percent of Latino voters. White Americans are pretty evenly divided on abortion, while no more than 30 percent of voters who identified as a person of color oppose it in most cases.\n\nThe differences aren\u2019t quite so stark along racial lines when it comes to gay marriage, but still a majority of black, Asian and Latino voters told exit pollsters that they think their state should legalize gay marriage. About 47 percent of white voters said the same.\n\nOn health care, the racial divide is extremely clear. A full 58 percent of white voters who responded to the 2012 exit poll said they believed that the Affordable Care Act should be partially or totally repealed. Just 18 percent of black voters agreed with that idea, while 33 percent of Latinos and 19 percent of Asians did the same.\n\nIt is, of course, worth noting that Latino voters captured in the exit poll do seem to come closer to white voters on major issues than other racial groups. But in 2008 and 2012, Republicans captured what the party has itself described as a worryingly small share of the Hispanic vote -- just 27 percent.\n\nAfter the 2012 election, a lot of that has was blamed on Romney\u2019s hard-line immigration stance -- including \"self-deportation\" \u2013 during the primary. But the political ideology info gleaned by Pew and specific policy questions raised in the exit poll make it clear that the party\u2019s challenges don't begin and end with immigration.\n\nThey are wide and deep. Only a Republican willing to break with some or all of the party\u2019s orthodoxy would seem to have much of a real chance at siphoning off a substantial portion of the minority vote.\n\nUntil Republicans recognize that, saying they need to appeal to minorities is likely going to amount to little more than words.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mitt Romney said his biggest failing was not talking to these voters.
