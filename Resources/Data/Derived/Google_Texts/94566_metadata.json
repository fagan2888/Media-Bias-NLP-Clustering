The change came in response to high demand for some of the most expensive vaccines, especially in rural Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cThat is a big shift from public health because it\u2019s always been \u2018Please come to the county health department \u2014 you will be served,\u2019 but we\u2019re not there any more,\u201d said Lori Linstead, director of the Immunization Service at the Health Department.\n\nInstead, people with insurance will be served by county health departments similar to how they\u2019re served at their physician\u2019s offices. Instead of receiving a free or low-cost vaccine, their insurance will be billed, Linstead said.\n\nSince last July, the state Health Department has filed 30,000 insurance claims for vaccincations with about 200 insurance companies for almost $2 million worth of care delivered by county health departments across Oklahoma. So far, the agency has been reimbursed only $270,000. Several claims are pending, so the agency anticipates more money coming in.\n\nAngry Parents\n\nToday, most health departments can\u2019t afford to keep the more costly childhood vaccines on hand. This does not include Tulsa City-County Health Department and Oklahoma City-County Health Department, which operate independently of the state Health Department.\n\nLinstead refers to these vaccines as \u201cThe Big Four\u201d \u2014 Prevnar, a vaccine that helps prevent pneumonia; the Human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccine, which helps prevent the most common sexually transmitted infection; the rotavirus vaccine, which prevents a common illness in children that causes diarrhea; and the meningococcal vaccine, that prevents a disease that can result in meningitis, or inflammation in the brain.\n\nThese vaccines often cost more than $100 each and require multiple doses.\n\nBecause of that, the Health Department cannot afford to stock these vaccines for residents with private insurance. Instead, most county health departments tend to carry these vaccines only for children without insurance through a federal program called Vaccines for Children. The program provides immunizations for American Indian children and those who are on Medicaid, uninsured or underinsured. An underinsured child includes a child who has health insurance that doesn\u2019t cover vaccines.\n\nBut the two-tier system creates problems in rural Oklahoma. A doctor who may not carry the more expensive vaccines might refer a patient to a county health department only to find the health department may have vaccines for those without insurance, but not those with insurance.\n\nThe state Health Department tried unsuccessfully to address the issue by requesting $2.7 million this year from the Legislature to start a vaccine stock for insured residents.\n\nSusan Mendus, education director for the immunizations unit at the Health Department, said county public health workers regularly deal with understandably angry parents.\n\n\u201cSo then the parents get mad and say \u2018I can pay for it,\u2019 and we have to say \u2018I\u2019m sorry \u2014 we still don\u2019t have it,\u2019 so then the parents get even more mad and say \u2018You\u2019re giving it to these (Vaccines for Children) kids,\u2019 \u201d Mendus said.\n\nToni Frioux, deputy commissioner for prevention and preparedness at the state Health Department, said that years ago, public health nurses and physicians would go to schools across Oklahoma, providing vaccines without asking whether a child was insured.\n\nBut the state Health Department no longer has money available to do that on a wide scale, Frioux said.\n\nThis means that when they hold those types of vaccination events, public health nurses must find out whether the children are covered under the state\u2019s Medicaid program, SoonerCare, have private insurance, or lack coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen we go out and do clinics, it starts becoming much more complex and complicated in trying to determine which children qualify for Vaccines for Children, which children are insured, and \u2014 have their parents given us a copy of their insurance card?\u201d Frioux said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not as easy as going out and immunizing.\u201d\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 If you\u2019re headed to the county health department for a vaccine, there\u2019s one thing you\u2019ll need to bring if you have it: your insurance card.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Jaclyn Cosgrove The Oklahoman", "og": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/news/state-news/oklahoma-county-health-departments-begin-billing-insurance", "site_name": "Times Record", "type": "article", "description": "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 If you\u2019re headed to the county health department for a vaccine, there\u2019s one thing you\u2019ll need to bring if you have it: your insurance card.", "title": "Oklahoma County Health Departments Begin Billing Insurance"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/news/state-news/oklahoma-county-health-departments-begin-billing-insurance", "title": "Oklahoma County Health Departments Begin Billing Insurance", "description": "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 If you\u2019re headed to the county health department for a vaccine, there\u2019s one thing you\u2019ll need to bring if you have it: your insurance card.", "creator": "@timesrecord"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1707559", "app_name": "swtimes", "package": "com.stephensmedia.timesrecord"}, "ios": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1707559", "app_store_id": 964468128, "app_name": "swtimes"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964468128", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.timesrecord", "keywords": "State News,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-08T11:17:21-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf89b\"", "article_summary": "This does not include Tulsa City-County Health Department and Oklahoma City-County Health Department, which operate independently of the state Health Department.\nInstead, people with insurance will be served by county health departments similar to how they\u2019re served at their physician\u2019s offices.\nSince last July, the state Health Department has filed 30,000 insurance claims for vaccincations with about 200 insurance companies for almost $2 million worth of care delivered by county health departments across Oklahoma.\nIn the past, even those with insurance, often could get free or low-cost vaccines from county health departments.\nStarting last summer, county health departments across Oklahoma started billing those with insurance for vaccines that physicians often don\u2019t stock in their offices because of their high cost."}
