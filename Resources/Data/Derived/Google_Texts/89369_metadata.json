Matt Gaetz discussed why he wants to debate Amanda Kondrat\u2019yev over the Bayview Park Cross.\n\nGaetz is a Republican candidate for Florida\u2019s 1st Congressional District. Kondrat\u2019yev is running as a Democrat.\n\nLast week, the American Humanist Association\u2019s Appignani Humanist Legal Center and the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) filed suit challenging the City of Pensacola allowing a 25-foot tall Christian cross in public Bayview Park.\n\n\u201cPensacola\u2019s cross is a clear violation of the separation of state and church,\u201d said FFRF Legal Fellow Madeline Ziegler. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful to be working with courageous Pensacola residents to end the city\u2019s unconstitutional religious favoritism.\u201d\n\nKondrat\u2019yev is one of four Pensacola citizens that plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a problem in our country right now where we can notice that people of faith, are being discriminated against in a wide variety of platforms,\u201d said Gaetz. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the Little Sisters of the Poor being forced by Obamacare to pay for life ending procedures that they don\u2019t support, or whether it\u2019s groups like Hobby Lobby being dragged into court over Obamacare, we\u2019ve really gotten into a situation where there is a war against people of faith.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cHere in our community, you\u2019ve got an ultra liberal, activist, humanist group that wants to see no expression of faith of any kind on our public land, on our money. They don\u2019t want to see, \u2018In God we Trust\u2019 on our law enforcement vehicles, and I think it\u2019s time to fight back.\u201d\n\nGaetz said he looked forward to \u201ca robust intellectual debate about the historical value that Judeo-Christian beliefs have really brought to the success and prosperity of United States of America.\u201d\n\nThe date of the debate has yet to be set.\n\n\u201cI invited Miss Kondrat\u2019yev to debate me, person to person, in Bayview Park so that we can discuss the constitutionality of the cross,\u201d said Gaetz. \u201cWe can discuss the importance of historical recognitions of the value of the faith community in Pensacola and throughout our country. She accepted that challenge, and we are working now with her campaign to solidify a date.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nGoogle\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Rick's Blog", "description": "On \u201cPensacola Speaks,\u201d State Rep.
