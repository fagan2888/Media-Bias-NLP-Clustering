A police procession has taken a wounded Mississippi state trooper wounded nearly two weeks ago in a shootout from a hospital to his home near Laurel.

Media outlets report that Lt. Trea Staples was released Friday from the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson.

Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics agent Lee Tartt and standoff suspect Charles Lambert were killed when police raided Lambert's home near Iuka early Feb. 20.

Staples tells WAPT-TV he was shot in the femoral artery and vein and nearly bled to death. Surgery in a Corinth hospital stopped the bleeding and Staples was later transferred to Jackson.
