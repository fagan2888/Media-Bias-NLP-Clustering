KOCH GROUPS SPEND $25M+ TO FIGHT OBAMACARE -- PHIL SCHILIRO: reform’s new face -- OBAMA INTELLIGENCE OVERHAUL TO INCLUDE PUBLIC ADVOCATE – B’DAYS: Doris Kearns Goodwin, Ben Mayer, Jeremy Funk

BEHIND THE CURTAIN -- Koch network drove EARLY Obamacare narrative in key 2014 states: The ads, mostly by Americans for Prosperity, began in late July with a soft message – an emotional campaign designed in part to build credibility with independent-minded women. There was a lull around Oct. 1, as strategists gauged how sign-ups would go. Now, there is a pounding, with AFP – which has started branding itself “the nation’s largest grassroots champion for health care freedom” – this week announcing “a multimillion dollar ad effort holding three US senators [who are up in Nov.] accountable for their support of the President’s health care law” – Sen. Kay Hagen (D-N.H.), Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.)

Deep pockets are behind these campaigns, with much more to come, according to strategists working closely with the Koch network. Freedom Partners, an Arlington-based group founded by Koch allies in late 2011 that serves one of the largest financial funnels in American politics, spent $250 million last year. In September, when Jim VandeHei and I disclosed the existence of this organization in our “Behind the Curtain” column, we called it the “ Rosetta Stone of the vast web of conservative groups — some prominent, some obscure — that spend time, money and resources to influence public debate, especially over Obamacare.” That was even more true than we knew at the time.

Story Continued Below

Expenditures by Koch-aligned groups in the fight against Obamacare, from July through this week, total more than $25 million. AFP spent $23 million, Generation Opportunity spent a little over $1 million and the LIBRE Initiative spent just over $1 million. The groups’ activities include TV, radio, print, digital and mobile ads (in English and Spanish); grassroots efforts; and direct mail. One of the strategists tells us: “This is huge push behind a single issue -- and it’s all happening very early, which is pressuring cash-strapped candidates and committees to make hard decisions about how they spend their dollars.”

BULLETIN -- @JeffZeleny: “Former First Lady Barbara Bush is being released from Houston Methodist Hospital today, family spokesman tells @ABC.”

AP FOR SUNDAY PAPERS – “Outside money can be key factor in 2014 elections,” by Philip Elliott: “Terry McAuliffe's successful campaign for governor in Virginia might provide a playbook for fellow Democrats in 2014 -- and a warning for Republicans. … Nominally independent committees, political action groups, environmentalists and unions poured almost $14 million into McAuliffe's campaign. … In the final month before the November election, allies aired … $3 million in television ads to help McAuliffe maintain his lead, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project … Outside spending will play a pivotal, if not deciding, role [in 2014]. This year's elections will be the first when both parties fully embrace outside groups and their potential to accept unlimited contributions from supporters. …

ASTONISHING … TRAGIC -- “Fallujah falls to 'Qaeda-linked' militants” – AFP: “Iraq has lost Fallujah to Al-Qaeda-linked fighters, a senior security official said Saturday, putting militants back in control of a city where American forces repeatedly battled insurgents.” http://goo.gl/6mOaMi

--JAKE TAPPER’s “The Lead” blog on CNN.com: “Death toll in Iraq shows resurgent al Qaeda”: “Experts are reporting a resurgence of al Qaeda in Iraq – a country that was supposed to be stable enough for the U.S. to leave on December 18, 2011, when the last combat troops pulled out. … During the 2012 campaign, President Obama repeatedly said al Qaeda was on the ‘path to defeat.’ In 2013, the President tried to clarify those comments, saying he was talking about al Qaeda's core leadership. Nearly 8,000 civilians and more than 1,000 members of security forces were killed in Iraq in 2013 … [the most] in five years.” http://goo.gl/Twecvc

FOR YOUR RADAR – Reuters/Moscow: “President Vladimir Putin has eased curbs on demonstrations in the Winter Olympics venue of Sochi in a gesture likely to burnish Russia's image ahead of an event dogged by security and human rights worries.” http://goo.gl/u3rRIx

IF YOU READ ONLY ONE THING -- L.A. Times 2-col. lead, “Intelligence system may be reformed: Obama could put a public advocate on the secret surveillance court and shift control of telephone data,” by Christi Parsons: “President Obama is preparing a package of intelligence reforms that will probably put a public advocate for the first time in the secret court that approves surveillance practices and remove a controversial telephone records database from direct government control, aides said. With plans to unveil the changes days before the State of the Union address on Jan. 28, key presidential advisors are looking skeptically at a separate proposal to require a federal judge to approve each use of a ‘national security letter’ … Some civil liberties experts who have been consulted by the White House are hoping Obama will make more sweeping changes than those his aides have disclosed so far.” http://goo.gl/nGZVqC

THE JUICE – D.C. power players – “The Obamacare fixer,” by Carrie Budoff Brown and Jonathan Allen: “Phil Schiliro’s work on Obamacare has come full circle. As President Obama’s legislative director, Schiliro helped get the Affordable Care Act through Congress. Now, he’s back as the fixer. … Shortly after his unexpected return last month, Schiliro met with more than a dozen Democratic senators to convince them the White House gets it. His message: … I understand your frustration, and that’s why I’m here — to streamline coordination with the Hill, fix problems, deal with issues before they blow up. He told the senators to reach out whenever they needed him, … on his mobile phone, at home, by email …

“Schiliro, 57, is particularly adept at creating new strategies on the fly. As a former longtime aide to Rep. Henry Waxman, he knows the policy and understands the mind-set of members of Congress. He grew up in a big Italian family on Long Island, where his professors at Hofstra University recall a student who came up with offbeat answers to questions. … Obama … nicknamed him ‘third-way Phil.’ … Since the White House announced his return Dec. 6, Schiliro has quickly become the public face of Obamacare. He mingled with lawmakers at the White House holiday parties. He called congressional leadership staff to the White House for a meeting, and sat down separately with senators and House leaders.” http://goo.gl/zascY1

--WSJ A1, “Health Site Failures Spur Push to Ease Tech Hiring,” by Gautham Nagesh: “The Obama administration … is considering loosening hiring rules for technology specialists and creating a new federal unit dedicated to big tech projects … The steps, some of which President Obama could announce this quarter, are designed to address the lack of concentrated talent in civilian federal agencies to manage large technology projects—a shortcoming exposed by October's disastrous launch of the federal health-insurance site.” http://goo.gl/xtulrQ

THE OBAMAS LEAVE OHAHU this evening, landing in D.C. tomorrow morning.

WHAT THE WEST WING IS READING – “Obama eyes modest momentum on Capitol Hill in 2014,” by AP White House Correspondent Julie Pace in Honolulu: “The health care questions aside, Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said the White House enters the new year buoyed by the ‘modest amount of legislative momentum’ generated by the December budget deal. ‘We're hopeful Congress can build on it and make progress on other priorities where common ground exists,’ Earnest said. It won't take long to test that proposition, with debates on unemployment insurance, budget spending and the government's borrowing limit expected in quick succession in the opening weeks of the year.” http://goo.gl/yxB9op

--“Obama Seeks Tighter Mental Health Restrictions on Guns,” by Bloomberg’s Margaret Talev: “The White House said … the Justice and Health and Human Services Departments were proposing changes in regulations to clarify who under U.S. law is prohibited from possessing a firearm for mental health reasons. The proposals would also make it easier for states to submit information about the mentally ill to the background check system.” http://goo.gl/D4Dav4

DRIVING THE CONVERSATION – HuffPost banner, “FED TO FOXES: HELP US GUARD THE HENHOUSE” – “Federal Reserve Asks Financial Industry Lobbyists For Personnel Recommendations,” by Shahien Nasiripour and Ryan Grim: “Financial industry lobbyists are among those being asked to suggest who should replace Sandra Braunstein, the retiring Federal Reserve official who oversaw the regulator’s lackluster efforts to protect consumers in the years preceding the U.S. mortgage meltdown [director of the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs since 2004]. Her plan to leave … has not been … reported … As Braunstein prepares to leave, … concerns are mounting among consumer advocates that the Fed may pick a financial industry ally who may want to weaken consumer protections.

“Diversified Search, an executive search firm retained by the Fed, has asked financial industry lobbyists for recommendations on who should replace Braunstein … Consumer advocates said they, too, have been asked … to recommend … replacements. … Braunstein helped the Fed develop stronger rules to protect consumers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. But during the early years of her tenure, the Fed declined to use its vast powers to curb predatory or abusive lending, something that … Sheila Bair, the former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman, has described as the ‘one bullet’ that could have prevented the crisis.” http://goo.gl/ucESqT

DINNER-TABLE DISCUSSION -- Chicago Tribune p. 1, “Girls dribble away from high school basketball,” by John Keilman: “[A]cross the Chicago area, coaches and athletic directors tell the same story: Girls, for reasons both well-understood and mysterious, seem to be losing interest in basketball. The number of female high school players is declining statewide, dropping about 2 percent over the past six years … [S]ome have had to trim the number of teams they field. Demographics could be partly to blame -- the total number of female high school students in Illinois has dropped almost 5 percent … — but they're not the whole story: The number of male students has fallen even more sharply, and boys basketball has gained players. Instead, coaches and players say, girls basketball is losing athletes to year-round club sports and other wintertime activities such as competitive dance.” http://goo.gl/qj6qyN
