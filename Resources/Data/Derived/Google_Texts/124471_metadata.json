He has protested abortion outside the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs for several years.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Carmody, 57, said he was part of a protest outside the clinic the day a man opened fire at the facility. The pro-life protesters had left before the shooting started.\n\nAs soon as he heard about the shootings, Carmody said, he called Planned Parenthood\u2019s security guard to make sure he and the clinic staff were all right.\n\n\u201cI called J.C. to make sure he was OK,\u201d the priest said, adding that he and the guard are \u201cvery friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my hope and prayer he gets out of the business,\u201d Carmody said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man; he just has a blind spot on this issue. Most people who work at Planned Parenthood are good; they just have a blind spot.\u201d\n\nCarmody said he also called Planned Parenthood\u2019s main office to express condolences.\n\n\u201cThis was wrong, and I had to say it,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a prayer vigil following the shooting, Carmody said, he spoke with Vicki Cowart, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n\u201cShe asked, \u2018What are we going to do?\u2019 I said, \u2018We need to pray.\u2019 She nodded. Nothing else was said.\u201d\n\nThe priest criticized the \u201crush to politicize the tragedy.\u201d He said:\n\nBlaming pro-lifers, you know, five minutes after it happened was so tacky. We don\u2019t even know all the facts yet. I purposely was silent, trying to be respectful of the families who lost people. Let them grieve.\n\nCarmody said it\u2019s important for those in the pro-life movement to \u201clive your life showing that you value life.\u201d\n\n\u201cPro-choicers want me to be mean,\u201d Carmody said, adding:\n\nThey want me to yell and scream because that\u2019s the stereotype. But we want their conversion [to a pro-life position]. We honor all life, including the victims of this tragedy. Our actions speak louder than our words. Our actions must show that we value all life\u2014born and unborn.\n\nPolice said gunman Robert Dear, 57, took the lives of three, including a police officer, and wounded nine others at the Colorado Springs clinic Nov. 27. He surrendered from inside the Planned Parenthood clinic after a standoff that lasted about five hours.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Dear made a comment about \u201cbaby parts,\u201d but the remark was \u201camong a number of statements [he] made to authorities after his arrest,\u201d making it difficult to ascertain \u201chis specific motivation.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, the affiliate that operates the Colorado Springs clinic, was one of the affiliates featured in undercover videos released by the pro-life Center for Medical Progress that showed Planned Parenthood officials appearing to engage in the trafficking of body parts of aborted babies.\n\nIn the pro-life group\u2019s fourth video, Dr. Savita Ginde, vice president and medical director of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, tells actors portraying buyers from a human biologics company: \u201cI think a per-item thing works a little better, just because we can see how much we can get out of it.\u201d\n\nDavid Daleiden, founder of the Center for Medical Progress, was among pro-life activists who condemned the violence that occurred the day after Thanksgiving.
