REUTERS/Faith Ninivaggi\n\n4882558\n\nTwo of Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest campaign bundlers are Washington D.C. lobbyists who represent a who\u2019s who of companies that the Democratic presidential candidate publicly claims to despise.\n\nCampaign finance records released on Sunday show that Capitol Counsel lobbyists Richard Sullivan and David Jones raised more than $540,000 for Clinton in 2015. More than $225,000 of that came in the last quarter of the year.\n\nSullivan bundled the second largest amount of cash for Clinton, raising $274,891 for the year and $69,363 in the last quarter. Jones came in third, raising $266,286 for the year and $158,286 for the quarter.\n\nBut both lobbyists represent companies and trade groups in the pharmaceutical industry, health insurance field, oil exploration business and private prison industry \u2014 all fields that Clinton has criticized throughout her campaign. She has said she will shut down the private prison business, claiming that it contributes to racial disparity in the justice system. In the first Democratic presidential debate in October the former secretary of state named health insurance and pharmaceutical companies on her list of enemies. She\u2019s also railed against oil and gas producers as creators of climate change.\n\nSullivan and Jones rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars each quarter for Capitol Counsel from those supposed Clinton foes.\n\nSullivan has lobbied for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a giant trade group that represents dozens of drug manufacturers. The group has paid Capitol Counsel $60,000 per quarter for years to lobby Congress on \u201clegislative issues related to access to pharmaceuticals, including Medicare Part D, and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that PhRMA is interested in squeezing out as much profit from those programs as it possibly can, undermining Clinton\u2019s stated desire to control costs in those programs. The irony is that Clinton routinely brags about creating CHIP, which is administered in individual states to provide health care to children.\n\nSullivan and Jones have also lobbied for Cardinal Health, a pharmaceutical and medical devices manufacturer. The company pays a lucrative $110,000 quarterly stipend to lobby on a host of issues, including on the repeal of Obamacare\u2019s excise tax on medical devices. While Clinton has said she supports Obamacare and wants to expand it, she has declined to lay out her position on the 2.3 percent medical devices tax, saying in 2014 that the \u201cpluses and minuses\u201d had to be weighed.\n\nBoth Clinton bundlers rake in $90,000 per quarter lobbying for another company that hopes to squeeze profit out of health insurance consumers.\n\nHealth Care Services Corp. (HCSC) pays Capitol Counsel to lobby on issues related to \u201cprovisions in the Affordable Care Act affecting tax status of Blue Cross organizations.\u201d\n\nHCSC has been heavily criticized by a progressive watchdog group controlled by David Brock, who operates the pro-Clinton super PAC, Correct the Record.\n\nIn 2014, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which Brock took over the same year, released a report hammering HCSC and its CEO for contributing to an anti-Obamacare ad campaign undertaken by the conservative American Action Network.\n\nSullivan and Jones have also lobbied for another company whose business Clinton has blasted in public.\n\nBass Enterprises Production Company, based in Fort Worth, Tex., pays Capitol Counsel $50,000 per quarter to cover issues related to the \u201ctax treatment of oil, gas and estate tax treatment of family businesses,\u201d Senate records show.\n\nLike most Democrats, Clinton blames oil and gas companies for contributing to climate change. She has also railed against providing favorable tax treatment for the wealthy and for firms in the oil business.\n\nSullivan, the second-best Clinton bundler, also lobbies for BI Inc., a subsidiary of the private prison operator, GEO Group.\n\nBI Inc. has paid Capitol Counsel $30,000 per quarter to lobby Congress on \u201clegislative issues related to alternatives to detention.\u201d\n\nClinton frequently criticizes the private prison industry in stump speeches. And according to Politico, her campaign forwarded an $8,600 contribution from a private prison PAC to a women\u2019s prison charity in late December.\n\n\u201cHillary believes we should move away from contracting out this core responsibility of the federal government to private corporations, and from creating private industry incentives that may contribute \u2014 or have the appearance of contributing\u2014to over-incarceration. The campaign does not accept contributions from federally registered lobbyists or PACs for private prison companies, and has donated any such direct contributions to charity,\u201d a campaign official told Politico.\n\nThe campaign gave no word on if it plans to return money bundled by Sullivan.\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "Two of Hillary Clinton's biggest campaign bundlers are Washington D.C. lobbyists who represent a who's who of companies that Clinton claims to despise.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Two of Hillary Clinton's biggest campaign bundlers are Washington D.C. lobbyists who represent a who's who of companies that the Democratic presidential candidate publicly claims to despise.
