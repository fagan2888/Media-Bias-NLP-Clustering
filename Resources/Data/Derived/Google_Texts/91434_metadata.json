I\u2019m not one of those coaches,\u201d Malone said. \u201cThere are plenty of coaches in the NBA that use the injury excuse to save their (butts). I\u2019m not one of those guys. I don\u2019t buy it.\u201d\n\nBut there is reality.\n\nAnd the reality is the Nuggets (12-17) have been challenged to win without many of their primary rotation players. Four who weren\u2019t part of the 104-96 victory over the Suns in Phoenix on Wednesday \u2014 Danilo Gallinari, Emmanuel Mudiay, Wilson Chandler and Jusuf Nurkic \u2014 were projected to be among the Nuggets\u2019 top-six rotation players this season.\n\nGallinari and Mudiay have been among the top six. Chandler never got started before his season ended because of hip surgery. Nurkic hasn\u2019t played in a game yet this season; he is rehabbing a torn patellar tendon.\n\nComing into last week, no other NBA team had lost more games to injured players who were of significance (players averaging 15 minutes per game or more) than the Nuggets, who were tied with the Philadelphia 76ers at 99. And that was before the Nuggets lost nine more \u201cman-games\u201d with their games against the Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix.\n\nYet the Nuggets are only one game out of the eighth playoff slot in the Western Conference. Keeping themselves relevant has been connected to some of their players developing faster than expected and others having career years.\n\nWill Barton is at the top of the list of most-improved players. The fourth-year guard is averaging nearly 10 points per game more than his combined total with Denver and Portland last season, and a number of other areas are up as well.\n\nBarton\u2019s hot start has him being mentioned for the league\u2019s sixth man of the year and most-improved player awards. He is a big reason the Nuggets have been able to stay afloat.\n\nGary Harris is up nearly seven points per game over last season. Gallinari is up five points per game over last season. And while Mudiay\u2019s contributions have been expected, Nikola Jokic\u2019s solid rookie season has been a pleasant surprise. Joffrey Lauvergne\u2019s improvement over last season has been a boon as well.\n\nQuality depth has helped the Nuggets stay competitive.\n\n\u201cOn one hand, having that type of depth is always comforting as a coach. We\u2019ve had so many injuries, guys can step up, take advantage of the minutes,\u201d Malone said. \u201cAnd if somebody isn\u2019t playing well, you can go down the bench.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s going to continue, because the Nuggets\u2019 injury situation probably will take a while to sort itself out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of paid professionals to do a job,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll get (Gallinari) back as soon as possible. But if he\u2019s out, somebody else has to step up. But you\u2019re not going to hear me crying the injury card. I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nDENVER AT SAN ANTONIO\n\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. Saturday\n\nTV/Radio: ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Kawhi Leonard:\n\nCould the former San Diego State star be on the shortlist for league MVP? Perhaps he\u2019s already there. Leonard is the reigning defensive player of the year, and he was the MVP of the NBA Finals in 2014. Leonard has made another leap in performance this season; all of his stats except steals are up. He is shooting the ball as well as any other player in the league, hitting 50.9 percent from the field, 47 percent from 3-point range and 87.9 percent from the free-throw line. Also, he continues to be one of the league\u2019s premier defensive players.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets:\n\nThey haven\u2019t beaten the Spurs this season \u2014 only five teams in the NBA have done that. The Nuggets are 0-2 against San Antonio this season and have lost nine straight to the Spurs overall. The last time the Nuggets defeated San Antonio was April 10, 2013, at the Pepsi Center. Their last win in San Antonio was March 4, 2012.\n\nSpurs:\n\nThis is the second of back-to-back games for the Spurs, who played at Houston on Christmas. The Spurs have won the second game of every back-to-back set this season, going 5-0. They beat Denver 91-80 at the front of a consecutive-game set in late November, and now they get the Nuggets in the second game of a back-to-back set.\n\nChristopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets stay competitive with quality depth despite having extensive injury problems", "title": "Nuggets stay competitive with quality depth despite having extensive injury problems", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/25/nuggets-stay-competitive-with-quality-depth-despite-having-extensive-injury-problems/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__gary-harrisp1-1.jpg", "height": 455}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__gary-harrisp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-25T17:48:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:24:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Spurs have won the second game of every back-to-back set this season, going 5-0.\n\u201cAnd if somebody isn\u2019t playing well, you can go down the bench.\u201dThat\u2019s going to continue, because the Nuggets\u2019 injury situation probably will take a while to sort itself out.\nAnd given his team\u2019s extensive injury problems this season, it comes up a lot.\nAnd the reality is the Nuggets (12-17) have been challenged to win without many of their primary rotation players.\n\u201cThere are plenty of coaches in the NBA that use the injury excuse to save their (butts)."}
