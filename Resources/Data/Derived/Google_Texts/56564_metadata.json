But when he took a job on Wall Street? No. Surprise. At. All.\n\nLet\u2019s think about this for a minute. It appears as though the establishment-types know Cantor pretty well. He\u2019s got friends on Wall Street, and this is the natural course of events in the world of cronies and insiders. Republicans and Democrats have both availed themselves of the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington. No surprise, no big deal.\n\nWhat insiders don\u2019t know very well is outsiders. To insiders, the unnatural thing \u2014 the big deal \u2014 was an incumbent losing. Silly outsiders, a.k.a. voters! Didn\u2019t they know that Wall Street and fancy Washington lobbyists just love this guy?\n\n[MORE: Cartoons about Congress]\n\nOh, wait, yes, the silly voters did know. It\u2019s one of the reasons they broke up with Mr. Cantor. He preferred the cool kids to his own constituents and they knew it, so they voted for someone else.\n\nThe Cantor-Goes-to-Wall-Street ending to the story was excruciatingly predictable, but it may have some unexpected outcomes in that it could encourage tea-party types to dig in deeper.\n\nYou see, when he accepted this job, Cantor proved that his constituents were right. He was out of touch with folks at home, but very much in touch with the rich and powerful in New York. Anyone who can land a job this lucrative in a field where they have zero experience must be getting the job for, ahem, different reasons. It\u2019s about being friends, about doing and receiving favors. Voters understand this, and those who already think Wall Street and Washington are thick as thieves just got their best proof yet.\n\nI suspect that Cantor\u2019s friends inside the Beltway are very happy for him. They may even be thinking, \u201cGood for Eric. The best revenge is living well!\u201d They may secretly think that those silly voters in Virginia will be jealous of their former congressman\u2019s new income, which will be 26 times bigger than their average household income.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on the 2014 Congressional Elections]\n\nBut I doubt there is any jealousy at all. I\u2019m guessing the feeling of those who voted against Cantor is more along the lines of: \u201cGood. He\u2019ll be much happier with his friends in New York City and downtown Washington than he was with us here in Virginia.\u201d\n\nThe fruition of predictable events can be comforting, but it can also cement convictions. So for those Washingtonians who are toasting Cantor\u2019s success this week, I have a word of caution: Your buddy Eric just proved to the anti-establishment, tea-party types that firing him was a good decision. Other members of Congress in the Cantor mold will not be well served by this. Perhaps that\u2019s why Cantor waited until primary season was safely over before proving his constituents right.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Eric Cantor's Wall Street Job Proves the Tea Party Right", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The former majority leader decamped to Wall Street, proving his critics were right all along.", "title": "The Tea Party Was Right About Eric Cantor", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2014/09/04/eric-cantors-wall-street-job-proves-the-tea-party-right", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/67/7a/c8b718824167a07fe1fd1df7182e/thumb-4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The former majority leader decamped to Wall Street, proving his critics were right all along.", "card": "summary", "title": "Eric Cantor's Wall Street Job Proves the Tea Party Right"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 4, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jean Card,Cantor, Eric,Wall Street,tea party,Republican Party,Congress,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The former majority leader decamped to Wall Street, proving his critics were right all along."}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s got friends on Wall Street, and this is the natural course of events in the world of cronies and insiders.\nRepublicans and Democrats have both availed themselves of the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington.\nBut when he took a job on Wall Street?\nYou see, when he accepted this job, Cantor proved that his constituents were right.\nVoters understand this, and those who already think Wall Street and Washington are thick as thieves just got their best proof yet."}
