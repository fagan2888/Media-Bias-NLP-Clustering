Regulator FNE said it is looking to fine each company $22.9 million for their alleged participation in the scheme.

The FNE said the supermarket chains "knowingly adhered to a common scheme that replaced the risks of competition with shared practical cooperation in order to regulate the market and avoid price wars."

It accuses the supermarket chains of "having participated in an agreement to fix, through their suppliers, a minimum selling price for fresh chicken, at least between 2008 and 2011, restricting competition in this market."

Cencosud said it had no immediate comment. Cencosud's shares were down 2.55 percent in afternoon trading.

At the end of 2011, Cencosud, SMU and Wal-Mart had a 92.5 percent market share of Chile's supermarket sector, the FNE noted.
