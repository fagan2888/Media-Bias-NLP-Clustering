Unborn twins Mason and Madilyn already have a bond.

But they likely don’t share a future: Mason’s “only chance of survival would be heart surgery but they wouldn’t do heart surgery because of his brain,” said their mom Brittani McIntire, according to Pix11.

A recent sonogram showed Mason’s hand clasped around Madilyn’s.

“I know I’m holding him, I know I’m carrying him, but I just want to be there for him … she’s the only one that can actually be there and holding on to him through it,” said McIntire.

“And so it’s comforting to know that if he does pass, he won’t be alone.”
