Overall, nearly half of the public (49 percent) has an unfavorable opinion of the Tea Party, while 30 percent have a favorable opinion,\u201d the Pew Research Center For People And The Press said in its latestpoll and report.\n\n\u201cFor Republicans, the decline is steepest among those who describe themselves as moderate or liberal. Today, only about a quarter (27 percent) of moderate and liberal Republicans have a favorable opinion of the Tea Party movement, down 19 points from June,\u201d Pew said, after surveying 1,500 adults over 18 across the country between Oct. 9 and 13. \u201cYet the Tea Party\u2019s ratings have also declined among conservative Republicans, from 74 percent favorable in June to 65 percent now.\u201d\n\nSince the standoff ended, there\u2019s been no shortage of media reports about the Republican Party tearing itself apart\u2014with rightwingers accusing leaders in Congress of \u201csurrender\u201d and finger pointing at usual targets such as the media\u2019s supposedly liberal bias. Tea Party leaders such as former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, now president of the Heritage Foundation, vowed in a Wall Street Journal column Friday that the fight to destroy the Affordable Care Act will continue. Meanwhile, another Tea Party darling, Kentucky\u2019s Sen. Rand Paul, is AWOL in this fracas, perhaps nursing his 2016 presidential bid.\n\nBut no one should think that the Tea Party\u2019s latest failures will make them go away. This faction, as epitomized by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz declaring that the shutdown was a victory, is unapologetic, arrogant and proud of it. As Pew notes, Tea Partiers share 10 beliefs and causes that make most Americans cringe\u2014not just Democrats but millions of moderate and liberal Republicans. Let\u2019s look at those views and values, according to Pew.\n\n1. They really don\u2019t care about America as a nation. For the past 25 years, Pew said that polls routinely find that about 55 percent of American voters want representatives in Congress to put local concerns ahead of \u201cwhat they think is best for the country.\u201d Tea Partiers disproportionately take that view. \u201cAmong Tea Party Republicans, fully 76 percent say members should vote against a bill their constituents oppose, even if he or she thinks it is in the best interest of the country,\u201d Pew said. \u201cJust 22 percent say the lawmaker should prioritize the national interest.\u201d\n\n2. Forget national solutions to national problems. Since three-quarters of Tea Partiers value a confederacy of GOP-run provinces more than an effective national government, it\u2019s not surprising that they are always talking about making government smaller. But, as Pew found, that rhetoric means dismantling big public programs and overlooking public needs that were behind their creation in the first place.\n\n\u201cA driving attitude of the Tea Party is a belief in smaller government,\u201d Pew said. \u201cFully 92 percent of Tea Party Republicans prefer a smaller government with fewer services, just 5 percent want a bigger government. Among non-Tea Party Republicans, a smaller government is preferred by a less one-sided 67 percent to 28 percent margin.\u201d Tea Partiers tend to be older, whiter and wealthier than other Republicans\u2014and other Americans, Pew said, which fits their self-centered, gated-community mindset.\n\n3. They don\u2019t believe in new government debt. Despite all the warnings by economists and even foreign leaders, such as Italy\u2019s prime minister speaking at the White House on Thursday\u2014who feared a default would raise global interest rates and spark a downward spiral\u201469 percent of Tea Parties said it was \u201cnot essential\u201d to raise the U.S. debt limit, Pew said. That was 25 percent higher than \u201cnon-Tea Party\u201d Republicans, Pew said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even one-quarter of Republicans don\u2019t think like them, Pew finds", "title": "10 reasons the Tea Party is wildly unpopular", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Even one-quarter of Republicans don\u2019t think like them, Pew finds", "title": "10 reasons the Tea Party is wildly unpopular", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/21/10_reasons_the_tea_party_is_wildly_unpopular_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/ted_cruz3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even one-quarter of Republicans don\u2019t think like them, Pew finds", "title": "10 reasons the Tea Party is wildly unpopular", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/ted_cruz3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steven Rosenfeld", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Conservatism, Gun Control, Guns, Republicans, Tea Party, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Conservatism, Gun Control, Guns, Republicans, Tea Party, Ted CruzThis article originally appeared on AlternetNow that the federal government has reopened and its debt limit raised, the Tea Party is more unpopular with Americans than ever\u2014including among moderate Republicans\u2014polls are finding, with analysts asking if the Tea Party is part of the GOP at all.\n\u201cFully 92 percent of Tea Party Republicans prefer a smaller government with fewer services, just 5 percent want a bigger government.\nMeanwhile, another Tea Party darling, Kentucky\u2019s Sen.
