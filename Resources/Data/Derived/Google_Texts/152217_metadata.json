Although the confiscation was in line with the airport's protocol, Milano has brought attention to how impractical travel regulations are for nursing moms.\n\nAccording to Heathrow Airport security protocol, individuals are not permitted to fly with more than 3 oz. of liquids. Although there is an exception to this rule in the case of breastmilk, this is only permitted if the mother is physically traveling with her child and plans on feeding the milk during the duration of the flight. But this past Friday, Milano attempted to board a plane out of London Heathrow without her daughter and had her 10 oz. of breastmilk confiscated.\n\n(1 of 2) @HeathrowAirport just took my pumped breast milk away. 10 ounces. Gone. Not okay. \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 9, 2015\n\nAlthough Milano raised a fair point, the security guards stood by their decision to confiscate the breast milk. As explained on Heathrow\u2019s website, any bottle containing over 3 oz. of liquid must be stored as luggage.\n\nMilano\u2019s story highlights the plight of breastfeeding women, especially when travelling. It was only last month that an Australian airlines went as far as to kick a woman off her flight because she refused to stop breastfeeding her son during takeoff, Gold Coast Bulletin reported. The mother met with both federal and local police after being escorted off the plane but did not face charges.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alyssa, milanos, breast, milk, confiscated, heathrow, airport, highlighting, plight", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Alyssa Milano had a bottle of her breast milk confiscated at London Heathrow Airport and has taken to Twitter to express her disdain.", "title": "Alyssa Milano's Breast Milk Was Confiscated At The Airport, And She's Not Happy About It", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/alyssa-milanos-breast-milk-confiscated-heathrow-airport-highlighting-plight-328854", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/04/10/alyssa.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Alyssa Milano had a bottle of her breast milk confiscated at London Heathrow Airport and has taken to Twitter to express her disdain.", "title": "Alyssa Milano's Breast Milk Was Confiscated At The Airport, And She's Not Happy About It", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/alyssa-milanos-breast-milk-confiscated-heathrow-airport-highlighting-plight-328854", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/04/10/alyssa.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/10/alyssa.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-10T17:21:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-10T17:23:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Alyssa Milano had a bottle of her breast milk confiscated at London Heathrow Airport and has taken to Twitter to express her disdain."}, "article_summary": "Although the confiscation was in line with the airport's protocol, Milano has brought attention to how impractical travel regulations are for nursing moms.\nAlyssa Milano had a bottle of her pumped breastmilk confiscated while traveling out of London\u2019s Heathrow Airport this past weekend.\nAccording to Heathrow Airport security protocol, individuals are not permitted to fly with more than 3 oz.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 9, 2015Although Milano raised a fair point, the security guards stood by their decision to confiscate the breast milk.\nBut this past Friday, Milano attempted to board a plane out of London Heathrow without her daughter and had her 10 oz."}
