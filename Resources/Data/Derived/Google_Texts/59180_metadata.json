Perez's 8-year-old son, Aleczander Perez, was vacationing in California, but wanted a souvenir.\n\n\u201cI've been a wrestling fan since I was 7,\u201d said Perez, who attended the event with several friends. \u201cI'm looking forward to the four-way title match. I'm hoping Roman Reigns takes it. I just like his whole character and how he carries himself.\u201d\n\nThe WWE billed the heavyweight title match as \u201ca particularly unfair stipulation for (Cena), as he can theoretically lose the match without ever being pinned.\u201d\n\nJose Cruz of Orlando was looking forward to that happening. Cruz and friends Carlos Aponte and Aaron Salmon, also of Orlando, bought their tickets online several months ago. Tickets prices ranged from $25 to $400, according to information from the WWE.\n\nTo illustrate his love of wrestling, Cruz wore over his shoulder a large white championship belt valued at $400.\n\n\u201cWe're starting to go to more\u201d wrestling shows, Cruz said. \u201cBut this is my first pay-per-view.\u201d\n\nThe trio said they plan to attend a WWE \u201cSmackDown\u201d show in Orlando on Tuesday.\n\nSunday's card at the Forum also featured a Divas Championship Match, featuring women wrestlers, a 20-man battle royal, and longtime WWE star Chris Jericho vs. Bray Wyatt.\n\nSunday's event marked the first WWE pay-per-view from Tampa in over three years, The Forum said.\n\nLongtime friends Scott Oakes and Scott Bombard, both of Venice, wore matching T-shirts that read: \u201cI Am The Tag Team Champions.\u201d\n\nBoth predicted that Cena would retain his heavyweight title and that Jericho would prevail over Wyatt.\n\nOakes and Bombard said they bought tickets for just under $100 each.\n\nThe seats were just off the floor \u201cin the first section of bleachers,\u201d Oakes said.\n\nBoth men said they were wrestling fans as youths, but lost track of \u201csports entertainment\u201d for several years.\n\n\u201cThen, my wife got me tickets to 'Monday Night Raw' a few years ago,\u201d Bombard said.\n\ngfox@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 731-8162", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 20 Jul 2014 19:55:24 -0400", "Description": "Battleground, a World Wrestling Entertainment pay-per-view at the Forum on Sunday night, had high stakes for wrestling faithful.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Battleground, a World Wrestling Entertainment pay-per-view at the Forum on Sunday night, had high stakes for wrestling faithful.", "title": "Wrestling fans pack Forum for WWE pay-per-view", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/wrestling-fans-pack-forum-for-wwe-pay-per-view-20140720/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140720/ARTICLE/140729914/EP/1/4/EP-140729914.jpg", "height": 2611}, "updated_time": "2014-07-21T09:29:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Battleground, a World Wrestling Entertainment pay-per-view at the Forum on Sunday night, had high stakes for wrestling faithful.", "title": "Wrestling fans pack Forum for WWE pay-per-view", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140720/ARTICLE/140729914/AR/0/AR-140729914.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "googlebot-news": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-07-20T19:55:24Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-07-21T09:29:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc36\"", "article_summary": "To illustrate his love of wrestling, Cruz wore over his shoulder a large white championship belt valued at $400.\n\u201cI don't mind the WWE, but 'Impact' is too violent,\u201d said Joel Rachlin, who reminisced about past wrestling heroes such as Bruno Samartino.\nSunday's event marked the first WWE pay-per-view from Tampa in over three years, The Forum said.\nBoth men said they were wrestling fans as youths, but lost track of \u201csports entertainment\u201d for several years.\n\u201cBut this is my first pay-per-view.\u201dThe trio said they plan to attend a WWE \u201cSmackDown\u201d show in Orlando on Tuesday."}
