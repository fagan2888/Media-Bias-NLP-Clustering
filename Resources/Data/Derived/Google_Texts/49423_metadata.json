Cruz was born to an American mother in Calgary, Canada, making him a natural born U.S. citizen. More from USA Today:\n\nAn Illinois judge on Tuesday dismissed a legal challenge brought by a voter who contends that Sen. Ted Cruz is ineligible to run for president because he was born in Canada.\n\n\n\nJudge Maureen Ward Kirby of the Cook County Circuit Court dismissed the complaint brought by Lawrence Joyce, because he failed to properly serve Cruz and members of the Illinois State Board of Elections as required by law.\n\nThis isn't the first lawsuit brought against Cruz over the issue of his citizenship and eligibility to run for president. Suits have been filed in Florida, New York, Alabama and Texas. The New York and Florida lawsuits have also been tossed out.\n\nGOP presidential rival Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to sue Cruz on the issue and has claimed Democrats will do so in a general election if Cruz were to win the GOP nomination. Trump has also questioned the presidential eligibility of Senator Marco Rubio, who was born Florida.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eligible. .05/26/2016 20:00:25PM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Eligible.", "title": "Another Judge Dismisses Ted Cruz Birther Case", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/03/08/judge-dismisses-absurd-ted-cruz-birther-claims-n2130015", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/60/2016-02-29T181822Z_1_LYNXNPEC1S1DS_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-CRUZ.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Eligible.", "title": "Another Judge Dismisses Ted Cruz Birther Case", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/03/08/judge-dismisses-absurd-ted-cruz-birther-claims-n2130015", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/60/2016-02-29T181822Z_1_LYNXNPEC1S1DS_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-CRUZ.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Another Judge Dismisses Ted Cruz Birther Case, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "In case you missed it yesterday, a judge in Illinois threw out a lawsuit arguing Texas Senator Ted Cruz isn't eligible to be the President of the United States.\nCruz was born to an American mother in Calgary, Canada, making him a natural born U.S. citizen.\nTrump has also questioned the presidential eligibility of Senator Marco Rubio, who was born Florida.\nThis isn't the first lawsuit brought against Cruz over the issue of his citizenship and eligibility to run for president.\nMore from USA Today:An Illinois judge on Tuesday dismissed a legal challenge brought by a voter who contends that Sen.
