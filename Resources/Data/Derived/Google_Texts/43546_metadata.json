Asked if Clinton was telling the truth about the emails, 58 percent were sure she knowingly lied.\n\nThose surveyed were reminded that back in March, Hillary Clinton swore in front of Congress that she never sent classified data over her private email server. But now government investigators have revealed that she did, indeed, send classified information using that email address. The poll then asked what respondents thought about Clinton\u2019s claims of innocence. A whopping 58 percent said she \u201cknowingly lied\u201d about handling classified information. Only 33 percent said that there must be \u201canother explanation.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe breakdown of demographics on the question is interesting, as well.

Only 37 percent said no to that question.\n\nA second part of the poll focused on President Obama\u2019s Iranian nuke deal, which also came in for a drubbing, as 58 percent said that Congress should reject the nuclear agreement with Iran, while only 31 percent approved of it.\n\nWorse, 75 percent said that Iran could not be trusted to hold up its end of a deal, regardless of the particulars.\n\nThe same poll also found that 51 percent disapprove of the job President Obama is doing, and 54 percent stand against Obamacare, his signature healthcare law.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a new poll, Hillary Clinton is criticized for using a private email server as secretary of state.
