This year\u2019s Monitor also brings substantive commentary on voting rights, judicial and executive nominations, economic security, and criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cTo have the year we had in 2015 is an important reminder of what is achievable against even the worst of odds,\u201d said Wade Henderson, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference Education Fund, in the publication\u2019s introduction. However, Henderson noted, the work on issues of utmost urgency to the civil and human rights community\u2014like voting rights and immigration\u2014remains unfinished. \u201cIn particular, this year will be an important year for voting rights. Unless Congress acts, 2016 will see the first presidential election in 50 years without the full protection of the Voting Rights Act.\u201d\n\nClick here to read this year\u2019s Civil Rights Monitor.\n\nThe Leadership Conference Education Fund builds public will for federal policies that promote and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the United States.
