The change reflects New Jersey's expansion of Medicaid and the first year the Affordable Care Act, the federal law that mandates healthcare coverage, went into effect.\n\nIn the five previous years, the number of uninsured generally fluctuated by less than 5 percent.\n\n\"It's really unprecedented, there's no question,\" said Raymond Castro, a senior policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a think tank that supports the ACA. \"Critics said it would actually lead to higher uninsured rates because it would be too expensive and business owners would start dropping their policies. In fact, it's been just the opposite of that.\"\n\nThe changes appear to have benefited black residents and the state's poorest citizens most, the data show. The number of uninsured black New Jersey residents fell by more than 43,000 from 2013 to 2014, to a rate of 12.2 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, 67,000 fewer people earning less than $25,000 a year were uninsured in 2014 compared to the previous year. The number of uninsured residents also fell by more than 15 percent across all age groups and among both sexes.\n\n\"It's a great step forward, certainly, as predicted,\" said Melville D. Miller, president of New Jersey Legal Services.\n\nThe figures are lower than some had hoped, however, and Miller said the true impact of the ACA may not be known for several years.\n\nThe Census data also shows that the uninsured rate among Hispanics remains very high at 24.3 percent, and did not show the same progress that other cross-sections of New Jersey did. Language barriers are seen as the most significant roadblock to engaging the Hispanic population, and funding shortfalls for outreach have been persistent.\n\nCastro said the American Community Survey, an annual Census product that delves into a laundry list of demographics, will likely show public and private officials alike where the legislation was most successful and what gaps remain.\n\n\"Even just skimming through some of the data, there's a lot of need throughout the state,\" Castro said. \"That's why I really want to dig into the numbers ... This is the most comprehensive snapshot we've gotten of where the uninsured are. It's great.\"\n\nCounty-by-County Map of ACA's impact\n\nHover or tap on a county for more information.\n\nStephen Stirling may be reached at sstirling@njadvancemedia.com.
