We can warm and assemble.\u201d\n\nThe menu includes coffee and espresso drinks, smoothies, pastries, deli sandwiches, soups, salads and old-fashioned ice cream desserts. Prices are affordable, with most lunches less than $10. The cafe has Wi-Fi and is close to getting a wine and beer license.\n\nThe owners \u2014 all trustees of the Duluth Aviation Institute \u2014 started the cafe to increase awareness of local aviation and to help fund the institute\u2019s Path to Aviation program in Duluth, Hermantown, Proctor and Fond du Lac public schools.\n\nCafe profits will go to help fund the school program, which costs $40,000 to $90,000 a year, Ettestad said, noting the more they raise through contributions and grants, the more they can do.\n\n\u201cWe still have to pay our bills, but whatever else is left over will go to this program,\u201d she said.\n\nIn its sixth year, the program provides aviation science lessons for 900 sixth-graders for two months in the last half of the school year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their science lesson,\u201d Ettestad explained. \u201cWe\u2019re co-teaching. The teachers learn from us. We want to give everybody a foundation of knowledge about aviation.\u201d\n\nThey hope eventually to expand the program to include ninth-graders.\n\nEttestad noted that Duluth has a rich aviation history, beginning with the Lark of Duluth, a 1913 seaplane that inspired the cafe\u2019s name. Owned a century ago by Julius Barnes, a wealthy Duluth grain trader and entrepreneur, the floating biplane made history in 1914 when it became the world\u2019s first commercial passenger air service, shuttling passengers between two Florida cities.\n\nMarino led efforts a few years ago to build a replica of the Lark, which was showcased at the institute\u2019s Lark O\u2019 the Lake Festival in July 2013 at Sky Harbor Airport.\n\nAn expansive mural stretches across one wall of the cafe \u2014 a black and white picture of the original Lark of Duluth merging with a color picture of the replica being flown by Marino. More pictures of the historic Lark are coming, while a replica of its wood propeller already is on display.\n\nThe right tenant\n\nWork began in July to transform the former Jacqui\u2019s deli and Romano\u2019s grocery at Superior Street and Third Avenue East. The 1,600-square-foot space was gutted and enlarged to 2,200 square feet.\n\nThe drop ceiling, wood paneling and linoleum flooring were removed. Care was taken to preserve or complement the building\u2019s historic features while making infrastructure improvements. Columns, woodwork and cornices, doors and large window openings were kept. Utilities were upgraded, new windows and awnings installed.\n\n\u201cWith the ceiling, we tried to emulate but not copy the trim and design of the lobby, put in cornice pieces and use colors in harmony with the lobby and the building in general,\u201d Ettestad said.\n\nThe original coffee shop had a sit-down counter for diners dividing the space, with tables by the windows. In this reincarnation, the space is opened up with no counter. Customers order at a service counter and are served at their tables.\n\nMarino did much of the buildout himself.\n\n\u201cMy husband is a very capable builder,\u201d Ettestad said. \u201cHe built six airplanes and five houses. He did the work.\u201d\n\nBoth the tenant and building owner, Sherman Associates, are covering the costs of the buildout, said Kathy Marinac, Sherman\u2019s senior commercial real estate manager.\n\nThe storefront sat empty for two years before Ettestad, Marino and Monaco came along with their plan for an upscale cafe. It fit with Sherman\u2019s desire for a more ambitious redevelopment of the space to go along with the restoration work at Greysolon Plaza in recent years.\n\n\u201cThere have been other possibilities that didn\u2019t pan out,\u201d Marinac said. \u201cThe difference is the past prospects would have just remodeled portions, which would not have been as significant. Now, a whole new buildout has been done. It\u2019s a significant change to that space.\u201d\n\nWith the tenant\u2019s 10-year lease and their investment in the space, such a major remodel of the storefront could be done, she said.\n\nThe cafe will employ about 10 people when hiring is complete.\n\nCafe location and hours\n\nThe Lark O\u2019 the Lake Cafe, 231 E. Superior St., is open from 6:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sundays.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Business,news,downtown,duluth,Food,restaurants", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Candace Renalls", "og": {"site_name": "Duluth News Tribune", "description": "Downtown Duluth\u2019s budding historic arts and theater district has a new eatery.
