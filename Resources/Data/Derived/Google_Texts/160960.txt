Maryland Republicans and Democrats can agree on one thing this election season: They're not sure whether Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco is elite, either.

New Public Policy Polling data released Friday reveal a divide among Marylanders about the caliber of the Super Bowl winner: 39 percent said he is an elite quarterback, 31 percent said he is not, and 30 percent are not sure. Political affiliation revealed little, as 36 percent of Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans called him elite.

Half of Baltimore City respondents and 46 percent of those in Baltimore suburbs also went with elite, compared with 33 percent in the Washington suburbs.

PPP surveyed 879 registered Maryland voters from April 15-17 about a range of topics, from the Affordable Care Act to their expectations for the Orioles to Old Bay. The margin of error for the survey is 3.3 percent.

Here are some of the key findings:

-- Nearly a majority of Marylanders (46 percent) are Orioles fans. Nineteen percent are Nationals fans, while a combined 10 percent are Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees fans.

-- Ravens fans also enjoy a plurality in Maryland, but at nowhere close to the Orioles' margin. Thirty-eight percent of those surveyed said their favorite team is the Ravens, while 22 percent chose the Washington Redskins.

-- Eighty-five percent of Orioles fans expect the team to make the playoffs, with nearly a third of respondents (32 percent) predicting a World Series title. It's important to note that this survery was conducted during a three-day span when the Orioles played two games, losing both.

-- Maryland is by far the most popular college team in the state, with 46 percent of voters calling it their favorite school.

-- That move to the Big Ten Conference, though? Not so popular. Forty percent of Terps fans said they would rather be in the Atlantic Coast Conference, compared with 35 percent in the Big Ten. Nearly half of Democrats (48 percent) said they prefer the ACC; just 22 percent of Republicans felt the same.

-- Of Michael Phelps, Ray Lewis and Cal Ripken Jr., the former Orioles third baseman is the most well regarded in the state (75 percent favorable opinion), followed by Phelps (60 percent) and then Lewis (47 percent).

-- Marylanders came closest to unanimity on their feelings about crabcakes and Old Bay. Eighty-one and 79 percent of respondents had a favorable opinion of the Maryland staples, respectively. Amen.
