The country\u2019s presidential-election system is on track to be radically altered, yet most voters have no idea that change is afoot.\n\nNational Popular Vote is a California-based group that has been working since 2006 to change the way Americans elect their presidents. NPV supporters are aware of the many failed past efforts to enact a constitutional amendment eliminating the Electoral College. Such an amendment would require the support of two-thirds of each house of Congress and three-quarters (38) of the states. Their objective \u2014 eliminating the Electoral College \u2014 simply does not have enough support to achieve this goal.\n\nBut NPV supporters aren\u2019t going to let a little thing like the Constitution get in the way of a good progressive idea. They have hatched a new scheme, which they say is merely making creative use of constitutional provisions. Creative, indeed! NPV\u2019s idea is so creative that it claims the ability to implement the direct presidential election system that was specifically rejected by the delegates to the Constitutional Convention.\n\nNPV\u2019s plan is simple: It asks each state to change its laws regarding allocation of presidential electors. Today, most states give their electors to the presidential candidate who won their own state\u2019s election. For instance, Barack Obama obtained 55 electors from California in 2012 because he won the popular vote in California. NPV instead asks states to commit themselves, in advance and (supposedly) irrevocably, to award their electors to the winner of the national popular vote.\n\nParticipating states sign an interstate compact committing them to this new system. It goes into effect when states totaling 270 electors \u2014 enough to win a presidential election \u2014 have signed on. In this way, participating states are guaranteed that the winner of the national popular vote will be chosen as president. The Electoral College would still technically exist, but it would merely ratify the national popular-vote winner.\n\nWith NPV in place, California still would have appointed 55 Democratic electors for Obama in 2012, because he won the popular vote nationwide. But in 2004 the pact would have required California to appoint 55 Republican electors for George W. Bush, even though John Kerry won 54 percent of the California vote, because Bush won the nationwide popular vote.\n\nDoes anyone really think that California would tamely submit and appoint 55 Republican electors in such a situation? Are we really to believe that it would give its electors to Sarah Palin or Ted Cruz? Doubtful. Litigation would surely follow to determine whether California\u2019s legislature could appoint Democratic electors after all. (The Constitution says: \u201cEach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors . . .\u201d) The chaos that would follow is just one of the many unanticipated ramifications of NPV\u2019s plan.\n\nOther unintended consequences are certain to follow this attempt to circumvent the constitutional-amendment process.\n\nFirst, consider that 51 local election codes exist in this country (one for each state, plus the District of Columbia). Today, these codes exist side by side; they do not interfere with each other, because each one governs a different election and a different pool of voters: California\u2019s election code, for example, applies only to California voters. Each state holds its own election to choose its own electors, and there is no overlap between them. A vote cast in Texas has no influence over the selection of California\u2019s electors.\n\nBut NPV disrupts this careful balance. It would not replace the current local election codes with a single federal one. The various state codes will still exist, but states that are participating in NPV will be expected to allocate their electors in partial dependence on other states\u2019 laws. With NPV in place, a presidential vote cast in Texas will always affect the outcome in California. And so the existence of a different election code in Texas always has the potential to unfairly penalize a voter in California, and vice versa.\n\nAnd state election codes can differ drastically. States have different rules about registration, early voting, and qualifying for the ballot. They have different policies regarding felon voting. They have different triggers for optional or automatic recounts, and different procedures for counting provisional ballots or investigating allegations of fraud. Their hours of voting vary quite a bit. Each and every one of these differences is an opportunity for someone, somewhere to file a lawsuit.

Why could those felons vote in the national election, but I couldn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nOne well-respected constitutional lawyer, Vikram David Amar, has acknowledged the dangers created by these clashing sets of state election codes. Amar\u2019s opinion is important: NPV is based on an idea that he and two other professors proposed in 2001. He notes that a \u201cproblem I see in the current National Popular Vote bill is that it does not guarantee a true national election with uniform voter qualification, voter mechanics, and vote-counting standards. Absent such uniformity, some states might have incentives to obstruct or manipulate vote counts.\u201d\n\nYou have to pass it to find out what is in it?
