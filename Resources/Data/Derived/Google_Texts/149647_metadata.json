In recent years, however, the 121-institution Federal Bureau of prisons has grown too large (210,000 inmates), too expensive ($6.8 billion last year), too overcrowded (it\u2019s at 123 percent of capacity) and too ineffective (recidivism rates remain well over 50 percent) to justify its continued growth. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that Congress consider some newly proposed legislation which would begin the process of making federal prison system smaller, more effective and less expensive. The bill in question, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, takes proven, commonsense steps that will preserve safety while serving the cause of justice and saving money.\n\nFundamentally, the bill, which counts supporters ranging from libertarian philanthropist Charles Koch to the left-wing Center for American Progress, draws on things that have worked at the state level. Over the past decade, dozens of states ranging from the deep blue California and Rhode Island to the ardently Republican Texas and South Carolina have shrunk prison populations by separating the truly dangerous from the merely misguided. In all of these places, crime rates have generally continued on the downward course they\u2019ve set for the past 30 years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd many of the reforms made at the state level\u2014like many proposed at the federal level in the law now before Congress\u2014are just common sense. It\u2019s foolish that current federal mandatory minimum sentence laws make it impossible for judges to show some lenience on sentencing to a single mother who gets drawn into the underworld out of desperation. It\u2019s equally problematic when early release standards (there\u2019s no parole in the federal system) offer little recognition for those who really turn their lives around behind bars.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to allow some relatively low risk offenders to return to their communities under intensive supervision with a promise of a quick return to prison if they screw up. Programs like this have worked well in places ranging from Texas to Hawaii and deserve a try at the federal level. Federal prison officials, likewise, should have the powers enjoyed by many of their colleagues at the state level to provide phone, e-mail and visitation privileges as an incentive for good behavior. While it makes all of these reforms and more, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act doesn\u2019t free anyone from prison who hasn\u2019t done something to earn early release or arbitrarily shorten any criminal sentence.\n\nAnd one doesn\u2019t have to buy many of the claims made by reformers on both the far-left and libertarian right to believe that proposals like the ones now before Congress are good ideas. Indeed, almost everyone doing time in the federal prison system has committed a serious crime and even a large portion of people serving time for \u201cnon-violent\u201d offenses have acts of violence elsewhere on their records. While many do get sentenced for drug offenses, likewise, it\u2019s nearly impossible to end up in the federal pen for simple possession of a small quantity of illegal drugs. But there are still a lot of reasonably low risk offenders in the system who aren\u2019t particularly likely to prey on society if released. Indeed, warehousing many of them makes it harder to provide effective punishment for the truly dangerous criminals.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s possible to believe that expanding the federal prison system once had value while simultaneously believing we should work to shrink it today. States have pointed the way towards a better correctional system. Now Congress needs to follow and reform the federal prisons.\n\nLehrer is president of the R Street Institute and a signatory to the Right on Crime Statement of Principles.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "There are still a lot of reasonably low risk offenders in the system who aren\u2019t particularly likely to prey on society if released.", "description": "There are still a lot of reasonably low risk offenders in the system who aren\u2019t particularly likely to prey on society if released.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "There are still a lot of reasonably low risk offenders in the system who aren\u2019t particularly likely to prey on society if released.", "title": "Right reform for the prison system", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/258106-right-reform-for-the-prison-system", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/258106-right-reform-for-the-prison-system", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-27T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Eli Lehrer", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-27T10:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/258106-right-reform-for-the-prison-system", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "There are still a lot of reasonably low risk offenders in the system who aren\u2019t particularly likely to prey on society if released.", "card": "summary", "title": "Right reform for the prison system"}, "dcterms.title": "Right reform for the prison system"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6b6d\"", "article_summary": "As recently as 1990, America\u2019s federal prison system contained too few inmates and sent many serious criminals away for sentences that were too short.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that Congress consider some newly proposed legislation which would begin the process of making federal prison system smaller, more effective and less expensive.\nIn short, it\u2019s possible to believe that expanding the federal prison system once had value while simultaneously believing we should work to shrink it today.\nThe bill in question, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, takes proven, commonsense steps that will preserve safety while serving the cause of justice and saving money.\nIt\u2019s equally problematic when early release standards (there\u2019s no parole in the federal system) offer little recognition for those who really turn their lives around behind bars."}
