That\u2019s designed to make it more politically difficult to jack up property taxes.\n\nBut Emanuel wants to rewrite the law to exempt from that calculation property tax increases dedicated to pension funding.\n\nAll of the revenue from Emanuel\u2019s proposed $543 million property tax increase over the next four years would go into the police and fire pension funds, so it would not be subject to the limitation if the council approves the change before voting on the tax hike. In essence, aldermen would have to take only one politically unpalatable vote instead of two.\n\nMayor to announce $250K gun buyback fund Mayor Rahm Emanuel was joining religious and community leaders at a West Side church Monday afternoon to promote a new gun buyback effort.

That, however, doesn\u2019t mean overall taxes would go up by that much. The city accounts for only about a fifth of each tax bill, so the overall increase in each of those bills would be about 12 percent.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t include the $45 million Emanuel wants aldermen to approve for Chicago Public Schools for construction projects, which would add another percentage point.\n\nThe breadth of Emanuel\u2019s record-setting property tax hike proposal can be seen on the agenda for Monday morning\u2019s meeting of the City Council Finance Committee.\n\nIt includes four public hearings, one for each of the property tax increases Emanuel has proposed in the coming years to start restoring financial health to the underfunded police and fire pension systems.\n\nDespite the magnitude of the increases \u2014 far and away the largest in modern Chicago history \u2014 few fireworks are expected at the hearings. Typically, these unadvertised annual affairs are taken care of in a few minutes without public protest.\n\nLater Monday, the Budget Committee meets to talk about the mayor\u2019s overall $7.8 billion budget proposal for 2016. That\u2019s where aldermen and the mayor could offer any changes to the budget plan.\n\nIn addition to the nitty-gritty details of the ordinances behind the budget, aldermen are sure to talk about the property tax and the $9.50-per-month fee that Emanuel proposes to charge each single-family home, duplex and four-flat for garbage pickup.

The change, according to the mayor's office, is that neighborhood organizations can hold the events and promote them instead of the city doing its own event. Emanuel also will speak at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial lunch at a downtown hotel and at a gun violence prevention political action committee event.\n\n*Gov. Bruce Rauner is scheduled to attend the Holocaust Memorial lunch.\n\n*Illinois Republican Chairman Tim Schneider is the speaker at Monday\u2019s City Club luncheon. Schneider took over the party chairmanship shortly after Rauner won the GOP nomination last year. Schneider has been a reliable surrogate for Rauner\u2019s message, and the state Republican Party is heavily dependent upon the governor\u2019s wealth. Schneider also is in his third term as a Cook County Board commissioner and may have some things to say about the budget recently proposed by Democratic Board President Toni Preckwinkle. (Rick Pearson)\n\nFrom the notebook\n\n*Brown's backing: With news surfacing last week that Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown is under the scrutiny of federal law enforcement, some Democratic Party leaders were raising questions about her ability to prevail in the March 15 primary.\n\nAld. Ricardo Munoz, 22nd, who lost to Brown in the 2012 primary, said people began asking him to run again after the news surfaced, but he\u2019s not interested. Ald. Walter Burnett, 27th, said he\u2019s open to the idea of running but doesn\u2019t think \u201call the stars have lined up\u201d and doesn\u2019t \u201clike to kick anyone while they are down.\u201d\n\nWhen Brown sought and won the party endorsement in August, some committeemen asked her if she was under investigation and she said no, Democratic Chairman Joe Berrios said Friday.\n\nBut Brown\u2019s defense attorney confirmed last week that the FBI went to her home recently and seized her cellphone as part of an ongoing investigation into a 2011 land deal involving a longtime campaign contributor that netted tens of thousands of dollars for Brown and her husband.\n\nBerrios, however, said there are no immediate plans to reconsider the endorsement in light of last week\u2019s revelation.\n\n\u201cUnless someone requests a full meeting not to endorse Dorothy Brown, it\u2019s not my intention to call one,\u201d Berrios said. \u201cAs of right now, as you and I are talking, there\u2019s nothing on the horizon.\u201d\n\nBrown in recent months has been kind to the Democratic Party that endorsed her. Last month her campaign fund transferred $25,000 to the county Democratic fund.\n\nThat, and other expenses, left her with about $37,000 on hand, to $36,000 for challenger Jacob Meister.
