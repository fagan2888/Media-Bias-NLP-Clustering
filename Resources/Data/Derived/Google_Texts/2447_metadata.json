The rule requires restaurant chains with 20 or more stores to list calorie information for nearly every food item, and a \u201csuccinct statement\u201d that \u201c2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary,\u201d on each menu board.\n\nVending machines must also display calorie information, though that part of the regulation was already set to take effect in December 2016.\n\nViolations of the regulation can carry civil and criminal penalties, of up to a $1,000 fine, one year in prison, or both.\n\nDomino\u2019s, a leading critic of the rule claimed that it is \u201cimpossible to comply\u201d with its requirements, said the delay is not enough to fix the regulation.\n\n\u201cFDA\u2019s delay confirms both the serious deficiencies in the final rules and the urgent need for enactment of the bipartisan Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act (H.R. 2017),\u201d said Lynn Liddle, executive vice president of Domino\u2019s and chair of the American Pizza Community, in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, FDA proceeded with an approach to final rules that impose significant compliance costs without achieving any meaningful improvements in consumer education.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter years of uncertainty, FDA still has not addressed basic questions regarding implementation,\u201d she said.\n\nThe proposed legislation, sponsored by House Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.), would give businesses greater flexibility in how to display calorie information. The bill would allow companies where the majority of their orders are carryout and delivery, such as pizza chains, to display the information online.\n\nThe Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act also clarifies that an advertisement, coupon, flyer, window display, or post on social media is not a menu, which the regulation implied. The rule defined a menu as anything \u201cused by a customer to make an order selection at the time the customer is viewing the writing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FDA\u2019s self-admission that these regulations are unclear, unpractical, and unworkable is welcome, but a one-year delay doesn\u2019t change the underlying problem on the books\u2014a one-size-fits-all, 400-page regulation that is nearly impossible to follow,\u201d Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers told the Washington Free Beacon. \u201cProviding consumers accurate, clear, consistent nutritional information is everyone\u2019s priority, but it doesn\u2019t have to come at the expense of commonsense.\u201d\n\nThe FDA said they received \u201cnumerous requests asking us to further interpret portions of the final rule\u201d since it was finalized last year. Businesses asked for more time due to the need to change all of their menus, and train staff.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration appreciates and takes very seriously the extensive input it has received from stakeholders throughout the process of establishing requirements for menu labeling in restaurants and other retail food establishments,\u201d FDA Deputy Commissioner for Foods and Veterinary Medicine Michael R. Taylor said. \u201cThe FDA is committed to working collaboratively with those establishments covered by the menu labeling final rule, including chain restaurants, covered grocery stores, and others to facilitate timely and efficient implementation of the new requirements.\u201d\n\nThe FDA is still planning to issue a \u201cdraft guidance document\u201d to businesses further clarifying the rules and will \u201cprovide educational and technical assistance for the covered businesses and for our state, local, and tribal regulatory partners to support reasonable and consistent compliance nationwide.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Calorie rule criticized as \u2018impossible to comply\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is delaying an Obamacare regulation requiring restaurants to display calorie information until December 2016 after businesses complained they did not have suffic", "title": "Feds Delay Obamacare Menu Labeling Rule By a Year", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/feds-delay-obamacare-menu-labeling-rule-by-a-year/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/menus-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is delaying an Obamacare regulation requiring restaurants to", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/menus-150x150.jpg", "title": "Feds Delay Obamacare Menu Labeling Rule By a Year", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9506\"", "article_summary": "Vending machines must also display calorie information, though that part of the regulation was already set to take effect in December 2016.\nThe proposed legislation, sponsored by House Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.), would give businesses greater flexibility in how to display calorie information.\nDomino\u2019s, a leading critic of the rule claimed that it is \u201cimpossible to comply\u201d with its requirements, said the delay is not enough to fix the regulation.\nThe 319-page regulation, mandated by Obamacare, is estimated to cost industry $1.7 billion to comply.\nThe bill would allow companies where the majority of their orders are carryout and delivery, such as pizza chains, to display the information online."}
