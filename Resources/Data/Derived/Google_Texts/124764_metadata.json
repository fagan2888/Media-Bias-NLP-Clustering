However, rates of never events have seen little apparent progress, due in large part to flawed measurement processes, wrote Timothy Morgenthaler, M.D., chief patient safety officer at the Mayo Clinic, and Charles M. Harper, M.D., the clinic's executive dean for practice.\n\nEven in states that require reporting, such as Minnesota, several factors distort data on never events, the authors explained. Not only has the precise definition of the term changed over time, but the average inpatient's condition is also more severe and complex than ever, while numerous procedures and treatments that were unheard of a decade ago are now common. The flaws in patient safety measurement mean different providers have widely disparate ideas of how much progress they have made.\n\nMayo has taken several steps to monitor patient safety in a way that sidesteps these flaws, according to the authors. For example, the clinic analyzes every step in the care process for patients who die under its care, even in cases when death was the expected outcome, creating quarterly metrics for recurring care issues or opportunities for improvement.\n\nMoreover, the clinic reviews every incident involving serious harm to determine whether it was caused by a deviation from the clinic's standards of care; any such harms caused by deviations are counted as preventable harms. \"This is a meaningful way to measure progress in patient safety, because it measures something we feel we can influence--i.e., how reliably we follow our best practices to prevent harm,\" they wrote.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospital medical errors now the third-leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\nLeapfrog Group: Hospitals must improve on never events, hospital-acquired conditions\n\nLeapfrog releases 2013 annual survey results, gets record hospital participation\n\nHospitals turn to big data to identify risks in the ICU\n\nHospital medical errors now third leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\nLeapfrog: Hospital safety improves but patient safety hazards still lurk\n\nHospital investigation challenges Leapfrog patient safety score data\n\nLeapfrog: Hospital safety has room for improvement", "article_metadata": {"description": "To achieve meaningful patient safety reform and reduce preventable \"never events,\" the healthcare industry must reassess the way it measures medical mistakes to get a more accurate picture of the extent of the errors,\u00a0according to\u00a0a\u00a0Harvard Business Review\u00a0blog post.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "To achieve meaningful patient safety reform and reduce preventable \"never events,\" the healthcare industry must reassess the way it measures medical mistakes to get a more accurate picture of the extent of the errors,\u00a0according to\u00a0a\u00a0Harvard Business Review\u00a0blog post.", "title": "Never events: Better measures needed to eliminate medical mistakes", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/never-events-better-measures-needed-eliminate-medical-mistakes/2015-10-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "adverse events,Care Delivery,Harvard Business Review,Mayo Clinic,medical errors,medical mistakes,never events,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient mortality,patient safety,preventable harm", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4164\"", "article_summary": "Patient safety is an ongoing concern in hospitals and health systems, especially with the revelation that medical errors are the nation's third-leading cause of death.\nMayo has taken several steps to monitor patient safety in a way that sidesteps these flaws, according to the authors.\nThe flaws in patient safety measurement mean different providers have widely disparate ideas of how much progress they have made.\n\"This is a meaningful way to measure progress in patient safety, because it measures something we feel we can influence--i.e., how reliably we follow our best practices to prevent harm,\" they wrote.\nEven in states that require reporting, such as Minnesota, several factors distort data on never events, the authors explained."}
