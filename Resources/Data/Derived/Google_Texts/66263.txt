A fire that started in the kitchen of a home kept crews busy Sunday afternoon in Hays.

At 4:27 p.m. crews responded to the blaze in the 500 block of Halladay Street.

A police officer found a fire in the kitchen of one apartment and worked to control it with a fire extinguisher from his patrol vehicle before firefighters arrived to use two additional fire extinguishers to put out the fire.

The kitchen stove was destroyed by the fire. Flames extended to the walls and cabinets in the kitchen adjacent to the stove. Smoke and carbon monoxide from the fire extended into the apartment above. Firefighters used ventilation fans to make this area safe.

Five fire trucks and 17 firefighters responded. The last firefighters left the scene at just before 5:30 p.m.
