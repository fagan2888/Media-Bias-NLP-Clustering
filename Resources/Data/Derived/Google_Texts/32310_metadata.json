At the time, he had no plans on taking charge of an expanding professional and academic healthcare system in January, 2016.\n\nDr. Steven Altschuler, the new senior vice president of health affairs and CEO of UHealth at UM, was developing the gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics when he was approached about about joining UM. Spark Therapeutics is a spin-off of the Center of Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), which he retired from in June. He will now be responsible for leading the school\u2019s clinical health system, including hospitals, faculty practice and clinics. He will also report directly to President Julio Frenk.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying about leading: good leaders manage the present while creating the future and selectively forgetting the past,\u201d Dr. Altschuler said about shaping his new position. \u201cNothing at UHealth needs change right away.\u201d\n\nDr. Altschuler\u2019s work at CHOP included a long-term working relationship with Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He had worked with a network of 50 clinical care sites at CHOP and said that expanding UHealth\u2019s network is increasingly important. For example, the upcoming opening of the 200,000-square-foot Lennar Foundation Medical Center on Coral Gables campus in the fall of 2016 will bring together services from the school\u2019s existing facilities and provide urgent care and outpatient surgery, among other services. He said that healthcare networks are becoming more important because of federal healthcare policies.\n\n\u201cWith the new Affordable Care Act, there\u2019s a push to provide care at the right time in the right place with the right services,\u201d Dr. Altschuler said. \u201cYou need a network of care.\u201d\n\nPresident Frenk said in the hiring announcement on Nov. 24 that he valued Dr. Altschuler\u2019s experience in both administration and deliverance of health care.\n\n\u201cSteven Altschuler has a wealth of experience as a leader in both health care administration and the delivery of excellent and compassionate patient care. As senior vice president of health affairs, he will spearhead UHealth\u2019s continued advancement as a world-class academic medical enterprise serving the Americas and beyond,\u201d President Frenk said.\n\nFrenk\u2019s experience as the minister of public health in Mexico and dean of the Harvard Medical School, among other healthcare administration positions, showed Dr. Altschuler that the school was committed to improving and building on its existing healthcare network.\n\n\u201cI hit it off really well with President Frenk when we met \u2026 obviously he\u2019s a leader in public health,\u201d Dr. Altschuler said.\n\nDr. Altschuler is still working on finding a house in South Florida but said that he and his wife were excited about the move. They knew that if they moved again after his retirement, it would be for warmer weather. Dr. Altschuler will start in his new position on Jan. 1, 2016.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Miami Hurricane", "description": "A\u00a0few months ago, the new leader of the UHealth system at the University of Miami was working on a startup company.
