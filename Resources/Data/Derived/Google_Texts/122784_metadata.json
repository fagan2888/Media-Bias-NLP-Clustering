Vitollo \u2014 \u201cCall me Joe\u201d \u2014 was out posting election signs and going door to door to convince people to vote for him as Albany County\u2019s next executive.\n\n\u201cPeople think their vote doesn\u2019t count, but they\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThis race will be close if we get people out to vote.\u201d\n\nVitollo is frustrated that incumbent Democrat Daniel McCoy won\u2019t debate him. Vitollo has spent mostly his own money to finance his campaign, he said, citing a figure of $3,800. \u201cI don\u2019t want big business saying I owe them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe New York State Board of Elections says that McCoy has spent $595,895 since Jan. 1; most of that was for a September primary battle against Daniel Egan, which McCoy easily won.\n\nVitollo is also greatly outnumbered when it comes to enrolled voters: Republican voters in Albany County number 35,103 to 85,917 enrolled Democrats.\n\n\u201cI am personally invested in this,\u201d said Vitollo. \u201cOur Founding Fathers were willing to risk their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor for the American Revolution. These guys ran the risk, if they lost, they\u2019d be tried and hung for treason, leaving their families destitute.\u201d\n\nVitollo, 59, said the point is to \u201crisk it all for what you believe in.\u201d\n\nHe lives in Coeymans and has six children and 15 grandchildren.\n\n\u201cNo way could I look my kids and grandkids in the eye if I didn\u2019t invest in the future of this country for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\u201d\n\nVitollo, who used to own a small construction business, is a registered nurse who works as a charge nurse at a 60-bed emergency room in White Plains, he said, a job he\u2019s held for the last eight years.\n\nHe is making his first run for office, he said, because the Republican county committee asked him to.\n\n\u201cI saw the needs of the county and felt I had what it would take to help,\u201d said Vitollo.\n\n\u201cProfessional politicians need to come to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a Jeffersonian\u2026\u2018Public servants\u2019 is an oxymoron.\u201d\n\nHe said of McCoy, \u201cHe has the unions in his pocket but he hasn\u2019t done anything for them. He has the Democratic machine\u2026without the party, Mr. McCoy would be nowhere. I think the people have had enough of party politics. It\u2019s time for the people to win.\u201d\n\nVitollo favors term limits.\n\nHe describes his stance as \u201cpro-business and pro-American.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I would make the Industrial Development Agency truly active in the county,\u201d said Vitollo. \u201cIt\u2019s done next to nothing since McCoy took office,\u201d he said, \u201cThe county has relied on towns to move business forward. I\u2019d be proactive; we have the port, the railways, the abandoned industrial buildings.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cWe are an eyesore in the wheels of progress. The only businesses brought in offer minimum-wage jobs\u2026McCoy is a miserable failure.\u201d\n\nAnother tenet of his campaign is to \u201creduce the size of county government\u2026We are way over-represented,\u201d said Vitollo.\n\nFinally, he said, \u201cPeople of the county pay too much in taxes. We need to reduce taxes, get our hand out of people\u2019s pockets. We\u2019ve been taxed enough already. I go along the lines of the Tea Party.\u201d\n\nIn addition to having the Republican line, Vitollo is endorsed by the Reform party, which has roots in the Stop Common Core movement. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s also libertarian, the people\u2019s party.\u201d There are no Reform Party members in Albany County, according to 2015 enrollment figures from the county\u2019s board of elections.\n\nOn the revised county charter proposal, Vitollo said, \u201cI do not support it\u2026It gives one party too much say in the changes.\u201d\n\nHe went on, \u201cThe charter does need to be amended. Things do need to change. The one they drafted is very weak and does not strengthen the people. This is my theme: It\u2019s time for the people to win. That charter makes the politicians win.\u201d\n\nOn regulating oil trains, Vitollo said, \u201cThe county\u2019s role should be along the lines of making sure state regulations, of which there are many, are in line with safety for the people\u2026I\u2019m all in favor of safety and protecting the environment and people. We need some very strong laws that do that.\n\n\u201cBut legislation shouldn\u2019t waste time duplicating what is done on the state level. We don\u2019t need legislation we can\u2019t enforce.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Vitollo said of laws passed by the county legislature to ban toxic toys and Styrofoam, \u201cMany of these have state and federal regulations. The toxic-toy thing is puff, making it look like they\u2019re doing something. We don\u2019t have the ability to enforce such laws.\u201d\n\nOn heroin, Vitollo said, \u201cI work in the ER so I see this on a regular basis. It is incredibly infectious because of how cheap it is.\u201d\n\nHe outlined a three-part plan to stem the heroin epidemic.\n\nFirst, he said, \u201cMake sure our law-enforcement folks are properly equipped to deal with this epidemic. We have a very good police force\u2026We need to make sure they have the proper tools.\u201d\n\nSecond, Vitollo said, \u201cMany drug treatment programs have large weak points. I see it with people returning, after just getting out of treatment, back to the hospital with an OD\u2026.Treatment programs need to be revisited. Some are extremely effective.\u201d\n\nHe contrasted some state programs that he said had a 15-percent cure rate with some private programs he said had an 85-percent cure rate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re failing them,\u201d he said of the addicts, \u201cand we\u2019re failing the public\u2026Crime goes along with it.\u201d\n\nThird, he said, \u201cGo back to educating kids in the right way.\u201d He praised the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program.\n\nHe also said, \u201cYou need to give young people something else to do.\u201d\n\nOn consolidating services, Vitollo said, \u201cThere does need to be a certain level of cooperation. There is a lot of duplication of services.\n\n\u201cThe county is overburdened with the cost of maintaining roads. Sharing equipment could be very beneficial.\u201d\n\nHe suggested, \u201cGo to the departments themselves. The county hired someone to figure out where they could save costs and they enacted not one suggestion. Bringing in someone from the outside does not always work\u2026\n\n\u201cYou have to go to the people on the ground if you want to figure out how to save money\u2026and they will take ownership of the idea. Those guys who run the plows, they know everything about it\u2026We have to give them an incentive to come up with ideas.\u201d\n\nOn caring for veterans, Vitollo said, \u201cIt takes time to see results. These guys did not get here overnight; it takes time for them to recover. Enlisting the help of other vets is useful.\u201d\n\nVitollo said that, over the last century, soldiers have been given less time to recover from war.\n\n\u201cAfter World War I,\u201d he said, \u201csometimes it took six months to a year before they made it home to their families; there was a catharsis with other veterans\u2026\n\n\u201cAfter world War II, it was a month to six months. Most of them did very well. They were hanging with other vets, other men, and pouring out their hearts. They were given tasks to do to keep busy.\u201d\n\nVeterans from the Korean War, he said, had less than 30 days before they were home, and, for Vietnam veterans, that time had shrunk to just a few days as is true for veterans who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cYou could be fighting one day and in your parents\u2019 living room three days later,\u201d said Vitollo. \u201cThat\u2019s very little time for emptying the stuff in their hearts and heads\u2026.The problem is complex and has to do with the rapid pace of our society. These guys need care and love and touch. A lot of people aren\u2019t aware of the time factor.\u201d\n\nOn suburban poverty, Vitollo said, \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s self-inflicted with debt load and credit load, trying to be there as a suburbanite.\n\n\u201cSome of it is not their choice \u2014 someone in the family has lost a job. There\u2019s an incredible increase in cost for health benefits, a skyrocketing cost for health care.\u201d\n\nVitollo asserted, \u201cObamacare is not working. I watch it in the emergency room. Those who don\u2019t have, pay less; those that do have to pay a lot more and a lot is not covered. It\u2019s a redistribution of wealth through the health-care system. I disagree with that.\u201d\n\nVitollo also said that unemployment figures are misleading since they do not record the jobless who have given up seeking work. \u201cSome have dropped off the radar,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to put them back to work. We need an aggressive industrial development agency,\u201d he reiterated.\n\nVitollo also recommend, \u201cRe-introduce the trades and vocations to education. College isn\u2019t for everybody. A high percentage of entrepreneurs today don\u2019t have college degrees\u2026They are self-made.\u201d\n\nHe went on, \u201cElectricians, plumbers, carpenters \u2014 these people are needed in our society. Some people are not good with books or tests; they are hands-on.\u201d He lamented that many schools have done away with vocational training programs.\n\nVitollo concluded of the poor, \u201cGive them a hand up, not a hand out.\u201d\n\nOn caring for elderly county residents, he said, \u201cIt is a lot less expensive to take care of people at home. A number of levels of health care can be extended to the elderly at home\u201d\n\nCertified nurse assistants, he said, \u201care excellent as a set of eyes and ears for the nurses.\u201d He recommended \u201cincreasing the county nurse force to allow the elderly to stay where they are.\u201d\n\nOn wages, Vitollo said, \u201cThere\u2019s a problem with the government getting involved in setting minimum wage. The workers should drive that.\u201d\n\nHe described how, as a 13-year-old, he offered to clean up daily at an auto-body shop in exchange for learning the trade, and ended up working there. \u201cI kind of made my own job,\u201d he said.\n\nMinimum-wage jobs at places like McDonald\u2019s and Wal-Mart, Vitollo said, \u201cprovide an education.\u201d He said they teach responsibility, teamwork, respect for authority, leadership, and personal hygiene.\n\n\u201cThese places are not intended to be lifetime jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cEntry-level jobs play a big role in future work\u2026They\u2019re actually paying you to get an education.\u201d\n\nOn the $15-per-hour wage for fast-food workers, Vitollo said, \u201cIt\u2019s a huge mistake to let workers drive their salary. It should not be the government\u2019s role.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; minimum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd556\"", "article_summary": "He is making his first run for office, he said, because the Republican county committee asked him to.\n\u201cI saw the needs of the county and felt I had what it would take to help,\u201d said Vitollo.\nVitollo is also greatly outnumbered when it comes to enrolled voters: Republican voters in Albany County number 35,103 to 85,917 enrolled Democrats.\nHe describes his stance as \u201cpro-business and pro-American.\u201d\u201cFirst and foremost, I would make the Industrial Development Agency truly active in the county,\u201d said Vitollo.\nALBANY COUNTY \u2014 On Monday, Republican Francis J.
