New research shows that as a result of rising temperatures caused by global climate change, the first leaves and buds of spring will begin arriving at least three weeks ahead of time in the United States.\n\nResearchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison examined the variations and trends in the onset of spring across the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s temperate regions and calculated that the onset of spring plant growth will shift by a median of three weeks earlier over the next century. Their findings were published in the journal Environmental Research Letters yesterday.\n\nThe prospect of shorter winters probably seem like great news for those who have suffered through several long and freezing cold spells recently, but it\u2019s definitely bad tidings for many spring season plants and for animals that rely on them for sustenance. The change will have far-reaching impact on the growing season of plants and could, as a result, affect for our food security as well.\n\nIn the natural world, plants and animas life cycles are adapted to the seasons and resource availability. For instance, some migratory birds cope with winter conditions, when food is scarce, by migrating to a warmer climate. Others, like bears and squirrels, do the same by hibernating. Both migration and hibernation are sensitive to seasonal changes. So when the climate goes out of whack \u2014 or as scientists would say, when there\u2019s a \u201cphonological mismatch\u201d \u2014 it means trouble. (There have already been reports about warmer weather driving bears out of hibernation early this year.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The spring will come three weeks earlier thanks to climate change.
