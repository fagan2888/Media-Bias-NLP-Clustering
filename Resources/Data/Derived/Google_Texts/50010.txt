Famed SNL star and radio personality Dennis Miller has a strong take on what should happen when Obamacare starts hurting businesses, according to an Oct. 17th radio broadcast of “The Dennis Miller Show.”

In the audio clip published by Media Matters, Miller said if someone has to be let go due to Obamacare, employers should “fire somebody with an Obama-Biden sticker on their car in the employee parking lot.”

Many conservatives would whole heartedly agree.

Miller said sarcastically, “they’ll understand, they’re patriots.”

That part just doesn’t seem plausible. No one expects accountability in this day and age and certainly not from Obama’ites.

Miller believes employees should no longer be cut based on seniority.

“There are some people who think this is crap, fire a believer, they’ll understand. Just say ‘we’re all in this together, this is what you wanted. I have to let you go, but at least you’ll have health care in the single payer.’”

He went on to explain,

“folks I’m not saying that to be mean. That is how weird things have gotten where if you say that you’re thought to be perverse or vindictive. Who else would you fire?Go out into the parking lot. If somebody has to be cut to 29 hours-if somebody has to be fired. You know how proud they are of their Obama-Biden bumper stickers in their original permutation. They’re still on five years down the road.”

Rational arguments are a specialty of Dennis Miller. He hits a home run here.
