Sasse earned early illegal applause when he joked that he\u2019d try to get the old boy-girl-boy-girl seating chart restored (the audience was divided in half, with boys on one side, girls on the other).\n\nIn his opening, Domina said he\u2019s represented people on death row, and every time he \u201cvolunteered to put myself between a Nebraskan and the electric chair\u201d the inmate went home. And when one man he got exonerated didn\u2019t have a home to return to, he stayed with Domina, just down the hall from his children.\n\nDomina said he differs from Sasse in that he opposes putting Social Security benefits into the hands of banks, won\u2019t take money from someone who opposes a farm bill, and opposes a voucher system for Medicare or balancing the budget \u201con the backs of veterans.\u201d\n\nSasse talked about how he took over his hometown Lutheran college when it was on the brink of bankruptcy and unable to make its payroll \u2013 recalling the four times the school didn\u2019t have enough money at the beginning of the month to pay employees at month\u2019s end.\n\nAsked about drones, domestic surveillance and the rights of privacy, Domina said the Fourth Amendment protects Americans against unreasonable search and seizure, and \u201cdrones are no exception.\u201d He said he opposes the use of drones to kill Americans in foreign countries and the National Security Agency\u2019s seizure of emails and texts.\n\nSasse said Americans need \u201cstone-colored realism about the dangers we face\u201d and its government must have the technology to keep up with bad guys, but agreed with Domina on the need to guard against unreasonable search and seizure.\n\nAsked if the federal government should address conflicting state and federal laws on marijuana legalization and same-sex marriage, Sasse said he believes in traditional marriage and children are best raised by a father and mother and doesn\u2019t believe the government should be in the business of defining marriage. The feds also shouldn\u2019t be involved in regulating marijuana \u2013 that should be left to local authorities, he said.\n\nDomina disagreed, saying it\u2019s the responsibility of government to define marriage, noting that a couple dozen states have legalized same-sex marriage. He said he\u2019s not aware of any studies showing children fare better with a mother and father than with two fathers, two fathers or single parents.\n\nAs for pot, he said the feds need to address the situation where the drug is legal in Colorado but not in neighboring states, while federal law bans the transport of illegal drugs.\n\nOn energy, Domina advocated for abolishing federal subsidies for fossil fuels and redirecting them to renewable energy. He supported the EPA\u2019s proposed new regulations to crack down on coal-fired power plants.\n\n\u201cScience is real, and the impact that fossil fuels are having on our environment are real,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will come raining down on all our heads, and especially yours, if we don\u2019t fix it immediately.\u201d\n\nSasse decried the Obama adminstration\u2019s \u201cwar on industries like coal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration doesn\u2019t have an all of the above strategy \u2014 they have a Solyndra Strategy,\u201d Sasse said, referring to a California solar company that went bankrupt despite $529 million in government subsidies.\n\nDomina represents Nebraska landowners fighting the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline that would cross the state; Sasse supports the pipeline and the development of more North American oil and natural gas. Sasse also supports renewable energy, ethanol, clean nuclear power and wind energy \u201cbut not an administration that tries to pick winners and losers.\u201d\n\nAsked about the Affordable Care Act, more commonly called Obamacare, Sasse hammered on Congress for passing the law without reading it and said it has driven up health care costs and the 7 million enrolled in its health care exchanges doesn\u2019t count 5.3 million who were left uninsured by Obamacare\u2019s new mandates. He likened that to a Kmart manager burning down a Wal-Mart and then claiming he created business.\n\nDomina said the law has \u201cserious problems\u201d \u2013 including an \u201cunforgivable\u201d rollout \u2013 but also some good provisions, such as requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions and allow children to stay on parents\u2019 plans longer and the elimination of lifetime coverage caps. He noted that Republican Sen. John McCain said it would be a \u201cfool\u2019s errand\u201d to try to repeal the law.\n\nOn education, Sasse said he opposes Common Core State Standards \u2013 which were developed by groups such as the National Governors\u2019 Association but have come under fire by wary conservatives. Sasse said they were supposed to be voluntary and state-based, but are \u201cno longer either.\u201d Sasse said raising kids is the responsibility of parents and local government and shouldn\u2019t be \u201ccentrally done in Washington.\u201d\n\nDomina said the federal government has a \u201cpretty dynamic interest\u201d in making sure all students have common levels of understanding, noting that he may differ on education from Sasse, who attended private colleges and homeschools his children \u201cwhich I applaud him for.\u201d The problem is, both George W. Bush and Obama didn\u2019t trust teachers to decide who should pass, Domina said.\n\nAsked how they would stay true to their beliefs while working across the aisle toward solutions, Domina said he differs from Democrats in several areas and parties need to \u201cdrop the labels and think about the issues.\u201d\n\nSasse was also willing to criticize his party, repeating his mantra that Republicans need to stop being \u201cthe party of no ideas\u201d and saying the problem isn\u2019t just that Democrats are in charge, but too many Republicans want Washington to be in charge.\n\n\u201cWe need Washington to be a lot smaller and politicians to be a lot less relevant in our lives,\u201d he said.\n\nThe only time one of them directly challenged the other was during the closing statements, when Domina challenged Sasse\u2019s earlier assertion that there are 22,000 pages of Obamacare rules and regulations \u2013 which he has printed out and carries with him on a 9-foot-tall prop. Domina said to get to that length, you\u2019d have to count all the proposed regulations, press releases and repealed regulations.\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
