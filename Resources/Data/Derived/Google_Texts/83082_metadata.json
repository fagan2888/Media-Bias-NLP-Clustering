Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy invited dozens of Connecticut local officials, business executives and heads of non-profit agencies to the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday for a day of accessing the sometimes puzzling ways of Washington.\n\n\u201cConnecticut in the Capitol\u201d was an event begun by former Sen. Chris Dodd, but discontinued after he left office \u2013 until Tuesday.\n\nAbout 100 visitors from the state are attending a two-day a series of panels, moderated by Connecticut lawmakers, on hot-button issues of health care, transportation, immigration and Wall Street reform.\n\n\u201cI sense there\u2019s a disconnect between Washington and everyone else,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nThat disconnect was the subject of talk by Chuck Todd, moderator of NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d who tried to explain the partisan divisions that led to gridlock in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe [political parties\u2019] base is dominating the debate and you are being punished for compromise,\u201d Todd said.\n\nIn his grim assessment, Todd said Congress only reacts to crisis. \u201cTransportation funds will come only when bridges fall in the water,\u201d he said, only half-jokingly.\n\nStill, Cheryl Chandler of the Connecticut Council on Problem Gaming, said a panel that included former Connecticut health exchange CEO Kevin Counihan, who now runs the federal exchanges, on the future of the Affordable Care Act made her feel hopeful about the future of mental health services.\n\n\u201cTheir optimism is good to hear,\u201d she said.\n\nThe conference was attended by representatives of Connecticut\u2019s largest industries, including United Technologies, hospitals and other non-profits and local officials like Groton Mayor Marian Galbraith.\n\nGalbraith said she came to Washington to determine how to best take advantage of situations where the federal agenda \u201cmeshes\u201d with her local agenda.\n\n\u201cAlmost everything that happens here impacts us locally,\u201d she said.\n\nSen.
