Also, Obamacare expands Medicaid (called Medi-Cal in California), which means an influx of patients who will need cardiologists, ophthalmologists and other such physicians.\n\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s going to be more competition to access these specialists,\u201d said Javier Sanchez, CalOptima\u2019s chief network officer.\n\nFunding will come from an unexpected $13 million in Medi-Cal revenue at CalOptima, officials said.\n\nSpecialists will be reimbursed about 8 percent more \u2013 a bump that could possibly draw new physicians into the network and translate to shorter patient wait-times. Still, doctors will get less than under Medicare, the public insurance for seniors.\n\n\u201cThere are too many doctors who are falling away from taking CalOptima and Medi-Cal rates because they cannot survive,\u201d said Dr. Peter Anderson, the director of the emergency department at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital.\n\nAnderson cautioned, though, the additional funding may not reach all the specialists. Healthcare networks can take the higher rate in aggregate, and then distribute it among doctors unevenly \u2013 more for specialists who are in higher demand, for instance.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure it gets to all the doctors in the network in a fair fashion,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso Thursday, the CalOptima Board of Directors approved a $27,000 one-time bonus for Chief Executive Officer Michael Schrader, and an $8,000 raise for Chief Counsel Gary Crockett. Schrader\u2019s annual base salary is $315,000 and Crockett\u2019s was $206,000.\n\nFormer board members criticized Crockett during the past two years for mishandling legal questions regarding open meetings and conflicts of interest. Last year, the county Grand Jury wrote that CalOptima spent more than $500,000 on outside law firms and \u201cconsumed countless hours of staff time investigating these allegations.\u201d\n\nBut all the directors who voted Thursday supported the two salary increases.\n\n\u201cWe looked at it as a systemic issue, not a one-person issue,\u201d said board member Michael Riley, who is also the director of the county Social Services Agency.\n\nAs of August, CalOptima had a $3.6 million operating surplus; its total budget is about $1.5 billion.\n\nContact the writer: mreicher@ocregister.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "news", "description": "News: County Medi-Cal doctors to get higher payments  | caloptima, doctors, county, higher, specialists, medi, cal, board, million, chief", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "MIKE REICHER", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Directors of the county\u2019s health care agency for the poor have agreed to spend $10 million more annually on specialist doctors \u2013 and to bump the pay for two of the agency\u2019s top executives.", "title": "County Medi-Cal doctors to get higher payments", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/caloptima-529627-doctors-county.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/mu676t-b781190130z.120131004173440000g0n1g9gdu.2.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ocregister", "image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/mu676t-b781190130z.120131004173440000g0n1g9gdu.2.jpg"}, "description": "Directors of the county\u2019s health care agency for the poor have agreed to spend $10 million more annually on specialist doctors \u2013 and to bump the pay for two of the agency\u2019s top executives.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "County Medi-Cal doctors to get higher payments"}, "content_author": "MIKE REICHER", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/mu676t-b781190130z.120131004173440000g0n1g9gdu.2.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "caloptima, doctors, county, higher, specialists, medi, cal, board, million, chief", "publication_date": "2013-10-04", "access-type": "free", "section": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "County Medi-Cal doctors to get higher payments"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe think there\u2019s going to be more competition to access these specialists,\u201d said Javier Sanchez, CalOptima\u2019s chief network officer.\nHealthcare networks can take the higher rate in aggregate, and then distribute it among doctors unevenly \u2013 more for specialists who are in higher demand, for instance.\n\u201cWe want to make sure it gets to all the doctors in the network in a fair fashion,\u201d he said.\nFunding will come from an unexpected $13 million in Medi-Cal revenue at CalOptima, officials said.\nHigher doctors\u2019 rates, officials said, might keep physicians from dropping Medicaid patients."}
