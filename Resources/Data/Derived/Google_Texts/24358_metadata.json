(Photo: The Register)Buy Photo\n\nBoth Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Marco Rubio said in Iowa last week that their ideas are the ones that will make the country thrive in the 21st century, while their competitors are backward-thinking. Here are the proposals that Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, and Rubio, a Florida U.S. senator, laid out during their Iowa speeches:\n\nHILLARY CLINTON\n\n1.ECONOMY: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have an economy that works for everybody.\u201d GOP trickle-down economics doesn\u2019t work, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried that. It has failed. It is time to bury it 6 feet deep.\u201d\n\n2. RESEARCH: Invest in research and science instead of cutting back. \u201cWhat really boosted the economy in the last 35 years or so? Investments the United States government made, in the Internet,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, the United States government did invent the Internet.\u201d Clinton said the human genome sequencing project was finished soon after her husband\u2019s administration ended, and other investments have led to major discoveries.\n\n3. RENEWABLE ENERGY: \u201cWe need also to make ourselves the 21st century clean energy superpower.\u201d Investing in clean, renewable energy will address climate change and create millions of jobs, she said.\n\n4. EDUCATION: Invest in high-quality child care and early childhood education. Use \u201chome visiting\u201d to help kids and young moms. Make college affordable. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous\u201d that Americans hold about $1.2 trillion in outstanding college loan debt, she said.\n\n5. HEALTH CARE: Stand behind the Affordable Care Act. If a GOP president is elected, it will be repealed, she said.\n\n6. FAMILIES: Help people who are both working and raising a family. \u201cWe have rules governing how people work and raise families that are out of the 1950s,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need paid family leave. We need earned paid sick days. We need predictable work schedules. We need to make sure that we start giving support to families who are doing the most important work they will ever do, which is raising the next generation.\u201d\n\n7. POLITICAL SYSTEM: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix our dysfunctional political system. Obviously that\u2019s something we all think a lot about.\u201d She said she wants to register every American to vote as soon as they turn 18. She would \u201cstand against these pernicious efforts that are underway in too many states to try to prevent young people, people of color, elderly people from being able to vote.\u201d And she wants to \u201cget dark unaccountable money out of politics,\u201d she said.\n\n8. MARRIAGE AND ABORTION: Stand up for gay rights and abortion rights. \u201cOn those two issues, Republicans want to turn the clock back,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of saying marriage equality is the law of the land, let\u2019s move on to the next part of the agenda, which is ending discrimination against LGBT folks, they\u2019re going to try to fight.\u201d\n\n9. GUNS: \u201cI\u2019m going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our country because I believe we can do better than that,\u201d she said. \u201cA majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners agree with universal background checks to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people who are mentally unstable and even terrorists.\u201d\n\n10. IMMIGRATION: \u201cWe need comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d she said. The bipartisan immigration bill that Rubio and others in the U.S. Senate passed in 2010 would \u201cbe my starting point,\u201d she said. The U.S. is not going to deport the 11 or 12 million people here illegally, she said.\n\nMARCO RUBIO\n\n1. ECONOMY: The U.S. needs to become the best place in the world to do business again, and the chief way to do that is to reform the tax code to set a globally competitive corporate tax rate, he said. \u201cWe have the highest combined corporate tax rate in the world,\u201d he said.\n\n2. REGULATIONS: The government has regulations \u201cthat are completely out of control and are wiping out not just small business but community banking, which is so critical to small business,\u201d he said. Rubio wants \u201ca hard cap on how much regulations can cost our economy,\u201d to force government agencies to get rid of regulations.\n\n3. BALANCED BUDGET: Balance the budget by reforming Social Security and Medicare. The national debt of $18 trillion will eventually trigger a debt crisis that will make doing business in America impossible, he said.\n\n4. SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE: Decrease spending on Social Security and Medicare. People who today are in their 40s and younger will need to retire a year later, and their Social Security benefits won\u2019t grow as fast, he said. \u201cOur Medicare might be an option to go out into the private market and find a private plan,\u201d he said.\n\n5. FAMILIES: Help people who are both working and raising a family. Many people can\u2019t get a raise without going back to school for more education, he said. He wants to see more alternatives to traditional four-year degrees, more vocational training, and more college programs with classes at night, online and on weekends.\n\n6. DEFENSE: \u201cWe can\u2019t have an American century if we\u2019re not safe,\u201d he said. The United States is still the only nation in the world capable of bringing countries together to confront threats from China, aggression from Moscow, radical jihadists in the Middle East, and Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, he said. \u201cMost of the world\u2019s problems cannot be solved without American leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1IZ7Th1", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "From economy to family policies, two presidential hopefuls say they\u2019re looking to future.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "From economy to family policies, two presidential hopefuls say they\u2019re looking to future.", "title": "By the issues: Clinton, Rubio lay out plan for future", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/07/14/hillary-clinton-marco-rubio-ideas-iowa-speeches/30160723/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From economy to family policies, two presidential hopefuls say they\u2019re looking to future.", "title": "By the issues: Clinton, Rubio lay out plan for future", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8b8c1cc85e478c6ee0a38d804f4bcf7b3b420cc7/c=201-0-1401-1200&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/14/IAGroup/DesMoines/635725089633556074-hil-rubio.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Marco Rubio", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Persons/Marco Rubio", "title": "By the issues: Clinton, Rubio lay out plan for future", "author": "Jennifer Jacobs", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/elections/presidential/caucus", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a58d31d4bfc3ad9843df1665878a22a189696164/c=351-0-1251-1200/local/-/media/2015/07/14/IAGroup/DesMoines/635725089633556074-hil-rubio.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/637fd98e62186f56f3cfa3788d54f00962498ca8/c=201-0-1401-1200/local/-/media/2015/07/14/IAGroup/DesMoines/635725089633556074-hil-rubio.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd245c115ca53275cb468f87e4e3c2f3f8d65987/c=3-0-1599-1200/local/-/media/2015/07/14/IAGroup/DesMoines/635725089633556074-hil-rubio.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c9b785185f1c415b410e88353748d7dc65a2e5f/c=0-27-1598-930&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/07/14/IAGroup/DesMoines/635725089633556074-hil-rubio.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-14T21:21:10.470000-05:00", "shorthed": "By the issues: Clinton, Rubio lay out plan for future", "articleid": 30160723, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce63e67453a4e6f937c1d4a40e1199cc91986ac7/c=0-27-1598-930/local/-/media/2015/07/14/IAGroup/DesMoines/635725089633556074-hil-rubio.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d7a60da3640bc1ae536aab3a65403e6dc704be33/c=465-0-1137-1200/local/-/media/2015/07/14/IAGroup/DesMoines/635725089633556074-hil-rubio.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE: Decrease spending on Social Security and Medicare.\nRubio wants \u201ca hard cap on how much regulations can cost our economy,\u201d to force government agencies to get rid of regulations.\nBuy Photo Both Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio delivered the same overarching theme: I\u2019m the forward-thinking presidential candidate.\nBALANCED BUDGET: Balance the budget by reforming Social Security and Medicare.\n\u201cOur Medicare might be an option to go out into the private market and find a private plan,\u201d he said."}
