Nixon aide, actor, and right-wing commentator Ben Stein has some thoughts about race in America.

Stein, you may remember, recently made headlines for his charge that President Obama is attempting to “racialize all politics,” making him “the most racist president there has ever been in America.” (We can safely assume, then, that Stein wasn’t in the room when his old boss espoused his own ideas about race.) Asked about the controversy surrounding those remarks and the state of race relations in America during a Monday appearance on Newsmax TV, Stein stepped in it again, railing against the “beaten-down, pathetic, self-defeating black underclass.”

“You would think if you read the liberal mainstream media the main problem with race in America was poor, innocent black people being set upon and mistreated by the police,” Stein said. “That’s just nonsense. The real problem with race in America is a very, very beaten-down, pathetic, self-defeating black underclass that just can’t seem to get its way going in the way that blacks were able to before the scourge of drugs and the scourge of gangs.”
