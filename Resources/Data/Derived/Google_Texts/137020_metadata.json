The corporation pays the arbitrators hearing the case, and the rulings, from what we can tell about this opaque process, favor the corporation, if only because an arbitrator siding with the people who do the hiring ensures them more work in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing that we\u2019ve allowed corporations to build their own parallel legal system, rupturing the fundamental right of access to courts. \u201cIt\u2019s in two amendments of the Bill of Rights,\u201d said Sen. Al Franken, one of Congress\u2019 leading critics of mandatory arbitration, on a conference call reacting to the Times series. \u201cThe Second Amendment is supposed to be important, but that\u2019s one amendment. [Trial by jury] is really important, that\u2019s in two amendments.\u201d (It\u2019s the Sixth and the Seventh, incidentally.)\n\nTwo partisan Supreme Court rulings, 2011\u2019s AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion and 2013\u2019s American Express v. Italian Colors, entrenched arbitration in the law, preventing even criminal lawsuits from proceeding and significantly limiting class action cases. As the Times points out, Chief Justice John Roberts, who participated in the majority in both cases, unsuccessfully tried to limit class actions as a private lawyer for Discover Bank. When in a position to make the decision by himself, Roberts capitalized, and consumers and workers have suffered ever since.\n\nBut a case out of California could upend this blockade of the justice system, and it\u2019s perhaps fitting that the company involved routinely breaks the law as part of its business strategy. Uber, the ride-sharing app, not only may have gone too far in the way it treats its drivers; it could bring down the arbitration house of cards in the process.\n\nUber treats its 300,000 drivers as independent contractors, allowing it to avoid granting worker\u2019s compensation, overtime pay and other relevant labor benefits. Low labor costs enable the company to undercut competitors and win business. If forced to actually follow the law, Uber is just another car service.\n\nA non-trivial number of drivers are not happy with being the low-paid cog in the Uber business model, and have sued the company over misclassifying their employment status. The California Labor Commission awarded $4,152.20 in business expenses and back wages to driver Barbara Berwick in June. But Uber can handle one driver at a time; a class action incorporating all its drivers would be a fatal blow. And this September, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Chen ruled that drivers could form a class to litigate employee misclassification.\n\nThe critical question is how big that class will be. Like so many other companies, Uber included a clause in its standard employment contract, binding driver disputes to an arbitration process. However, its initial language was faulty. One part of the contract says a private arbitrator gets to rule on whether a particular case goes to arbitration, but another part gives that choice to a judge. Also, an opt-out clause allowed drivers to retain their right to sue, but it was hidden on the second-to-last page of the contract, and required drivers to hand-deliver a letter to Uber\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco, or mail it overnight through a \u201cnationally recognized overnight delivery service.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Uber's shady practices have been the subject of much debate \u2014 and now they could be the subject of a court ruling", "title": "Inside the Uber apocalypse: Why the fast-growing tech giant could be in serious trouble", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Uber's shady practices have been the subject of much debate \u2014 and now they could be the subject of a court ruling", "title": "Inside the Uber apocalypse: Why the fast-growing tech giant could be in serious trouble", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/03/inside_the_uber_apocalypse_why_the_fast_growing_tech_giant_could_be_in_serious_trouble/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/uber_protest.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Uber's shady practices have been the subject of much debate \u2014 and now they could be the subject of a court ruling", "title": "Inside the Uber apocalypse: Why the fast-growing tech giant could be in serious trouble", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/uber_protest.jpg", "creator": "@ddayen", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Dayen", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Labor, tech, The Labor Movement, The Sharing Economy, uber", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If forced to actually follow the law, Uber is just another car service.\nLike so many other companies, Uber included a clause in its standard employment contract, binding driver disputes to an arbitration process.\nBut Uber can handle one driver at a time; a class action incorporating all its drivers would be a fatal blow.\nA non-trivial number of drivers are not happy with being the low-paid cog in the Uber business model, and have sued the company over misclassifying their employment status.\nUber treats its 300,000 drivers as independent contractors, allowing it to avoid granting worker\u2019s compensation, overtime pay and other relevant labor benefits."}
