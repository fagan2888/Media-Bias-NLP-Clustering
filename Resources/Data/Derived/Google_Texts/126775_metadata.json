(Photo: Katarzyna Bialasiewicz, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nA rush of therapists taking advantage of the new state law allowing them to turn away clients who don\u2019t align with the counselors\u2019 \"sincerely held principles\" could undermine access to mental health services guaranteed under federal law.\n\nExperts said a small number of licensed counselors or therapists won\u2019t carry a significant impact. But the controversial new law is raising concerns about whether health insurers will be able to provide access \u2014 particularly in rural areas \u2014 to mental health providers, as required by the Affordable Care Act, if it\u2019s widely used.\n\n\n\nMental health services are required to be covered alongside medical and substance abuse services under the ACA. Health insurers and other industry officials are closely watching how the law plays out.\n\nHealth insurers include anti-discrimination clauses in the network contracts they sign with providers as a way to protect members.\n\nIn fact, the TennCare contract with the managed care organizations that administer the program, as well as the providers and subcontractors, requires companies to \u201cpromote the delivery of services in a culturally competent manner to all enrollees, including those with limited English proficiency, disabilities and diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds regardless of an enrollee's gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity.\u201d\n\nTennCare does \u201cnot anticipate a change to our program based upon this new law because of the expectations and requirements we already have for our providers and MCOs with respect to our enrollees receiving medically necessary covered services,\u201d said Sarah Tanksley, a TennCare spokeswoman.\n\nStill, the legislation signed by Gov. Bill Haslam this week raises questions about how it will impact access.\n\n\u201cYou can expect them to pay a lot of attention to this,\u201d said Keith Dennen, a lawyer at Dickinson Wright.\n\nNetworks \u2014 the web of providers covered under a health insurance plan \u2014 are increasingly a source of contention for the industry as patients grapple with narrowing networks as insurers, and employers who self-insure, try to control costs.\n\nWidespread use of the law could further whittle down the number of mental health providers in the state \u2014 which is already taxed by the number of people seeking care, according to experts.\n\nFederal and state language loosely defines \"network adequacy\" because it depends on the market and the specialty. States have authority from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to set their own standards through 2016, said Kevin Walters, spokesman for the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance. The authority remains in place starting in 2017 contingent upon the state's efforts.\n\nMary Danielson, spokeswoman for BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, said its contracts with providers contain non-discriminatory language but also directs the insurer to follow state and federal laws.\n\n\u201cWe will comply with the law as we do in all instances,\u201d Danielson said, adding there is not \u201can apparent impact on access\u201d for members.\n\nCritics say the law targets the LGBT community, but is crafted in a way as to not single out any specific groups.\n\nThe impact could surface in the future, legal experts said.\n\n\u201cI think it would take some time and data to show that a particular group is being discriminated against for any lawsuit to be successful regarding this law,\u201d said Alex Fisher, an associate at Thompson Burton law firm in Franklin. \u201cI think this is a law that would have to be found discriminatory in practice, rather than on its face.\u201d\n\nIn response to a question about whether the law will restrict mental health resources, Fisher replied with a \u201cresounding yes.\u201d\n\nKatie Sulkowski, a spokeswoman for Cigna in Nashville said the company is \u201ccurrently evaluating the new law and any impact on our operations or contracts.\u201d\n\nThere could be questions of how, or if, an insurer interacts with a provider who chooses not to see people based on sexual orientation or life choices, such as premarital sex.\n\nIt could also bring scrutiny to state and federal language on network adequacy, such as what is \u201caccessible without unreasonable delay,\u201d according to a federal regulation.\n\n\u201cTo determine preemption, you would have to look at whether or not this law prevents the insurers from being able to meet the requirements. It seems like from a practical perspective that the insurers are likely in the best position to argue this law contradicts the ACA,\" said Deborah Farringer, assistant professor of law at Belmont University College of Law.\n\nIf patients and insurers encounter problems with providers, a database \u2014 such as the one run since 2012 by the Secular Therapist Project \u2014 could be important to tracking which providers are accepting referrals in addition to providing a glimpse into regional access, said officials.\n\nIn the last month the Secular Therapist Project has had more applicants than it has had in the last three months combined, said Caleb Lack, director of the Secular Therapist Project. It lists about 270 professionals nationwide with 11 in Tennessee. A search for professionals within 200 miles of Nashville brings up eight professionals.\n\nRight now, the industry is in wait-and-see mode.\n\n\u201cAt this point, insurers probably don\u2019t really know whether patients are going to be turned away,\u201d Farringer said. \u201cIs it a law trying to solve a problem that didn\u2019t exist and thus creating a new problem?\u201d\n\nReach Holly Fletcher at 615-259-8287 or on Twitter @hollyfletcher.\n\nBuy Photo Gov.
