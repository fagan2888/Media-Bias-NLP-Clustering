They resubmitted the claim which was also rejected a few weeks ago.\n\nOn March 3, Aubrey wrote on Facebook that the claim had been denied.\n\nShe wrote: 'I know that our son is only two but his mobility shouldn't be determined by a doctor that works for the insurance company, who has never met him.\n\n'Crue is such an amazing and determined little boy and is capable of a lot more than they think. I don't know where he would be without his little ZipZac chair. That chair has given him his own independence and the ability to explore and learn on his own.\n\n'He's been using that chair for almost two years now (no thanks to the insurance). I just wish that insurance companies would understand that if they gave young disabled children the chance to have mobility at a young age, the difference they'd be making in their lives.\n\n'An able child learns to walk at the age of one so why is it not okay for a young disabled child to learn to use a chair at the age of two?'\n\nCrue, who was born with spina bifida, currently gets around in a $1,100 ZipZac, which is a small wheelchair that is low to the ground and often gets stuck on cracks in the sidewalk (Crue pictured above in his ZipZac wheelchair)\n\nAnthem Blue Cross has said the child's doctor is at fault for not submitting the required documents ahead of the legal deadline.\n\n'Our records reflect that claim was denied because their doctor, despite efforts by Anthem to obtain this information, did not provide necessary documentation before the legal deadline to process a claim expired,' Darrel Ng, spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross told Fox News.\n\nThe insurance company also said the family can appeal the decision that the chair is not necessary for Crue, according to ABC.\n\nThe toddler's parents plan to appeal the decision and keep fighting for their son.\n\nInsurance company, Anthem Blue Cross, said the child's doctor is at fault for submitting the required documents in a timely fashion (above, Crue pictured in February during his routine kidney and bladder check up)\n\nCrue's parents plan to appeal the decision given by the insurance company and will keep fighting for their son (above Crue pictured in January enjoying sled hockey)\n\nAubrey began sharing her son's story on Facebook, which led a close friend of theirs to start a donation page to help raise funds so that Crue could have a new wheelchair.\n\nAs their friend, Chanda Clark Steggell, was only intending to raise $10,000, by Saturday $15,995 had been raised in donations.\n\nNow Crue will also be able to have a standing walker and standing wheelchair.\n\nThe donations will also help with many other of his other medical needs that are incurred on both a weekly and monthly basis.\n\nSince Aubrey shared her son's story on Facebook, which led a close friend to help raise nearly $16,000 by Saturday. Now Crue will get a new wheelchair, as well as a standing walker and a standing wheelchair (above the Facebook post thanking people for generous donations)\n\nAubrey said she gets teary-eyed thinking about all of the donations, and that she along with Joe are determined to show Crue that he can do whatever he wants in life (above Aubrey and Joe)\n\n'This little boy is beyond shocked and so grateful for all the donations he has gotten,' a recent Facebook post said.
