With recent data breaches at Target, Neiman Marcus and other retailers, that concern isn\u2019t likely to decrease any time soon.\n\nHere\u2019s how to handle problems.\n\nData breaches. After a hacking, most retailers and credit card issuers will notify their customers. Take the notification seriously: Last year, one in three consumers who were notified of a data breach became a victim of fraud, says Javelin Strategy & Research, a consulting firm. Companies typically offer fraud monitoring and other services for free to victims of a breach. If you\u2019re offered these services, say yes.\n\nCredit and debit card issuers also monitor users\u2019 habits for patterns so that they can spot potentially fraudulent activity. They\u2019ll often proactively suspend a card after a suspicious purchase until receiving confirmation from the cardholder. While such monitoring can be annoying to some users, it helps to keep fake charges to a minimum.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to monitor your own accounts for unauthorized charges. Set up phone alerts with your card issuer or bank to receive a message for transactions above a certain amount. Some homeowner and renter insurance policies cover card fraud liability. If you\u2019ve suffered a major financial setback due to unauthorized charges, it\u2019s worth a call to your insurance agent to see if you\u2019re covered.\n\nRelated: Your Phone Hasn\u2019t Replaced Your Wallet - Yet\n\nIf you think you\u2019ve been a victim of fraud (or if your cards have been physically lost or stolen), call your card issuer immediately \u2013 most have call centers dedicated to fraud 24/7. You\u2019ll also want to follow up with a written report to the issuer regarding the unauthorized charges. However, your liability depends on the type of plastic used.\n\nCredit cards and charge cards. Credit cards offer the greatest shield against fraudulent or unauthorized charges\u2014a fraudster who goes on a spending spree with your credit card is spending the bank\u2019s money, not yours.\n\nIf your card is lost or stolen, and you report it before the card is used, you\u2019ll have zero liability. If charges are made on the card before you have an opportunity to report them, your losses are legally limited to a maximum of $50. Some providers offer even greater protection: \u201cZero liability\u201d fraud protection is now commonly offered by Visa and MasterCard to calm consumer fears of fraud, though some restrictions may apply.\n\nDebit cards. Since your debit card is connected to your bank account, criminals who get hold of these cards can cause the most damage the most quickly. You may not notice your account has been drained until you have insufficient funds to make a purchase.\n\nIf you notify your bank within two business days, you can\u2019t be held responsible for more than $50 in charges on a debit card. After that, your liability under the law can rise to $500 or more.\n\nMost banks want to keep their customers satisfied and won\u2019t enforce strict time limitations on reports of fraud if they believe you did all you could to avoid and report the loss in a timely fashion. However, if you wait more than 60 days after receiving your statement to make a report, there may not be a limit on your liability.\n\nRelated: Key Takeways from the Target Credit Breach\n\nWith a prompt report of fraud, you can limit your liability, but not the hassle. While the bank investigates the matter, the charges in question can, in some cases, result in a \u201cprovisional\u201d hold for weeks on your account for the amount involved in the dispute. (By contrast, fraudulent charges on a credit card tie up the card issuer\u2019s assets, not yours.)\n\nPrepaid cards. Prepaid cards have become an increasingly popular form of payment. The Pew Research Center says consumers loaded $64.5 billion onto prepaid cards in 2012, up from just $28.6 billion in 2009. The cards are a handy financial tool, allowing direct deposit of wages, cash withdrawals from ATMs, and the convenience of shopping with plastic.\n\nDespite their convenience, though, prepaid cards offer the least protection against fraud (although you\u2019re never liable for more than the dollar amount held on the card). Issuers don\u2019t provide pro-active fraud monitoring, since most cards don\u2019t offer enough user history to find patterns and detect suspicious activity.\n\nWhile all the major prepaid card providers offer some level of liability protection after unauthorized charges, the protection can range widely from one provider to another. If your prepaid card has a Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover network logo, you will likely have enhanced fraud safeguards.\n\nFor example, American Express requires reports of fraud to be received within 60 days of discovery to eliminate cardholder liability. Visa, MasterCard and Discover also waive liability to consumers for cards in \u201cgood standing\u201d as long as cardholders have used \u201creasonable care.\u201d There can be restrictions, though. It\u2019s a good idea to read a prepaid card\u2019s liability policy before purchasing.\n\nPayroll and gift cards are also considered prepaid cards, but again, fraud liability varies. Gift cards have no limit to your liability under federal law. However, if you use a payroll card, fraud security will generally be similar to a debit card.\n\nHal Bundrick is a Certified Financial Planner\u2122 and former financial advisor and senior investment specialist for Wall Street firms.
