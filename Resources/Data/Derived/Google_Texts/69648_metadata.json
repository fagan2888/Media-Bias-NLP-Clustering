He said vouchers provide an alternative to public schools with traditional tax financing.\n\n\u201cWith the option of attending private schools with vouchers, parents see their children moving forward and having positive outcomes. This leads to a brighter and more prosperous future,\u201d Virginia Walden Ford, executive director of D.C. Parents for School Choice Inc., and a visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation, wrote in a 2014 article for The Daily Signal.\n\nCompared with students in traditional public schools, girls and boys enrolled in the voucher program to attend a private school of their choice saw a 75-percent reduction in felony convictions, 56-percent to 78-percent reduction in misdemeanor convictions, and 21-percent to 50-percent reduction in accusations of any crime, the study says.\n\nDeAngelis said the high quality of education available through school choice could be responsible for reducing students\u2019 likelihood of being accused and convicted of crimes.\n\n\u201cA higher quality of education leads to better citizens,\u201d he said, \u201ccitizens who are less likely to commit crimes.\u201d\n\nChoice also offers disadvantaged students autonomy, DeAngelis said:\n\nPeople using this program are from a disadvantaged background. The definition of a disadvantaged background is lower autonomy to choose. By giving students choice, we are giving autonomy to those who most need it, which could explain the decrease in crime.\n\nJim Bender, president of School Choice Wisconsin, cautioned against looking at one \u201cdata point\u201d to justify any education program.\n\n\u201cThere are many different data points and factors that go into education as a success,\u201d he told The Daily Signal in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cThe study\u2019s biggest impact is a robust discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the role of public dollars in education?\u201d\n\nBender said he expects more studies on the same set of Milwaukee students. Planned studies will evaluate the effect of Milwaukee\u2019s school choice program on students\u2019 marriages, childbirth, and public resource use, among other topics, he said.\n\nThe study evaluated 2,178 students, comparing 1,089 students in the voucher program to 1,089 students in traditional public schools in 2006. The two sets of students were matched based on grade, neighborhood, race, gender, English skills, and math and reading test scores.\n\nThe study collected information on criminal activity from the Wisconsin court system by searching for cases using a student\u2019s first name, last name, and date of birth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Milwaukee students enrolled in a voucher program accounted for a 75 percent reduction in felony convictions, a new study says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Milwaukee students enrolled in a voucher program accounted for a 75 percent reduction in felony convictions, a new study says.", "title": "Study: School Choice Students Less Likely to Commit Crime", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160315_SchoolChoiceCrime_Mork.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-22T17:25:48+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RdXm5p"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Milwaukee students enrolled in a voucher program accounted for a 75 percent reduction in felony convictions, a new study says.", "title": "Study: School Choice Students Less Likely to Commit Crime", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160315_SchoolChoiceCrime_Mork.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "school choice", "published_time": "2016-03-22T14:05:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-22T17:25:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "University of Arkansas, School Choice, Vouchers, Crime, Students, Education, Milwaukee, Milwaukee Parental Choice Program"}, "article_summary": "By giving students choice, we are giving autonomy to those who most need it, which could explain the decrease in crime.\nThe study evaluated 2,178 students, comparing 1,089 students in the voucher program to 1,089 students in traditional public schools in 2006.\nJim Bender, president of School Choice Wisconsin, cautioned against looking at one \u201cdata point\u201d to justify any education program.\nPlanned studies will evaluate the effect of Milwaukee\u2019s school choice program on students\u2019 marriages, childbirth, and public resource use, among other topics, he said.\nStudents who participated in a school choice program in Milwaukee were much less likely to face criminal charges or convictions than their counterparts in public schools, according to a new study."}
