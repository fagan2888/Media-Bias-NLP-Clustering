Sarah Palin reads from \"Green Eggs and Ham\" at CPAC on March 8. | M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Palin mocks Obama's 'Yes you can'\n\nNATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2014 Sarah Palin offered a tour of the past year of anti-establishment Republican politics in a speech that stirred activists here on the final day of the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nThe 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee contrasted her current optimism with the feeling last year at the annual gathering last year, when \u201cthere was some reeling going on\u201d because of the 2012 election results.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stronger now, we\u2019re wiser now and God knows we are hungry,\u201d Palin told activists in the conference\u2019s closing speech, which hit crowd-pleasing notes on everything from Benghazi to birth control and also took square aim at Republican leaders in Congress.\n\nThe former Alaska governor spoke to a near-capacity crowd after an introduction from NRA Institute for Legislative Action executive director Chris Cox and a glossy video featuring clips of Palin, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Fox News host Megyn Kelly and the signature roaring bear associated with Palin\u2019s political action committee.\n\n\u201cThat hope and change, it went from a catchy [Obama] campaign slogan to a reality, and along the way, hope and change, \u2018yes we can,\u2019 it became \u2018no you can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Palin said, winding up an Affordable Care Act-NSA-Michelle Obama attack in a speech full of riffs she clearly appeared to be enjoying.\n\n\u201cNo you can\u2019t log onto the website,\u201d she said. \u201cNo you can\u2019t keep your health care. No you can\u2019t make a phone call without Michelle Obama knowing this is the third time this week you\u2019ve dialed Pizza Hut delivery.\u201d\n\nPalin singled out Cruz for his marathon speech on the Senate floor last year during his push to defund Obamacare, when the freshman senator read Dr. Seuss\u2019s \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d to his young daughters watching at home.\n\nPalin brought her own version of the rhyme, crediting a couple lines of it to the Internet.\n\n\u201cI do not like this Uncle Sam,\u201d it began. \u201cI do not like this health care scam. I do not like these dirty crooks or how they lie and cook the books.\u201d\n\nThe crowd devoured it.\n\nIn addition to Cruz, Palin name-checked other congressional Republicans as \u201cgood guys\u201d who need \u201creinforcements\u201d in the 2014 midterms, including Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and House Republicans Trey Gowdy (S.C.), Paul Gosar (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas).\n\nShe said the midterms offered an opportunity make Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) either minority leader or \u201ca blackjack dealer in Vegas.\u201d\n\nBut, she warned existing Republican leadership: \u201cYou know that 2010 election victory that swept you into power? You didn\u2019t build that. The tea party did.\u201d\n\nShe offered repeated nods to the young people in the audience. Organizers said almost half of the attendees who voted in the conference straw poll were between the ages of 18 and 25.\n\n\u201cI love coming back here because there are always so many young people, or as you\u2019re known by the folks across the river, Obamacare suckers,\u201d she said.\n\nSlightly less well-received was a joke about the \u201cchoom gang\u201d \u2014 a dig at President Barack Obama over marijuana \u2014 shortly after conference organizers said their straw poll found three-fifths of attendees favor legalization of marijuana for either recreational or medical use.\n\nPalin also devoted a section of her speech to women in the audience, urging them to resist Democratic entreaties after a year filled with partisan fights over Obamacare\u2019s women\u2019s health care provisions and calls by some in the GOP to retool the party\u2019s message to women.\n\n\u201cWomen, don\u2019t let them use you unless you choose to be their political pawn or just their piece of accessory on their arm,\u201d Palin said. \u201cHoney, that\u2019s not liberation. That\u2019s subjugation, and this sisterhood fights against that.\u201d\n\nShe spoke shortly after the announcement that Paul had won CPAC\u2019s presidential straw poll. Palin took 2 percent of the votes, tied with figures such as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, after she flirted with a run in 2011.\n\nDuring her speech, she responded to a few chants of \u201crun, Sarah, run\u201d from the audience.\n\n\u201cI should,\u201d she quipped. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to run this morning. I was so busy.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "At CPAC, she says Obama's campaign promise has become &quot;no you can't.&quot;", "title": "Palin mocks Obama's 'Yes you can'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/sarah-palin-cpac-2014-104452.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/03/08/140308_sarah_palin_green_eggs2_msm_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Sarah Palin", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "At CPAC, she says Obama's campaign promise has become &quot;no you can't.&quot;", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Palin mocks Obama's 'Yes you can'NATIONAL HARBOR, Md.\nDuring her speech, she responded to a few chants of \u201crun, Sarah, run\u201d from the audience.\nSarah Palin reads from \"Green Eggs and Ham\" at CPAC on March 8.\n\u2014 Sarah Palin offered a tour of the past year of anti-establishment Republican politics in a speech that stirred activists here on the final day of the Conservative Political Action Conference.\nPalin brought her own version of the rhyme, crediting a couple lines of it to the Internet."}
