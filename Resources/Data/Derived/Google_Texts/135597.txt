(Sioux City, IA) “The petitions are signed and bound, so now it is full speed ahead to June 8th,” said Sam Clovis, candidate for the U.S. Senate. “I have traveled across Iowa and looked the voter in the eye. I shook their hands and listened to their concerns about all that is wrong in Washington, DC. They trust me to go to DC and not be swayed by those with deep pockets.

“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again – Washington is broke and broken.” Clovis continued by saying that the Democrat agenda is failing America. “Look at the track record. Cash for Clunkers, Sylondra, and the big one – Obamacare. They have all cost the taxpayers more money out of their pockets and in many cases, their jobs.”
