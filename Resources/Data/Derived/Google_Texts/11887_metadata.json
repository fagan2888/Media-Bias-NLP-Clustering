Maybe you should have looked into that before a guy who has never done anything in his life \u2014 never run a convenience store \u2014 decides he has the awesome super powers to governmentalize one-sixth of the economy. Thanks for finally figuring out that the real world is more complicated than your faculty lounge abstractions. At some point, you know, Americans who voted for this guy \u2014 voted for a guy who has never done anything in his life and has just been wafted onwards to the next do-nothing gig before he was ever required to do anything ought to cringe under the bed in embarrassment for voting for this guy twice.\u201d\n\nHewitt, author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Happiest Life: Seven Gifts, Seven Givers, and the Secret to Genuine Success,\u201d pointed out to Steyn that today\u2019s move could postpone the worst of Obamacare to just before next year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s true. I mean, he keeps using this line, oh he\u2019s \u2018only inflicting catastrophe on fewer than 5 percent of the population,\u201d Steyn said. \u201cThat\u2019s because he unilaterally decided to suspend the employer mandate for a year. Otherwise, a lot of spouses and children, for example just to take the most obvious thing, would be getting kicked off employer-based plans round about now. Now obviously this is unbecoming to a republic, to any kind of theory of responsible government. One of the indictments of George III that you excitable revolutionary colonials made was that he was arbitrarily suspending laws that had been passed and refusing to implement them according to his regal whims. Obama, having wrecked people\u2019s lives by forcing insurance companies to comply with Obamacare, is now ordering them not to comply with Obamacare. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s doable, but if it were doable then this would no longer be a free society.\u201d\n\nHewitt asked Steyn if this sequence of events regarding the Obamacare rollout would lead some people to stop trusting Democrats. According to Steyn, it should be lesson to everyone that passing bills that lawmakers haven\u2019t read is not a good way to legislate.\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "Commentator says Obama\u2019s proposal to have insurance companies not adhere to law is not \u2018doable\u2019 in a free society", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Conservative commentator Mark Steyn says that President Obama's Thursday press conference proposing an Obamacare \"fix\" was underwhelming, and that Obamacare's disastrous rollout stems from the fact th", "title": "Steyn to president for revelations of Obamacare difficulties: \u2018Well, thanks a lot, genius\u2019", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/15/steyn-to-president-for-revelations-of-obamacare-difficulties-well-thanks-a-lot-genius/", "image": {"width": 955, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Steyn1026-e1351226702665.jpg", "height": 410}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Thanks for finally figuring out that the real world is more complicated than your faculty lounge abstractions'", "title": "Steyn to president for revelations of Obamacare difficulties: \u2018Well, thanks a lot, genius\u2019 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/15/steyn-to-president-for-revelations-of-obamacare-difficulties-well-thanks-a-lot-genius/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Steyn1026-e1351226702665.jpg"}, "creator": "@jeff_poor", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-15 08:56:52", "sailthru.title": "Steyn to president for revelations of Obamacare difficulties: 'Well, thanks a lot, genius'", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "hugh-hewitt,mark-steyn,obamacare,jeff-poor", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "hugh hewitt,mark steyn,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Conservative commentator Mark Steyn says that President Obama's Thursday press conference proposing an Obamacare \"fix\" was underwhelming, and that Obamacare's disastrous rollout stems from the fact th", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Steyn1026-e1351226702665.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d8d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think that\u2019s true.\n\u201cWell, thanks a lot genius.\nObama, having wrecked people\u2019s lives by forcing insurance companies to comply with Obamacare, is now ordering them not to comply with Obamacare.\nAccording to Steyn, it should be lesson to everyone that passing bills that lawmakers haven\u2019t read is not a good way to legislate.\nI mean, he keeps using this line, oh he\u2019s \u2018only inflicting catastrophe on fewer than 5 percent of the population,\u201d Steyn said."}
