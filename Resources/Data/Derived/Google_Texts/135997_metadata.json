As Colbert sees it, Marco Rubio is more like Ru-bye-o. Such a segment is a far cry from Colbert previously saying the GOP needs to unite around Rubio.\n\nColbert doesn\u2019t think very highly about any of the last remaining candidates. For as he pointed out, \u201cthey\u2019re like the Beatles, except there are six of them and they\u2019re all Ringo.\u201d\n\nAlso part of the segment was a snuff box, with Colbert doing \u201ca gram of Lindsey Graham,\u201d because \u201cnothing gets my blood pumping like the crushed dreams of failed candidates.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio was referred to not only as \u201cbrave tribute\u201d and a Florida Senator, but \u201cboy whose birthday party your parents made you attend.\u201d\n\nTo much laughter and applause, Colbert countered a line from Rubio in his concession speech that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing more you could have done\u201d with \u201cwell, you could have voted for him, but besides that, no.\u201d He also referenced Rubio\u2019s \u201cstring of third place victories.\u201d\n\nIt was his \u201csecond place defeat in Florida,\u201d which did him in. This is the Florida which \u201cvotes yes on Jimmy Buffett, yes on releasing pythons into toilets, on Marco Rubio, no thanks.\u201d\n\nColbert also commented on Rubio\u2019s support from the establishment, while likening him to Jeb Bush. On that note he asked the audience to \u201cplease clap, please clap, and now.\u201d\n\nAbout Trump moving that much closer to becoming the nominee, Colbert, in a nervous tone, tried to claim everything was still under control.\n\nTowards the end the segment closed with some of Rubio\u2019s insults about Donald Trump. On Rubio\u2019s comment about Trump, \u201cyou know what they say about men with small hands,\u201d Colbert responded with \u201cthey win Florida.\u201d\n\nColbert did close with how Rubio, from District Thirsty, could still get the nomination, because \u201creally, anything\u2019s possible at this point.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Image via screenshot.
