But he is also spending much more time reading the ongoing deluge of rules and regulations coming out of federal agencies that are meant to help guide employers as they adjust their companies\u2019 health benefits under President Obama\u2019s signature health-care law, the Affordable Care Act. Peppe is also spending more time on the road, flying to places such as Peru, Ill.; Jacksonville, Fla.; and the 14 other U.S. cities where the company\u2019s plants are located. There, he meets with workers personally to discuss changes to their health care plans under the new law \u2014 and explain why their premiums will be going up 16 percent next year.\n\n\u201cWe have meetings, we walk them through enrollment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of hand holding. We explain and answer questions because we don\u2019t want people panicking ... They had expectations that somehow their costs were going to go down because of Obamacare. I was there to explain that no, for companies that provide health care, our costs have gone up. Because [Canam] offers coverage, they don\u2019t get a subsidy, and it\u2019ll likely cost more to get government insurance.\u201d\n\nCanam is keeping employer-provided health plans for all of its 2,000 U.S. employees, 300 of whom are in the Washington region. That decision is costing the company $3 million more than if it had opted to pay the $2,000-per-employee penalty instead.\n\n\u201cWe need to stay in the health care game to be competitive,\u201d Peppe said. \u201cSo we sat down and said, \u2018How do we design a plan?\u2019 We made columns for each [Affordable Care Act] mandate and said, \u2018Here\u2019s the added cost.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s health care costs are already up 20 percent compared with a year ago, and half of that jump came from covering new mandates required by the new health-care law, including extending coverage for dependents until age 26, eliminating the lifetime cap on benefits and covering certain wellness programs.\n\nThe extra costs are necessary, Peppe said, because his company competes with other manufacturers and the federal government to hire workers. A competitive benefits package makes a big difference.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this concept in our company that you\u2019re part of the family, that they do want to take care of you,\u201d Peppe said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have unlimited deep pockets. It\u2019s a tough time for the construction industry, but to the extent we could do it, it was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut Canam\u2019s game plan is far from finished. A couple of years down the road, the company may require its workers to buy coverage from new insurance marketplaces that are similar to the public exchanges getting so much attention now, but which are run by private companies. Or it may not. There are simply too many unanswered questions to know what will be the best move for the company in the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can set it and you\u2019re done,\u201d Peppe said. \u201cA lot of the nuances affecting things now isn\u2019t so much what\u2019s in the legislation, it\u2019s what are the agencies doing with it. It\u2019s still pretty unsettled.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s leaving companies with little choice but to wing it, effectively playing a game for which many of the rules have yet to be written. Every week, the Internal Revenue Service, the Labor Department and the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 the federal agencies responsible for issuing the bulk of the ACA-related regulations \u2014 are putting out new rules for what companies should and shouldn\u2019t be doing when implementing the new health-care law. Many regulations have yet to be announced or finalized, including whether employers must provide coverage to seasonal workers or workers whose hours fluctuate from week to week (under the new law, employers must provide coverage for employees who work at least 30 hours a week) \u2014 which could greatly affect cost.\n\nThe details matter. Manufacturing and construction are cyclical, and workers\u2019 schedules vary greatly from the more predictable hours of some professional industries. For now, Canam deemed it enough of a hassle to figure out who qualified and who didn\u2019t that it simply chose to provide coverage to all employees.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of technology [resources] on the HR side, it would all be done by hand,\u201d Peppe said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the money to do it.\u201d\n\nAll of these changes are happening at a time when Peppe, like many of his counterparts, is facing pressure to cut costs. Peppe joined Canam in 1996 and in the years since has seen cutbacks and consolidation in human resources and administrative staff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m spending a lot more time keeping on top of these [health care law] issues because of the volume or regulations and changes in this area,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re getting a lot more pressure in-house to keep reducing cost.\u201d\n\nPeppe, like many in-house lawyers, is closely tracking the development of private marketplaces run by insurance companies. A number of large employers, including Walgreens, Sears Holdings and Darden Restaurants, have already started moving in that direction, giving their employees a set amount of money to shop for coverage on the private exchanges.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk among lawyers and HR people about moving to a model like that,\u201d Peppe said. \u201cWe looked at that, but the private exchanges weren\u2019t developed enough ... I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll reevaluate depending on where costs are going. It depends on how well we\u2019re doing, what other companies are doing. Everyone is playing this game of seeing how others are doing it.\u201d\n\nPrivate exchanges are appealing because they potentially may offer employees more options than the two or three plans a company might offer, said Sarah Bassler Millar, a health care lawyer who leads the employee benefits group at Drinker Biddle & Reath. Sending workers to the private marketplaces also offers companies more certainty about their out-of-pocket cost, because they can give their workers a set amount of money and let them choose the insurance plan that best fits their needs.\n\n\u201cThere is a tremendous amount of pressure on companies to manage expenses, and health-care expenses are becoming an ever-increasing portion of their budget,\u201d Bassler Millar said. \u201cSo they are looking for ways to control cost, ways to ensure that they are mitigating their liabilities. There\u2019s a sense of, \u2018If we contract out some responsibility, potentially we have less liability when things go wrong.\u2019 It\u2019s mostly about cost and managing the bottom line.\u201d\n\nPeppe said Canam would probably not consider moving to the private exchange until 2016 at the earliest, partly because the designing of plans has to take place the previous year for open enrollment.\n\nPlanning for \u201c2014 is already done,\u201d he said. \u201cFor 2015, as soon as we get done with open enrollment after Christmas, we start planning for the next year. I doubt we\u2019ll know enough for 2015. In 2016, there will probably be bigger changes especially with the development of private exchanges.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of it will depend on how insurance companies react,\u201d he said. \u201cEnrollment may not end up being what they want. There\u2019s a lot of talk that young people will say, \u2018The penalty is so low, why buy insurance?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat could upset the economic underpinning of the new health-care law; federal officials are counting on relatively healthy young people to join in order to help spread the costs of treating those needing more care, he said.\n\nUltimately, if companies continue to provide coverage for employees \u2014 either through traditional employer plans, or by sending employees to the private exchanges \u2014 the burden of health care costs will shift onto employees through higher premiums, deductibles, out-of-packet maximums and co-pays, Bassler Millar said.\n\nOver time, many more companies may start dropping health care altogether, sending their workers to the public exchanges.\n\n\u201cThat will develop in waves,\u201d she said. \u201cThe initial movement is going to be in retail and hospitality, where they have a large number of lower-paid hourly workers they don\u2019t consider full-time, but might be considered full-time for purposes of [ACA].\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a seismic change,\u201d Bassler Millar said. \u201cSix months from now, ... you\u2019ll see employers making different types of choices for 2015.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Companies are watching the government, their competitors and private exchanges as they try to calculate their next moves.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1216470", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Companies are watching the government, their competitors and private exchanges as they try to calculate their next moves.", "title": "New health-care law pushing employers to make tough decisions about coverage", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/new-health-care-law-pushing-employers-to-make-tough-decisions-about-coverage/2013/11/27/a0cd8456-4bf4-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/20/Others/Images/2013-11-20/DR2A76561384983188.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@WapoCat"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/new-health-care-law-pushing-employers-to-make-tough-decisions-about-coverage/2013/11/27/a0cd8456-4bf4-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capbizhero, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Ron Peppe, Canam Steel", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1216470"}, "eomportal-uuid": "a0cd8456-4bf4-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "capbizhero, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Ron Peppe, Canam Steel"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02dc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m spending a lot more time keeping on top of these [health care law] issues because of the volume or regulations and changes in this area,\u201d he said.\nI was there to explain that no, for companies that provide health care, our costs have gone up.\nOver time, many more companies may start dropping health care altogether, sending their workers to the public exchanges.\n\u201cWe need to stay in the health care game to be competitive,\u201d Peppe said.\nThere, he meets with workers personally to discuss changes to their health care plans under the new law \u2014 and explain why their premiums will be going up 16 percent next year."}
