Hannity kept harping on the seemingly tragic possibility he might have to pay more in taxes under another Democratic administration.\n\nHANNITY: A lot came up tonight about who pays what. A lot of attacks against corporate America, Wall Street, the top one percent. I have a question for you. Do you know how much the top one percent pays in federal income taxes, what percentage they pay?\n\nThe question stumped Miranda and he tried to deflect, as Hannity looked like the honest broker:\n\nMIRANDA: Well, I tell you what, I don\u2019t think that it was an attack so much as simply how do we keep America moving forward\u2026 HANNITY (interrupting): That\u2019s not my question. What percentage of federal income taxes does that one percent you guys kept talking about pay in federal income tax? Do you know? Do you know? MIRANDA: All our candidates are talking about, is creating a safety net and having an economy that works. HANNITY: We have a safety net.\n\nThe conversation continued that way with Hannity browbeating a defense-playing Miranda. At one point, Hannity even laughed in his face.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. Miranda was a charismatic, seemingly well-informed guest who made a lot of good points. But he should have known that the Hannity show, like most of Fox, is not a serious exploration of anything Democratic. It\u2019s a political Punch and Judy show, where Democrats are always the villains, and the only way to win is to beat the host at his own game.\n\nFor example, when Hannity complained about an increased number of Americans on food stamps, in poverty and unemployed, instead of pointing to George W. Bush's economy, why didn\u2019t Miranda put Hannity on the defensive by asking what Republicans want to do to help the little guy other than repeal ObamaCare, defund Planned Parenthood, deport immigrants and have more guns everywhere? He could have demanded that Hannity explain whether the stock market has not drastically improved as well as unemployment under Obama\u2019s watch and ask what\u2019s wrong with that? Or asked Hannity to explain how his enthusiasm for shutting down the government is going to help the economy?\n\nHannity returned to his own pocketbook concerns: \u201cI pay, as a New York resident, between federal, state, sales, property taxes - 62 cents of every dollar I make goes to government. Am I paying my fair share?\u201d\n\nAgain, Miranda, could have put Hannity on the spot by asking if he\u2019s hurting for money and whether Hannity hasn\u2019t made good money since Obama became president. But Miranda said, \u201cI think, look, I think what we have to do is make sure that we have candidates who are looking at the big picture of our economy,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Lincoln Chaffee did a bit better in a later interview. Hannity started in again about his one percent tax bill. This time, he complained, \u201cThe bottom 50%, what percentage of the federal income tax bill do you think they pay?...They don\u2019t pay any. Zero.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should I work?\u201d Hannity asked. He took money out of his pocket and threw it in the air.\n\nChaffee answered, \u201cYeah, but the point is \u2026the wealthy are still doing just fine. The one percent are doing fine.\u201d\n\nJust how \u201cfine\u201d is Hannity doing? Forbes ranked Hannity as 89th, tied with Leonardo DiCaprio, on its list of the world\u2019s 100 highest paid celebrities, with earnings of $29 million last year. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Hannity is worth $80 million.\n\nBut he wants viewers to think he\u2019s the one struggling while poor people are living on Easy Street. It\u2019s up to Democrats and liberals not to let him get away with it.\n\nWatch the charade below, from the October 13 Hannity.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "+854dtCkVVYDnPv0FEo0WWnAbN+dCnmTEnCIvnYbp4s=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/hannity_obsesses_about_his_tax_money_going_to_those_low_earning_freeloaders_101415", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Hannity Obsesses About His Tax Money Going To Those Low-Earning Freeloaders"}, "Title": "Hannity Obsesses About His Tax Money Going To Those Low-Earning Freeloaders"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1299\"", "article_summary": "What percentage of federal income taxes does that one percent you guys kept talking about pay in federal income tax?\nDo you know how much the top one percent pays in federal income taxes, what percentage they pay?\nThis time, he complained, \u201cThe bottom 50%, what percentage of the federal income tax bill do you think they pay?...They don\u2019t pay any.\nHannity kept harping on the seemingly tragic possibility he might have to pay more in taxes under another Democratic administration.\nAm I paying my fair share?\u201dAgain, Miranda, could have put Hannity on the spot by asking if he\u2019s hurting for money and whether Hannity hasn\u2019t made good money since Obama became president."}
