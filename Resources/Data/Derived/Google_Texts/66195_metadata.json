While the launch was marred by well-publicized glitches that prevented many people from signing up, there has also been little attention paid to some of the dangers lurking in cyberspace as it relates to Obamacare and how some hackers are already finding ways to take advantage of the health insurance mandate.\n\nJust last week, it was revealed that hackers were recently able to gain access to personal information residing on databases maintained by LexisNexis, Dun & Bradstreet and Kroll Background America, which according to Stu Sjouwerman, founder and CEO of IT security awareness training firm KnowBe4, could be used to conduct targeted spear phishing attacks. In these attacks, criminals will spoof an email address pretending to be from a legitimate organization in an attempt to get users to click on a malicious link or unknowingly submit confidential data.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re looking at those health exchanges that allow the bad guys to go for a highly-targeted spear phishing attack that you could essentially automate if you\u2019re looking at large-scale organization,\u201d Sjouwerman explained. \u201cWith their own data mining tools, they can now create a profile of an employee at let\u2019s say, for example, Home Depot. You do a little bit of research on what health insurer Home Depot has, now you can create a highly-targeted spear phishing attack to a few key, often C-level employees, but not necessarily always. You can get in through the mail room as well.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just assume that Home Depot has Aetna as their health insurer, so now the bad guys have the option to identify employees with more than two children and they can craft a spear phishing attack that comes directly to them \u2013 either from spoofed (email addresses within the company) related to their health insurance with a message crafted somewhere to the extent of, \u2018with the new Affordable Healthcare Act, Aetna might not be the best health insurer for people with more than two kids, we recommend you go to this particular health insurance exchange to check out your options.\u2019 They could do this for just a few (employees) or they could do scattershot or shotgun spear phishing and send them to as many email addresses that they can get their hands on.\u201d\n\nDue to the amount of confusion that exists within the populace regarding any type of new initiative like the online healthcare exchanges, Sjouwerman said that cyber criminals will always be waiting to lure in unsuspecting victims. \u201cTo the bad guys this is heaven,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are dozens of scams already preying on people that are confused and want to know more, so it does provide a corporate risk and that\u2019s just one. It\u2019s not hard to come up with five more.\u201d\n\nThere are several social engineering tactics that online criminals like to employ. One of the most popular, according to Sjouwerman is getting a user to avoid a negative consequence and could include emails with subject lines such as \u201cif you don\u2019t sign up for a new healthcare plan you\u2019ll get fined\u201d or \u201cyou need to comply with this new law.\u201d While these types of scare tactics are usually aimed at home users, Sjouwerman said that they have also worked in corporate settings.\n\nAlthough most organizations are aware of the threats posed by cyber crime and are doing the best they can within their existing budgets to fight back, Sjouwerman said that it\u2019s simply not enough anymore.\n\n\u201cI do think, and I\u2019ve been in IT for 34 years and the last 20 in IT security, that the \u2018rule of thumb\u2019 that you spend about six percent of your IT budget in security is going to come back and bite you in the ass. It needs to go up,\u201d he added. \u201cI would posit that most enterprises that currently do just once a year security awareness training \u2013 meaning stick them in the break room, coffee and donuts, death by PowerPoint \u2013 they are no longer scaling their security awareness to a point where it needs to be and it needs to be beefed up.\n\n\u201cSo, point one is reevaluate your fixed six percent for security because it probably needs to be more like 10 or 12. Second, I would strongly recommend that (organizations) start to test their security awareness training. You cannot just train and then leave it be for awhile. These employees need to be tested constantly, so sending all of your employees two or three simulated phishing attacks per month is no luxury. This is something that you need these days.\n\nIn addition, Sjouwerman said that companies need to be aware of the legal consequences of not scaling up their security awareness training, especially in organizations where cyber safeguards are mandated by law. He also recommends designating someone within the company to stay on top of the latest threats.\n\n\u201cMake someone in your organization responsible to think like a hacker and have a continuing flow of alerts related to current events,\u201d he said. \u201cGo to each employee that warns you of scam attempts like this. As an example, a successful social engineering attack was, \u2018the U.S. has started bombing Syria.\u2019 That\u2019s a current event-type thing that everybody is concerned about and that people will click on. Have someone think like a hacker, look at current events and anticipate the kind of attacks to keep an eye out for. It\u2019s not hard to predict and send people regular alerts.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cyber criminals waiting to pounce on unwitting victims", "og": {"site_name": "SecurityInfoWatch.com", "description": "Cyber criminals waiting to pounce on unwitting victims", "title": "Health insurance mandate created by Obamacare could be exploited by hackers in spear phishing attacks", "url": "http://www.securityinfowatch.com/article/11186783/health-insurance-mandate-created-by-obamacare-could-be-exploited-by-hackers-in-spear-phishing-attacks", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://r2.securityinfowatch.com/files/base/image/SIW/2013/10/16x9/1280x720/healthcare-gov-website_11186806.jpg", "height": 720}, "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 153689364727873}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "keywords": "Safety, Best practices, Regulations, Executives, Corporate Security, IT Security, ObamaCare, Affordable Care Act, Information Security, Security Executives", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddefb\"", "article_summary": "Second, I would strongly recommend that (organizations) start to test their security awareness training.\nThese employees need to be tested constantly, so sending all of your employees two or three simulated phishing attacks per month is no luxury.\n\u201cNow you\u2019re looking at those health exchanges that allow the bad guys to go for a highly-targeted spear phishing attack that you could essentially automate if you\u2019re looking at large-scale organization,\u201d Sjouwerman explained.\nYou do a little bit of research on what health insurer Home Depot has, now you can create a highly-targeted spear phishing attack to a few key, often C-level employees, but not necessarily always.\nHave someone think like a hacker, look at current events and anticipate the kind of attacks to keep an eye out for."}
