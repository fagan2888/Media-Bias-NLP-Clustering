In 2014, 17.1% of consumers did not have insurance and the rate declined by 4.2 percentage points since the ACA's requirement for Americans to have health insurance went into effect one year ago.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services reported that 6.5 million Americans either selected new plans or were automatically re-enrolled into a plan via HealthCare.gov as of Dec. 26, 2014. Before open enrollment began last November, Gallup found in its survey that more than half of those who were uninsured were planning to purchase a plan. Most people who were newly insured also planned either to renew their current policy or purchase another one.\n\nThe ACA requires that no one can be declined health care coverage because of his past medical history.\n\n\u201cOn the positive side, it\u2019s a lot easier for people to get coverage now,\u201d said Carrie McLean, director of customer care at eHealth.com, an online health insurance exchange based in Mountain View, Calif. \u201cThe quality of coverage is also better with many preventive services available at no out-of-pocket costs.
