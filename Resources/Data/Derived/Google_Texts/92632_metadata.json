For items such as craft beer, which are not made in house, calorie information from the brewery must be shipped to the restaurant.\n\n\u201cBrewers are facing the prospect of spending potentially thousands to determine calorie counts for every variety of beer produced,\u201d explains the article. \u201cUnless they spend the money to provide the information, breweries may never get their products into chain restaurants.\u201d\n\nSmaller brewers will be more affected by the regulations since they have to decide whether producing the beer is worth the cost of complying with the rules.\n\n\u201cA regional craft brewer or a major brewery can spread the cost over a much larger volume of sales and it\u2019s not so unreasonable for them,\u201d said Paul Gatza, a former brewer. \u201cSmaller guys that are just trying to sell a keg or two here or there, they have a decision to make on whether it is worth the additional cost to try to get their beers into chain restaurants.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Cato Institute, the regulations will cost between $49,000 and $77,000 for each business to comply. For what it costs to update the menus, businesses could afford to hire two to three employees.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for brewers to test every variety of beer they make, spending many thousands of dollars before they even made it onto a chain restaurant\u2019s menu,\u201d explains Michelle Minton, a fellow with the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cRestaurants interested in carrying a craft beer may not want to wait for testing to be done and will move on to beers that already have nutritional information,\u201d she says. \u201cThat means that many craft brewers will miss out on an important opportunity to grow their business.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Obamacare regulations requiring that restaurants post calorie information on menus will make it harder and costlier for breweries making craft beer to comply with the new rules, Watchdog.org reported.", "title": "Obamacare Regulations Target Breweries Making Craft Beer", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/obamacare-regulations-target-breweries-making-craft-beer/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Beer-AP-150x150.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare regulations requiring that restaurants post calorie information on menus will make it hard", "creator": "@DJAliMeyer", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Beer-AP-150x150.png", "title": "Obamacare Regulations Target Breweries Making Craft Beer", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @DJAliMeyerObamacare regulations requiring that restaurants post calorie information on menus will make it harder and costlier for breweries making craft beer to comply with the new rules, Watchdog.org reported.\nFor items such as craft beer, which are not made in house, calorie information from the brewery must be shipped to the restaurant.\n\u201cThat means that many craft brewers will miss out on an important opportunity to grow their business.\u201d\n\u201cRestaurants interested in carrying a craft beer may not want to wait for testing to be done and will move on to beers that already have nutritional information,\u201d she says.\nRegulations taking effect next year will require that restaurant chains with more than 20 locations nationwide such as Buffalo Wild Wings and Applebee\u2019s post calorie information on all of their menus."}
