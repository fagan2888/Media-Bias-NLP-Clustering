In this case, it\u0092s the Congressman, dressed informally, along with two of his staff members, sitting down on the back deck of Chitiva\u0092s Stockton waterfront restaurant to get input from a small group of Delta folks and find ways to promote recreation in the Delta.\n\nThat was the agenda. But Rep. Jerry McNerney, D-Stockton, soon found that anger over the governor\u0092s crusade to build massive water tunnels to siphon off fresh water from the Delta was the overriding concern.\n\nThe governor as recently as Friday, in an interview with the San Jose Mercury News, repeated his goal to build his $67 billion project to send fresh water to customers of the State Water Project and the federal Central Valley Project.\n\n\"Brown, meeting with this newspaper's editorial board, also said he plans to proceed with his twin-tunnel plan for the Delta whether or not the public votes on it,\" the newspaper reported.\n\nThe tunnel scheme is at the heart of the so-called Bay Delta Conservation Plan, which is currently in the review stage of its draft environmental impact report and statement. Voters will have no say in the project.\n\nThe Congressman got an ear full and then some.\n\nLeslie Flint, operations manager of the downtown Stockton Marina, told him that because of the moving of barge-based construction equipment into Antioch, a long-time yacht club there is being told to move. She is negotiating with the club to move to the Stockton City Marina and hopes to get the answer soon. \u0093I didn\u0092t know they (BDCP) were already moving stuff into Antioch,\u0094 said Mr. McNerney. \u0093I\u0092ll have to check on that.\u0094\n\nVortex Marine Construction Inc. of Oakland is moving some or all of its barge operations now in Alameda to Antioch, according to David Dial, the commodore of the Ebony Boat Club, which has been told to vacate its facilities to make way for Vortex, in an interview Sunday.\n\nHe also provided a letter dated Jan. 2, 2014 from Blaise Fettig, Marterm Holdings LLC, saying, \u0093As you may be aware, ownership of this facility has changed as of December 31, 2013. The long-term use of the property wil be to create a corporate yard for a large tenant. However, until certain permits and construction has been put in place, we will do our best to accommodate our existing tenants. Furthermmore, we hope to be able to communicate our transition schedule in such a way as to allow you adequate time to plan for our transition.\"\n\nVortex Marine, a marine construction firm, describes itself on its website as \u0093a full service marine contractor owning and operating one of the largest fleets of floating construction equipment in the Western United States.\u0094\n\nThe company, it states, specializes in marine and heavy civil construction projects with an emphasis on turn-key marine facilities.\n\nMuch of the BDCP\u0092s construction will involve construction barges. Vortex could not be immediately reached for comment before CVBT's publishing deadline Sunday evening.\n\nBarbara Daly, partner in Delta Heartbeat Tours, a Delta bus land tour business, as well as an activist and Clarksburg resident whose home overlooks one of the planned twin tunnel intake locations on the Sacramento River, told Mr. McNerney that the state Department of Water Resources and other responsible agencies have not been maintaining the levees the past three years in her Clarksburg area.\n\n\u0093They used to be out there with riprap and barges, strengthening them,\u0094 said Mrs. Daly. \u0093Now there are trees dying on the levees. They are butchering the trees. With a strong wind, they would be pulled out of the levee during the winter.\u0094\n\nFear of levy failure is one of the arguments put forth by proponents of the tunnels.\n\nMrs. Daly said a letter was sent to the Delta Protection Commission from Jerry Meral, once the leader of the BDCP movement and who is now director of a group dubbed the \u0093Natural Heritage Committee.\u0094\n\n\u0093He recommended to the Delta Protection Commission that in their flood protecting policy that they say, as levees are breached, landowners must pay to have the breach fixed. If they can\u0092t and don\u0092t, then their property would revert to the state,\u0094 said Mrs. Daly.\n\nJason Flesher, the market manager for Sierra market outdoor programs and outreach for Seattle, Wash.-based Recreational Equipment, Inc., asked Mrs. Daly, \u0093Do you think it is because of financial reasons or are there other reasons?\u0094\n\n\u0093I\u0092ve followed this for quite awhile,\u0094 Mrs. Daly said. \u0093At very early BDCP outreach meetings, I stood up and made public comments because I live right behind a levee. As levees are breached, they will be decided on a case-by-case basis.\u0094\n\n\u0093Who is \u0091they\u0092?\u0094 pressed Mr. McNerney.\n\n\u0093The Delta Stewardship Council, the BDCP, DWR \u0097 all of the people who control our water rights,\u0094 Mrs. Daly replied. \u0093This is very, very concerning. The levees are in bad shape because they haven\u0092t been maintained.\u0094\n\nBill Schmicker, a partner in Pegasus Group of Walnut Creek that owns the 700-slip Village West Marina on Benjamin Holt Drive in north Stockton, said that if the twin tunnels are built and that causes saltwater intrusion to come to his marina, it would put the marina out of business, \u0093because our marina is built to be in fresh water. Its lifetime in salt water is much, much shorter.\u0094\n\nWhile Mr. Schmicker said he was not aware of other immediate impacts to his marina during construction, the BDCP proposal would turn Mildred Island, an interior, flooded lake just off Empire Cut and Middle River, a favorite anchor-out destination of big boaters at Village West Marina, into a 24/7 construction site with bright lights at night and pile driving equipment pounding away.\n\nEven Mandeville Island off the Stockton Deep Water Channel, the traditional 4th of July fireworks area for boaters by the Hilton house landmark, is another proposed construction site. That annual event draws hundreds of boaters every year.\n\nBill Wells, executive director of the Delta Chambers of Commerce, told the Congressman that Mark Cowin, director of the DWR, has gone on record several times saying they will take an extra 800,000 acre feet of water a year out of the Delta.\n\n\u0093The tunnels have a capacity of about 240,000 cubic feet per second so they can literally drain the watershed of California but they say, \u0091Don\u0092t worry, you can trust us. We\u0092re not going to do it,\u0092\u0094 Mr. Wells said. \u0093I\u0092ve never found anything where I can trust them.\u0094\n\n\u0093Do you have a way to estimate the dollar impact?\u0094 asked Congressman McNerney.\n\n\u0093I don\u0092t have a dollar amount but it will be devastating,\u0094 said Mr. Wells. \u0093The little marinas will be completely wiped out. On the Sacramento River there will be a five-mile zone so that will severely impact boat traffic. I think the rivers will be so shallow that the Sacramento Yacht Club and the Sacramento Marina will find it absolutely devastating.\u0094\n\nHe said it will devastate the region\u0092s recreation economy.\n\n\u0093Everyone\u0092s dependent on recreation,\u0094 Mr. Wells said. \u0093I buy gas for my cars and boat. It will impact grocery stores, and other businesses.\u0094\n\n\u0093Any feel for how the habitat restoration is going to effect our local communities?\u0094 asked Mr. McNerney.\n\nMrs. Daly said the BDCP says tunnel construction \u0093Alternative 4,\u0094 that starts at Clarksburg, Hood and Courtland, sucks out 9,000 cubic feet per second of fresh water from the Sacramento River before it can flow into the Delta.\n\n\u0093Alternative 9,\u0094 that goes from Walnut Grove, would take 15,000 cubic feet of water per second, she said.\n\n\u0093What they didn\u0092t say,\u0094 she continued, \u0093is the Central Valley Project\u0092s choice is Alternative 9.\u0094\n\nIf that is the final choice for the governor\u0092s tunnels, then, she said, the water will stop pretty much between Freeport and Clarksburg and down to where the Deep Water Channel is located.\n\n\u0093Also in the Implementing Agreement they talk about conservation and restoration areas. They\u0092ve taken the whole Primary Zone and divided it up into about 11 areas,\u0094 said Mrs. Daly. \u0093They\u0092ve got the Delta Conservancy working on the different areas. The Delta Conservancy plans on putting them in and making them reserves and the Department of Fish & Game in charge of them. If they can\u0092t decide on how to use the water and mandate these preserves, then they will go to another step. But they talk about human settlements, just like Africa, in the Delta. That will take farmland out of production and eliminate 140,000 acres of prime farmland (plus about 20,000 acres in Yolo County). Sacramento County will be devastated.\u0094\n\nMr. Wells added that there is a huge concern about mosquitoes. He reminded the congressman how people are already dying from West Nile virus and he knows several people who have been severely disabled \u0097 including one judge in Stockton.\n\n\u0093The tunnels will add a lot of stress to the local communities,\u0094 said Mr. McNerney. \u0093The pumping of the water is almost a separate issue. Where will they put in all this plumbing to move the water? We know we have a couple of avenues here. We don\u0092t want the tunnels because of all the damage locally and problems it will cause. And it\u0092s expensive. We also have to protect ourselves from misuse of the current pumping facilities.\u0094\n\nMr. Wells said back when Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was in office, \u0093We were shown invasive species and algae growing and they said it was caused by low flows. It\u0092s gotten worse since then.\u0094\n\nHe also said that under the current governor, what had been a successful and popular California Department of Boating and Waterways, has been downgraded to a division, squeezed into the Parks & Recreation Department.\n\n\u0093Now if you call their hotline, no one answers their phone or return calls,\u0094 said Mr. Wells. \u0093To me it\u0092s an out and out assault on everyone in the Delta.\u0094 Then Mr. Wells told how the DWR and other state agencies dealing with the waterways began issuing maps of the Delta that didn\u0092t show any roads or infrastructure. \u0093It seems to be a conscious effort to do whatever they can to drive us out of the Delta,\u0094 said Mr. Wells.\n\n\u0093Any other issues not related to the BDCP?\u0094 asked Mr. McNerney, which got a chuckle.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s not as much fun to talk about as BDCP,\u0094 said Mr. Schmicker, \u0093but signage on the Interstate freeway that says there is a marina is important. We have one sign for Village West Marina now when you\u0092re heading north to turn off at Benjamin West off ramp. This is the only one in Stockton and there are three marinas at three freeway exits in town. We worked for five years to get our sign. The process is unbelievable.\u0094\n\nMr. Schmicker said that in 2005 there were 964,000 registered boats in California, with that figure sinking to 775,000 following the Great Recession. It grew to 819,000 registered boats in California last year.\n\nMr. Flesher said it\u0092s important in moving ahead not to forget the muscle power of recreation. He said in California alone, there is $85.4 billion in consumer spending for recreation, 732,000 jobs, and over $27 billion in wages and salaries, and $6.7 billion in state and local tax revenues.\n\nThen he really got everyone\u0092s attention when he said that REI gives millions of dollars away in grants and donations for programs that promote recreation.\n\n\u0093We know people are very vocal and giving to protect their recreation areas,\u0094 said Mr. Flesher. He said that REI runs many wildlife and kayak tours and other recreational activities in the Delta, as well as the rivers that feed it. \u0093There is an endless wait list from people coming from the Bay Area, San Diego, Los Angeles and Southern California who want to see the bird migrations here and they spend money.\u0094\n\nTulare Lake Basin suggested as a new reservoir\n\nMrs. Daly told the congressman that the Tulare Lake Basin should be restored to the fresh water lake it used to be before farmers drained it dry in the early 1900s.\n\nIt was the largest fresh water body of water west of the Mississippi until then.\n\n\u0093It could be storage,\u0094 said Mrs. Daly. \u0093I have the original 1912-1913 legislation that declared it a hydrologic water region for California. The BDCP and DWR don\u0092t want to talk about that.\u0094\n\nIn conclusion, Mr. McNerney said the Delta is an important issue. \u0093There\u0092s a lot of different things happening and moving parts like the bond measure for investing in the state water infrastructure that\u0092s needed. But I think there are a few folks who are concerned \u0097 myself included \u0097 about whether that will open up the opportunity for mischief in regard to the tunnels or doing away with the governance that gives us the marginal protection that we already have in the Delta.\n\n\u0093Some folks would like to overturn that and just allow maximum pumping of fresh water. I\u0092m not sure how the tunnels would affect each one of us. With the habitat in general, we want to make sure that doesn\u0092t happen, because it has the potential to really alter the character of the Delta.\u0094\n\nVideo info follows here:\n\nRep.
