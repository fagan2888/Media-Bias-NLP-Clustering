Come for the politics, stay for the complete lack of patience for the B.S. and bad faith coming from conservative leaders and pundits.\n\nDr. Oz keeps feeling more heat over his show where he routinely pushes snake oil on an audience that understandably believes that they\u2019re getting responsible health education, because, after all, Dr. Oz is a surgeon and a professor at Columbia University. Now a group of influential doctors has written a letter to Columbia, asking them to drop Dr. Oz on the grounds that he\u2019s a quack and a charlatan\u2014not in his surgery work, but when he is pushing weight loss supplements and other \u201calt medicine\u201d horseshit on his show. From the letter:\n\nAs described here and here, as well as in other publications, Dr. Oz has repeatedly shown disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine, as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops. Worst of all, he has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain.\n\nDr. Oz is responding, though generically to \u201ccritics\u201d, on Thursday\u2019s episode, but a clip has already been released. If you had any hope he would show any sign of intellectual honesty in his response, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you. He\u2019s pulling the Freeze Peach card.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve irritated some potential allies in our quest to make America healthy,\u201d he says, as if his critics are opposed to health, when in fact they are trying to protect people\u2019s health against his quack faux medicine. \u201cNo matter our disagreements, freedom of speech is the most fundamental right we have as Americans. And these 10 doctors are trying to silence that right.\u201d\n\nThe martyrdom conclusion: \u201cSo I vow to you right here and right now: we will not be silenced, we will not give in.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, having free speech rights does not guarantee you either a TV show or a professorship at Columbia University. The issue here is straightforward one, of basic medical ethics. Dr. Oz gets people to trust and listen to him because of his position as a doctor at an elite institution. He violates their trust by telling them things he knows are not true, especially on issues that are as sensitive as weight loss. As Julia Belluz at Vox explained:\n\nOz\u2019s dubious medical advice wouldn\u2019t be such a problem if people saw the show as merely entertainment \u2014 if they simply watched the show but didn\u2019t take its claims to heart. But it\u2019s clear viewers really do heed his advice. There\u2019s the case of a man who followed Oz\u2019s suggestion of curing insomnia by pouring uncooked rice into socks, heating them in a microwave, and wearing them to bed. The man got second- and third-degree burns on his feet. He sued, but the case was thrown out because the judge determined that Oz cannot establish a physician-patient relationship through TV. Not everyone agrees with the judge\u2019s reasoning. Rochester New York medical student and blogger Benjamin Mazer has been publishinganonymous stories sent into him from health professionals about the impact Oz has had on patient care. One reported that her dad had a heart attack and five stents placed in his heart, which required him to take aspirin and Plavix to prevent blood clots. \u201cHe was watching Dr. Oz, who said Plavix was not necessary, so he stopped taking it. About a month later, he had another massive [heart attack] and coded and had to be shocked back to life.\u201d She continued: \u201cMy dad admitted to following Dr. Oz\u2019s advice and not asking his own cardiologist.\u201d There\u2019s also the powerful \u201cOz effect,\u201d which has worked on everything from raspberry ketone supplements to neti pots. This suggests that people act on Oz\u2019s health advice as if he were their own doctor, for better or worse. (While Oz has been careful to point out repeatedly that he does not \u201cdirectly\u201d endorse any company or product, he is available for strategic partnerships, according to the Oz Media website: \u201cOur goal is for Dr. Oz to forge a direct and authentic connection between you and your demographic.\u201d)\n\nAgain, this is not their fault. He is a professor at Columbia Medical School. If he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, who can you trust? This problem is only compounded by the fact that a lot of Americans don\u2019t have really good access to medical care. They may have crappy insurance or no insurance at all, and while Obamacare has helped in that area, it\u2019s not a cure-all. But even if you do have health insurance, visiting your doctor isn\u2019t exactly a great experience. Doctors are under immense amounts of pressure to keep visits to 15 minutes or less. Dr. Oz\u2019s show, in contrast, is like an hour a day every day. Of course people are going to start listening to him.\n\nBut it\u2019s the weight loss thing that really gets me. A lot of Americans want to lose weight, but losing weight is extremely hard and keeping it off is nearly impossible. That makes them extremely vulnerable to people claiming they have a shortcut or easy way out through this supplement or that, and having Dr. Oz put his medical imprimatur on these claims just makes it that much worse. And this is not harmless in the slightest, especially if people taking supplements think that it means they can increase their calorie consumption or reduce their exercise because the pill is doing the work for them. I realize that there\u2019s always a \u201cbe sure to eat right and exercise\u201d claim attached to these pills, but let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s hard to hear when you\u2019re hearing about this \u201cmiracle\u201d herb that will supposedly speed up your metabolism. That sounds an awful lot like exercise in a pill, and so of course people will think that\u2019s what you\u2019re selling.\n\nSo yeah, Dr. Oz is an asshole. This confirms it. No one is telling you that you don\u2019t have free speech, but if you want to call yourself a doctor, you should act like one.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_65475376-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Dr. Oz mistakes demands for professionalism for attacks on free speech"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Dr. Oz is responding, though generically to \u201ccritics\u201d, on Thursday\u2019s episode, but a clip has already been released.\n\u201cHe was watching Dr. Oz, who said Plavix was not necessary, so he stopped taking it.\nDr. Oz gets people to trust and listen to him because of his position as a doctor at an elite institution.\nSo yeah, Dr. Oz is an asshole.\nDr. Oz\u2019s show, in contrast, is like an hour a day every day."}
