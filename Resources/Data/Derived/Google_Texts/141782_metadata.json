They go for their self-interest, their tax breaks, their liability escapes (think Wall Street). Meanwhile, they\u2019ve relentlessly instructed the non-rich that they too must vote for the rich.\n\nThey\u2019ve promised for decades that if the 99 percent just comply with the wishes of the wealthy, bow down, kiss their feet, shine their shoes, then some paltry portion of the bucket-loads of dough that the rich are amassing will dribble down upon the 99 percent.\n\nThat trickle-down trick didn\u2019t work for the vast majority of Americans. The rich got richer, all right. But the rest slid backwards. Now income inequality is worse than it was during the era of robber barons. It\u2019s time to turn that around. Political leaders must focus on the needs of the 99 percent. For that to happen, the 99 percent must vote for themselves on Tuesday. They must go for their self-interest, their wages, their health insurance, their Social Security.\n\nVote for higher wages for the 99 percent.\n\nMinimum wage workers in the United States are paid so little that taxpayers subsidize the likes of Walmart and Wendy\u2019s through government programs such as food stamps and Medicaid. That doesn\u2019t happen everywhere.\n\nAs the New York Times pointed out last week, McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and Starbucks all pay their workers in Denmark at least $20 an hour and provide paid vacations and pensions. And the companies still make profits.\n\nThe one percenter CEOs of these companies, who demand millions in pay for themselves, have squashed efforts to raise the U.S minimum wage, a pittance stuck five years at $7.25. Instead of improving paychecks, McDonald\u2019s told its workers to get second jobs, forego heat in their homes and find health insurance for $20 a month.\n\nWhen the minimum wage rises, it bumps up pay for everyone else. The 99 percent benefit. And the majority supports lifting the wage.\n\nVoting for raises means voting for Democrats. President Obama has called for an increase, and U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez said the U.S. minimum wage is an international embarrassment. \u201cI mean, we suck. We really do,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans have consistently blocked a raise. New Jersey\u2019s GOP Gov. Chris Christie, the nation\u2019s fourth highest paid governor at $175,000 a year, said last month that he is \u201ctired of hearing about the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nVote for health insurance for the 99 percent.\n\nThe majority of Americans believe that health insurance should be accessible to everyone. The Affordable Care Act moved the nation closer to that, enabling tens of millions to get covered.\n\nIt prevented insurers from dumping clients when they get sick and from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, like diabetes. It covered millions of young people to age 26 on their parents\u2019 plans. It protected millions with an expansion of Medicaid.\n\nNational surveys have shown that low-income Americans are obtaining health insurance at a faster rate than the rich. There are two reasons for this. The rich already were covered. And the law was designed to help the working poor. This is creating fairness in access to medical care.\n\nRepublicans hate the law. Two dozen GOP governors refused to expand Medicaid in their states, and those places now suffer from the highest rate of uninsured residents. Republicans are so intent on denying health care to the working poor that they rejected a program that would cost them nothing for three years.\n\nNow, Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, has again pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act if the GOP takes control of his chamber. Republicans want to regress to higher inequality in health insurance coverage.\n\nVote to preserve and expand Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThese programs are not priorities of the rich. The wealthy are riding high on golden parachutes, gilded pensions, tax-sheltered off-shore accounts, and the built-in security of immense salaries. Social Security wouldn\u2019t pay their country club fees.\n\nFor the rest, however, Social Security and Medicare mean fear relief. They\u2019re crucial to the 99 percent.\n\nFor years now, however, Republicans have tried to privatize, cut and destroy these programs. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, repeatedly has issued a \u201croadmap\u201d for an America in which the rich drive new Ferraris bought with tax breaks and the rest forfeit their wheels because of cuts to Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Americans oppose cuts. Among Democrats, there\u2019s a movement to increase benefits by lifting the $117,000 cap, after which income no longer is taxed for Social Security. The cap means that the rich pay proportionately less into Social Security than the rest.\n\nVote for the overwhelming majority, the non-rich, to get their needs met.\n\nThe nation\u2019s richest are more politically engaged and get easier access to high-level politicians than the 99 percent. That isn\u2019t just obvious. It\u2019s also according to surveys and interviews of one-percenters conducted by three university professors. They are Northwestern University\u2019s Benjamin I. Page and Jason Seawright and Vanderbilt\u2019s Larry M. Bartels. Their report is called Democracy and the Policy Preferences of Wealthy Americans.\n\nThe rich minority gets its way. Bartels and another researcher showed in earlier studies that federal government policy corresponds much more closely with the wishes of the rich than the needs of the rest.\n\nBartels, author of Unequal Democracy: The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age, has noted that no other rich country came close to the United States in cutting the budget based on class preferences. It went this way: the workers lost programs; the wealthy kept perks.\n\nThis has got to change. And it could. In states with low voter turnout inequality \u2013 that is balloting by the non-rich more closely matching participation rates by the wealthy \u2013 there are higher minimum wages, stricter anti-predatory lending laws and better health benefits for the working poor. In other words, when workers vote, they\u2019re more likely to get what they want from politicians.\n\nVote for yourself on Tuesday.\n\nFollow Leo W.
