More specifically, the methane-laden burps and farts that, combined with the \u201cemissions\u201d of other ruminants, contribute an estimated 4 percent of the world\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions. Here\u2019s the pitch:\n\nRuminants all have lots of microscopic organisms living in their digestive tract that help them digest cellulose\u2014a component of the cell wall of green plants. It\u2019s a huge boon for these animals, giving them the ability to get energy from pretty much any plant that grows on Earth. Cows can\u2019t digest grass without these microorganisms. The catch is that when the organisms digest the cellulose, they create carbon dioxide and methane gas, which the host animal has to get rid of. All ruminants excrete methane, but cows are by far the most prolific emitters.\n\n\u2026Enter DSM, a former state coal mining company that has undergone an unlikely evolution into a global material and life-sciences conglomerate with operations on five continents and annual revenues of 9.1 billion euros ($12.43 billion). The company directly employs a number of scientists who work alongside DSM-funded academic researchers such as [Karen]mBeauchemin to solve the cow dilemma. And they think they\u2019ve done it.\n\nThe team now has a powder that cows can eat with their daily feed. \u201cIt interferes with the animal\u2019s biological mechanisms,\u201d Beauchemin says. \u201cThat stops the microorganisms in the animal\u2019s stomach from doing what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn trials we\u2019ve managed to reduce methane emissions by up to 60 percent,\u201d says Petra Simic, a biochemist who directs DSM\u2019s cow-methane efforts. \u201cWe have solid proof of concept that our compound does what it\u2019s supposed to do. What we\u2019re working on now is figuring out the best way of mixing it into the cow\u2019s feed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An international team of scientists says it's managed to reduce methane emissions from cattle by 60 perecent", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "An international team of scientists says it's managed to reduce methane emissions from cattle by 60 perecent", "title": "Fart-reducing supplement could reduce cows\u2019 contribution to climate change", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/09/fart_reducing_supplement_could_reduce_cows_contribution_to_climate_change/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_102794705.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An international team of scientists says it's managed to reduce methane emissions from cattle by 60 perecent", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_102794705.jpg", "title": "Fart-reducing supplement could reduce cows\u2019 contribution to climate change", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Fart-reducing supplement could reduce cows\u2019 contribution to climate change", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Climate Change, cows, greenhouse-gas emissions, Methane", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb35\"", "article_summary": "While most of the world\u2019s attention is focused on the push to reduce fossil fuels\u2019 contribution to climate change, Newsweek reports, an international team of scientists has focused its efforts on a different source of greenhouse gases: cows.\nAll ruminants excrete methane, but cows are by far the most prolific emitters.\nWhat we\u2019re working on now is figuring out the best way of mixing it into the cow\u2019s feed.\u201d\n\u201cThat stops the microorganisms in the animal\u2019s stomach from doing what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\u201cIn trials we\u2019ve managed to reduce methane emissions by up to 60 percent,\u201d says Petra Simic, a biochemist who directs DSM\u2019s cow-methane efforts.\nCows can\u2019t digest grass without these microorganisms."}
