Reuters\n\nLas Vegas resident Evonne Derrico, 33, successfully delivered quintuplets last Friday between 11:17 and 11:21 a.m. at Banner Desert Medical Center in Arizona. Evonne and her husband Deon are already parents to a 7-year-old daughter, a 3-year-old son, and a set of 1-year-old twin boys.\n\n\u201cWe are all doing great. Excited is an understatement,\u201d the happy father told the Las Vegas Sun. \u201cWe have a vehicle for the family right now, but we don\u2019t have a vehicle for the five others. There\u2019s just so much to figure out.\u201d\n\nEvonne was pregnant for 32 weeks and two days, a month longer than the national average for quintuplets, the Associated Press reported. Back in March, doctors told the couple to expect quadruplets; however, two days later, they found out about a fifth child in the womb.\n\nIn accord with a family tradition, all of the newborns were given names starting with the letter \u201cD,\u201d including Deniko, Dariz, Deonee, Daician, and Daiten. The children\u2019s weight ranged from 1 lb. 14 oz. to 2 lbs. 15 oz.\n\nThe Derrico quintuplets are expected to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit at Cardon Children\u2019s Medical Center for several weeks so doctors can effectively monitor their health. The family that temporarily relocated to Arizona to receive care from perinatologist and multiple birth specialist Dr. John Elliot will move back to Las Vegas after the children are cleared by doctors.\n\nThis past May, Fernando and Guillermina Garcia from Utah welcomed their quintuplets at University Hospital in Salt Lake City. Esmeralda, Fatima, Marissa, Jordan, and Fernando Garcia were all delivered via Cesarean section in a span of two minutes. Unlike the Derrico family, the Garcia family required the assistance of fertility drugs to become pregnant.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "evonne, deon, derrico, quintuplets", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Derrico family from Las Vegas welcomed three girls and two boys in less than five minutes last Friday.", "title": "Woman Delivers Quintuplets; Las Vegas Family Grows To 11", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/evonne-derrico-delivers-quintuplets-arizona-hospital-las-vegas-family-grows-11-256448", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/derrico-quintuplets.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Derrico family from Las Vegas welcomed three girls and two boys in less than five minutes last Friday.", "title": "Woman Delivers Quintuplets; Las Vegas Family Grows To 11", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/evonne-derrico-delivers-quintuplets-arizona-hospital-las-vegas-family-grows-11-256448", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/derrico-quintuplets.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/derrico-quintuplets.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-11T16:29:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-25T11:22:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Derrico family from Las Vegas welcomed three girls and two boys in less than five minutes last Friday."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf4cf\"", "article_summary": "Unlike the Derrico family, the Garcia family required the assistance of fertility drugs to become pregnant.\nThe Derrico family from Las Vegas welcomed three girls and two boys in less than five minutes last Friday.\nExcited is an understatement,\u201d the happy father told the Las Vegas Sun.\nReutersLas Vegas resident Evonne Derrico, 33, successfully delivered quintuplets last Friday between 11:17 and 11:21 a.m. at Banner Desert Medical Center in Arizona.\nThis past May, Fernando and Guillermina Garcia from Utah welcomed their quintuplets at University Hospital in Salt Lake City."}
