We really do need an access road up here.\u201d\n\nApplications for some FEMA grants are due April 1, but the Indiana Department of Homeland Security has said that if Indiana is still ineligible at the deadline, the state will lose access to the funds completely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating,\u201d said Grant County Emergency Management Director Bruce Bender. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the politics are in Kokomo. All I\u2019m asking is, please, let it go so I can take care of the people in my county. My job is my county, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get taken care of.\u201d\n\nBender said the access road project has been in the works for years.\n\n\u201cThis is the closest we\u2019ve ever been to taking care of this,\u201d said Bender. \u201cWho is right or who is wrong (in Kokomo), I don\u2019t know, but the point is it has stopped all of the rest of us from applying for funds to help our local jurisdictions and that\u2019s what\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\n\nThe city of Kokomo previously accepted federal dollars through the Hazard Mitigation Grant program and, as part of its requirements, must keep the space open.\n\nPREVIOUS | FEMA to Kokomo: Stop work on baseball stadium | FEMA rejects Kokomo stadium redesign plans\n\nThey\u2019ve filed a lawsuit against the Indiana Department of Homeland Security in an effort to finish the project.\n\nMeanwhile, IDHS has appealed FEMA\u2019s decision to suspend hazard mitigation grant dollars for the entire state.\n\n\u201cAn access road would be more convenient especially if we have emergencies up here,\u201d said Jeff Burnette, a resident of Stone Crest Manor.\n\nBender said the access road is not just about getting residents out, but getting emergency crews in.\n\n\u201cWe need to get ambulances back here, fire trucks, food and water,\u201d said Bender. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the biggest concerns. Once it gets flooded the closest thing we could do is bring a helicopter in.\u201d\n\nBender said in the past, they\u2019ve used all-terrain vehicles to help people in the trailer park during a flood.\n\nPlans and projects in the following counties are impacted by the withholding of hazard mitigation grants: Boone, Grant, Henry, Knox, Marshall, Miami, Monroe, Ohio, Orange, Parke, Owen, Pike, Ripley, Starke, St. Joseph, Allen, Washington, Tipton, Dubois and Clay.\n\nRandy McKay, operations manager for the City of Kokomo, issued a response in February regarding FEMA\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe firmly dispute FEMA\u2019s assertions that the eight parcels in question are not in compliance,\u201d said McKay in a statement. \u201cWe believe that the redesign plans are fully compliant with the deed restrictions placed on the parcels; that is why we filed suit against IDHS on January 26.\u201d\n\nMcKay said they have offered several alternative designs yet FEMA has provided no guidance or explanation for their position.\n\n\u201cWe are in continued talks with IDHS regarding this issue and our related lawsuit,\u201d said McKay in a statement to RTV6. \u201cWe know the state understands the overreach of the federal government; Governor Pence and his departments have actively fought, or filed suit against, federal government overreach on the Affordable Care Act, Immigration Reform, Education Policy and other issues. IDHS has indicated a willingness to concur and support Kokomo\u2019s position in recent discussions.\u201d\n\nFollow Kara Kenney on Twitter: @karakenney6 | Facebook: KaraKenneyNews\n\nDigitally produced by Sarah Swiss", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "The City of Kokomo\u2019s controversial baseball stadium project is having a ripple effect throughout the entire state of Indiana, including a Grant County trailer park community with more than 400...", "author": "Kara Kenney", "og": {"site_name": "RTV6", "description": "The City of Kokomo\u2019s controversial baseball stadium project is having a ripple effect throughout the entire state of Indiana, including a Grant County trailer park community with more than 400 residents.", "title": "Kokomo stadium impacts Grant Co. trailer park", "url": "http://www.theindychannel.com/news/call-6-investigators/kokomo-stadium-impacts-grant-co-trailer-park", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.theindychannel.com/photo/2015/03/20/stone_crest_manor_grant_county_1426884551670_15256391_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 530250039, "iphone": 530172614}}, "site": "@rtv6", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "Kokomo stadium impacts Grant Co. trailer park", "robots": "Index, Follow", "keywords": "grant  county, fema, kokomo, idhs, kara kenney, call 6, baseball stadium, trailer park", "fb": {"app_id": 1575767939378722}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.theindychannel.com,recp.mkt32.net", "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "Kara Kenney"}, "msvalidate.01": "F33258882556C3E953931ECED98AF6A1", "google-site-verification": "j4wSC7_v2_B4sjvx7H6TGe4EpCvggzT8pxX7bS0HuNE", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WRTV6", "published_time": "2015-03-20T23:58:15+0000", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/", "section": "Call 6 Investigators", "modified_time": "2015-03-20T23:58:15+0000", "tag": "grant county, kokomo, fema, baseball stadium"}, "hasVideo": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "-- The City of Kokomo\u2019s controversial baseball stadium project is having a ripple effect throughout the entire state of Indiana, including a Grant County trailer park community with more than 400 residents.\nGrant County, Ind.\nGrant County Emergency Management and the Stone Crest Manor mobile home community were hoping to use FEMA hazard mitigation grant dollars to build an access road that can be used during flood events.\nMeanwhile, IDHS has appealed FEMA\u2019s decision to suspend hazard mitigation grant dollars for the entire state.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating,\u201d said Grant County Emergency Management Director Bruce Bender."}
