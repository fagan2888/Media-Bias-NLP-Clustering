They have done so with the support of heavy weaponry, tanks, and advanced equipment that they clearly did not possess prior to the uprising, and had no means of producing on their own.\n\nRussia, however, has adamantly denied that it has supplied either troops or manpower to the assist in the fighting. When the personal belongings of Russia soldiers were produced, including passports and military ID cards found on soldiers captured or killed in Ukraine, the Kremlin\u2019s response has been to claim that the men were adventurers \u201con vacation\u201d in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, the document that Putin helped negotiate tells a different story.\n\nThe text of the ceasefire agreement specifies, among other things, that forces on both sides need to move their heavy weapons back from the front, with explicit instructions about the required distance different weapons must be drawn back. Among the weapons systems named is the MLRS Tornado-S, a multiple launch rocket system that, as it turns out, could only have come from one place.\n\nRelated: Is Putin trying to Pry Greece Out of the European Union?\n\n\u201cThe 9A52-4 Tornado-S is an advanced Russian system, only deployed in 2012,\u201d writes Mark Galeotti, Clinical Professor in Global Affairs at the New York University Center for Global Affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not in private stocks, and Ukraine doesn\u2019t have any. So the only way it could be involved in this war is because Russia has supplied them to the rebels\u2014the ones they aren\u2019t arming, remember?\u2014or else in the hands of Russian troops.\u201d\n\nIf there are Tornado systems in Ukraine, as the ceasefire documents suggest, it\u2019s highly likely that they arrived with soldiers trained in how to use them \u2013 presumably Russian soldiers, since nobody other than the Russian army has the Tornado.\n\nThe presence of the Tornado in the ceasefire agreement, and its implications, appears to have been pointed out first by Andr\u00e1s R\u00e1cz and Sinikukka Saari, both senior research fellows at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. In a paper released Friday morning, they wrote:\n\n\u201cAlthough probably accidentally, the document provided proof of direct Russian military involvement in the conflict. Among the heavy weapons to be withdrawn is the Tornado-S, which is explicitly mentioned. This high-tech, long- range multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) entered into service in the Russian Federation in 2012, and is operated by no other state. Hence, if Tornados are to be withdrawn from the conflict zone, they could not have originated from anywhere but Russia.\u201d\n\nRelated: If the U.S. Arms Ukraine, Russia Vows Retaliation\n\nWhether the mention of the Tornado in the document was a slip, or simply a long overdue acknowledgment that Russia has been supplying men and arms to the separatists is now a much less important question that the more basic one: will the ceasefire hold?\n\nGaleotti, for one, isn\u2019t sanguine. \u201cIt would be lovely to think this was the first step towards a lasting peace, and not just the next act in Russia\u2019s unfolding exercise in creative disruption. But I won\u2019t be holding my breath.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The ceasefire document that Russian President Vladimir Putin helped negotiate in Minsk requires that as part of the ceasefire in Ukraine, certain weapon systems be pulled back from the front.
