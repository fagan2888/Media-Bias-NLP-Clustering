But Bush directed most of the blame on the man he wants to replace: \u201cWe need a president committed to running a competent government.\u201d\n\nBush, who has not serve in any military capacity, proposed that all 9 million veterans in VA care programs be free to choose doctors and other providers outside the VA system. Choice always yields \u201cbetter outcomes,\u201d Bush argued.\n\nCongress has already appropriated $10 billion over three years to allow flexibility for VA patients who cannot get an appointment within 30 days or who live 40 miles or more from a VA health facility.\n\nThe candidate called for a massive upgrade in software that would allow veterans to apply for care, access their medical records and manage appointments using a secure online system. And he wants to change federal personnel rules to make it easier to fire low-level VA employees deemed responsible for delaying or preventing patient care. Bush said he is not \u201canti-government-worker\u201d and wants only to \u201cempower\u201d good workers, while firing those who do not perform.\n\nBush has not put a price tag on his ideas, though he pitched himself as a both a \u201cdeficit hawk and a defense hawk.\u201d He said a VA fix must be part of a wider budget overhaul that would include major changes to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, along with putting \u201ceverything on the table\u201d at the Defense Department \u2014 the four single largest federal outlays.\n\nAt the Pentagon, Bush said that would mean reducing the number of administrative personnel, curtailing the use of expensive contractors and tightening spending controls for new weapons systems, which Bush described as \u201cextraordinarily expensive.\u201d\n\nBush said he\u2019d direct the savings to boosting the active-duty troop count, both by delaying discharges of current forces and recruiting new personnel. He described higher troop levels as both a national security imperative and a way to prevent more discharged service members from flooding the veterans care system.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush wants to privatize more veterans care, make it easier to fire federal employees found responsible for poor", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/bush-privatize-more-veterans-care", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201508/jeb_bush_gage_skidmore.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush wants to privatize more veterans care, make it easier to fire federal employees found responsible for poor", "title": "Bush: Privatize More Veterans Care"}, "story_id": 432700272, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Associated Press", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Bush: Privatize More Veterans Care"}, "nid": 11662, "datePublished": "2015-08-18", "keywords": "Gov.
