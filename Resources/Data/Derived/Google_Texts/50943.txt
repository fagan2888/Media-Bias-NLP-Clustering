JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida Blue is dropping 300,000 customers whose policies the health insurer says aren't sufficiently comprehensive under the health care overhaul.

The Jacksonville-based insurance company said Thursday that the 300,000 policyholders have plans that don't include all of the 10 categories of benefits required under the Affordable Care Act.

Florida Blue says the affected policyholders can upgrade to a plan with more comprehensive benefits. Others may choose to go with another insurer.

Florida Blue says those policyholders should contact the company to review their options.

Gov. Rick Scott, though, says Florida Blue's actions show that not everyone is able to keep their plans as promised by President Obama under the overhaul.

The governor says there's no guarantee that new policies will have the same quality and cost for the affected policyholders.
