Janet Yellen’s Beige Book report said last week that wage gains may force the Fed’s hand in raising rates to curb inflation.

What’s that? Raise rates on inflationary fears because of a 2 percent rise in Americans’ wages over the past year?

Middle-class America has been waiting a long time to see a bump in salaries. It was one of the first things to go — besides jobs — in the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

Let’s look at the math.

In 2005, when health care premiums for families rose 9.3 percent, wages grew only 2.5 percent. That amounts to a significant hit for the average American family in a year.

In 2009, health care premiums skyrocketed 5.5 percent, while wages collapsed 5.6 percent.

That was even a greater percentage coming out of family earnings.

In 2011, the year after ObamaCare was passed, premiums jumped another 9.5 percent — the largest increase during the 2005-2015 period — and wages rebounded 4.7 percent from a 0.4 percent gain in 2010.

Every year since 2005, health care premium increases have surpassed wage increases.

So what exactly is “inflationary” about an increase in wages now?

From 2005 to 2014, health care costs rose 70 percent, while wages went up only 17 percent. That’s a 53 percent loss in buying power just in relation to health insurance premiums.

And those figures don’t include the rising deductibles and copays.

In last week’s February employment report, average hourly earnings actually fell 0.1 percent despite a good employment number in which the economy added 242,000 jobs.

So why is the Fed preoccupied with raising short-term rates on the middle class now — just as glimmers of hope in wage gains finally appear — when it has other options?

What the Fed ought to be focused on is steepening the yield curve by selling off its massive holdings in US Treasurys, thereby freeing up ultra-tight credit in order to foster an environment in which wages and full-time workers can catch up from a decade of stagnation.
