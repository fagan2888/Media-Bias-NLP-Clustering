In the two weeks since lawmakers in Portland legalized Uber, the company has already attracted 500 drivers.

From GeekWire:

While some of those drivers may have been driving for Uber in surrounding cities for the past few months, it’s still a substantial number. “That’s a lot people in two weeks,” said David Plouffe, Uber’s senior vice president of policy and strategy.

At a TechFestNW event last Thursday, Plouffe said his company eventually hopes to have 10,000 drivers in Portland.

Last month, the Portland City Council voted 3 to 2 to approve a 120-day pilot program to let app-based ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft operate within city limits.

Portland Mayor Charlie Hales said he’s looking forward to analyzing data from Uber, Lyft and the taxi companies after the 120-day pilot period ends in August to make any necessary regulatory changes.

Hales described the temporary regulations that as a “learning process which government doesn’t typically do.”
