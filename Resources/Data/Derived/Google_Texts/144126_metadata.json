This amounted to about $200 to $300 per borrower.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe payday lenders would then withdraw fees of about $60 to $90 every two weeks to pay for these unauthorized loans.\n\n\"The utter disregard for the law shown by these businesses and the men who control them is shocking, and the grave harm they are doing to consumers simply has to be stopped,\" CFPB Director Richard Cordray said.\n\nThe CFPB says the Hydra Group collected more than $115 million from the scam, and the FTC says a similar payday lender withdrew more than $46 million from people's accounts.\n\nWhen people complained about the unauthorized charges, the payday lenders produced fake loan documents to convince the banks to let them continue with the withdrawals, the CFPB said.\n\nEventually, these companies would sell the fabricated debt to third-party collectors who would hound people to repay the loans they never agreed to.\n\nThe CFPB and FTC have brought charges in federal court in an effort to shut down the companies and reimburse the people who were scammed by them.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Officials say companies deposited unrequested loans and then charged for them.", "description": "Officials say companies deposited unrequested loans and then charged for them.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Tim Devaney", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Officials say companies deposited unrequested loans and then charged for them.", "title": "Feds tackle banking loan scams", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/218048-feds-tackle-illegal-payday-lending-scams", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/218048-feds-tackle-illegal-payday-lending-scams", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-17T13:51-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Tim Devaney", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-17T13:51:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/218048-feds-tackle-illegal-payday-lending-scams", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Officials say companies deposited unrequested loans and then charged for them.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds tackle banking loan scams"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds tackle banking loan scams"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd620e\"", "article_summary": "Federal regulators are cracking down on illegal lending scams that forced consumers to repay millions of dollars in unauthorized loans that they never signed up for.\nADVERTISEMENTThe payday lenders would then withdraw fees of about $60 to $90 every two weeks to pay for these unauthorized loans.\nEventually, these companies would sell the fabricated debt to third-party collectors who would hound people to repay the loans they never agreed to.\nWhen people complained about the unauthorized charges, the payday lenders produced fake loan documents to convince the banks to let them continue with the withdrawals, the CFPB said.\nThe CFPB and FTC have brought charges in federal court in an effort to shut down the companies and reimburse the people who were scammed by them."}
