Four Michigan counties have lost 1,000 jobs and are seeing nearly a third of all employers significantly reduce work hours to avoid Obamacare, according to a recently released report.

“Firms are choosing not to hire more workers in reaction to the Affordable Care Act,” Grand Valley State University professor Leslie Muller, one of the study’s authors, said in a statement, according to The Daily Caller. “Conservatively, there would be 1,000 more workers today in Kent, Ottawa, Muskegon and Allegan counties if not for the [Affordable Care Act]. This is not even taking into effect the decrease in hours firms are making to keep employees at part-time.”

The report found that 29 percent of employers are cutting worker hours to fewer than 30 hours a week to avoid complying with Obamacare.

Nearly half of all employers also said they were passing on additional Obamacare costs to employees, and another 40 percent are considering doing the same.

As if that wasn’t painful enough for the workforce, companies are also converting employee health plans to less attractive options than they had before.

“The predominant way firms in Western Michigan are containing health costs is by offering more high deductible plans, changing their prescription coverage,” Muller told local News WOOD TV Channel 8.
