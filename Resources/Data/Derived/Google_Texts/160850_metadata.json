The campaign promise (and its subsequent violation), as well as disparaging statements about one\u2019s opponent (whether true, mostly true, mostly not true, or entirely fantastic), are cornerstones of American democracy. Indeed, mocking and satire are as old as America, and if this Court doesn\u2019t believe amici, it can ask Thomas Jefferson, \u2018the son of a half-breed squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe case began in 2010 when the Susan B. Anthony List tried to publish a billboard stating that U.S. Rep. Steven Driehaus supported taxpayer-funded abortions when he voted for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nDriehaus filed a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission, claiming the ad violated Ohio\u2019s \u201cfalse statement\u201d law, which criminalizes \u201cfalse\u201d political speech. The SBA List sued and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the law. The U.S. Supreme Court set oral arguments for April 22.\n\n\u201cCan a state government criminalize political statements that are less than 100% truthful?\u201d Cato asks.\n\n\u201cJohn Quincy Adams called Andrew Jackson a \u2018slave-trading, gambling, brawling murderer,\u2019\u201d the brief states, adding that allegations about Thomas Jefferson fathering children with his slave and accusations about draft-dodging, Swift boats and birthplaces are \u201cpolitical staple.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny one of these allegations, if made during an Ohio election, could be enough to allow a complaint to be filed with the Ohio Election Commission and thus turn commonplace political jibber-jabber into a protracted legal dispute. \u2026 Inflammatory, insulting and satirical speech is more likely to produce a response, thus making the back-and-forth of politics a self-correcting marketplace of ideas \u2013 except, of course, when candidates can tattle to the government, which then takes away their toys speech.\u201d\n\nP.J. O\u2019Rourke, a native Toledoan, author, satirist and H.L. Mencken Research Fellow at the Cato Institute, joined the brief, and with paragraphs reminiscent of his writing style, it\u2019s easy to see why.\n\n\u201cAfter all, where would we be without the knowledge that Democrats are pinko-communist flag-burners who want to tax churches and use the money to fund abortions so they can use the fetal stem cells to create pot-smoking lesbian ATF agents who will steal all the guns and invite the UN to take over America? Voters have to decide whether we\u2019d be better off electing Republicans, those hateful, assault-weapon-wielding maniacs who believe that George Washington and Jesus Christ incorporated the nation after a Gettysburg reenactment and that the only thing wrong with the death penalty is that it isn\u2019t administered quickly enough to secular-humanist professors of Chicano studies.\u201d\n\nIlya Shapiro, Cato\u2019s senior fellow in constitutional studies, said the concept for the brief came from Gabriel Latner, a junior associate at Cato.\n\n\u201cI thought about the idea for a second and thought it might be a hard idea to execute,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cThe nature of satire goes back to time immemorial. From the Greeks to the French Court, people have used humor to poke fun, but make serious points, nonetheless.\u201d\n\nThat was the goal, he said, but the intended audience was more than the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that any amicus brief gets read by the clerks, much less the justices,\u201d Shapiro noted. \u201cWhen do you have non-lawyers reading briefs? We wouldn\u2019t write something that would detract from the seriousness of filing before the Supreme Court, but when you can hit the broader targets as well, we like that.\u201d\n\nTheir argument focuses on the concept of \u201ctruthiness\u201d \u2013 \u201ca \u2018truth\u2019 asserted \u2018from the gut\u2019 or because it \u2018feels right,\u2019 without regard to evidence or logic.\u201d That concept is a key part of political discourse, they write.\n\n\u201cWe make very serious arguments about the First Amendment,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t always get through. Satire can break through the point that government shouldn\u2019t be regulating what is and isn\u2019t false.\u201d\n\nBecause of the way the brief is written, Shapiro hopes it will get more people thinking about campaign finance and campaign regulatory laws, especially ones that seek to regulate truth.\n\n\u201cMany campaign statements cannot easily be categorized as simply \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false,\u2019\u201d the brief states. \u201cAccording to Politifact.com, President Obama\u2019s claim that \u2018if you like your health-care plan you can keep it\u2019 was true five years before it was named the \u2018Lie of the Year.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven political satire is illegal under the Ohio law: \u201cA publication like The Onion \u2014 which regularly puts words in political figures\u2019 mouths, or makes up outlandish stories about them \u2014 could be violating Ohio law by making people think at the same time it makes them laugh.\u201d\n\nThe brief questions politicians writing a law that protects them, but no one else, including other famous people \u201cwho are often lied about.\u201d\n\nShapiro doesn\u2019t know if the brief will impact the outcome of the case, but he hopes Ohio and other states will examine their laws and err on the side of allowing all political discourse.\n\n\u201cWe did our best in terms of making the point we wanted to make, so we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A unique Supreme Court brief uses satire and humor to poke fun at what it calls an \u201cOrwellian\u201d Ohio campaign law that violates the First Amendment.", "title": "Cato uses satire and humor to oppose Ohio campaign speech law - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/03/Jester-_Joker_Card001-194x300.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-10T10:44:25+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/131939/ohio-campaign-law/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Campaign Ads,Campaign Finance,Cato Institute,First Amendent,Free Speech,Ohio,US Supreme Court", "published_time": "2014-03-10T10:13:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-10T10:44:25+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A unique Supreme Court brief uses satire and humor to poke fun at what it calls an \u201cOrwellian\u201d Ohio campaign law that violates the First Amendment.", "title": "Cato uses satire and humor to oppose Ohio campaign speech law - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/03/Jester-_Joker_Card001-194x3001.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "A unique Supreme Court brief uses satire and humor to poke fun at what it calls an \u201cOrwellian\u201d Ohio campaign law that violates the First Amendment."}, "article_summary": "By Maggie Thurber | for Ohio Watchdog\u201cYou\u2019ve got to read this Supreme Court brief!\u201dThose aren\u2019t words you normally hear, but in this case originating in Ohio, it\u2019s apt.\nDriehaus filed a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission, claiming the ad violated Ohio\u2019s \u201cfalse statement\u201d law, which criminalizes \u201cfalse\u201d political speech.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court set oral arguments for April 22.\nWeighing in against an Ohio law that makes it a crime to lie about a candidate, the Cato Institute filed an amici curiae brief using satire and humor to poke fun at what it calls an \u201cOrwellian\u201d law that violates the First Amendment.\nFrom the Greeks to the French Court, people have used humor to poke fun, but make serious points, nonetheless.\u201dThat was the goal, he said, but the intended audience was more than the Supreme Court."}
