I was about to leave the network for good.\n\nThe ratings had been slipping at Meet the Press, and I had a new boss at NBC News, Deborah Turness, who was pushing us hard to reimagine the show. Some of her ideas were pretty unorthodox. I had been trying new ideas at the show well before she came on board, but I thought it was essential that we retain the qualities of the program that had made it popular for so long.\n\nOther elements were shifting, too. The TV landscape had changed. NBC and its parent company, Comcast, had seen sliding ratings on Today as well as Nightly News.\n\nThe Sunday shows were struggling to retain their place as appointment viewing. Booking guests whom viewers really wanted to see had become more difficult.\n\nBy the time I made the announcement that I was leaving Meet the Press in August 2014, NBC and I had been in discussions for several weeks. I didn\u2019t want to leave, but I was not happy. I was getting a lot of bad press about falling ratings, and many of the stories specu\u00adlated on whether I would be replaced. It was frustrating, because I knew that people within NBC were leaking stories\u2014saying I was about to be pushed out, in order to weaken my position, even as my bosses were telling me that was not the case. The press coverage seemed exces\u00adsively personal, as though I had done something wrong.\n\nThat summer I decided to stay above the fray\u2014I didn\u2019t talk to reporters, either privately or publicly, to de\u00adfend myself or to tell them what was going on behind the scenes. But I needed the network to stand behind me. I knew Washington and politics. Now that there was blood in the water, it would only get worse. I told my bosses that the attention was becoming too much about me. It was bad for the show and for what we were trying to do.\n\nMy relationship with Meet the Press during that last year was like a marriage that you know is bad but you can\u2019t leave. I was miserable, but I needed to be told the company didn\u2019t support me before I could come to terms with the end. Although NBC backed me initially, the net\u00adwork decided late in the summer that it would not com\u00admit to me in the long term. Clearly, that was the signal that it was time to go. Could I have done something else at the network? In theory, yes. But as the damaging leaks kept coming, it became clear to me that they weren\u2019t in\u00adterested in that. It never came up as an option.\n\nThe last gasp came suddenly, and the timing was bad: Beth and I were setting off on a day of travel to pick up our kids from camp in New Hampshire. Just before the plane doors closed and I had to power down my phone, my agent called to tell me that NBC had decided it didn\u2019t want to risk another \u201cAnn Curry moment,\u201d which has become a byword in the TV business for an on-air embar\u00adrassment, after Curry\u2019s long and tearful farewell from her job as Today show cohost. Because of this ill-conceived concern, NBC decided not to let me have a final show. They wanted this to be my last day. I was furious when I heard that. I felt like they were snuffing me out.\n\nAs Beth drove our rental car through the bucolic New England farmlands, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how much I wanted to be able to say goodbye to the Meet the Press viewers. I had one of my first friends in TV news on my mind. Nolan Snook was a salesman for a station I worked at in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He had a memorable shock of white hair, and he had come from big-market television, so he knew the ropes. He told me that jobs in the news business are fleeting. \u201cJust re\u00admember, David,\u201d he told me, \u201cthey\u2019ve given you a forum. Everything you have in your relationship with the public is based on this forum. And they can take it away at any time.\u201d\n\nI was not going to be able to control the messaging. My cell signal kept going in and out after we turned off the interstate and onto a country road, and at some point along Route 104, I saw on my Twitter feed that NBC had leaked that I was out at Meet the Press.\n\nThis goodbye was never going to be easy. I\u2019d been working in TV news since I was eighteen. Since I gradu\u00adated from school, I had rarely been off the air longer than a week, other than vacations. I worked every summer during college, and I got my first job, in Albuquerque, before I graduated. I had my sights set solidly on a job at the network for eight years until I got it, and I had planned each stage of the journey I\u2019d take to get there. After that, it was a new set of goals. And Meet the Press was a destination that had exceeded my expectations.\n\nAfter a career spent entirely in TV news, I had come to rely on being on the air. It was my way to measure how good a week I had. Other people assess their professional achievements through meetings attended, classes taught, or surgical operations conducted; for me, it\u2019s always been about airtime. When I was a reporter, being on the air a lot was shorthand for being in the middle of covering a big story. The equivalent at Meet the Press was how well spent my hourlong show was each week, and how much pickup the interviews got. Now, in the middle of my life, I would have to completely recalibrate my ideas about productivity and worth.\n\nSitting in the car that day, watching the tweets stack up about my rumored departure, I was far from at peace with all of it. I had spent so much time planning out my career. It hurt to see how far out of my control this end\u00ading was. There was also the feeling that I\u2019d be seen as a failure. I\u2019d had a big setback, and everyone was going to know it.\n\nIt was one of these moments people talk about: Something bad is happening to you, and you are watch\u00ading yourself in slow motion from the outside. I had feared this moment would come. As the ratings slid and the press got worse, I had played out the scenario in my head. Now it was real. And one of the things I was con\u00adscious of was that I should handle it well.\n\n*\n\nIt was all coming together: Here was the time for me to live out so many of the lessons I\u2019d been learning on my spiritual journey. I\u2019d been contemplating living a more spiritual, meaningful existence, and now was the time to walk the walk. In a way, that day up in New Hamp\u00adshire clarified many of the discoveries I had been making about life and faith.\n\nIt is our job in the world to strive to be our best self all the time. But the time when it matters most is when things are hard. That is the true test of our character. In the months since I left NBC, I\u2019ve come to a conclusion: If I do not change as a result of this experience, then it was not worth it. That\u2019s not to say the way that I left was my choice. But it happened as it happened, and I am determined to be the better for it.\n\nOne day, as the long, drawn-out drama of my depar\u00adture from NBC was coming to a head, I met the Southern Baptist leader Russell Moore at his Capitol Hill office. It was already feeling inevitable that I would leave, and Erica\u2019s question \u201cWho would you be?\u201d was weighing on my mind. I asked Dr. Moore how he would answer some\u00adone who came to him asking, \u201cWho does God expect me to be?\u201d\n\nDr. Moore answered me with his own questions. \u201cThe fundamental question here is \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you have a national profile, or you are the guy running a hardware store in a small town, you are ultimately facing the same question, which is: Do you define yourself by your work or as someone created in the image of God? Are you the owner of the hardware store or someone who must give an account to God?\u201d\n\nHe quoted Matthew 26, in which one of Jesus\u2019 fol\u00adlowers lashes out at the men who come to arrest him, cutting off one man\u2019s ear with a sword. \u201cPut your sword back into its place,\u201d Jesus tells his follower. \u201cFor all who take the sword will perish by the sword.\u201d\n\nDr. Moore said that one of the ways he likes to inter\u00adpret that Scripture is in terms of ambition. Jesus was re\u00adminding his follower that kindness and humanity matter above all. Anyone who views himself primarily in terms of ambition can start to dehumanize, \u201cto become the sort of person who claws and fights to keep what they want,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Book exclusive: \"When I left NBC, what stung more than outright negativity was the indifference shown by so many\"", "title": "David Gregory: \u201cMy relationship with \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 \u2026 was like a marriage you know is bad but can\u2019t leave\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Book exclusive: \"When I left NBC, what stung more than outright negativity was the indifference shown by so many\"", "title": "David Gregory: \u201cMy relationship with \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 \u2026 was like a marriage you know is bad but can\u2019t leave\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/13/david_gregory_my_relationship_with_meet_the_press_was_like_a_marriage_you_know_is_bad_but_cant_leave/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/david_gregory.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Book exclusive: \"When I left NBC, what stung more than outright negativity was the indifference shown by so many\"", "title": "David Gregory: \u201cMy relationship with \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 \u2026 was like a marriage you know is bad but can\u2019t leave\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/david_gregory.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Gregory", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Books, david gregory, Editor's Picks, faith, meet the press, Religion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9df3\"", "article_summary": "My relationship with Meet the Press during that last year was like a marriage that you know is bad but you can\u2019t leave.\nI was getting a lot of bad press about falling ratings, and many of the stories specu\u00adlated on whether I would be replaced.\nTopics: aol_on, Books, david gregory, Editor's Picks, faith, meet the press, Religion, Life NewsSix years after I became moderator of Meet the Press, I was facing the lowest moment of my professional career.\nThe equivalent at Meet the Press was how well spent my hourlong show was each week, and how much pickup the interviews got.\nBy the time I made the announcement that I was leaving Meet the Press in August 2014, NBC and I had been in discussions for several weeks."}
