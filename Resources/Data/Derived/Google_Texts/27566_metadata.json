Gov. Jay Dardenne announced Tuesday that the Alexandria Museum of Art will be the new home to the 99-piece collection managed by the Louisiana Division of Arts.\n\nThe sculptures, stained glass paintings, drawings, photography, and etchings were all crafted by Louisiana artists. The state started receiving them as donations and acquisitions in the 1940s and housed them in the Old State Capitol Building. Eventually, many went into storage though or were moved into other state buildings like the office for the Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism.\n\nBuy Photo A stained glass painting from the Louisiana State Art Collection hangs in a window at the Alexandria Museum of Art.

They learned the collection was worth a more than half a million dollars. During a Tuesday morning appearance at AMoA, Dardenne noted the value of the State Art Collection also is in its legacy, and he wants to share that with the public.\n\n\"Artwork by Louisiana artists needs to be available for Louisianians to see and enjoy,\" Dardenne said.\n\nEven though that meant, leaving some bare walls around around the building where he works.\n\n\"We had to take the pictures off of the wall literally in some people's offices and say sorry,\" Dardenne said.\n\nBut, he said the collection needs to be at a place where it can be properly cared for. AMoA turned out to be a \"natural fit.\"\n\n\"This museum is a very mature museum,\" Dardenne said. \"It's established and centrally located in the state, and we thought it would be the perfect place.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Catherine Pears, executive director of AMoA, and others at the museum have been in the process of building a permanent collection there.\n\nBuy Photo A serigraph by Charles H.

The 99 pieces already have moved there though, and a select few will be on display until then. Pears said the museum's collection committee planned to start unpacking them right away Tuesday evening.\n\n\"That'll be fun for them to unpack and get to see some of the treasures,\" Pears said.\n\nThe State Art's repertoire includes work by Natchitoches folk artist Clementine Hunter, landscape artist Elemore Morgan Jr., Shreveport sculptor Clyde Connell and renowned artist Ida Kohlmeyer from New Orleans. Since some have been in storage, the museum will have to restore any damage. Once that task is complete though, it will open up new opportunities.\n\nBuy Photo Lt. Gov.

We'll only have to change out the main gallery,\" Pears said. \"And so, we'll be able to focus on interpretation and education with our own collection.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/local/2015/06/16/dardenne-reveals-new-home-state-art-collection/28832419/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Louisiana State Art Collection moves to a more central location.", "og": {"site_name": "thetowntalk.com", "description": "Louisiana State Art Collection moves to a more central location.", "title": "Dardenne reveals new home for State Art Collection", "url": "http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/local/2015/06/16/dardenne-reveals-new-home-state-art-collection/28832419/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/thetowntalk.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Louisiana State Art Collection moves to a more central location.", "title": "Dardenne reveals new home for State Art Collection", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2630b0dee5e5b667b9463924f75691def8874992/c=896-0-3744-2848&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/16/Alexandria/B9317734099Z.1_20150616180856_000_G7LB3JEU5.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@TownTalkdotcom", "site": "@TownTalkdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898045744", "fb": {"app_id": 116986585038108}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe450c\"", "article_summary": "Dardenne announces Tuesday that the Alexandria Museum of Art will be the new home for Louisiana\u2019s State Art Collection.\nBuy Photo A stained glass painting from the Louisiana State Art Collection hangs in a window at the Alexandria Museum of Art.\nBuy Photo A serigraph by Charles H.
