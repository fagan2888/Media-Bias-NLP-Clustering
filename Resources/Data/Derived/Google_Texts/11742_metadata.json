Still, there are situation-specific strategies that may maximize coverage and make mental health services and medications more affordable. Here are a few, highlighted by health insurance brokers and experts at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, or NAMI, a grass roots advocacy, education and support organization.\n\nDo Your Homework Before Enrolling in a Plan\n\nWith the next open enrollment period under Obamacare set to begin Nov. 1, it\u2019s a good time to get an early start researching health insurance plans. That's a solid idea whether you're getting a plan through a health insurance exchange or looking at several options an employer offers.\n\nLarge employer plans are not required to cover mental health services, but if they do offer mental health benefits, they must be on par or equivalent to benefits for general medical care, says Sita Diehl, director of state policy and advocacy for NAMI. \u201cSo the first thing to do if you\u2019re shopping for a plan through your employer is to make sure that mental health benefits are covered. Most are \u2013 most plans do cover mental health \u2013 but you\u2019ve got to check it out,\u201d Diehl says. Those who work for a company that offers a plan that doesn't cover mental health may choose to purchase insurance outside their company. You may end up spending more of your own money on monthly premiums as a result, however.\n\nIf you\u2019re already seeing a mental health provider for therapy or medication management, make sure he or she is in your plan\u2019s network. \u201cThe provider networks are nowhere near as extensive\u201d for mental health as for clinicians who treat physical issues, Diehl says. \u201cSo it\u2019s harder to find someone in your health plan\u2019s network.\u201d But experts say enrolling in a plan that covers the providers you see and the medications you take can make a substantial difference in what you pay out of pocket. For many, that can affect whether they\u2019re able to afford needed mental health treatment. For those getting a plan through health insurance exchanges, go to healthcare.gov. \"You do have to [dig] down deep, but you can see whether your provider is in the various plans\u2019 networks, and whether your medications are covered by those plans,\u201d Diehl says.\n\nShe also recommends that those signing up through exchanges get help from designated, government-funded enrollment navigators or assisters located in most cities and many rural areas. You can locate one nearby through healthcare.gov by going to \u201cFind Local Help.\u201d\n\nCrunch Dollars and Cents Upfront\n\nTake into account plan deductibles \u2013 including out-of-network versus in-network for preferred provider organization, or PPO, plans \u2013 and out-of-pocket limits, says Nicholas Moriello, a health insurance broker and president of Health Insurance Associates in Newark, Delaware.\n\nThen go a step further in your cost assessment. Plans commonly use a tiered coverage system, in which drugs \u2013 including some for mental and behavioral health \u2013 falling into higher tiers receive less-robust coverage, resulting in higher out-of-pocket costs for consumers, says Moriello, who is also a member of the national legislative council for the National Association of Health Underwriters, an industry trade group. Check to see not only whether your medications are covered, but to what degree.\n\nHe suggests looking for a plan that covers a larger network of providers, like a PPO, and that also offers out-of-network benefits. This would enable patients to see an out-of-network provider and not be \"totally without coverage,\u201d he says. \u201cOne area of specialty [where] that tends to come up more frequently than others is in rehab, [including] addiction treatment.\u201d\n\nTo further evaluate what you may pay, go over any anticipated mental health care needs with the navigator or health insurance broker who might be helping you find a plan. This would include detailing things like: \u201c\u2018I want to see a therapist once every three months; I\u2019m going to see my psychiatrist once every six months; these are the medications I take,\u2019\u201d Diehl says. \u201cGet down to that sort of level of detail so they can actually do a dollars-and-cents analysis for you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Nearly two-thirds of women who die suddenly of coronary heart disease had no previous symptoms.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "As lawmakers wrestle with reform, here are some strategies for accessing needed services today.", "zone": "patientadvice/articles", "author": "Michael O.
