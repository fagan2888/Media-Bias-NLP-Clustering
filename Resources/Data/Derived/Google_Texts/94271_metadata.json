In subsequent articles, the nonstop news site stayed away from the \u201cexemption\u201d language, as other outlets cautioned that the story had gone overboard.\n\nNo matter: Once an outlet of the mainstream media mentions \u201cCongress,\u201d \u201cObamacare\u201d and \u201cexemption\u201d in the same breath, there\u2019s no plucking it out of the country\u2019s news stream. Especially when Fox News is around.\n\nSeveral days after Politico\u2019s story surfaced, \u201cThe Five,\u201d a fun roundtable discussion program on Fox News, was chatting about this outrage, with co-host Dana Perino in the role of analyst: \u201cSo President Obama\u2019s health-care legislation is evidently so awful that even members of his own party were trying to get out of it. Reports are swirling about lawmakers having hush-hush talks about whether they think it\u2019s okay for members of Congress and most of their aides to be exempt from portions of Obamacare. Americans obviously don\u2019t have that luxury.\u201d\n\nOn it went.\n\nOf course, the media throughout the spring was focused on three more promising scandals/non-scandals \u2014 the IRS, Benghazi, snooping on news organizations \u2014 leaving little air for the Obamacare-exemption scandal. Yet the story line proved to be quite a soldier, braving the summer and blazing into the fall. Working backward in time, here are some highlights.\n\nLast Saturday on Fox News\u2019s \u201cJournal Editorial Report,\u201d commentator Jason Riley said, \u201cThere are senators like Tom Coburn and David Vitter who have put together these things, such as the individual mandate, using that as leverage \u2026 such as pointing out how members of Congress and their staff are trying to put loopholes in the law that exempt them from some of the provisions. That is where Obamacare is vulnerable. And in the short run, that\u2019s where the leverage is to be had and used to push back.\n\nOn Sept. 24, Fox News contributor (and Washington Post columnist) Charles Krauthammer said on \u201cFox Special Report with Bret Baier\u201d: \u201cThis, what we\u2019re seeing tonight, is pure theater. It will have no effect. I think what might have an effect, if you want to attach something on to the resolution. You got to have something that the country entirely agrees with. Attach on to this a provision that no one in Congress and no staffer in Congress is going to be exempt from all of the provisions of Obamacare and they will not be eligible for any subsidies. And that will advertise to the country \u2014 because this is all theater anyway and we\u2019re trying to make a point \u2014 it would make a point of the utter hypocrisy of the people in Congress, the Democrats in Congress who passed it for everybody else but exempted themselves. That I think would be an effective point. But defunding it is not going to happen.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 9, Sean Hannity hosted Tea Party activist Jenny Beth Martin and asked about her attack on Obamacare: \u201cAll right, so big labor has been exempted. Washington has been exempted. Congress has been exempted. This is to exempt the American people?\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 20, Hannity hosted Martin, who said this: \u201cYes, if he funds it, if he votes to pay for this law, it\u2019s the same thing as voting for the law. Either you are against the law and you don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing for America and our tax money shouldn\u2019t be going for it, or you\u2019re spending our tax money on it and you must be okay with the law. If it\u2019s not good enough for big business, who has had a delay, it\u2019s not good enough for big government, who has been \u2014 Congress and their staff had been exempted, it\u2019s not going good enough for America.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 13, Hannity asked a pair of guests: \u201cLet me ask you a question. Isn\u2019t it just morally wrong that these guys exempt themselves from the very laws and burdens they\u2019re placing on the rest of us? Isn\u2019t that wrong?\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 5, Fox News host Greta Van Susteren said: \u201cCongress and the president have a lot of nerve. Congress passing Obamacare and President Obama then signing a law that was supposed to cover everybody. Members of Congress didn\u2019t bother to read the law before they passed it, and now they discovered they don\u2019t like it. They surely don\u2019t want it for themselves or for their staff. So guess what they did? They sneaked behind closed doors and agreed among themselves, and then went to President Obama, and the president then gave them a special exemption from the OPM that exempts them from the law that they passed themselves. President Obama is not giving you that special exemption.\u201d\n\nJust how true is any of this?\n\nFor a useful fact-check, let\u2019s rely on a primary source. On Aug. 7, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a proposed rule outlining how health-care benefits would be organized for members of Congress and their staffers. For Federal Register fare, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. It starts off by explaining the legislative/regulatory pickle in which the government found itself vis-\u00e0-vis congressional health benefits, thanks to this provision of the Affordable Care Act: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law . . . the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are \u2014 (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act).\u201d\n\nThe shorthand for that mandate is this: From here on out, lawmakers and staffers must get off of their cushy Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) plans and venture out into Obamacare\u2019s exchanges. The OPM proposed rule does just that, in precise legal terminology:\n\nThe following employees are not eligible to purchase a health benefit plan for which OPM contracts or which OPM approves under this subsection, but may purchase health benefit plans, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8901(6), that are offered by an Exchange, pursuant to \u00a71312(d)(3)(D) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Public Law 111-152 (the Affordable Care Act or the Act)\n\nWelcome to Obamacare, Capitol Hill. The proposed rule also makes clear that congressional types will continue receiving their employer contributions to their health-care insurance \u2014 just as all those folks with existing employer-provided insurance programs do. In fact, that\u2019s what this exercise has been about from the beginning: How to comply with the ACA\u2019s directive that Congress enroll in Obamacare\u2019s exchanges while preserving the employer contributions to which these hard workers are entitled.\n\nThe net result of all this maneuvering is a hassle \u2014 not a handout \u2014 for Hill workers. They have to find a new plan and do a lot of fresh paperwork. So they\u2019re \u201cexempt\u201d only from convenience. Note that OPM\u2019s highly scannable proposed rule preceded much of the unequivocal discussion of this \u201cexemption,\u201d as highlighted above.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to fantasize about how the world would be different if only Politico had chosen a different headline for that initial story. Instead of \u201cLawmakers, aides may get Obamacare exemption,\u201d the site could have gone another formulation, like \u201cHill tries to save lawmakers, staffers from massive benefits cut.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill are moving to Obamacare's exchanges, so just what is this 'exemption' all about?", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill are moving to Obamacare's exchanges, so just what is this 'exemption' all about?", "title": "From Politico to \u2018Hannity': The trajectory of Congress\u2019s Obamacare \u2018exemption\u2019 myth", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/10/02/from-politico-to-hannity-the-trajectory-of-congresss-obamacare-exemption-myth/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/files/2013/10/obamacare.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ErikWemple"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/10/02/from-politico-to-hannity-the-trajectory-of-congresss-obamacare-exemption-myth/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obamacare, Politico, Fox News, Sean Hannity, Greta Van Susteren,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Politico, Fox News, Sean Hannity, Greta Van Susteren,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e13\"", "article_summary": "Instead of \u201cLawmakers, aides may get Obamacare exemption,\u201d the site could have gone another formulation, like \u201cHill tries to save lawmakers, staffers from massive benefits cut.\u201d\nNo matter: Once an outlet of the mainstream media mentions \u201cCongress,\u201d \u201cObamacare\u201d and \u201cexemption\u201d in the same breath, there\u2019s no plucking it out of the country\u2019s news stream.\n(Photo by Charles Dharapak/Associated Press)As noted in this space yesterday, Politico didn\u2019t exactly stand by its story that Congress was exploring an exemption for its employees from Obamacare.\nCongress passing Obamacare and President Obama then signing a law that was supposed to cover everybody.\nNote that OPM\u2019s highly scannable proposed rule preceded much of the unequivocal discussion of this \u201cexemption,\u201d as highlighted above."}
