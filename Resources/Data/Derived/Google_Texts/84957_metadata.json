It seems beyond comprehension that people could take such an electric piece of history and make something this dull, miscast, misguided, badly written, bloated, schmaltzy and shlocky out of it, but director Roland Emmerich and screenwriter Jon Robin Baitz have managed it.\n\nAlmost everything about \u201cStonewall\u201d is terrible. You watch it alternately cringing and howling; the sparsely attended screening I went to was so rocked with laughter that you would have thought we were seeing the comedy of the year.\n\n\u201cStonewall\u201d caused a great deal of controversy before anyone had seen it, thanks to a trailer that pushed the real-life heroes of the riot\u2014namely, trans people, drag queens, people of color and women\u2014to the side in favor of a made-up white Midwesterner named Danny (played by Jeremy Irvine). Emmerich and Baitz defended themselves, saying that the trailer wasn\u2019t representative of the whole movie. Emmerich also said explicitly that the focus on Danny was a way to win straight people over\u2013a strange goal if ever there was one, but a goal that underscores the perverse incentives of Hollywood as well as anything could.\n\nEmmerich and Baitz clearly don\u2019t know what kind of movie they\u2019ve made. The representation issues in \u201cStonewall\u201d are very real, and very glaring\u2014yet another example of the film industry\u2019s insistence on pushing white characters to the forefront of its stories, even if they don\u2019t deserve to be there. It is Danny who throws the brick that launches the riots, Danny whose cry of \u201cgay power\u201d ignites the crowd, Danny who leads his people into battle.\n\nThe filmmakers, stuck in a Hollywood bubble, seemed surprised that anyone would have a problem with this. A better rejoinder would have been to make a good movie. But almost every inch of \u201cStonewall\u201d is wrong.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s so, so long. You feel every one of its 129 minutes, like painful shards of boredom were breaking your mind apart.\n\nThe writing is off-the-charts awful. It\u2019s as though Baitz reached into a bag marked \u201cclich\u00e9s,\u201d pulled some out at random and pasted them into the script. This is a movie where someone actually says, \u201cThose kids, they\u2019ve got nothing left to lose.\u201d Someone says, \u201cI just want to break things!\u201d about 40 minutes before he goes on to break things. Another character actually declares, \u201cI\u2019m too mad to love anybody right now.\u201d\n\nThe movie is shot through strange, grimy filters, as though Emmerich was trying to project some of the seediness of the Village through the lens. It just means that you have to squint a bit to see anything clearly. There are also anachronisms so glaring you wonder how they got through the editing process. In one sequence, Stonewall patrons dance to \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There,\u201d a song that didn\u2019t come out until 1972.\n\nThe biggest problem with \u201cStonewall,\u201d though, is that it\u2019s not actually about Stonewall. Any real attempt to explore the politics behind the rebellion are cast aside in favor of creaky soap opera. For some reason, \u201cStonewall\u201d thinks that what we really need is lots and lots of Danny, the sensitive Indiana boy who rolls into the Village and proceeds to learn a host of life lessons from the assorted rainbow coalition of queer ruffians whose main job in life is to worry about Danny\u2019s feelings.\n\nWe spend what feels like 17 years on Danny\u2019s past in Indiana\u2013his doomed affair with another boy, his awful father\u2019s rejection, his plucky kid sister\u2019s tearful cries as he leaves the small town life behind forever. It\u2019s all so weirdly retro\u2013Emmerich and Baitz have crafted a melodrama as hoary and sudsy as anything made in 1925, let alone 2015. It would all be deliciously kitschy if you didn\u2019t sense that all involved thought they were making a profound masterpiece.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Director Roland Emmerich has made one of the most tone-deaf and offensive movies in recent memory", "title": "Inside the \u201cStonewall\u201d catastrophe: A dull, miscast, misguided, bloated, schmaltzy and shlocky disaster of a movie", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Director Roland Emmerich has made one of the most tone-deaf and offensive movies in recent memory", "title": "Inside the \u201cStonewall\u201d catastrophe: A dull, miscast, misguided, bloated, schmaltzy and shlocky disaster of a movie", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/26/inside_the_stonewall_catastrophe_a_dull_miscast_misguided_bloated_schmaltzy_and_shlocky_disaster_of_a_movie/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/stonewall5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Director Roland Emmerich has made one of the most tone-deaf and offensive movies in recent memory", "title": "Inside the \u201cStonewall\u201d catastrophe: A dull, miscast, misguided, bloated, schmaltzy and shlocky disaster of a movie", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/stonewall5.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jack Mirkinson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Film, Gay Rights, History, Roland Emmerich, Stonewall", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The biggest problem with \u201cStonewall,\u201d though, is that it\u2019s not actually about Stonewall.\nEmmerich and Baitz defended themselves, saying that the trailer wasn\u2019t representative of the whole movie.\nEmmerich and Baitz clearly don\u2019t know what kind of movie they\u2019ve made.\nIn one sequence, Stonewall patrons dance to \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There,\u201d a song that didn\u2019t come out until 1972.\nTopics: Editor's Picks, Film, Gay Rights, History, Roland Emmerich, Stonewall, Entertainment News, News, Politics News\u201cStonewall,\u201d the newly released movie about the 1969 rebellion that launched the modern gay liberation movement, is so bad it\u2019s almost baffling."}
