Sandford and Plessy v. Ferguson \u2014 both contributors toward the maintenance of African-American servitude and segregation \u2014 seem to us now to be reflections of a court intent on bypassing political, economic and social \u2018rightness\u2019 in favor of strict adherence to constitutional legality.\n\nIn essence, the court traded the pressing question of what made moral and practical sense for the more tangible and answerable question of what was constitutionally justifiable. In both of the aforementioned cases, the law overrode our current notions of morality and social responsibility.\n\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act, often termed \u201cObamaCare,\u201d which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012, is a case of the converse.\n\nIn other words, whereas past Supreme Court cases have stuck to the precedent of upholding or ruling in favor of laws that may be politically, morally or economically \u2018wrong,\u2019 but constitutionally and legally \u2018right,\u2019 the Affordable Care Act presents a case where the law is politically, economically and socially \u2018right,\u2019 but constitutionally questionable.\n\nWhether or not the act is truly constitutionally \u2018right\u2019 needs to be reexamined.\n\nThe 5-4 split in the court\u2019s voting already indicates the presence of a gray area, so questioning the finding\u2019s legitimacy is justifiable.\n\nA central piece of the Affordable Care Act is its individual mandate, a provision that compels citizens to purchase health insurance. The general purpose of this mandate is to ensure that young, healthy Americans (who often defer the purchase of health insurance until later years) enter the insurance pool. More entrants into the pool means lower premiums, which makes it easier for those who cannot afford health insurance to purchase it.\n\nTo add brevity to a lengthy legal dispute: In its majority decision, the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the notion that the individual mandate was constitutionally justifiable under the right of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. Compelling people to commerce, they claimed, is not the same as regulating it. Rather, the mandate was upheld under the right of Congress to tax.\n\nThe case brief reads as follows: \u201cCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS concluded in Part III\u2013B that the individual mandate must be construed as imposing a tax on those who do not have health insurance, if such a construction is reasonable.\u201d\n\nLater on in the opinion, this construction is deemed reasonable and justifiable, despite the Obama administration\u2019s earlier insistence that the law was not a tax.\n\nHere\u2019s where things get tricky.\n\nThe individual mandate is, legally, a tax levied on those who do not purchase health insurance. It is a tax on the lack of action. It is a tax on inaction \u2014 the first of its kind.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided that this was constitutional \u2014 but is it?\n\nMy instinct is to say yes. I believe that, barring the Congressional sabotage that seems ever more probable in light of the ongoing budget crisis, the Affordable Care Act has the potential to improve the health care system in a sensible manner.\n\nSee what I did there? I let my instinctual perception of the law as being politically, economically and socially \u2018right\u2019 cloud my judgment of whether or not it ought to be considered constitutionally justifiable.\n\nSo, is it truly constitutionally justifiable?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been mulling over this question in my head for over a year now. I don\u2019t think it is. I think it sets a dangerous precedent to justify taxation of inaction.\n\nQuestions like \u201cIf a law passed trying to tax me for my lack of red hair, would that be constitutionally justifiable?\u201d sound juvenile. But in this case, they aren\u2019t useless questions.\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back, ignore the noise from Congress about the law\u2019s implementation for a moment and put ourselves in the seat of a Supreme Court justice.\n\nIs a law like this \u2014 a tax on inaction \u2014 no matter how politically, economically or socially sensible it may appear, actually justifiable under the United States Constitution?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Pipe Dream", "description": "Let\u2019s take a step back, ignore the noise from Congress about the law\u2019s implementation for a moment and put ourselves in the seat of a Supreme Court justice.", "title": "Obamacare is due for a checkup", "url": "http://www.bupipedream.com/opinion/23762/obamacare-is-due-for-a-checkup/", "image": "http://www.bupipedream.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/JakeEth\u00e9-GRAY-copy-1024x682.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"expiration_time": "2013-10-08", "published_time": "2013-10-04T01:10:24EDT", "section": "Columns", "author": "http://www.bupipedream.com/author/jethe/"}, "fb": {"admins": 1352160452}, "twitter": {"site": "@bupipedream", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87fb\"", "article_summary": "The 2010 Affordable Care Act, often termed \u201cObamaCare,\u201d which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012, is a case of the converse.\nMore entrants into the pool means lower premiums, which makes it easier for those who cannot afford health insurance to purchase it.\nWhether or not the act is truly constitutionally \u2018right\u2019 needs to be reexamined.\nA central piece of the Affordable Care Act is its individual mandate, a provision that compels citizens to purchase health insurance.\nConstitutional merit can't be taken for grantedThe United States Supreme Court holds an intrinsic institutional mandate to be both cold and calculating."}
