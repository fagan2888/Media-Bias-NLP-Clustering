And trying to get right-hander Jordan Lyles ready for his start on Monday against the Phillies.\n\nOf all the injuries, Dickerson\u2019s is the most worrisome right now.\n\nHe aggravated the plantar fasciitis in his left foot while running in the outfield Saturday night. When he made a sudden stop on the warning track, the conditioned flared up. A trip to the 15-day disabled list is a possibility, though Dickerson said he doesn\u2019t think it would help.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that time would help,\u201d he said. \u201cTo heal it, it will take a lot of time, or tearing (the tissue in his foot), to get better. So I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nDickerson is frustrated by the injury, especially because his foot was feeling better on Saturday before he aggravated it.\n\n\u201cYesterday was the best it has ever felt, and I was running well,\u201d Dickerson said.\n\nManager Walt Weiss said he\u2019s concerned about Dickerson\u2019s injury. Asked if putting Dickerson on the disabled list was a possibility, Weiss said: \u201cYeah, but not today, not right now. We will see how it plays out for a couple of days. But it is concerning, because we do know the nature of that injury. It doesn\u2019t go away. He\u2019s been dealing with it. \u2018Doogie\u2019 and the staff have been doing a great job with it. But he\u2019s sore today.\u201d\n\nTulowitzki was out of that starting lineup for the second straight game after experiencing tightness in his left quad in the third inning of Friday night\u2019s game. Tulo went through agility drills Sunday morning and did well. According to manager Walt Weiss, the shortstop would be available to pinch hit \u201cif we have a chance to win the game.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still not clear when Tulo will be back in the starting lineup.\n\nDe La Rosa, who was sensational in beating the Dodgers Saturday night \u2014 allowing no runs on just two hits with no walks and three strikeouts in 7 1.3 innings \u2014 did some light jogging Sunday morning. He re-injured the left groin that cost him the first two weeks of the regular season.\n\n\u201cI hope I can make my next start,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it was early in the season. We have to test it out.\u201d\n\nLyles, who suffered a nasty contusion on his right hand when the Angels\u2019 Albert Pujols hit a wicked comebacker at him last week, is still scheduled to start on Monday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still some swelling,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a lot better than I thought it would be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Corey Dickerson,Jordan Lyles,Jorge De La Rosa,Troy Tulowitzki,Walt Weiss", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Rockies trainer Keith Dugger is trying to got Troy Tulowitzki, Jorge De La Rosa,  Corey Dickerson and Jordan Lyles back on the field.", "title": "Rockies injury updates on Tuloi, Dickerson, De La Rosa, Lyles", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/05/17/rockies-injury-updates-on-tulowitzki-dickerson-de-la-rosa-lyles/20095/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/04/corey-dickerson.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Rockies trainer Keith Dugger is trying to got Troy Tulowitzki, Jorge De La Rosa,  Corey Dickerson and Jordan Lyles back on the field.", "title": "Rockies injury updates on Tulowitzki, Dickerson, De La Rosa, Lyles", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/05/17/rockies-injury-updates-on-tulowitzki-dickerson-de-la-rosa-lyles/20095/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/04/corey-dickerson.jpg", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rockies trainer Keith Dugger is trying to got Troy Tulowitzki, Jorge De La Rosa, Corey Dickerson and Jordan Lyles back on the field."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc584\"", "article_summary": "He aggravated the plantar fasciitis in his left foot while running in the outfield Saturday night.\nHe\u2019s trying to got Troy Tulowitzki, Jorge De La Rosa and Corey Dickerson back on the field.\nLos Angeles \u2014 Rockies trainer Keith Dugger was a very busy man Sunday morning before the Rockies played the Dodgers.\nAsked if putting Dickerson on the disabled list was a possibility, Weiss said: \u201cYeah, but not today, not right now.\nSo I don\u2019t know.\u201dDickerson is frustrated by the injury, especially because his foot was feeling better on Saturday before he aggravated it."}
