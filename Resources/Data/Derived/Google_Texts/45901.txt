A Republican congressman lamented during a Capitol Hill hearing on Tuesday that Democrats who would constantly “bitch and whine” about George W. Bush don’t seem to be concerned at all about how President Obama uses his power.

Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador made the comments during a Tuesday House Judiciary Committee titled, “The President’s Constitutional Duty to Faithfully Execute the Laws.”

“I’m surprised that my friends on the other side don’t think that this is an important hearing,” Labrador said, “because they seemed to bitch and whine for eight years about what the Bush administration did. And all of sudden they don’t seem to have one single concern about what this president is doing with his authority.”

At the beginning of the hearing Virginia Rep. Robert Goodlatte — the Republican chairman of the committee — accused the Obama administration of ignoring the “constitution’s carefully balanced separation of powers.”

“From ‘Obamacare’ to immigration, the current administration is picking and choosing which laws to enforce,” Goodlatte said.
