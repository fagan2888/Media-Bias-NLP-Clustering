Officials estimated that there were 100,000 uninsured Hawaii residents prior to the start of Obama\u00adcare this year.\n\nFewer than 8,000 residents successfully enrolled in the exchange as of the March deadline \u2014 among the lowest in the nation.\n\nA major part of the problem was consumers applying for subsidies to lower insurance costs via the Connector were first directed to the Department of Human Services\u2019 (DHS) $100 million Kolea system to determine whether they were eligible for Medicaid.\n\nThat caused a bottleneck of 11,000 unprocessed Connector applications because the Connector and Kolea systems are incompatible.\n\n\u201cIf there was backlog, it was most likely due to the time it took to process Medicaid denials,\u201d Kali said.\n\nThe state technology office is proposing to build an integrated system that will service both the exchange and DHS\u2019 Kolea system, Kali said.\n\nBefore that system is built, the state wants to direct those looking for insurance to Hawaii.gov.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to attract more people,\u201d Kali said. \u201cOur Hawaii.gov portal experiences 2.9 million unique visitors (per year), 10 times the amount of traffic from either the Connector or Kolea. We\u2019d like to cast a wider net.\u201d\n\nKali said there would be minimal cost for adding a health insurance link to the Hawaii.gov website.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really skeptical any of this you\u2019re talking about is really going to happen, but it\u2019s heartening to hear you say it\u2019s going to be a low-cost portal,\u201d said House Health Committee Chairwoman Della Au Belatti, D, Moiliili-Makiki-Tantalus.\n\nTom Matsuda, the Connector\u2019s interim executive director, said the Connector and Medicaid\u2019s combined sign-ups totaled 43,746 through mid-July. He said the Connector is supporting the state\u2019s plan to use the Hawaii.gov website to drive traffic to ACA and Medicaid programs.\n\nMeanwhile the Connector is facing a budget crunch. It received $204.3 million in federal funds to begin operations, but that money is set to expire at the end of this year. Matsuda said the Connector is still \u201cfiguring out how to reduce operating expenses\u201d after the Legislature funded just one-third \u2014 $1.5 million \u2014 of its $4.7 million request to operate in the first half of next year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a number of things we\u2019re exploring now to see how we can reduce expenses,\u201d he said. \u201cOur perspective is we have to make it work. We have to figure out how to maximize the resources we do have available to fulfill our requirements under the ACA.\u201d\n\nThe federal government didn\u2019t grant the Connector an extension to spend what is remaining of the federal dollars beyond this year, and its main source of revenue, outside of the money from the Legislature, is a 2 percent fee on health insurance plans sold on the exchange.\n\nMatsuda said there may be a way to extend the federal grant. The federal government will allow what is considered to be funds for development of the exchange to be used in 2015. Grant money for ongoing maintenance and operations can\u2019t be used beyond this year.\n\n\u201cThrough the budgeting process we can try to maximize our ability to use development funds, anything related to the establishment of the exchange,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, the Connector\u2019s board of directors has begun the search for a permanent executive director, Matsuda said. The application period closes at the end of the month, and a new head is expected to be selected around October.\n\n\u00a92014 The Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "The state-run site will be used to attract roughly 75,000 currently uninsured Hawaii residents \u2014 or 5.5 percent of the population \u2014 during the Connector\u2019s next enrollment period", "pubDate": "2014-07-23", "og": {"title": "Website Proposed to Boost Health Insurance Enrollment in Hawaii"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/state", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "State", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f49\"", "article_summary": "The state is stepping in to create a single website to boost Obama\u00adcare enrollment after a bungled first attempt left thousands of applicants without health insurance.\nWe\u2019d like to cast a wider net.\u201dKali said there would be minimal cost for adding a health insurance link to the Hawaii.gov website.\nThe state technology office is proposing to build an integrated system that will service both the exchange and DHS\u2019 Kolea system, Kali said.\nThat caused a bottleneck of 11,000 unprocessed Connector applications because the Connector and Kolea systems are incompatible.\nFewer than 8,000 residents successfully enrolled in the exchange as of the March deadline \u2014 among the lowest in the nation."}
