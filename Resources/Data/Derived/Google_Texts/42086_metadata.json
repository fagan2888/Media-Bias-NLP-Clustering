Ukraine's military reportedly is seeking to implement a renewed cease-fire with Russian-backed separatists. Eric FeferbergAFP/Getty Images\n\nIn hopes of pursuing a renewed cease-fire agreement, the Ukrainian military has stopped shooting at Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country, which has been embroiled in fighting for eight months.\n\n[READ: Russian President Vladimir Putin Asserts Right to Crimea in Ukraine]\n\nUkrainian General Staff Chief Viktor Muzhenko, head of Ukraine's armed forces, said the country hopes a cessation of hostilities Tuesday in the provinces of Donetsk and Lukhansk will last until more permanent measures can be put into place.\n\n\u201cSeeking to implement the peace plan, we are introducing a cease-fire regime, the so-called regime of silence, at 10 a.m. on Dec. 9,\" Muzhenko said, according to the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. \u201cThe regime of silence will take effect today and we will discuss the fulfillment of other stabilization measures in eastern Ukraine when we have guarantees that hostilities have really been halted.\u201d\n\nHowever, Muzhenko said two shooting incidents already have breached the cease-fire attempt, which follows a cease-fire agreement reached in Minsk, Belarus, in September that also has been repeatedly violated. According to the U.N., more than 4,300 people have died in the fighting, which began in mid-April, and hundreds of thousands have been displaced.\n\n\n\nRussia Intervenes in Crimea EXPAND GALLERY Photo Gallery x of x Full Screen Ukraine's fugitive former president, Viktor Yanukovych, makes his first public appearance since Saturday during a news conference Friday in Rostov-on-Don, a city in southern Russia about 600 miles from Moscow. \"I intend to keep fighting for the future of Ukraine,\" he said, and denied that he fled after being ousted.

The end game is going to be played in the court of diplomacy, and the best vehicle we see for achieving that is the full implementation of the Minsk agreement,\u201d Pyatt said\n\n\n\n[ALSO: Ukraine Death Toll Now More Than 4,300, U.N. Says]\n\nThe U.S. has attempted to use sanctions to pressure Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine. The measures, also implemented by Europe, target Russian individuals, corporations and industries in an attempt to create financial penalties and force Russian President Vladimir Putin to back off. The Russian economy has been struggling in wake of the sanctions, and is predicted to enter a recession next year.\n\nThe Russian government, however, continues to maintain it is not arming rebels in Ukraine, while the West says Russia is responsible for fueling the fighting. In a speech to his country\u2019s parliament last week, Putin said Crimea \u2013 a region annexed from Ukraine by Russia in March \u2013 is the same to Russians as the Temple Mount in Jerusalem is to Jews.\n\n\u201cCrimea is where our people live, and the peninsula is of strategic importance for Russia as the spiritual source of the development of a multifaceted but solid Russian nation and a centralized Russian state,\u201d Putin said.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "foreign policy", "title": "New Cease-Fire Hoped For Between Ukrainian Military and Russian-Backed Separatists", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The Ukrainian military and Russia-backed separatists also are expected to hold talks in an effort to resolve tensions.", "title": "Ukraine Attempts Another Cease-Fire", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/12/09/new-cease-fire-hoped-for-between-ukrainian-military-and-russian-backed-separatists", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/df/c5/ed8e7bec48dc998d655782c4236a/141209-ukraine-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Ukrainian military and Russia-backed separatists also are expected to hold talks in an effort to resolve tensions.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "New Cease-Fire Hoped For Between Ukrainian Military and Russian-Backed Separatists"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 9, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Teresa Welsh,Pulse,picks,Russia,Ukraine,Putin, Vladimir,foreign policy", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Ukrainian military and Russia-backed separatists also are expected to hold talks in an effort to resolve tensions."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb28b\"", "article_summary": "Andrew Lubimov/AP x of x Russian soldiers guard the entrance to the Sevastopol military airport Friday.\nAndrew Lubimov/AP x of x Full Screen Russian soldiers guard the entrance to the Sevastopol military airport Friday.\nSean Gallup/Getty Images x of x Full Screen Armed men patrol on Friday outside of Simferopol International Airport.\nSean Gallup/Getty Images x of x Armed men patrol on Friday outside of Simferopol International Airport.\nUkraine's military reportedly is seeking to implement a renewed cease-fire with Russian-backed separatists."}
