Charles Schumer of New York pointedly second-guessed President Obama\u2019s decision to push sweeping health care legislation in 2010, when Americans were more concerned with the state of the economy and their economic futures.\n\n\u201cAfter passing the stimulus, Democrats should have continued to propose middle-class oriented programs and built on the partial success of the stimulus. But unfortunately, Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them. We took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem \u2014 health care reform. Now the plight of uninsured Americans and the hardships caused by unfair insurance company practices certainly needed to be addressed, but it was not the change we were hired to make. Americans were crying out for the end to the recession, for better wages and more jobs, not changes in health care. \u2026\n\n\u201cTo aim a huge change in mandate at such a small percentage of the electorate made no political sense. So when Democrats focused on health care, the average middle-class person thought the Democrats are not paying enough attention to me.\u201d\n\nOK. \u2026 But wait. Senator Schumer admits the Democrats got \u201canother chance \u201d in 2013 to convince the middle class the Democrats had \u201can effective way out of [its] morass.\u201d Incomes were still stagnant, Schumer points out. Voters were still overwhelmingly concerned with their economic prospects. And in 2013 Schumer chose to push \u2026 \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform.\u201d Legalization! Guest workers! Imported high-skilled tech labor! Schumer\u2019s \u201cGang of 8\u201d immigration bill consumed much of Washington\u2019s media-political energy for 2 years.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t think (as I do) that the \u201cgang\u201d bill would actually hurt the economic fortunes of many middle class Americans by importing competing, cheaper workers to bid down their salaries, it was hardly the sort of economic fix Schumer says the middle class was demanding. Even more than Obamacare, it failed to give ordinary mid-income voters the impression that Democrats were \u201cpaying enough attention to me.\u201d Quite the contrary. They were paying attention to Rep. Gutierrez, the Chamber of Commerce, and David Brooks.\n\nSchumer\u2019s immigration push conspicuously flunks the first two of the five tests he gives for a successful Democratic policy\u2013it doesn\u2019t \u201cdirectly benefit\u201d middle class incomes and any effect is not\u201dsimple and easily explained.\u201d (It also doesn\u2019t satisfy the middle prong of a separate three-prong test Schumer announces: it doesn\u2019t show that Democrats will \u201ctake on \u2026 special interests.\u201d)\n\nJust like Obama, it seems, Schumer had a his own agenda \u2014 stimulus, check! global warming, check! amnesty, check! \u2014 and he was determined to go down this desk-work checklist no matter what the economy or the electorate seemed to require. Maybe he was especially determined if it was a bill he and his staff had largely written \u2014 a bill that would get him on the Sunday talk shows with some regularity.\n\nWe\u2019re always most righteous when we are guilty ourselves.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mickey Kaus", "description": "In a satisfying moment of intramural recrimination this week, Sen.
