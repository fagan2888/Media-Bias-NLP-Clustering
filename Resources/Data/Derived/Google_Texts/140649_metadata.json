They accomplished something historic.\n\nSoutheast Denver on Saturday will play its first game in the Cal Ripken World Series in Aberdeen, Md., becoming just the second team from Colorado to reach that pinnacle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big accomplishment,\u201d Dinges said. \u201cThey are all friends who support each other. They have worked really hard and share a love of baseball. I think that\u2019s what has gotten them to this point.\u201d\n\nCal Ripken Baseball, a division of the Babe Ruth League, is similar to Little League with several key exceptions. In Little League, the pitching mound is 46 feet from the plate and bases are 60 feet apart. The Cal Ripken dimensions are 50 feet and 70 feet. Players can also lead off in Cal Ripken Baseball, unlike their Little League counterparts.\n\n\u201cIt really prepares them for the game at the next level,\u201d said Southeast Denver Baseball and Softball League president Gregg Palmer.\n\nIn order to reach the World Series, which will include nine other American teams and eight international squads, Southeast Denver had to win a district, state and regional tournament.\n\nIn the Midwest Plains regional tournament in Baxter, Minn., Southeast Denver went 4-0, beating teams from Minnesota, Missouri and Kansas.\n\n\u201cI was speechless,\u201d said infielder Aidan Flores. \u201cI knew there had only been one other team from Colorado to make it, so when we won, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nThe reality is sinking in now. The team will leave for Maryland on Thursday and will play Saturday against a team from Homewood, Ill., the representative of the Ohio Valley region. The championship game on Aug. 16 will air on CBS Sports Network.\n\nOn Wednesday, the players received a warm send-off from Gov. John Hickenlooper at the state capitol.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be where we are,\u201d said infielder Keegan Feeley. \u201cWe are trying to make the most of it and play to the best of our abilities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Southeast Denver 12-year-old team makes Cal Ripken World Series", "title": "Southeast Denver 12-year-old team makes Cal Ripken World Series", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/06/southeast-denver-12-year-old-team-makes-cal-ripken-world-series/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-06T16:41:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-06T16:41:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In the Midwest Plains regional tournament in Baxter, Minn., Southeast Denver went 4-0, beating teams from Minnesota, Missouri and Kansas.\nSoutheast Denver on Saturday will play its first game in the Cal Ripken World Series in Aberdeen, Md., becoming just the second team from Colorado to reach that pinnacle.\nWhen Dustin Dinges gathered his team of Southeast Denver Baseball League 12-year-old all-stars for their first practices at the end of June, he had a feeling the group could do something special.\nIn order to reach the World Series, which will include nine other American teams and eight international squads, Southeast Denver had to win a district, state and regional tournament.\nPlayers can also lead off in Cal Ripken Baseball, unlike their Little League counterparts."}
