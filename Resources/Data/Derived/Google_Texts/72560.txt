The digital debut of “Hamilton” was an unmitigated flop.

An online lottery intended to make scoring cheap tickets to the hit Broadway musical easier — and warmer — crashed the website offering the deal, sending fans back out into the cold Wednesday.

More than 50,000 theatergoers itching to get a coveted $10 ticket to the sold-out show overloaded Broadway Direct’s site Tuesday — the online debut of the lottery, which was moved to cyberspace in an effort to ease overcrowding outside the Richard Rodgers Theatre on West 46th Street.

The show’s creator and star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, tried to quell anxiety, assuring his fans that the IT department was working on getting the site running again — but that people were going to just have to “wait for it.”

Twenty-one tickets were up for grabs — and all fans clicked out empty-handed.

“Got so close to entering the @HamiltonMusical lottery, but it went back to error messages when I tried to submit my info…SOMEDAY!” lamented one fan on Twitter.

Miranda said the system sent out “you’ve won” emails to more people than seats. “Which is the sh–iest,” Miranda tweeted.

The show’s official Twitter page announced that because of the glitch, no one would get tickets.

“The tickets for #Ham4Ham will go unsold and unused in an effort to be fair to everyone,” it tweeted Tuesday evening.

On Wednesday, dozens of people crowded around the Midtown theater — as the website was still trying to work out the kinks.
