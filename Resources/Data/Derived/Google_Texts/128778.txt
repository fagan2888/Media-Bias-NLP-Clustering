It is important for us all to vote, even if it is for the lesser of two evils. Anybody who doesn’t vote sabotages our democracy. If many people don’t vote, the results are not really the desire of American citizens. Worst of all, people not voting could cause the worst candidate to become president (read, Donald Trump).

We cannot have a president who focuses on bigotry. I worry about what the world leaders think of Trump, especially leaders of Islamic nations. I have serious misgivings about Trump being commander-in-chief. Violence has happened only at Trump rallies. Unfortunately, Trump’s success has been unpredictable time and again. Don’t think that he would never get elected.

It is not so cut and dried about Hillary Clinton. The email situation depends on whether the message was classified at that time. Many people have an opinion of Clinton that has been molded by Republican propaganda, especially “pathological liar.” I ask anybody who has that opinion, “Do you really trust any of the candidates?” All politicians will distort the truth in order to get votes. Lincoln was called “Honest Abe,” but that isn’t today’s politicians. Clinton is the best qualified. Her idea to improve Obamacare is the way to go.

If Bernie Sanders becomes the nominee, I would vote for him mainly as the lesser of two evils. Some of his ideas can’t be implemented. He has not said how he would pay for his ideas, especially free college tuition. Taxes is a dirty word.
