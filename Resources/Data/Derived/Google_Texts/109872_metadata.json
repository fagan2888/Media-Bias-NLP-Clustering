Barton has been charged in connection with the origin of the Hayman wildfire, the largest in Colorado history. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith RG/MMR - RTR6IC4\n\n4201660\n\nColorado Attorney General John Suthers, one of three Republicans to hold statewide office in what is otherwise a state dominated by Democrats, is considering running for mayor of Colorado Springs, the state\u2019s second most populous city.\n\nSuthers\u2019 term ends in 2015 and due to term limits, he\u2019s unable to run for re-election.\n\n\u201cI am very fortunate that I have lots of options,\u201d Suthers told the Colorado Springs Gazette. \u201cI am considering a run for mayor, and I will make up my mind in September.\u201d\n\nSuthers was first appointed attorney general in 2005, to replace Ken Salazar, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate. He won the seat in general elections in 2006 and 2010.\n\nSuthers was one of 12 state attorneys general to file suit against the federal government on the same day the Affordable Care Act was passed.\n\nSuthers was also vehemently opposed to the passage of Amendment 64, which legalized marijuana in Colorado for adults in 2012. Yet, once it was passed, he announced that he would defend the amendment in court if challenged by federal authorities. He also advocated for passage of a taxing scheme for marijuana sales, saying in a statement at the time \u201cthe state must do the best job possible of implementing Amendment 64 and regulating the new recreational marijuana industry.\u201d\n\nCurrent Springs Mayor Steve Bach recently received a B grade from the Gazette for his performance as mayor, earning accolades for helping secure transportation funds, increasing public safety and adding new jobs to the local economic base.\n\nHe was dinged, however, for his lack of diplomacy.\n\n\u201cDespite an impressive record of achievements, Bach has garnered a reputation for not working well with others,\u201d the Gazette wrote. \u201cHis full-speed ahead approach to achieving goals often leaves other leaders feeling left out and/or disrespected. One Bach advocate suggested a fundraising event to pay for sending the mayor to charm school.\u201d\n\nBach hasn\u2019t said whether he will seek re-election.\n\nColorado Springs has a \u201cstrong mayor\u201d form of government in which the mayor is the city\u2019s chief executive and the City Council is its legislative branch.\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
