Every bid has proposed costs higher than originally estimated by the Bullock administration.\n\nFor example, if 25,000 people sign up for coverage under the program next year, Oregon-based PacificSource would charge the state as much as $12 million to manage the expansion \u2013 and perhaps a one-time technology fee of $632,000.\n\nThe Bullock administration had estimated that a private firm would charge about $6 million to manage the program next year, at that level of participation.\n\nIf thousands more sign up for the program, the costs get higher, because each company plans to charge a \u201cper member per month\u201d fee.\n\nState officials may decide this week which company gets the contract. The federal government also must decide whether to approve Montana\u2019s proposed expansion, including the private contractor.\n\nThe 2015 Legislature voted in April to expand Medicaid coverage in Montana, as part of the federal health-care overhaul under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nStarting next year, the government-funded coverage will pay medical bills for Montanans earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or 16,400 for a single person and $27,700 for a family of three.\n\nIt\u2019s been estimated that 70,000 poor Montanans are eligible for the coverage. The federal government pays for almost all the program\u2019s costs, estimated at $430 million the next two years.\n\nMontana would be the only state in the nation to use a private contractor to manage its entire Medicaid expansion. The contractor \u2013 a health-insurance firm \u2013 will collect premiums, process claims and handle other administrative duties of the program.\n\nBullock, a Democrat, proposed using a private contractor in his original Medicaid expansion plan this year. He said it\u2019s a good idea to use a health insurer with an existing network of health-care providers to manage the program.\n\nHe also said he doesn\u2019t think the feds will have a problem with Montana\u2019s private-contractor arrangement.\n\nFederal officials wouldn\u2019t comment Monday, but have said in the past they plan to negotiate with the state on approving the overall proposal.\n\nBullock\u2019s original proposal had a lesser estimated cost for the private contractor. But a compromise bill with Republicans asks the contractor to do much more, so the cost is higher.\n\nIf 25,000 people sign up next year for the program, the bidders and their proposed costs are:\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana -- $7.8 million for the first year. The per-member amount could drop the next year, if more than 25,000 are on the program. Blue Cross also may ask for reimbursement of up to $3.6 million in one-time technology costs.\n\nPacificSource \u2013 $12.3 million for the first year. The per-member cost would decline the next year if enrollment increases.\n\nStanford Health Plan -- $13.2 million for the first year, with no decline the next year.\n\nAllegiance Benefit Plan Management \u2013 Did not provide a cost estimate for the program\u2019s first six months. For the next six months, $4.5 million. For 2017, $9 million.\n\nAll four companies said they\u2019d increase the fee slightly in future years.\n\nThe initial cost would be lower, of course, if fewer people sign up \u2013 a strong possibility, since it\u2019s a new program. But if enrollment comes in higher, or once it increases in future years, the money going to the private manager will increase.\n\nFor example, if 70,000 people sign up by 2017, Blue Cross would be collecting $21.6 million in management fees that year.\n\nState officials began scoring the bids last week. So far, Blue Cross and Blue Shield has a slight lead over PacificSource in the scoring, with more evaluation to come this week.\n\nThe cost of the contract accounts for about one-third of the scoring. The company that scores the highest usually gets the contract.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The cost of hiring a private company to manage Montana\u2019s Medicaid expansion could be a few million dollars a year \u2013 or it could be a lot more.", "author": "Mike Dennison - MTN News", "og": {"url": "http://www.krtv.com/story/30028647/cost-of-private-firm-to-manage-medicaid-expansion-in-montana-wont-come-cheap", "image": "http://KXLH.images.worldnow.com/images/8797199_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The cost of hiring a private company to manage Montana\u2019s Medicaid expansion could be a few million dollars a year \u2013 or it could be a lot more.", "title": "Cost of private firm to manage Medicaid expansion in Montana won't come cheap"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KXLH.images.worldnow.com/images/8797199_G.jpg", "description": "The cost of hiring a private company to manage Montana\u2019s Medicaid expansion could be a few million dollars a year \u2013 or it could be a lot more.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cost of private firm to manage Medicaid expansion in Montana won't come cheap"}, "wnreadableurl": "cost-of-private-firm-to-manage-medicaid-expansion-in-montana-wont-come-cheap", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KXLH", "fb": {"app_id": 161591973908016}, "date": "2015/09/14", "KEYWORDS": "Great Falls, Montana, News, news, breaking news, weather, CBS", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS03", "news_keywords": "Great Falls, Montana, News, news, breaking news, weather, CBS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfaa2\"", "article_summary": "Montana would be the only state in the nation to use a private contractor to manage its entire Medicaid expansion.\nThe 2015 Legislature voted in April to expand Medicaid coverage in Montana, as part of the federal health-care overhaul under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\nThe cost of hiring a private company to manage Montana\u2019s Medicaid expansion could be a few million dollars a year \u2013 or it could be a lot more.\nBullock, a Democrat, proposed using a private contractor in his original Medicaid expansion plan this year.\nFour health-insurance firms bid on the contract to manage the expansion of Medicaid, which will provide health coverage for thousands of poor Montanans."}
