Enter Joe Buck, Greg Norman and Fox Sports.\n\nFor the first time in 20 years, the colorful NBC peacock won\u2019t be lighting up the TV screen during one of golf\u2019s most colorful events \u2014 the U.S. Open, which begins Thursday at Chambers Bay Golf Club in northern Washington.\n\nFox\u2019s entry into the big-time golf world is a direct result of the network\u2019s creation of Fox Sports 1, the cable outlet that premiered in August 2013, teaming with regular Fox Sports.\n\nFox executives, promising the dual operation would become a big-time player in the sports world, immediately outbid NBC for the prestigious USGA package \u2014 a 12-year deal that includes the U.S. Senior Open (June 25-28) in Sacramento, Calif., and the U.S. Women\u2019s Open (July 9-12) in Lancaster, Pa.\n\nFox is trumpeting a \u201cnew look\u201d for its U.S. Open coverage, which will be aired live in prime time for four nights beginning Thursday.\n\nThe schedule is Thursday and Friday: 10 a.m.-6 p.m. on Fox Sports 1; 6-9 p.m. on Fox.\n\nSaturday: noon-8 p.m. on Fox; Sunday: noon-8:30 p.m. on Fox.\n\nThe schedule will produce tournament coverage during evening hours in the ratings-rich Eastern time zone.\n\nAnother viewing enticement: The Chambers course, called \u201cthe most visually spectacular course on the planet\u201d by Alan Shipnuck of SI.com, is only eight years old, allowing armchair golfers to enjoy a new golf journey.\n\nBuck, a seven-time sports Emmy Award winner for his play-by-play work on NFL and Major League Baseball games, is of proven quality. Norman? He will be under a huge microscope as an analyst after telling several golf publications that he will provide commentary \u201cin his own way.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind the majority of baseball, football and basketball fans have never \u201cplayed the game\u201d at a high level.\n\nGolf is different. Thousands of armchair \u201cduffers\u201d will watch and have definite opinions about the coverage of Norman, Buck and other Fox team members.\n\nArvada native Joel Klatt, who found football fame as a CU Buffs quarterback, is part of the analyzing-reporting team. Others include Tom Weiskopf, Corey Pavin and Brad Faxon.\n\nAlthough NBC lost live coverage, the Golf Channel, owned by Comcast-NBC, will offer 60 hours of pretournament coverage beginning Monday.\n\nA highlight: A roundtable discussion (2 p.m. Wednesday) examining the players and a look at Chambers Bay.\n\nMeanwhile, NBC Sports, stung by the loss of USGA coverage, opened its bank vault last week to outbid ABC-ESPN for the British Open beginning in 2017.\n\nABC-ESPN began coverage in 1962. The new NBC deal includes Golf Channel coverage in early rounds, plus exclusive coverage of other British golf events.\n\nHow determined was NBC to regain golf prominence? Several sources, including The New York Times, reported NBC-Comcast paid the R&A company $50 million \u2014 double the current contract of ABC-ESPN.\n\nRatings roulette. The Warriors-Cavaliers championship series is producing the largest audience ABC has had since beginning NBA championship coverage in 2003.\n\nThrough Thursday, viewing was up 26 percent over the first four-game of the Spurs-Heat series last year. More than 19.8 million viewers \u2014 an ABC coverage record \u2014 viewed Thursday night\u2019s game.\n\nMeanwhile, the Blackhawks-Lightning Stanley Cup battle on NBCSN and NBC also is an audience winner, showing 7 percent audience growth over last season after five games.\n\nLongtime Denver journalist Dusty Saunders writes about sports media each Monday in The Denver Post. Contact him at tvtime@comcast.net.\n\nTwo Broncos so far find way into Top 100\n\nThe NFL Network\u2019s Top 100 Players of 2015 lists Broncos wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders No. 95 and outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware at 87.\n\nStill to come (10 are named every Wednesday night) is the top 50. Last year\u2019s preseason poll of players, journalists and NFL executives listed Peyton Manning as No. 1.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dusty Saunders: Fox Sports gears up for first U.S. Open golf tournament", "title": "Dusty Saunders: Fox Sports gears up for first U.S. Open golf tournament", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/14/dusty-saunders-fox-sports-gears-up-for-first-u-s-open-golf-tournament/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-14T20:32:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T07:19:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Although NBC lost live coverage, the Golf Channel, owned by Comcast-NBC, will offer 60 hours of pretournament coverage beginning Monday.\nThe new NBC deal includes Golf Channel coverage in early rounds, plus exclusive coverage of other British golf events.\nThe schedule is Thursday and Friday: 10 a.m.-6 p.m. on Fox Sports 1; 6-9 p.m. on Fox.\nThousands of armchair \u201cduffers\u201d will watch and have definite opinions about the coverage of Norman, Buck and other Fox team members.\nMeanwhile, NBC Sports, stung by the loss of USGA coverage, opened its bank vault last week to outbid ABC-ESPN for the British Open beginning in 2017."}
