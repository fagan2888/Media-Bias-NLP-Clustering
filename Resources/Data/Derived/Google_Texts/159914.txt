For many years, historians have been trying to solve the mystery behind Stonehenge. Though a wide range of tests and excavations were carried out at the spot, researchers could not find any clue to solve the mystery.

Recently the garden hose gave some clues about the mystery. The grass around the Stonehenge is watered to keep it look healthy. This year the caretakers could not water the south west areas as they found their hose was small. Therefore, the water could not reach to the Stonehenge and the grass around it became dry leaving the behind parched grass. This showed the location of the missing stones, which once had filled the entire circle.

Experts said that past heat waves have highlighted the outlines of the Roman forts, Iron Age earthworks and the remains of Stone Age monuments as well.

Worker Tim Daw said he was standing on the public path gazing the grass near the stone when suddenly he realized that the dried marks were the evidence for which archaeologists had been looking for without any success. He and his colleagues later called archaeologists for further research.

Tim said he is astonished and very pleased that simply looking at something can reveal such tough mysteries that could not be revealed by sophisticated machineries as well.

Susan Greaney from English Heritage said that it was a fabulous finding and there are still many mysteries about Stonehenge that are yet to be unveiled.

Greaney said that it is really great that people who know about the site very well and generally look at it on a daily basis were easily able to recognize the parch marks and further were able to know what they were.

Adding to it, she said this latest discovery tells us that there is still so much we have to learn about Stonehenge.
