The Lodi home asked Hernandez to represent her in making decisions about her care.\n\n\u201cHow did she get there? Who signed her out?\u201d asked Hernandez, the long-term care ombudsman program director for San Joaquin County, where Lodi is located.\n\nHernandez met with the woman. Then she complained to the California Department of Public Health, prompting an investigation of Vintage Faire.\n\nThe story widened. The Modesto home had shipped a total of seven long-term residents in March to two sister nursing homes in San Joaquin County, according to state records. One resident said she had only 15 minutes to decide whether to go.\n\nVintage Faire failed to notify most families and friends of the transfers. At least four of the residents, all women, were diagnosed as severely mentally impaired.\n\nOne mentally challenged woman later told a state investigator that she walked the 38 miles from Modesto to Lodi, demonstrating by moving her legs back and forth, records say. Another woman said that \u201cshe did not know why she was there, how she got there or where she was.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was shocking to me that someone would do that, that a facility would just send them out like that,\u201d Hernandez said in an interview.\n\nHer complaint led to a state finding that Vintage Faire had transferred the residents \u201cwithout medical justification as necessary for resident welfare, needs or safety,\u201d a violation of federal regulations. The fine: $2,000.\n\nA key question remains unanswered: Why did Vintage Faire want to transfer those patients?\n\nThe facility won\u2019t comment, citing the fact that it has appealed the citation.\n\nBut according to hundreds of records obtained by The Bee under the state Public Records Act, the home\u2019s staff told some residents and families that it was removing long-term residents to make room for more short-term patients.\n\n\u201cIt says that right in the citation. It\u2019s pretty darned explicit,\u201d said Tony Chicotel, staff attorney with California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, or CANHR, a San Francisco-based nonprofit. He said he has seen similar cases at other homes.\n\nChicotel said \u201cshort term\u201d is code for higher-paying Medicare patients and that long-term refers to residents on low-paying Medi-Cal insurance for the poor.\n\nAndrew F. Torok, general counsel for Covenant Care, which owns Vintage Faire and more than 50 other facilities, would not comment on the transfers by Vintage Faire. But he said his company doesn\u2019t engage in transferring long-term residents for monetary gain.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how we operate,\u201d Torok said. \u201cOur culture is one of doing the right thing, for the right reason. It would be absolutely unthinkable that we would do something like this.\u201d\n\nIn a corrective plan sent to the state, the facility said it would assure \u201csafe and proper discharges in accordance with federal requirements.\u201d It promised to audit long-term care discharges for three months and review patterns of noncompliance.\n\nOn average in California, Medicare pays nursing homes roughly three times the daily rate that Medicaid pays. That\u2019s because Medicare pays for short-term, intensive rehabilitation after a hospital stay while Medicaid \u2013 known as Medi-Cal in California \u2013 pays for long-term care.\n\nLast year, a typical Medicare stay in a nursing home lasted 51 days, according to Medicare data. A Medicaid stay could last several years, often until a resident\u2019s death.\n\nState records do not show if the seven residents were on Medi-Cal.\n\nDeborah Pacyna, a spokeswoman for the California Association of Health Facilities, said she is not familiar with the Vintage Faire case and could not comment. She cautioned, however, against assuming a single example could signal an underlying trend.\n\n\u201cWe reject any allegations that patient admissions or discharges are tied to payment sources,\u201d Pacyna wrote in an email.\n\nPatients later evaluated\n\nThe woman known as Resident 1 had lived at Vintage Faire for nearly 15 years when the home approached her.\n\nAn aide told state investigators that the woman was asked if \u201cit was OK to transfer her, and she said it was.\u201d\n\nSo Resident 1 was placed in a van on March 27, bound for the Arbor nursing home 38 miles away in Lodi.\n\nHer story, and that of the six other transferred residents, is described in the July 6, 2015, citation that the state issued to Vintage Faire. The citation refers to them as Residents 1 through 7 to protect their privacy.\n\nThe day after Resident 1\u2019s transfer, a state evaluator visited Arbor and talked with the woman in her new room, filled with Barbie dolls, toy firetrucks and a dollhouse-sized firehouse. The woman stated \u201cfireman\u201d and pointed at the firehouse.\n\n\u201cResident 1 nodded her head or said \u2018yes\u2019 to questions but was unable to respond in complete sentences,\u201d according to state records. She was interviewed to assess her cognitive ability, scoring 0 on a scale of 0 to 15. Any score of less than 7 is considered \u201csevere cognitive impairment,\u201d the records state.\n\nTwo other transferred residents scored 5 and 3 on the same scale.\n\nAnother woman, Resident 4, a Cantonese speaker and a resident since 2007, is described in records as \u201cseverely impaired \u2013 never/rarely makes decisions.\u201d\n\nA man described in the state records as her \u201cresponsible party\u201d said Vintage Faire contacted him the day she left, to say she was being transferred and that the home was \u201cgetting rid\u201d of long-term residents. He said her relatives could not easily visit her in Lodi because of transportation problems.\n\nHer family had visited her frequently in Modesto, speaking in Cantonese and bringing home-cooked food that she ate with them in the dining room, where she always ate, records say. In Lodi, she ate most meals in her room.\n\nResident 7\u2019s friend found her missing just two days after bringing her fresh laundry. Vintage Faire had moved her to Arbor without notifying the friend, who held power of attorney for her health care needs. The facility\u2019s staff said they could not locate the paperwork.\n\n\u201cThey just sent her. She was not prepared,\u201d the friend said.\n\nArbor\u2019s staff wrote in her clinical record that she described herself as depressed and frustrated, saying, \u201cThings just aren\u2019t going well for me.\u201d\n\nVintage Faire\u2019s director, who is not named in state records, told investigators that she received a call in March from the company\u2019s regional director of operations, telling her that another facility had some open long-term beds and that any resident who wanted could transfer there.\n\nThe home\u2019s director said she told two social services aides to make the offer to alert, oriented residents. The aides were not adequately trained, she added, and she should have supervised them.\n\nIndustry changing\n\nMassive changes are sweeping nursing homes nationally as the so-called silver tsunami of aging baby boomers demands more medical care.\n\nIndustry officials and senior advocates agree that those changes mean more seniors are receiving Medicare short-term care in long-term facilities statewide.\n\nBut while the industry calls such care an essential role for those facilities, some advocates say it has the potential for squeezing out long-term residents covered by much lower Medi-Cal disbursements.\n\nSeniors often receive Medicare-financed rehabilitation after being hospitalized for strokes and hip and knee surgeries.\n\nFor many nursing homes, that has opened the door to charging Medicare increasingly higher rates for physical and occupational therapy, including \u201cultra high,\u201d the most expensive of five categories of Medicare-financed therapy.\n\nUltra-high therapy rates range from less than $500 to nearly $800 per day. By comparison, Medi-Cal pays $110 to about $275 per day, depending on location.\n\nIn California, the share of Medicare patients in nursing homes has stayed at roughly 14 percent, an analysis by the Center for Health Reporting shows. At Vintage Faire, Medicare paid for 22 percent of its patients.\n\nWhat has grown significantly, however, is the share of short-term patients receiving \u201cultra high\u201d therapy.\n\nIn 2014, the share of nursing home Medicare patients receiving such therapy stood at 58 percent nationally and 66 percent in California.\n\nThe same year, 72 percent of Medicare patients at Vintage Faire received \u201cultra-high\u201d therapy. Overall at the 56-home Covenant Care chain, the share was 83 percent.\n\nVintage Faire appeal pending\n\nThe full story of the seven Modesto residents will not be told until Vintage Faire\u2019s appeal is heard and decided. And that may not be soon.\n\nIn summer of 2008, the Modesto facility appealed two unrelated citations, totaling $1,700. More than seven years later, those twin appeals still have not been resolved.\n\nChicotel is still bothered by the $2,000 fine, which he calls too small to make nursing homes change their ways.\n\nThe $2,000 is the highest fine the Department of Public Health could issue for that type of citation, spokesman Corey Egel said. Larger fines are imposed only when a violation directly leads to a death or presents \u201can imminent danger of death or serious harm.\u201d\n\nThe state could have at least fined Vintage Faire $2,000 for each resident, Chicotel said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably what they spent on canned pears in the course of a year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Andrew F.
