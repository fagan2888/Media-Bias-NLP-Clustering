Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the ranking members of the Finance and Judiciary committees respectively.\n\n\n\nA state senator raised concerns that the same provision may interfere with Hewlett-Packard\u2019s plan to hire Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont as a subcontractor on a state health IT project.\n\n\n\nHatch and Grassley sent a letter in June to Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, spelling out their concerns about Optum\u2019s involvement with federal and state exchanges.\n\nOptum is a division of United Health Group, which also owns health insurance giant United Healthcare. United Healthcare sells insurance through exchanges in at least 10 states, but not Vermont.\n\nAs a result of Optum\u2019s \u201ckey technical advisor position\u201d to the federal healthcare.gov exchange and its similar role in several state exchanges, the company has access to a \u201csignificant amount of highly sensitive data\u201d including payment calculations for reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridors and the data collected to support those functions, according to the senators.\n\n\u201cWe would like to make sure all potential conflicts of interest mitigated,\u201d they wrote in the letter, which requests that the Senate Finance Committee be provided with a trove of information about Optum\u2019s hiring.\n\nDays after the senators sent their letter to CMS, Optum CEO Andy Slavitt left the company to become Tavenner\u2019s deputy at CMS.\n\nA CMS spokesman said the agency \u201cfollows federal contracting guidelines, which require us to evaluate all contracts to ensure that they do not have any conflicts of interest before making an award.\u201d\n\nOptum has an \u201cinformational firewall\u201d to ensure \u201corganizational and physical separation,\u201d said Aaron Albright, a CMS spokesman, in an email.\n\nThe company has a policy whereby no employee with access to nonpublic information assigned to an exchange project will later be involved in the development of health coverage at United Healthcare, Albright added.\n\nOptum currently has a $15 million contract to play a leading role in fixing the underperforming Vermont Health Connect exchange.\n\nOptum has also placed bids for the state\u2019s Integrated Eligibility (IE) system and the customer call center portion of its Medicaid Managed Information System (MMIS), both of which directly support Vermont Health Connect. Both projects are heavily federally subsidized.\n\nThe MMIS and IE contracts are worth a combined $139 million. The MMIS contract is valued at $86 million, but it\u2019s unclear what the contract for just the call center would be worth.\n\nThe current MMIS call center, operated by Maximus, is the customer service line for Vermont Health Connect and the state\u2019s Medicaid program. State officials have consistently counted people who discovered that they were Medicaid-eligible through Vermont Health Connect in its count of ACA enrollees.\n\nThe Blue Cross contract\n\nThe same ACA provision could also scuttle Hewlett Packard\u2019s plan to subcontract with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont as part of its bid to remain the state\u2019s MMIS contractor.\n\nTwo sources with knowledge of Hewlett Packard\u2019s bid told VTDigger that it includes Blue Cross as a subcontractor to operate the call center. The sources asked to remain anonymous because the bids are sealed until a contract is awarded as part of the state\u2019s competitive bidding process. The contract is expected to be awarded in December.\n\nOfficials from Blue Cross and HP would not confirm if Blue Cross is part of HP\u2019s bid for the MMIS contract, citing the ongoing procurement process.\n\nState officials said they could not confirm Blue Cross\u2019 involvement either citing similar reasons.\n\n\u201cThe terms of the (request for proposals), the bids are subject to public records requests after the successful bidder has executed a contract, not before. Prior to contract selection the respective bids are considered confidential and proprietary in order to keep the process fair,\u201d said Mark Larson, commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access.\n\nState officials declined to address directly whether Optum or Blue Cross should be able to hold MMIS or IE contracts.\n\nLawrence Miller, chief of Health Care Reform, said Optum\u2019s current contract meets \u201call relevant federal standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would review any bid for any of the related IT or services contracts that are contemplated for the Health and Human Services Enterprise with the same considerations,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Human Services Enterprise is the state\u2019s name for the combined IT overhaul of human services that includes Vermont Health Connect, IE and MMIS.\n\nAt a recent legislative oversight meeting, Sen. Jane Kitchel, D-Caledonia, said she had heard \u201cHewlett Packard might want to partner with Blue Cross Blue Shield\u201d on its bid for the contract.\n\n\u201cIs the collateral impact that you perhaps excluded a Vermont entity, an insurer, from working in partnership with another entity to bid, simply because there\u2019s a federal law that would preclude their involvement, because of that contract?\u201d Kitchel asked Agency of Human Services Harry Chen. \u201cDo you understand what I mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand what you\u2019re asking, I don\u2019t have an answer,\u201d Chen responded.\n\nTo see the current federal statute governing exchange contracts click here.\n\n(http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=181dd2e768270f6084cea5b37c3047b5&node=se45.1.155_1110&rgn=div8)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "blue cross blue shield of vermont, centers for medicare and medicaid services, exchange, hewlett packard, jane kitchel, lawrence miller, optum, united healthcare, vermont health connect, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "The same provision may interfere with Hewlett-Packard\u2019s plan to hire Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont as a subcontractor on a state health IT project.", "title": "Federal law raises questions about who can bid for IT projects that support the exchange | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Vermont-Health-Connect-feature.jpg", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2014/10/12/federal-law-raises-questions-can-bid-projects-support-exchange/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The same provision may interfere with Hewlett-Packard\u2019s plan to hire Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont as a subcontractor on a state health IT project.", "creator": "@true_morgan", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Vermont-Health-Connect-feature.jpg?fit=1024%2C690", "title": "Federal law raises questions about who can bid for IT projects that support the exchange | VTDigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "Hewlett-Packard, Blue Cross Blue Shield of VeHewlett-Packard, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, Optum, United Healthcare, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Integrated Eligibility, Medicaid Managed Information System, Lawrence Miller, Jane Kitchel, Vermont Health Connect, exchangeHewlett-Packard, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, Optum, United Healthcare, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Integrated Eligibility, Medicaid Managed Information System, Lawrence Miller, Jane Kitchel, Vermont Health Connect, exchangermont, Optum, United Healthcare, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Integrated Eligibility, Medicaid Managed Information System, Lawrence Miller, Jane Kitchel", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Vermont Health Connect", "published_time": "2014-10-12T11:45:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd2c\"", "article_summary": "Officials from Blue Cross and HP would not confirm if Blue Cross is part of HP\u2019s bid for the MMIS contract, citing the ongoing procurement process.\nThe MMIS contract is valued at $86 million, but it\u2019s unclear what the contract for just the call center would be worth.\nOptum currently has a $15 million contract to play a leading role in fixing the underperforming Vermont Health Connect exchange.\nA provision of the Affordable Care Act precluding health insurers or companies in the \u201csame controlled group of corporations\u201d as a health insurer from holding exchange contracts raises questions about Optum working on Vermont Health Connect.\nState officials have consistently counted people who discovered that they were Medicaid-eligible through Vermont Health Connect in its count of ACA enrollees."}
