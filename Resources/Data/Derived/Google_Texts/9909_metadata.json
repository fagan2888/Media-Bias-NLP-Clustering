(AP) \u2014 This \"Grinch\" was a mean one.\n\nPolice say burglars broke into a Florida woman's home, stole her two children's gifts from under the tree and snatched the family's puppy.\n\nMelody Russell, a 33-year-old property manager, said the thieves broke in to her home northeast of downtown Tampa while she was at work Monday. She came home to find the back door open, all presents under the tree gone and Honey, their 12-week-old Shih Tzu, missing.\n\nHer two children, 7-year-old Marissa and 5-year-old Marcus, were at her sister's home when the burglary happened. Marissa cried for a half hour when Russell broke the news about Honey.\n\n\"My kids are so in love with that puppy,\" she said.\n\nThe white and tan puppy did not yet have a microchip, Russell said.\n\nRussell said she had bought a handful of modest gifts for each of her children \u2014 Nerf guns and slippers and Ninja turtle toys.\n\n\"Typical Christmas stuff,\" said Russell, who is a single mother. \"Nothing extravagant.\"\n\nTampa Police are investigating the case \u2014 and they also tried to save Christmas for the Russell family.\n\nRussell said that after the officers wrote their reports and processed the crime scene at her home, she sat in the living room, praying to God for strength. It was 1 a.m. on Christmas Eve, she said, and the phone rang.\n\nIt was a Tampa Police officer, telling her that he and his entire squad were coming to her house with gifts.\n\nWhen police dispatchers and Squad 204 heard about the theft, they quickly chipped in to buy Marissa and Marcus presents.\n\n\"Every single one of them had gifts in their hands,\" Russell said. \"I was so in shock.\"\n\nEach present was signed \"From Santa.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Tamara Lush on Twitter at http://twitter.com/tamaralush", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Police say burglars broke into a Florida woman's home, stole her two children's gifts from under the tree and snatched the family's puppy.", "title": "Someone Stole All Of The Christmas Presents And A Puppy From This Florida House", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/burglar-steals-christmas-presents-and-puppy-from-florida-house-2013-12", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/52b9e7546bb3f78f04253004-506-253/someone-stole-all-of-the-christmas-presents-and-a-puppy-from-this-florida-house.jpg", "site": "bi_contributors", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "law-contributor", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Associated Press, Christmas, Gifts, Puppy, TAMARA LUSH", "news_keywords": "Associated Press, Christmas, Gifts, Puppy, TAMARA LUSH", "author": "TAMARA LUSH, Associated Press", "sailthru.date": "2013-12-24", "sailthru.title": "Someone Stole All Of The Christmas Presents And A Puppy From This Florida House", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/52b9e7546bb3f78f04253004-50-50/someone-stole-all-of-the-christmas-presents-and-a-puppy-from-this-florida-house.jpg", "description": "Police say burglars broke into a Florida woman's home, stole her two children's gifts from under the tree and snatched the family's puppy.", "tbi-image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/52b9e7546bb3f78f04253004/someone-stole-all-of-the-christmas-presents-and-a-puppy-from-this-florida-house.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2013-12-24", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "sailthru.description": "Police say burglars broke into a Florida woman's home, stole her two children's gifts from under the tree and snatched the family's puppy.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Police say burglars broke into a Florida woman's home, stole her two children's gifts from under the tree and snatched the family's puppy.", "title": "Someone Stole All Of The Christmas Presents And A Puppy From This Florida House", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/burglar-steals-christmas-presents-and-puppy-from-florida-house-2013-12", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/52b9e7546bb3f78f04253004-1190-625/someone-stole-all-of-the-christmas-presents-and-a-puppy-from-this-florida-house.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Someone Stole All Of The Christmas Presents And A Puppy From This Florida House", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/52b9e7546bb3f78f04253004/someone-stole-all-of-the-christmas-presents-and-a-puppy-from-this-florida-house.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "law-contributor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9be6\"", "article_summary": "Police say burglars broke into a Florida woman's home, stole her two children's gifts from under the tree and snatched the family's puppy.\nMarissa cried for a half hour when Russell broke the news about Honey.\nShe came home to find the back door open, all presents under the tree gone and Honey, their 12-week-old Shih Tzu, missing.\nIt was a Tampa Police officer, telling her that he and his entire squad were coming to her house with gifts.\nWhen police dispatchers and Squad 204 heard about the theft, they quickly chipped in to buy Marissa and Marcus presents."}
