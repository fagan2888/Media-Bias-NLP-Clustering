Tuscaloosa police are searching for the 17-year-old male accused of raping and robbing a woman after kidnapping her from the parking lot of University Mall.

Lt. Kip Hart of the Metro Homicide unit identified the suspect as Cedrick Lemar Collins. He is described as a 6-foot, 160-pound black male with black hair, brown eyes and medium complexion.

Lt. Hart says Collins is considered armed and dangerous.

Police responded to a robbery and sexual assault report at 7:30 Friday morning at University Mall at 170 McFarland Boulevard.

Lt. Hart described the victim as a 19-year-old white female. She told police she was sitting in the parking lot when a black male approached her car and asked to use her cell phone.

She gave him permission to use the phone and he entered her car. Police say the suspect told her he had a gun and forced her to drive to an ATM and withdraw money.

Investigators say the suspect forced the victim to drive to an abandoned property on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard where he sexually assaulted her.

Officers say the suspect left the area afterwards and the victim contacted police. She was taken to DH Regional Medical Center.

Detectives developed probable cause to obtain first degree rape, kidnapping and robbery warrants on Collins.

Anyone with information on this case is asked to call the Tuscaloosa Police Department.
