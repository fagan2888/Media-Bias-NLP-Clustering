Three Honolulu runs scored on wild pitches.\n\nEncinitas batters struck out 13 times, with reliever Dante Park, the winning pitcher, striking out 10 over the final 4 2/3 innings.\n\nEncinitas had four hits \u2014 three singles and Austin Machado\u2019s two-out double in the third inning. Honolulu had nine off five Encinitas pitchers, eight singles and third-inning double by Richie Vidal that drove in two runs.\n\nHonolulu (2-0) scored the game\u2019s first eight runs \u2014 two in the first, one in the second and five in the third. Encinitas scored both its runs in the fifth.\n\nHonolulu combined a leadoff single by Aaron Tom, a walk to its No. 3 hitter Jordan Botelho and four wild pitches by Encinitas starter Peter Gagne for its two first-inning runs.\n\nMakana Murashige\u2019s sacrifice fly drove in Maxx Muramoto, who led off with a bunt single, for Honolulu\u2019s second-inning run.\n\nEach of the first three Honolulu batters in the third walked and the fourth, Noah Nakamura, was hit by a pitch. One out later, Vidal doubled in two runs, increasing Honolulu\u2019s lead to 6-0.\n\nTom followed with the third of his three singles, driving in Nakamura. Vidal scored on a wild pitch.\n\nMachado singled in Luke Berardi, who walked, with Encinitas\u2019 first run. Spencer Jones, who had singled, scored the second run when Nakamura, the Honolulu left fielder, mishandled Machado\u2019s single for an error.\n\nPinch-runner Shiya Matsushita scored Honolulu\u2019s final run when Botelho reached on a fielder\u2019s choice in the fifth.\n\nThe loss was the third in 16 games in four tournaments for Encinitas, the Southern California champion.\n\nPacifica, the Northern California champion, is 1-1, losing to Honolulu, 10-5, on Friday, and defeating the all-star team from the Chandler National Little League, the Arizona state champion, 7-3, on Saturday.\n\nA watch party will be held at Oggi\u2019s Pizza and Brewing on Encinitas Boulevard for the 7 p.m. game.\n\nAll pool play games in the tournament played at Al Houghton Stadium will be televised by the ESPN3 broadband network.\n\nEncinitas will play four pool play games in the six-team West Regional. The top four teams will advance to the semifinals, which will be played Friday. The semifinal winners will play in the regional final Saturday.\n\nThis is the first time a team from the Encinitas Little League, which was formed in 1957, has advanced to the West Regional, according to league officials.\n\nThe tournament winner will advance to the Little League World Series, which is played in South Williamsport, PA. Ten teams from San Diego County have played in the Little League World Series, including the Eastlake Little League all-star team from Chula Vista last year.\n\n\u2014 City News Service\n\n>> Subscribe to Times of San Diego\u2019s free daily email newsletter!
