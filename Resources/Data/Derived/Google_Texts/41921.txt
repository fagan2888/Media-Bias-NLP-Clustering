Stop waiting for Manny Ramirez to be replaced. The Broncos have no such plans after they extended the contract of their starting center through the 2015 season.

Ramirez played his first four NFL seasons with the Detroit Lions, starting 12 games in 2009 when the team finished 0-16.

He found new life in 2011 when he signed with the Broncos as a reserve. After playing in just two games that year,. Ramirez started 11 games at right guard last season in place of the injured Chris Kuper, then became the starting center this year after first J.D. Walton experienced complications in his recovery from ankle surgery and then Dan Koppen suffered a torn ACL.

Ramirez graded out well in the Broncosâ€™ season-opening, 49-27 win last Thursday against Baltimore.
