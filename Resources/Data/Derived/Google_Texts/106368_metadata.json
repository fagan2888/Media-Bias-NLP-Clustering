She is more concerned about long-term mental health care than with shoveling mud out of basements \u2014 although volunteers with her nonprofit, Headwaters Relief Organization, did both on Saturday.\n\n\"Waiting a few weeks, there's almost a greater need,\" Thomley said. \"I think when we come in around now, we can help families who really are starting to cope with the loss.\"\n\nBOULDER, CO - Oct. 19: Dr. Rebecca Thomley, left, spends some time with the Boulder homeowner Cheryl Supino, whose home was devastated by the floods and mud that was left behind. The crew of volunteers worked to clear mud from a pool area that is in the backyard of Supino's home.

Those people met with flood victims to let them know what otherwise might go unsaid \u2014 that post-trauma emotions are normal.\n\n\"Like telling someone, 'You might have trouble sleeping,' \" said Thomley, a clinical psychologist.\n\nOther symptoms include difficulty sustaining relationships, anger and loss of enjoyment in activities. The brief counseling sessions are the backbone of what the volunteer group offers communities after natural disasters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group, which set up shop Saturday morning at Lyons Community Church, walked the streets in the afternoon, talking to about 30 people. The volunteers, Thomley said, often speak with people on doorsteps.\n\n\"It's not really that hard to do because everyone is out working,\" Thomley said.\n\n\"People are looking for someone to talk to.\"\"It's very different from what you'd do in your office,\" Thomley said, adding, \"It's kind of the power of presence.\"\n\nChuck Keim, a member of Lyons Community Church who helped facilitate the Headwaters trip, said the few people who are in town come for the day, work on reconstruction, and leave with the daylight because the town is still without running water, a working sewage system and much electricity.\n\n\"The stress in the community seems to be everywhere, irrespective to where you are,\" Keim said.\n\nCheryl Supino and the five other people living at 1885 Upland Ave., adjacent to Fourmile Creek in Boulder, left home around midnight on the first night of the flood. The creek deposited 3 feet of mud across the block.\n\nEven though neighbors helped the family clear out the wrecked house, the Supinos are, five week later, still shoveling mud from their home.\n\n\"It gets to the point where you have to go back and do your own thing,\" Supino said.\n\nShe said she was grateful for the work of about 20 Headwaters volunteers Saturday, a service she found through Calvary Bible Church in Boulder. Thomley said religious groups play a big role in connecting disaster relief with community members.\n\nOn Sunday, 17 Jewish teens with the Orthodox Union's National Conference of Synagogue Youth are scheduled to arrive in Boulder and join the second-wave relief efforts.\n\nThomley's team saw other scenes of devastation in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, in Oklahoma after summer twisters and during their ongoing work in Haiti.\n\nSifting through the rubble can be more drawn-out and emotionally devastating than losing everything, Thomley said.\n\nVoluneer Alec Demgen, 22, said the main difference between Colorado and Louisiana disaster relief has been homeowners' presence alongside the workers in Colorado. Some people in New Orleans who lost everything picked up and moved on, but most affected Colorado residents have not.\n\n\"I think the big part is just letting people know there are still people out there who care,\" Demgen said.\n\nThomley said one Jamestown woman, who couldn't accept Headwaters' construction help because her electricity was not yet restored, thanked the group for helping her neighbors.\n\n\"She said, 'It gave me hope just that someone came and is helping,' \" Thomley said.\n\nDemgen said their second-wave work in Colorado is probably far from over.\n\n\"I doubt this will be our last trip out here,\" Demgen said.\n\nLyons Town Administrator Victoria Simonsen said water and sewage will be phased in to neighborhoods over the next six weeks.\n\nThe north side of Main Street will receive those utilities next weekend, followed the next week by Stone Canyon, then Lyons Valley Park and finally Eagle Canyon. The south side of Main Street, referred to as the Confluence Area, will have no utilities until people whose homes were swept away decide whether or not to rebuild.\n\nSimonsen said her goal is to have everyone except within the Confluence Area home for Thanksgiving, though it won't be the end of their rebuilding.\n\n\"This is going to take a year and a half or two clean up,\" Simonsen said. \"Just because the water is gone doesn't mean everything is better.\"\n\nAlison Noon: 303-954-1223, anoon@denverpost.com or twitter.com/alisonnoon", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_24346173/second-wave-aid-arrives-flood-ravaged-colorado-towns", "modificationDate": "2013-10-19T19:40:17-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2013/1019/20131019__BN20131020_Z00_BNCD20FLOODAID~p1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Alison Noon   The Denver Post", "description": "LYONS \u2014 A second wave of flood assistance is flowing into Colorado, including a group of mental health professionals who made a trip to Lyons this weekend to help people still shocked by", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:24346173:view"}, "startDate": "2013-10-19T16:49:28-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_24346173/second-wave-aid-arrives-flood-ravaged-colorado-towns", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2013/1019/20131019__BN20131020_Z00_BNCD20FLOODAID~p1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "LYONS \u2014 A second wave of flood assistance is flowing into Colorado, including a group of mental health professionals who made a trip to Lyons this weekend to help people still shocked by", "title": "Second-wave of aid arrives for flood-ravaged Colorado towns"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "LYONS \u2014 A second wave of flood assistance is flowing into Colorado, including a group of mental health professionals who made a trip to Lyons this weekend to help people still shocked by", "title": "Second-wave of aid arrives for flood-ravaged Colorado towns", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_24346173/second-wave-aid-arrives-flood-ravaged-colorado-towns", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2013/1019/20131019__BN20131020_Z00_BNCD20FLOODAID~p1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-19T16:49:28-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2023-10-19T18:08:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Second-wave of aid arrives for flood-ravaged Colorado towns", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Alison Noon", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2013/1019/20131019__BN20131020_Z00_BNCD20FLOODAID~p1.jpg", "pubDate": "2013-10-19T16:50:55-0600", "news_keywords": "Education, Education news, Canyon City Colorado Education news, Canyon City Colorado news, Education Canyon City news, Education Colorado news, US Education news, world Education news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21fc\"", "article_summary": "A group of volunteers from the Headwaters Relief Organization from the Minnesota area arrives in Colorado to give assistance to the flood victims in the Longmont and Boulder areas.\nThe volunteers, Thomley said, often speak with people on doorsteps.\nVoluneer Alec Demgen, 22, said the main difference between Colorado and Louisiana disaster relief has been homeowners' presence alongside the workers in Colorado.\nDemgen said their second-wave work in Colorado is probably far from over.\nShe said she was grateful for the work of about 20 Headwaters volunteers Saturday, a service she found through Calvary Bible Church in Boulder."}
