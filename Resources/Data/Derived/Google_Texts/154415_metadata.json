Anything that is evidence-based is unimportant to them,\u201d said Pelosi, adding that the GOP considered the shutting down of the federal government last year \u201ca victory.\u201d\n\nPelosi said she believes the outlook for Democrats, who may lose control of the U.S. Senate, will improve within a \u201cmonth or so.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne evidence of governance would be how we rolled out the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is intact; it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs with everything, it\u2019s a work in progress. We need to improve it, but the website didn\u2019t work, and now it\u2019s well.\u201d\n\nThat success, said Pelosi, has forced Republicans to focus on other issues, such as Benghazi.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to come back to Benghazi because the Affordable Care Act has lost some of its weight in terms of being a political issue for them.\u201d\n\nAsked about how she and other Democrats navigate the tension between pushing for campaign finance reform while fundraising heavily themselves, Pelosi repeated her proposal to amend the Constitution, while admitting her own fundraising prowess.\n\n\u201cThe only way we can fight it and win it in order to change the law, and even maybe have a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, is to raise money to do it,\u201d Pelosi said, adding, \u201cquestion is, what money is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe money I raise, I\u2019m probably right up there with the biggest fundraisers in the country,\u201d she said. \u201cI know about raising money.\u201d\n\nRaising large sums of money is needed to battle Republicans. The two parties differ in that Republican donors are self-interested, while Democratic donors are motivated more by public interest, Pelosi said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very idealistic group of people from around the country who really do want to see the role of money reduced in politics,\u201d said Pelosi.\n\n\u201cBut surely some of them want something?\u201d Klein pushed.\n\n\u201cI think maybe some of those people give to both sides,\u201d Pelosi responded, adding that \u201cprobably not 10 percent\u201d of money Democrats raise comes from the Washington lobbyist community.\n\n\u201cOur small donor base is huge,\u201d said Pelosi.\n\nPelosi raised $35 million on behalf of the Democratic party last year. And while Democrats indeed outpace Republicans in terms of small donors, Pelosi\u2019s campaigns are not funded by the little guy.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "'I know about raising money'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke about a variety of issues in an interview aired Monday, calling Obamacare \"beautiful\", characterizing Republicans as being a \"triple threat,\" and bragging", "title": "Pelosi Calls Obamacare \u2018Beautiful\u2019, Admits She\u2019s One Of \u2018Biggest Fundraisers\u2019 In Country", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/05/26/pelosi-calls-obamacare-beautiful-admits-shes-one-of-biggest-fundraisers-in-country/", "image": {"width": 665, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/pelosi-sc-e1401137860107.jpg", "height": 256}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'I know about raising money'", "creator": "@@ChuckRossDC", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/05/26/pelosi-calls-obamacare-beautiful-admits-shes-one-of-biggest-fundraisers-in-country/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/pelosi-sc-e1401137860107.jpg"}, "title": "Pelosi Calls Obamacare \u2018Beautiful\u2019, Admits She\u2019s One Of \u2018Biggest Fundraisers\u2019 In Country Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-05-26 18:43:31", "sailthru.title": "Pelosi Calls Obamacare 'Beautiful', Admits She's One Of 'Biggest Fundraisers' In Country", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "benghazi,ezra klein,nancy pelosi,obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "benghazi,ezra-klein,nancy-pelosi,obamacare,chuck-ross", "sailthru.description": "U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke about a variety of issues in an interview aired Monday, calling Obamacare \"beautiful\", characterizing Republicans as being a \"triple threat,\" and bragging", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/pelosi-sc-e1401137860107.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7241\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think maybe some of those people give to both sides,\u201d Pelosi responded, adding that \u201cprobably not 10 percent\u201d of money Democrats raise comes from the Washington lobbyist community.\nThe two parties differ in that Republican donors are self-interested, while Democratic donors are motivated more by public interest, Pelosi said.\nRepublicans are \u201canti-governance, they\u2019re anti-science, they\u2019re anti-Obama,\u201d said Pelosi, when asked why the political landscape \u201cseems rough\u201d for Democrats going into the mid-term elections.\nAnd while Democrats indeed outpace Republicans in terms of small donors, Pelosi\u2019s campaigns are not funded by the little guy.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a triple threat,\u201d Pelosi said of the GOP."}
