Must see: “Hell’s Club”

A perfect palate cleanser after a long week. Not just technically impressive but darned clever, from the stitched-together Franken-narrative to the idea of setting the story in a club, where colored filters would make it easier to believe all the characters are interacting in the same space.

How much longer will it be before computers can reimagine images and sounds from old films so perfectly that a human viewer can’t tell the difference between a real actor and a “re-created” one? What I mean is, what advances are still needed for a machine to be able to study, say, James Dean’s form and voice in “Rebel Without a Cause” and learn it so exactly that you could have it generate whole new scenes, or entire films, featuring that character without being able to tell that it’s not lost footage featuring the real James Dean? With enough processing power, everyone “lives” forever.
