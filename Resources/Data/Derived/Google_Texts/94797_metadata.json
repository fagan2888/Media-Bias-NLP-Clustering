But watch out, because if sexuality works the way he says it does, he might turn gay in there.\u201d\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz comes onstage to \u201cyou ready to bust a Cruz?\u201d And he is characterized as \u201chard on immigration, and soft on chins,\u201d and \u201cjust like he did with the government, he\u2019s about to shut this mother down.\u201d\n\nFormer Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina next rides onto the stage on a Harley-Davidson. The emcee states, \u201cher maiden name is Carly Sneed, and she\u2019s got just what you sneed. Unless what you sneed is foreign policy experience.\u201d And \u201cHey, is it hot in here? Yeah, because of Carly Fiorina.\u201d\n\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul is introduced as \u201canti-gun control, anti-Obamacare, and pro-marijuana,\u201d with the event\u2019s emcee expressing their surprise at Paul being pro-marijuana. Paul is called \u201ca small man who loves small government, and fat blunts, in controlled dosages of course, when prescribed by a doctor. This little Kentucky kush is anti-abortion, except in cases where the fetus harshes his buzz.\u201d Paul also mimes smoking joints while he\u2019s onstage.\n\nThe last candidate, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, comes onstage with multiple dancers, and his jacket open to show off his chest. Rubio is described as someone who \u201cbelieves marriage should be between one man and one sexy mamacita. But when pressed, he said he would attend a gay wedding.\u201d The emcee adds, \u201che also voted against the Violence Against Women Act, sorry mamis.\u201d\n\nThe sketch concludes with the event\u2019s emcee wondering, \u201cWon\u2019t it be fun to watch all of these guys lose to Jeb Bush?\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" introduced their vision of cooler versions of the official Republican presidential candidates.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" introduced their vision of cooler versions of the official Republican presidential candidates.", "title": "Saturday Night Live Introduces Cool Versions of GOP Field - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/SNL-Open-59-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/05/09/saturday-night-live-introduces-cool-versions-of-gop-field/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" introduced their vision of cooler versions of the official Republican presidential candidates.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/SNL-Open-59-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Saturday Night Live Introduces Cool Versions of GOP Field - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Saturday Night Live,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,saturday night live", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Saturday Night Live", "published_time": "2015-05-09T21:00:26-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5c4c\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d introduced their vision of cooler versions of the official Republican presidential candidates.\nThe emcee states, \u201cher maiden name is Carly Sneed, and she\u2019s got just what you sneed.\nYeah, because of Carly Fiorina.\u201dKentucky Senator Rand Paul is introduced as \u201canti-gun control, anti-Obamacare, and pro-marijuana,\u201d with the event\u2019s emcee expressing their surprise at Paul being pro-marijuana.\nThe last candidate, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, comes onstage with multiple dancers, and his jacket open to show off his chest.\nThis little Kentucky kush is anti-abortion, except in cases where the fetus harshes his buzz.\u201d Paul also mimes smoking joints while he\u2019s onstage."}
