He snapped every game for the San Francisco 49ers last season and was a surprise cut last week, beaten out by Kyle Nelson, who doubles as a fourth tight end.\n\nThe new practice squad rules made McDermott eligible despite playing in 19 games, counting playoffs last season.\n\nMcDermott worked out Monday with the New England Patriots, then Tuesday morning with the Broncos.\n\nMcDermott \u2014 who will likely compete this week with Aaron Brewer, the Broncos\u2019 long snapper the past two years \u2014 already won one snap-off competition at Broncos\u2019 headquarters this week. Besides McDermott, the Broncos brought in long snappers Danny Aiken, recently cut by New England, and Jake Ingram, who has snapped for four NFL teams, for a tryout Tuesday morning.\n\nMcDermott was the one the Broncos signed to their practice squad Tuesday, according to an NFL source.\n\nThe 24-year-old grew up in Nashville, where in high school he was a three-year starter in lacrosse, basketball and football. He was a recruited walk-on to UCLA and eventually received a full scholarship from coach Rick Neuheisel.\n\nAs an undrafted rookie last season, McDermott beat out Brian Jennings, the 49ers\u2019 longsnapper the previous 13 years.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos sign long snapper Kevin McDermott; Browns sign Vinston Painter", "title": "Broncos sign long snapper Kevin McDermott; Browns sign Vinston Painter", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/02/broncos-sign-long-snapper-kevin-mcdermott-browns-sign-vinston-painter/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140902__mcdermottp1.jpg", "height": 523}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140902__mcdermottp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-02T10:51:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:17:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc61f\"", "article_summary": "173) of the 2013 draft out of Virginia Tech and spent most of last season on the Broncos\u2019 practice squad.\nAs an undrafted rookie last season, McDermott beat out Brian Jennings, the 49ers\u2019 longsnapper the previous 13 years.\nThe Broncos have signed long snapper Kevin McDermott to their practice squad.\nMcDermott \u2014 who will likely compete this week with Aaron Brewer, the Broncos\u2019 long snapper the past two years \u2014 already won one snap-off competition at Broncos\u2019 headquarters this week.\nTo make room for McDermott, the Browns have agreed to sign rookie offensive lineman Vinston Painter to their 53-man roster, pending his physical."}
