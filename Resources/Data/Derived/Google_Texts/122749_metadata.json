From there, the Fort took over. A 2 yard touchdown run from Datron James put the Patriots up 24-17. That was followed by an interception and another James score to make it 31-17 at the half.\n\nThe 2nd half began the same way as Dakereon Joyner connected with Adonicas Sanders on a 43 yard score followed by Joyner connecting with Nick Dederick on another touchdown pass after Dorman fumbled the ensuing kickoff. That made it a 45-17 lead and the Patriots never looked back.\n\nIn all, Joyner would total 366 yards and 4 touchdowns. James helped lead the way for the Fort going for 137 yards and 3 touchdowns on the ground while Diondre Champaigne had 5 catches for 129 yards.\n\nFort Dorchester forced 4 Dorman turnovers overall.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Fort Dorchester \u00a0wins AAAA Division 1 state title 59-31 over Dorman", "author": "Kevin Bilodeau", "og": {"url": "http://www.live5news.com/story/30732090/fort-dorchester-wins-first-ever-state-title", "image": "http://wcsc.images.worldnow.com/images/9447967_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Fort Dorchester \u00a0wins AAAA Division 1 state title 59-31 over Dorman", "title": "Fort Dorchester Wins first ever State title"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 16813752, "title": "Fort Dorchester Wins first ever State title", "image": "http://wcsc.images.worldnow.com/images/9447967_G.jpg", "creator": "@Live5News", "site": "@Live5News", "card": "summary", "description": "Fort Dorchester \u00a0wins AAAA Division 1 state title 59-31 over Dorman"}, "wnreadableurl": "fort-dorchester-wins-first-ever-state-title", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "WCSC", "fb": {"admins": 644426401, "app_id": 739226082784217}, "date": "2015/12/12", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/live5news"}, "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS05"}, "article_summary": "Fort Dorchester completed their 1st ever perfect season on Saturday by winning their 1st ever state championship beating Dorman 59-31 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia to take the AAAA Division 1 crown.\nJames helped lead the way for the Fort going for 137 yards and 3 touchdowns on the ground while Diondre Champaigne had 5 catches for 129 yards.\nFort Dorchester forced 4 Dorman turnovers overall.\nA 2 yard touchdown run from Datron James put the Patriots up 24-17.\nThat was followed by an interception and another James score to make it 31-17 at the half."}
