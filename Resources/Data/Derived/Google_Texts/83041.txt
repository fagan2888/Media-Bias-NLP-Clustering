D’Qwell Jackson left Monday evening impressed with the Broncos, but not ready to call Denver home.

“He had a great visit,” said Brian Mackler, Jackson’s agent. “Very impressed. He’s planning to make a decision by the end of the week.”

Jackson, 30, is a middle linebacker who started the previous eight seasons with the Cleveland Browns. Released last week to avoid a $4 million roster bonus, Jackson became immediately in demand. He visited the Tennessee Titans and his former defensive coordinator Roy Horton on Saturday.

He visited the Broncos and quarterback Peyton Manning, coach John Fox, defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio and general manager John Elway among others at the team’s Dove Valley headquarters on Monday.

Jackson flew on Monday evening to Miami where he will meet Tuesday with the Dolphins, and has one more visit scheduled with an unnamed team.

It wasn’t necessarily a bad sign the Broncos couldn’t close the deal with Jackson on Monday. After a long stay in Cleveland, Jackson wants to thoroughly explore all options before deciding on his next destination.
