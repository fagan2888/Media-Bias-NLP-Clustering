SPRING HILL, Fla. (AP) -- Residents living in a quiet neighborhood are being hassled by a group of hawks that have taken to dive-bombing retirees as they walk to their mailboxes.

WFTS reports that two of the birds are red-shouldered hawks.

It's the second season in a row the hawks have chosen this quiet street to make their home. According to residents, it seems they're getting more aggressive each time.

Wildlife officials refuse to remove the protective parent hawks until nature runs its course. The whole ordeal has left the victims along the street without many options.

One 88-year-old man has taken to wearing a pith helmet after he was struck and sent to the hospital.
