The company says many of the new customers who joined under Obamacare have existing health needs. They also include a large number of migrants from the Compact of Free Association states. The company says these new members are using more medical services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state insurance commissioner put out a press release about the unusually large request saying, \u201cthe Insurance Division will actively seek reductions to the proposed request, where possible, to ensure fairness to all parties involved.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a letter to members, HMSA said it understands their frustration, but defended the increase as being necessary and in line with other states, although an article it provided to back up that claim only identified one state, New Mexico, as having a higher rate increase request. Most others were in the range of 25-35%.\n\n\n\n\n\nHawaii's prepaid health care system requires employers to provide coverage to their full-time employees. HMSA says that means the pool of new members who came in through Obamacare is relatively small, about three percent of its total membership.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015 Hawaii News Now.
