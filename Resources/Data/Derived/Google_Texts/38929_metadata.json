You might be shocked if you do.\n\nSixth-grade children in a history class in the Bryant School District in Arkansas (whose website brags that the district \u201chas embraced\u201d Common Core standards) were assigned a project to update the U.S. Bill of Rights because it is \u201coutdated.\u201d They were instructed to \u201cprioritize, revise, omit two and add two amendments.\u201d\n\nThe written assignment is full of lies, such as that \u201cthe government of the United States is currently revisiting The Bill of Rights,\u201d that \u201cThey (presumably the government) have determined that it is outdated and may not remain in its current form any longer,\u201d and that our Constitution can be changed by a \u201cNational Revised Bill of Rights Task Force (NRBR)\u201d (to which students could be appointed).\n\nSt. Joseph-Ogden High School, a public school in St. Joseph, Ill., gave its sophomore class an assignment to choose which of 10 people were \u201cworthy\u201d of getting kidney dialysis when the hospital had only six machines. The assignment instructed the students, \u201cfour people are not going to live. You must decide from the information below which six will survive.\u201d\n\nThe students were given the list of the 10 who desperately needed kidney dialysis with identification about their occupation, age and ethnicity, and told to give each a score. The instructions stated: \u201cPut the people in order using 1-10, 1 being the person you want to save first and 10 being the person you would save last,\u201d with the assumption that those getting scores 7 through 10 would be marked for death.\n\nSince when are high-school students allowed to judge who may live and who must die? Is this to prepare us to accept death panels from Obamacare?\n\nDon\u2019t miss Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s latest book, now available at the WND Superstore: \u201cNo Higher Power: Obama\u2019s War on Religious Freedom\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, such public school class assignments are not new. A Department of Education hearing in Seattle on March 13, 1984, heard a parent describe the Health class at Clackamas High School in Oregon.\n\nStudents were presented with the \u201clifeboat situation\u201d: Too many people are in the sinking lifeboat, and the students were ordered to choose whose lives are not worth saving and should be thrown overboard so the lifeboat won\u2019t sink. Variations of the lifeboat situation have been widely used in public schools for many years.\n\nA drama teacher at Cactus Shadows High School in Cave Creek, Ariz., had his students perform a play in which one of the characters falls in love with a goat. The play includes sexually explicit content and vulgar sexual terms.\n\nAt Lucy Elementary School near Memphis, Tenn., an assignment required each student to pick an idol and write an essay about him. A 10-year-old girl chose God as her idol, but the teacher found this unacceptable and demanded that the girl write about someone else.\n\nThe girl then wrote about Michael Jackson, which the teacher accepted. After the girl\u2019s mother spoke out against this in the local media, the school apologized and gave the girl credit for her original work.\n\nFourth-graders in Gilbert, Ariz., and third-graders in Louisiana were given a lesson on adultery that included specific questions designed to make the child curious about what adultery is and how it affects relationships. The teacher said it came from approved Common Core materials for third-graders.\n\nGlenn Beck reported that Poolesville High School in Montgomery County, Md., which is Common Core compliant, administered an intrusive survey to students that included personal questions about family, religion, income, political identification, illegal drugs, Obamacare, guns and same-sex marriage. Click on The Blaze to be entertained by the conflicting responses that school officials gave to parents who complained and to reporters.\n\nThe question that parents found particularly obnoxious and trouble-making was, \u201cIf President Obama were Caucasian, how much more or less criticism do you think he would receive?\u201d The multiple-choice answers were: \u201cA lot less, Somewhat less, No difference, Somewhat more, A lot more.\u201d\n\nFifth-graders in North Bellmore, N.Y., spent several weeks studying the United Nations. One mother was highly offended when her daughter received full credit for writing that our human rights come from government (instead of from God, as our Declaration of Independence proclaims).\n\nAt Alliance High School in Nebraska, the principal announced on Oct. 7 that, because of the government shutdown, he was shutting down the usual morning recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. After public protest, he reversed his ban.\n\nNone of the above assignments quoted directly from a Common Core curriculum, but some claim to be \u201caligned with Common Core\u201d or \u201cCommon Core compliant.\u201d It\u2019s beginning to look like such assertions are a cover to fill the minds of public school students with all kinds of inappropriate left-wing notions, while erecting a Common Core \u201cwall\u201d to prevent parental oversight.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2013/10/whoa-check-your-kids-school-assignments/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "Have you checked your kids\u2019 school assignments lately?
