OVERLAND PARK, Kan. -- Sunday was the third annual Kosher Barbecue competition in Overland park.

It’s a young tradition that the Jewish community in Kansas City has come to savor.

Each year there are more entries, and this year the Kansas City BBQ Society has sanctioned the event, so the competition is stiffer.

It’s actually the only kosher BBQ in the nation that is now sanctioned by the group.

There are some key differences between this competition and others. Mainly everything has to be kosher. The meat is supplied, the seasonings are all provided. Even the utensils, pots, pans, smokers and grills are provided.

It’s a challenge that everyone says levels the playing field, so the best pit master wins.

"Everyone is cohesive, very friendly. If you need something, each team goes out of their way to help you and make sure you have that ingredient. It’s been a challenge to try to find correct ingredients to cook with your kosher meats. It’s been fun so far,” said BBQ competitor Big Billy.

Of course, there were both Jewish and non-Jewish teams competing on Sunday. Some from as far away as Chicago and New York who were looking to start up their own kosher BBQ competitions.
