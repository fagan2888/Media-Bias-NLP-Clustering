According to a 2012 report and policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics, cheerleading \u201caccounted for 65 percent of all direct catastrophic injuries to girl athletes at the high school level and 70.8 percent at the college level\u201d between 1982 and 2009. The overall number is small \u2014 110 closed-head injuries, skull fractures and cervical spine injuries that resulted in \u201cpermanent brain injury, paralysis or death\u201d over that period \u2014 and the number of participants in cheerleading is large, an estimated 3.6 million nationwide, the academy found. (A number of other girls suffered cardiac problems and heat stroke.) But the disproportionate number of severe injuries in this one activity is striking.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that cheerleading ranks number one when it comes to risky sports for girls, accounting for more than half of catastrophic injuries to female athletes. Here\u2019s a snippet:\n\n(Among the recommendations from the AAP report: \u201cPyramids should not be more than 2 people high and should only be performed with spotters.\u201d)\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth noting that in all sports, girls\u2019 injuries can look different than boys\u2019 and should be treated with that in mind. In an earlier post on a new Children\u2019s Hospital Boston program that aims to more wholistically care for female athletes, Dr. Kathryn Ackerman talked about some of those sports-related gender differences:\n\n\u201cWe know that the build of girls \u2014 both their musculature and bone structure \u2014 is different than boys\u2019, as is their hormonal milieu,\u201d said the program\u2019s co-director, Dr. Kathryn Ackerman. \u201cWe really need to start tailoring our care of these athletes in a slightly different way.\u201d Certain specific issues need extra attention among girl athletes, she said. They\u2019re at a five to eight times higher risk of anterior cruciate ligament knee injuries. \u201cAesthetic\u201d activities like ballet tend to be linked with higher risks of eating disorders. If menstrual cycles become abnormal, bone development could suffer. The new program aims to contrast with the traditional piecemeal approach to girls\u2019 injuries and other health issues, Dr. Ackerman said. For example, \u201cA girl comes in having sustained multiple stress fractures, and no one has asked her about her menstrual status or her calcium or Vitamin D intake or her overall caloric intake.\u201d Some studies, she said, suggest that up to 60 percent of girl athletes have at least one component of the Female Athlete Triad: eating dysfunction, loss of menstrual cycle or low bone density.\n\nAnd for a thorough discussion on topic, including the range of injuries, and the push to designate cheerleading as a sport, listen to this On Point segment from last year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cheerleading poses by far the greatest risk of catastrophic injury to young female participants of any sport, a report says.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Cheerleading poses by far the greatest risk of catastrophic injury to young female participants of any sport, a report says.", "title": "Quick, What\u2019s The Girl\u2019s Sport Most Linked To Catastrophic Injuries?", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2013/09/girls-sport-catastrophic-injuries-cheerleading", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/09/cheerleading-620x880.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2013/09/girls-sport-catastrophic-injuries-cheerleading", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/09/cheerleading-620x880.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Quick, What's The Girl's Sport Most Linked To Catastrophic Injuries?"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-11", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Wed, 11 Sep 2013 11:23:59 -0400"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca126\"", "article_summary": "Quick, What\u2019s The Girl\u2019s Sport Most Linked To Catastrophic Injuries?\nThe new program aims to contrast with the traditional piecemeal approach to girls\u2019 injuries and other health issues, Dr. Ackerman said.\nBut it turns out there\u2019s another girls sport I should be even more worried about: cheerleading.\nThe Washington Post reports that cheerleading ranks number one when it comes to risky sports for girls, accounting for more than half of catastrophic injuries to female athletes.\nWith or without government regulation, cheerleading poses by far the greatest risk of catastrophic injury to young female participants of any sport."}
