Many were award winners, and all were models of craft, fusing a unique voice and artistic style. They have enthralled children \u2014 and their parents \u2014 for more than 75 years.\n\nThe books have spawned movies (which Geisel resisted during his life) and TV classics such as \u201cHow the Grinch Stole Christmas!,\u201d which Boris Karloff memorably voiced. They have been read on the floor of the U.S. Senate \u2014 Texas Sen. Ted Cruz recited \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d in his 2013 Obamacare filibuster. And one book, 1950\u2019s \u201cIf I Ran the Zoo,\u201d put the word \u201cnerd\u201d into the lexicon.\n\nMost important, his books have introduced millions of children to the joys of reading and the magic of wordplay.\n\nNot bad for a Massachusetts native whose early career included ads for Flit insecticide, Essomarine motor oil, and World War II propaganda posters whose caricatures, including bucktoothed Japanese with slanted eyes, induce cringes in contemporary audiences.\n\nThe Seuss we know, however, is rooted in his manic joy and ability to tap into a child\u2019s-eye view of the universe.\n\n\u201cI think that the key to Dr. Seuss\u2019 enduring appeal lies in the spirit of playfulness that permeates his work,\u201d said Jen Robinson, a children\u2019s literature expert who oversees the website Jen Robinson\u2019s Book Page. \u201cHe encourages children and adults to look at the world in different ways, whether this means upside-down, from the top of a tree or from inside a tiny speck.\n\n\u201cOne can\u2019t look at the \u2018Whos down in Whoville\u2019 without smiling over their joie de vivre, for example,\u201d she said.\n\nThat Geisel\u2019s first children\u2019s book, \u201cAnd to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,\u201d was published in 1937 surprises many, given that his books are often thought of as a post-World War II phenomenon.\n\n\u201cMulberry Street\u201d is a tale about a boy named Marco and his flights of fantasy while walking down said road. It bears the core hallmarks of Geisel\u2019s later style, including galloping rhyme (inspired by the engine rhythms of the artist\u2019s voyage on an ocean liner):\n\nAnd that is a story that no one can beat\n\nAnd to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street.\n\nThere is also Geisel\u2019s trademark ink line, at once cramped and freewheeling, and, above all, the unfettered whimsy of a child\u2019s imagination. (The book is also a testament to perseverance: It was rejected by 20 publishers before landing at Vanguard Press.)\n\nThe wordplay is striking.\n\nConsider the opening lines to \u201cThe Cat in the Hat,\u201d the 1957 chronicle of a brother and sister\u2019s misadventure with a gangly, anthropomorphic feline sporting a red-and-white top hat:\n\nThe sun did not shine.\n\nIt was too wet to play.\n\nSo we sat in the house\n\nAll that cold, cold, wet day.\n\nI sat there with Sally,\n\nWe sat there we two.\n\nAnd I said, \u201cHow I wish\n\nWe had something to do.\u201d\n\nMood, setting, conflict, ennui. Just like Samuel Beckett\u2019s \u201cWaiting for Godot,\u201d except that something actually happens.\n\n\u201cGeisel\u2019s works also endure because of his gift for creating rhymes that are fun to read aloud and easy to remember, but are not cloying or irritating,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThat\u2019s no small feat. I think it\u2019s this combination of playfulness and lyricism that makes Dr. Seuss\u2019 works stand the test of time.\u201d\n\nWhile Geisel morphed into a writer \u2014 Seuss was his middle name \u2014 he began as an artist, working in black-and-white illustration and color. While his stories are engaging, it\u2019s the artwork that grabs people\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cSeuss\u2019 illustrations convey a sense of movement and anticipation,\u201d said Ann Schwab, senior librarian in the Denver Public Library\u2019s children\u2019s section. \u201cHis loose style, curvy lines and use of white space engage the reader\u2019s imagination. You can\u2019t wait to turn the page to see what happens next.\u201d\n\nA major legacy\n\nGeisel, who was inspired by essays about childhood learning, also has a major legacy in preschool and elementary school education. The National Education Association celebrates National Read Across America Day on his birth date.\n\n\u201cHe showed the world that easy readers don\u2019t have to be sterile,\u201d said Terry Doherty, executive director of The Reading Tub, an advocate for youth literacy. \u201cFor me, the Dr. Seuss books walk the talk in showing us that engaging kids with books and helping them learn to read can be fun not just for children, but for adults, too.\n\n\u201cDr. Seuss has helped eradicate those antiseptic and unnaturally clean primers that were the norm for so many years. He was a pioneer for a genre that is the linchpin in helping kids build a critical life skill.\u201d\n\nOn a recent morning at The Bookies, a Denver book shop catering to young people, 10 preschoolers sat in front of Cae Dornfeld, a staffer and, on this day, story lady. The children were rapt, for the first book Dornfeld was to read was Geisel\u2019s \u201cMr. Brown Can Moo! Can You?\u201d It\u2019s a sound-along story where the title character buzzes like a bee, choo-choos like a train and, of course, moos like a cow. The kids ate it up, as Dornfeld \u2014 no small voice talent herself \u2014 knew they would.\n\n\u201cHe makes nonsense reality,\u201d Dornfeld said of Geisel\u2019s gift. \u201cKids are so creative. They really do tap into an imaginary world, and he\u2019s right there with them.\u201d\n\nGeisel\u2019s influence is ongoing, she noted. Not only has he spawned successors, such as the children\u2019s author Mo Willems (\u201cDon\u2019t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!,\u201d \u201cElephants Cannot Dance!\u201d), but his own books remain timeless.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s because he brings so much joy to early readers,\u201d Dornfeld said. \u201cWhether you are reading or being read to, he really inspires you to read.\u201d\n\nRyan Howard, a staffer at Bookies, has been a Seuss fan since childhood.\n\n\u201cI was actually in my second-grade production of \u2018The Lorax,'\u201d Howard, 29, said. \u201cIt continues to be one of my favorites. I think that\u2019s one of the pleasures of Dr. Seuss, that it has universal appeal across the generations.\u201d\n\nCindy Thrasher of Aurora introduced the Seuss books to her family as a young mother. Now, as a grandmother to a 2-year-old girl, it\u2019s a second-generation tradition. \u201cI think that Dr. Seuss was a wonderful author, from \u2018The Cat in the Hat\u2019 to all the others,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has a very recognizable style in every book he wrote.\u201d\n\nWilliam Porter: 303-954-1877, wporter@denverpost.com or twitter.com/williamporterdp\n\nThe Denver Public Library\u2019s Central Children\u2019s Library at 10 W. 14th Ave. will hold a Dr. Seuss birthday party on March 1 at 10:30 am.
