The governor ridiculed Mr. Rubio at length for his incomplete attendance record in the Senate and noted that some of the ads on Mr. Rubio\u2019s behalf were funded by a group that did not have to disclose its donors.\n\nThe cumulative effect of all the ads, and corresponding attacks through harshly worded mailings, has been to stunt the growth of the so-called establishment candidates, keeping them clustered together in New Hampshire polls while Mr. Trump soars.\n\n\u201cThese guys are so busy fighting one another that they\u2019re only continuing to facilitate the rise of Trump and Cruz,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a longtime Republican strategist.\n\nAfter the Iowa caucuses, and then the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9, the pressure on those candidates who are lagging in the polls will intensify.\n\n\u201cWhoever is not named Trump and not named Cruz that looks strong out of both Iowa and New Hampshire, we should consolidate around,\u201d said Henry Barbour, an influential Republican strategist based in Mississippi.\n\nBut it is not clear that the Iowa and New Hampshire results will come so neatly, or that the also-rans will be so willing to drop out after two states. Mr. Bush, in particular, still has the support of a well-funded super PAC. And even if he were to trail Mr. Rubio after the first contests, Mr. Bush might still fight on to South Carolina, where he recently won the support of Senator Lindsey Graham and where he plans to call on his older brother, former President George W. Bush.\n\nSome in the party now concede that it might take until March or beyond for the Republican establishment to coalesce behind an alternative to the current front-runners. And that could be too late to catch Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz.\n\nPhoto\n\nJudd Gregg, a former senator from New Hampshire, said he believed his state would cull the field, but he acknowledged that the primary calendar \u2014 and the lineup of conservative Southern states that vote in March \u2014 could prolong the race.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRobert F. List, a former Nevada governor, agreed.\n\nThe current \u201ccircular firing squad against the lower team,\u201d Mr. List said, \u201cis not helpful.\u201d\n\nMany in the party say they believe the assault by Mr. Bush against Mr. Rubio has been particularly damaging.\n\nMr. Rubio has stepped up his complaints in recent days about the ads from Mr. Bush and his supporters. Rubio aides have been working aggressively behind the scenes to portray the attacks as strengthening Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump, highlighting, for instance, an article in The Weekly Standard that argued that Mr. Bush would be to blame if Mr. Trump became the nominee.\n\nBut it is not just supporters of Mr. Rubio who are uneasy about the attacks against him by the super PAC backing Mr. Bush, Right to Rise, an assault that will have lasted two months by the New Hampshire primary.\n\nAsked about the attacks, Mr. Cole, who has not endorsed a candidate, suggested Republicans would not tolerate them much longer if Mr. Bush did not show viability in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cYou need to be prepared to stop if the evidence is that it\u2019s not working,\u201d Mr. Cole said, lamenting the \u201camazing amount of resources wasted on one candidate.\u201d\n\nMr. Barbour, who is also uncommitted, was even blunter. \u201cWhy is Right to Rise spending all this money on somebody who can beat Hillary?\u201d he asked. \u201cMeanwhile, Trump and Cruz go mostly unscathed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Barbour was so exasperated by the intra-establishment combat that this month he sought to raise money for the super PAC supporting Mike Huckabee that would have been spent to attack Mr. Cruz in Iowa. But Mr. Barbour found few donors willing to intervene in such a volatile race.\n\nThe party\u2019s major contributors are starting to become increasingly vocal in their impatience.\n\n\u201cThe next couple of weeks are very important for Jeb,\u201d said William E. Oberndorf, who has given more than $1.5 million to Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign and the super PAC backing him.\n\nOthers in the party\u2019s donor class are so worried that they are already envisioning another path to their preferred nominee, months after the primary contests, at the Republican convention this summer.\n\nEarle I. Mack, a real estate developer and former ambassador to Finland under George W. Bush, said the heavy bloodletting in the Republican race might prevent any candidate from clinching the nomination. In that case, he said, Republicans should turn to Speaker Paul D. Ryan.\n\n\u201cIn these horrible crossfires, with everybody shooting each other down, it would be good to nominate somebody uncontroversial, who could appeal to a broader electorate,\u201d Mr. Mack said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160126050023, "twitter": {"description": "Members of the party establishment fear that time is running out for a credible alternative to emerge as the mainstream candidates continue to bash one another.", "title": "As Donald Trump and Ted Cruz Soar, G.O.P.
