All of them are untrue,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid not long ago on the floor of the Senate.\n\nFour years after the president signed the measure into law, there are, of course, many real stories of hardship under Obamacare. An extensive list of which is included at the end of this article. But when Reid made those remarks, he wasn\u2019t repeating words carelessly dashed off by some 20-something staffer. Rather, he was repeating a meme that has become common among those who economist Thomas Sowell dubs \u201cthe Anointed,\u201d intellectuals whose belief in their own superior knowledge and virtue leads to their misperception that they are an anointed elite more qualified to make decisions for the rest of us in order to lead humanity to a better life.\n\nThe Anointed\u2019s \u201cno horror stories\u201d meme arose when leftist pundits found potential holes in the story of Julie Boonstra, a cancer patient featured in ads run by Americans for Prosperity. While Boonstra did lose her policy due to Obamacare, she has kept her physicians and the new policy she found doesn\u2019t yet appear to cost her any more money.\n\nSome on the right sought to blunt the attack by unjustly complaining that the left was attacking cancer patients. But the left was not attacking Boonstra and other cancer patients as much as trying to discern the extent to which Boonstra was a true victim of Obamacare. Investigating the details of such cases is perfectly legitimate.\n\nThat said, one hopes the political left honors that legitimacy the next time Michelle Malkin, Mark Steyn, Powerline and others challenge the details of the person Nancy Pelosi uses to promote SCHIP. Given the left\u2019s reaction in that incident, though, don\u2019t hold your breath.\n\nHowever, the Anointed didn\u2019t merely investigate the details of Boonstra. Instead, they took it a big step further. For example, here is Los Angeles Times business columnist Michael Hiltzik:\n\nKevin Drum [of Mother Jones magazine] wonders whether there\u2019s a single genuine Obamacare horror story out there, given that virtually every yarn promoted by Republicans or conservatives about people hurt by the Affordable Care Act has deflated like a pricked balloon on the merest examination.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a very good question, inspired by the latest horror story bloomer \u2014 the tale of one Julie Boonstra of Michigan, wholesaled by the Koch-founded conservative organization Americans for Prosperity.\n\nMaybe that question should be posed to Danielle Nelson. Nelson, a California resident, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. She had to take up a plan on the Covered California exchange with Blue Cross, which assured her that her oncologists were on the plan. But a sign at one of her oncologist\u2019s office states that Covered California plans are not accepted. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine this is how President Obama wanted it to happen,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nAs heartbreaking as that sounds, we still need to ask if that is genuine Obamacare horror story. Or perhaps Hiltzik can save us a lot of time by posing it to his colleague, reporter Chad Terhune, who wrote the story for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nHiltzik and Drum are not the only members of the Anointed to hint that there isn\u2019t a genuine Obamacare horror story. Andrew Sullivan also quotes Drum. Paul Krugman writes that the political right\u2019s new strategy \u201crelies on highlighting examples of the terrible harm Obamacare does. There\u2019s only one problem: they haven\u2019t managed to come up with any real examples.\u201d\n\nThe Anointed continue to believe in their vision of Obamacare that, as Krugman states, will \u201cincrease the burden on fortunate people \u2014 the healthy and wealthy \u2014 to lift some burdens on the less fortunate. One can almost credit Brian Buetler of Salon for acknowledging this: \u201cGiven the numbers involved, I\u2019d be pretty surprised if such people didn\u2019t exist.\u201d Unfortunately, Buetler is just being weasily: \u201cBut at some point it\u2019s worth asking whether the apparent difficulty conservatives have finding them suggests that maybe the law isn\u2019t wreaking all the devastation they want you to believe it is.\u201d Thus, if there is a plethora of horror stories, Buetler can say he believed it all along. In the meantime, he can leave readers with the implication that Obamacare isn\u2019t causing that many problems.\n\nThe Anointed continue to believe in their vision of Obamacare that, as Krugman states, will \u201cincrease the burden on fortunate people \u2014 the healthy and wealthy \u2014 to lift some burdens on the less fortunate: people with chronic illnesses or other preexisting conditions, low-income workers.\u201d In The Vision of the Anointed, Sowell notes evidence contrary to the vision is often ignored or dismissed. The tactic in this instance is to discredit all of the evidence of hardship under Obamacare by hyping the few instances that are inaccurate and portraying them as typical of all horror stories.\n\nUnfortunately, Obamacare does put the burden on some with serious illnesses. Larry Basich, for example, underwent bypass surgery in early January. He figured he was covered because he signed up for a UnitedHealthCare plan through the Nevada Health Link in November. Yet UnitedHealthCare has since claimed that he was never in their system, while Xerox, the contractor for the Nevada exchange, claimed he was. Then Xerox claimed Basich signed up for a different plan. In the end, the hospital claimed Basich wasn\u2019t covered when he had surgery and, for now, he owes over $400,000 in hospital expenses.\n\nThe term \u201chorror stories\u201d is also typical of the vocabulary of the Anointed. Sowell notes that \u201ca concern that is important to the benighted is called \u2018an emotional issue\u2019\u201d by the Anointed. Why don\u2019t the Anointed use terms like \u201chardship\u201d or \u201cpersonal suffering\u201d? Because neither of those is associated with the make-believe scary movies Hollywood produces like the word \u201chorror\u201d is. Thus, using the term \u201chorror story\u201d works perfectly when the writer wants the presumption to be that all such stories are exaggerated, if not fictional, until shown otherwise.\n\nThe Anointed also find other ways to dismiss the concerns of those struggling under Obamacare. When criticizing Julie Boonstra, Buetler states:\n\nIf she and [Americans For Prosperity] get their way, she\u2019ll be just as much a victim of Obamacare repeal as all the people who face health circumstances similar to hers. And the saddest part of that tragic irony is that Boonstra doesn\u2019t even seem to understand what her circumstances are, or why it doesn\u2019t make sense to devote her energies to repealing the law. Boonstra told the Dexter Leader, \u201cPeople are asking me for the numbers and I don\u2019t know those answers \u2014 that\u2019s the heartbreak of all of this. It\u2019s the uncertainty of not having those numbers that I have an issue with, because I always knew what I was paying and now I don\u2019t, and I haven\u2019t gone through the tests or seen my specialist yet\u2026 But that\u2019s just not so. Anyone who\u2019s studied the law knows it\u2019s not so. Anyone who\u2019s paid unexpected health bills in installments knows it\u2019s not so.\n\nIn other words, the uncertainty and fear that Boonstra faced when she lost her plan \u2014 whether her new plan would cover her needs and include her doctors \u2014 is not really an issue.\n\nKrugman, in fact, claims that the people actually who do face some hardship related to Obamacare don\u2019t deserve our concern. The \u201ctrue losers from Obamacare generally aren\u2019t very sympathetic. For the most part, they\u2019re either very affluent people affected by the special taxes that help finance reform, or at least moderately well-off young men in very good health who can no longer buy cheap, minimalist plans.\u201d\n\nThus, you don\u2019t need to feel for Jim Bulger, head of a cattle association in Texas, who is raising two teenagers. He lost his plan with a $5,000 deductible. He decided to go with a plan from his current insurer, Humana, because he liked the service he\u2019d received over the years and he wanted to keep his network of doctors. That resulted in a premium increase of 84 percent. But he\u2019s healthy and relatively affluent, so his problems can be dismissed.\n\nOne is tempted to say that the Anointed have a collective case of serious denial, but it\u2019s more than that. As Sowell has shown, people who think they know best how to run other people\u2019s lives always push major changes in public policy such as Obamacare. When the results are little short of a disaster, they ignore the evidence, dismiss the concerns of those who are struggling, and \u2014 here\u2019s the kicker \u2014 advocate for even greater changes in public policy.\n\nThe people who suffer are seldom the well-to-do, but are people like Gayle Ayala, who suffers from high cholesterol and high blood pressure and is at high-risk for breast cancer. She signed up for an exchange plan only to later learn that she\u2019d have to travel three hours to see any physician on the plan. She also found out she might not even be covered under the plan because, although the exchange listed her as enrolled, the insurer had no record of her.\n\nMaybe if Senator Reid still buys into the meme of the Anointed, he could talk to Ayala about her experience. After all, she lives in Nevada.\n\nPeople suffering because of ObamaCare Illness-related:\n\nGayle Ayala: Ayala has high blood pressure, high cholesterol and is at high risk for breast cancer. She had to travel three hours to visit a doctor covered under her exchange plan, Nevada Health Co-Op. The only gynecologist she has access to has been fined by three state governments for violating standards of care.\n\nJohanna Benthel: The 17-year-old has had 84 surgeries over her life due to congenital malformations in her brain. Her mother, Eileen, said her family policy was cancelled last year. Last year Johanna was treated in at a clinic at the University of Chicago. Eileen says the new policy they have offers no coverage for going out of New York and they have lost coverage for one of their doctors.\n\nLarry Basich: Basich underwent open-heart surgery in early January. The UnitedHealthCare plan he signed up for on Nevada\u2019s exchange claims they have no record of him and will not cover his surgery. Xerox, a contractor for the Nevada exchange, says Basich signed up with a different insurer. Right now Baisch is liable for $407,000 in costs for his treatment.\n\nGloria Cantor: Gloria and her husband, Jay, received a letter from their Florida insurance company saying their plan would be cancelled in 2014 because of Obamacare. Gloria is fighting cancer and her physicians could not assure her that they will take her new plan.\n\nJosie Gracchi: Gracchi\u2019s insurance plan rolled over into a new plan that was on the exchange in New York. As a result, the physicians who were treating her for breast cancer were no longer part of her network. A January 3 biopsy and subsequent surgery were delayed as a result.\n\nLenny Hubbs: Mr. Hubbs had insurance through his wife, Laura. Then, due to the costs of Obamacare, Laura\u2019s employer was unable to maintain coverage for its employees\u2019 spouses. Lenny had no insurance when he ended up in the hospital with a serious case of pneumonia. He and his wife ended up with a $100,000 hospital bill they will have to pay themselves.\n\nNeil Jacobson: Jacobson says it is important that his family has health insurance because his wife and son need regular medical treatment. Despite selecting insurance on the Vermont Obamacare exchange on December 16, subsequently paying three premiums, and spending over 15 hours on the phone with Vermont exchange representatives and Blue Cross Blue Shield Vermont, he does not yet officially have insurance. His ten-year-old son, Charles, though, did receive a letter from the exchange saying Charles had requested a change in his insurance.\n\nDanielle Nelson: Nelson, a California resident, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. She had to take up a plan on the Covered California exchange with Blue Cross, which assured her that her oncologists were on the plan. But a sign at one of her oncologist\u2019s office states that Covered California plans are not accepted. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine this is how President Obama wanted it to happen,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nEllie Porter: The six-year-old from Utah is undergoing treatment from kidney cancer. Late last year, her parent\u2019s insurance policy was cancelled. Her parents, Paul and Jami, were worried about whether the new policy they were looking for on the federal exchange would cover the physicians who had been treating Ellie. \u201cNot knowing where she\u2019s going to be in treatment, it\u2019s just the uncertainty of it,\u201d her father said. They were also facing the possibility of buying a plan on the exchange that cost double the rate of their current plan.\n\nShawna Simpson: Mrs. Simpson\u2019s daughter was injured in a cheerleading accident in January. It was only then that she learned the new ObamaCare exchange policy she was paying $600 per month for didn\u2019t cover any of the physicians she usually takes her family to see. In fact, it doesn\u2019t cover any of the physicians in her county of residence in Tennessee. \u201cWe have insurance at this point that is worthless,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 24 Mar 2014 07:58:45 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Despite a campaign to discredit those who suffer, there are many real stories of hardship under Obamacare.", "title": "The \u201cNo Obamacare Horror Stories\u201d Fairy Tale", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Julie-Boonstra-pic.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-27T08:01:46+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/03/24/the-no-obamacare-horror-stories-fairy-tale/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Despite a campaign to discredit those who suffer, there are many real stories of hardship under Obamacare.", "title": "The \u201cNo Obamacare Horror Stories\u201d Fairy Tale", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Julie-Boonstra-pic.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "Andrew Sullivan,Brian Buetler,Danielle Nelson,Gayle Ayala,Jim Bulger,Julie Boonstra,Kevin Drum,Larry Basich,Mark Steyn,Michael Hiltzik,Michelle Malkin,Paul Krugman,Powerline", "published_time": "2014-03-24T07:58:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-27T08:01:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Despite a campaign to discredit those who suffer, there are many real stories of hardship under Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4f6\"", "article_summary": "As heartbreaking as that sounds, we still need to ask if that is genuine Obamacare horror story.\nHiltzik and Drum are not the only members of the Anointed to hint that there isn\u2019t a genuine Obamacare horror story.\n\u201cThere are plenty of [Obamacare] horror stories being told.\nIt was only then that she learned the new ObamaCare exchange policy she was paying $600 per month for didn\u2019t cover any of the physicians she usually takes her family to see.\nShe signed up for an exchange plan only to later learn that she\u2019d have to travel three hours to see any physician on the plan."}
