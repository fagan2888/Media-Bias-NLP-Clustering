CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Afghani actor Fahim Fazli (fah-HEEM’ FAHZ-lee) says being a translator with the U.S. Marines in Afghanistan was his way of giving back to his adopted country.

Fazli had roles in “Iron Man” and “Argo” and was an adviser on “Charlie Wilson’s War.” But he left acting for two years to work for the Marines.

He’s written a book with New Hampshire professor Mike Moffett called “Fahim Speaks: A Warrior-Actor’s Odyssey from Afghanistan to Hollywood and Back.” They hope it will become a movie.

The book chronicles Fazli’s life from Russia-occupied Afghanistan in the early 1980s to Hollywood and then back to his war-torn homeland.

He says it was important for the Marines and Afghanis to understand each other. If they didn’t, he says, “They’re going to kill each other.”
