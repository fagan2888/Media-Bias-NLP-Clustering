Tania Ciolko posted a question for the Republican presidential candidates without ever expecting to get an answer, The Daily News reported.

On Thursday she posted a video on Youtube with the following statement:

“Despite the challenging economic outlook for the past several years, most people I know want to work (...). As president and in plain words, please describe one action you would do to make the economic environment more favorable for small businesses and entrepreneurs,” Ciolko says on the video.

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio got to answer her question during the second part of the debate, referencing fostering growth of small businesses, cutting taxes and repealing Obamacare as some options.

Ciolko said she was very surprised to learn her question was chosen and hopes that it sparks further debate among voters. "I was just so blown away," she told The Daily News. "Before I commit to anything on this, I want to review (the debate)."
