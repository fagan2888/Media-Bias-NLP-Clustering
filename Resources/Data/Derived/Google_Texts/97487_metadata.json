So when you see the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and the Soviet Union in other areas.\n\nCOLMES: Ukraine?\n\nAYERS: Yes, those were acts of terrorism and they were conquests and so on and it\u2019s true for us.\n\nCOLMES: Are we committing acts of terrorism right now?\n\nAYERS: Right now, absolutely.\n\nCOLMES: Where would you say we\u2019re doing that in Syria, in Iraq?\n\nAYERS: In Yemen, in Syria, in Iraq, in Afghanistan.
