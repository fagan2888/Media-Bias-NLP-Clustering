Tim Scott (R-SC). Although the Hannity segment was nearly ten minutes long, only a fraction of Rev. Barber\u2019s two-minute reply was included, but fortunately, raw video and audio of the event is available.\n\n\n\n\n\nFox News contributor David Webb traveled to the Forward Together Moral March in Raleigh, N.C., this weekend in order to ask Rev. Barber about comments he made likening Sen. Tim Scott to a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy. The result of that visit was played on Monday night\u2019s Hannity program, but as is often the case in the time-constrained news business, only about 25 seconds of Rev. Barber\u2019s response made it onto the show. At a press conference following the march, Webb asked, \u201cDo you feel you owe Senator Tim Scott an apology for calling him a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy, and black conservatives mouthpieces for the tea party?\u201d\n\nFrom there, the Hannity tape flash-cuts to Rev. Barber responding, \u201cIt\u2019s my job, it\u2019s my calling, it\u2019s the job of the NAACP to speak the truth about public policies,\u201d then cuts again to Barber, who said, \u201cAnd while some people may choose to get caught up on a metaphor, that is a regular usage of preachers, the real indignation and upsetness should be over the regressive agenda.\u201d\n\nHannity then cut to Webb pressing his questions, as the Moral Marchers ask to move on.\n\nMissing from that tape was Reverend Barber\u2019s description of the policies that he objects to, including \u201cpolicies that hurt voting rights, policies that hurt working people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get upset,\u201d Rev. Barber said, \u201cget upset over the denial of the Medicaid expansion. Get upset about voting to reject unemployment benefits for laid-off workers who are Republicans, who are Democrats, who are black, who are white. Get upset over reduced access to public education and funding. We are in the 60th year of Brown versus Board of Education, and some want to go backwards on public education, rather than forward. Get upset over the attacks to turn back voting rights that were won with blood, sweat, and tears.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy critique,\u201d Rev. Barber said, \u201cwas about public policy, not party.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s extended video of those remarks, via Make it Plain:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\nIn the even longer full audio that MIP has posted, Barber continued to speak passionately about the \u201cmoral calling\u201d he feels to challenge \u201cextreme policies,\u201d and Webb can be heard further pressing Barber about his Tim Scott remarks, until someone in the crowd yells \u201cWe\u2019ll speak for him, as the people of North Carolina. No, we don\u2019t apologize.\u201d\n\n[h/t IJR]", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Monday night's edition of Fox News' Hannity, host Sean Hannity played some extensively, and transparently, edited video of Fox News contributor David Webb", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/barber.jpg", "title": "Fox Newser Confronts NAACP\u2019s William Barber: What Hannity Didn\u2019t Show You"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Monday night's edition of Fox News' Hannity, host Sean Hannity played some extensively, and transparently, edited video of Fox News contributor David Webb questioning Reverend William Barber of the North Carolina NAACP on comments he...", "title": "Fox Newser Confronts NAACP's William Barber: What Hannity Didn't Show You", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/barber.jpg", "creator": "@TommyXtopher", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2014-02-11T17:54:09+00:00", "keywords": "tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe42f5\"", "article_summary": "Barber about comments he made likening Sen.
