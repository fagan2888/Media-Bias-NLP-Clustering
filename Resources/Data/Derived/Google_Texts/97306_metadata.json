Though tax cuts have been a mainstay of their campaigns since at least Ronald Reagan, though the top marginal tax rate is now the highest since the 1980s, though the party could win control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in almost a decade, Republicans are barely mentioning reducing tax rates with voters.\n\n\u201c\u2018In a campaign, you talk about what people are interested in,\u2019 said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). \u2018I keep notes on all my town meetings' and 'tax cuts haven\u2019t come up.\u2019 ... Some lawmakers \u2014 including ones no one would confuse for moderates \u2014 said they\u2019re less interested in tax cuts than tax reform, a subtle distinction that has major political and policy implications.\u201d http://politi.co/1t4e72E\n\nRICK STENGEL featured on N.Y. Times p. A4, \u201cDigital War Takes Shape on Websites Over ISIS,\u201d by Brian Knowlton: \u201c[J]ust as the United States has begun an aggressive air campaign against the militants, Richard A. Stengel, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, believes the United States has no choice but to counter their propaganda with a forceful online response. \u2018Sending a jazz trio to Budapest is not really what we want to do in 2014,\u2019 said Mr. Stengel, referring to the soft-edged cultural diplomacy ... during the Cold War. \u2018We have to be tougher, we have to be harder, particularly in the information space, and we have to hit back.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe State Department division that Mr. Stengel heads has tried a range of approaches for engaging with the Middle East since 9/11, from slick, Madison Avenue-style ads to traditional international-visitors and exchange programs. But now, digital operators at the State Department are directly engaging young people \u2014 and sometimes jihadists \u2014 on websites popular in Arab countries, publishing a stream of anti-Islamic State messages, and one somewhat shocking video, on Facebook or YouTube or Twitter, using the hashtag #Think Again Turn Away.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1rzYaFa\n\nLIVING HISTORY: Twenty years ago today, on the steps of the Capitol, House Republicans unveiled the \u201cContract with America.\u201d The checklist of 10 conservative promises was credited with helping the GOP win control of the House in Newt Gingrich\u2019s Republican Revolution of November 1994 -- the first time the party had controlled the House in 40 years. Frank Luntz, a pollster working for the House GOP, recalled that day in a phone interview from London: \u201cFor me, it was the moment of greatest optimism that I've ever had in and with American politics and, sadly, it's kind of been all downhill from there. ... It wasn't a platform. It was a contract, and it was meant to have an enforcement clause. And that whole enforcement clause -- I learned that from [focus group] sessions that I did in Denver ...\n\n\u201cThere would be some sort of accountability if they failed, and that was the line: \u2018If we break this contract, throw us out -- we mean it.\u2019 I wanted them to say that they wouldn't run for reelection, and they were unwilling to do that. That was too far, too much. The 1-800 number, which seems so old-fashioned today was a big deal back then, giving voters the ability to get more information. ... Newt used to tell people \u2018tear it out\u2019 -- that's why we had a perforated edge [when the Contract was published as an ad in TV Guide, still framed on the wall of one of Luntz\u2019s homes] \u2013 \u2018put it up on your refrigerator and track our progress.\u2019\n\n\u201cEven though Barry Jackson was running it, from a creative standpoint it was ... Newt for the overall strategy, Dick Armey for the contents, Kerry Knott for the execution, and me for the research, for the language. ... I had presented to the [House GOP] conference a big poster\u2014there was a retreat in Salisbury [Md.] and I had presented to them what was called a \u2018compact\u2019 at the time ... I was supposed to kick their ass. This is the time when HillaryCare, ClintonCare was the rage and Republicans were doing badly. I was invited to present to them the truth.\n\n\u201cI think I went too overboard: \u2018You're going to lose unless you get your act together. You're going to lose because you show no sense of humanity, because people hate politicians and they hate you even more. They think you don't care. They think you have no heart. \u2018 A few members complained about it. They said I was rude to them. So Gingrich had me get up early the next day and walk with him. He was asking me what's the word, what stands out, what could we do that would be different, that would address everything you said yesterday evening. And he came up with the word: \u2018contract.\u2019 I immediately said: \u2018This is amazing, that's it, that's the difference.\u2019 And the reason why? In a word, accountability. ...\n\n\u201c[A short time later, Luntz was in Germany at a program for young leaders, where he met young Jonathan Karl, then with CNN.] I had to leave the program two days early. I mentioned to Jon: \u2018I've got to do this research. We're going to put out a contract.\u2019 He said: \u2018Why do you need a contract? You're going to kill somebody?\u2019\u201d\n\n** A message from Comcast: Faster, More Reliable Internet Connections When Comcast and Time Warner Cable Come Together. Faster broadband.
