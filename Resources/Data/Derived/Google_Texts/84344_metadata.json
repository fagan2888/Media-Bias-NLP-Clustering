His latest book is: \u201c The Power of RELENTLESS! \u201d Dubbed by the media as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist,\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years. Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nSomething is wrong. Really wrong. Are you as worried as I am at seeing what\u2019s happening to America? Why is it happening?\n\nWell the first answer is Barack Hussein Obama. We have a madman at the wheel who is purposely doing everything he can to drive us off the cliff. It is so clear he is purposely overwhelming the system.\n\nBut the reality is, it isn\u2019t really Obama\u2019s fault. It\u2019s the GOP\u2019s fault. Share:\n\nPurposely destroying the voting demographics with an open border and amnesty by executive order; purposely destroying the economy and small business by taxing and regulating them to death.\n\nPurposely destroying the middle class with giant increases in health care and energy costs through Obamacare and draconian Environmental Protection Agency climate change regulations.\n\nPurposely killing full-time jobs with Obamacare.\n\nPurposely putting Israel in grave danger with an Iran treaty so terrible that Democratic ally and future Senate Minority Leader-to-be Chuck Schumer is voting against it.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the latest and greatest: Obama is purposely pushing Housing and Urban Developemtn policies to force communities all across America to build high-density, low-income housing in the middle of middle class and upscale neighborhoods.\n\nObama wants to bring crime, car-jackings, home invasions, drug dealing, dirty streets, broken street lights and lower property values to a street near you, no matter where you live. You can\u2019t move to safe, clean suburbia anymore. Nothing and no one is safe from the socialists out to ruin America and redistribute your wealth. Now they\u2019re re-distributing your neighborhood, your property values and your children\u2019s safety. Make no mistake about it: They are coming after you. They are bringing the battle to you. Perfect Saul Alinsky strategy.\n\nBut the reality is, it isn\u2019t really Obama\u2019s fault. It\u2019s the GOP\u2019s fault.\n\nIt\u2019s the Republican Party\u2019s job to protect us, to stop Obama, or at least to slow Obama. The GOP isn\u2019t doing its job. Of course, Obama and his socialist cabal will take anything we give them. If no one stands in the way, why not grab all the chips? That\u2019s only natural. If the bank manager left the bank vault door open, and sent all the security guards home, wouldn\u2019t thieves take advantage? If the farmer left the hen house door open, wouldn\u2019t wolves attack?\n\nSo I believe I\u2019ve figured out the problem. It\u2019s not Obama or Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. It\u2019s the GOP.\n\nAnd I have the solution too. My new book, \u201cThe Power of Relentless\u201d is out today.\n\nIt lays it all out. It perfectly describes what\u2019s happening to America and the GOP and how to save both. \u201cThe Power of Relentless\u201d is the answer to what\u2019s missing in the Republican Party and the conservative movement.\n\nThink about it. Can you even imagine being so weak-willed that you could win in a massive, historic landslide and yet be too timid, or frightened, or cowardly, or self-destructive to take advantage of it? Well that\u2019s exactly what just happened to the GOP. We won last November in such a big way, such a historic sweep, such a repudiation of Barack Obama that we should be dominating the agenda in Washington, D.C.\n\nObama should be facing impeachment. Obamacare should be defunded. Obama\u2019s amnesty for illegal immigrants should be defunded. A wall should be under construction at the Mexican border. Abortions at Planned Parenthood should be defunded. Obama\u2019s EPA regulations should be neutered. Taxes and massive regulations should be gutted. Obama\u2019s traitorous Iran deal should be put in a cage, covered with gasoline and set on fire. Obama\u2019s agenda should be in shambles. Obama should be hiding deep inside the White embarrassed to show his face after a public drubbing like he took.\n\nThe reality is Obama was beaten so badly last November that his own Senate candidates ran from him. They treated him more like Ebola than Obama. They refused to be seen on a stage with him. Yet he acts as if he won. He never lost a step. He never lost confidence. He never let us see him sweat. He disregarded it all, stayed true to his agenda, and just kept on attacking \u2026 and winning.\n\nHe\u2019s gotten everything he ever wanted in the months since he lost in a massive landslide. And the GOP, who won that massive landslide, has gotten nothing. We not only haven\u2019t stopped him. We haven\u2019t slowed him. That\u2019s \u201cThe Power of Relentless.\u201d\n\nObama understands it. The GOP clearly doesn\u2019t.\n\nObama is relentless. And that\u2019s why he\u2019s winning. I don\u2019t want to ever emulate Obama\u2019s policies. I want to defeat and destroy every single facet of Obama\u2019s socialist agenda.\n\nBut I do want the GOP to study Obama and emulate his style, his mindset, his gameplan. Because its brilliant. Steve Jobs once said, \u201cGood artists copy. Great artists steal.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time to steal from Obama\u2019s relentless mindset and playbook.\n\nIf only the GOP was as relentless as Obama. America, American exceptionalism, capitalism and Judeo-Christian values would be safe and thriving. We\u2019re not losing because of our policies or principles. We\u2019re losing because our GOP leaders in D.C. are weak, cowardly and pathetic. They aren\u2019t relentless, they\u2019re feckless. They\u2019re scared of their own shadow.\n\n\u201cThe Power of Relentless\u201d isn\u2019t even a political game plan. It was written as a business and personal development strategy and philosophy. It was written for anyone to apply to their career, or business, or personal goals, to achieve extraordinary success. Yet it applies perfectly to what\u2019s happening to the GOP, to Republican leaders in D.C. and to America.\n\n\u201cThe Power of Relentless\u201d is a roadmap to success. It\u2019s a game plan for stopping Obama dead in his tracks and taking back America. Every conservative should read it, memorize it and hand a copy to every GOP politician. Every Republican congressman and senator\u2019s office should be flooded with thousands of copies of \u201cThe Power of RELENTLESS\u201d from conservative activists and constituents. Maybe then they\u2019ll get the message through their thick skulls. We won, man up, be proud and strong and confident and relentless. This is a war \u2026 play to win!\n\nStop bringing a knife to a gunfight. This isn\u2019t badminton with Muffy at the country club. This is a war for the future of America. Obama understands that. It\u2019s time to fight fire with fire. Start proudly and relentlessly fighting for our conservative principles. Stop whining and giving us excuses for your failure. Start fighting like your country and your family\u2019s future depends on it \u2026 because they do!\n\nThat\u2019s \u201cThe Power of RELENTLESS.\u201d\n\nMiracles happen when you develop the attitude and mindset of never accepting defeat. Never giving up, or giving in. Never worrying about the odds against you. Never listening to the critics. Never worrying about the media or the polls. Just follow your heart, your gut and your convictions.\n\nThat\u2019s Obama\u2019s game plan. Why isn\u2019t it the GOP\u2019s? Why aren\u2019t our leaders fighting with the same back-to-the-wall, never-give-up or give-in spirit of Obama?\n\nIn America anything is possible. In America dreams come true. Well my dream is taking America back from Obama, Hillary, Bernie Sanders and their socialist cabal. My dream is saving \u201cthe American Dream.\u201d\n\nWith \u201cthe Power of Relentless\u201d anything is possible. It\u2019s time to dream big and fight relentlessly. Fight as if our homeland is under attack. Because make no mistake about it, we are under attack. We are in a battle for our existence. And if we don\u2019t win, America is done. Finished. Finito.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll sign onto my \u201cPower of Relentless\u201d philosophy and game plan. Because it\u2019s time to fight.\n\n\u2666 \u2666 \u2666\n\nExclusive excerpt from Wayne Allyn Root\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Power of RELENTLESS,\u201d on sale now\n\nThere is one thing I respect about Obama. He is relentless. He is my exact polar opposite. He has the exact same mindset as me- the power of RELENTLESS.\n\nSay what you want about Obama, he has gotten pretty much everything he ever wanted- from massive increases in spending\u2026to massive increases in the power of government\u2026to a massive stimulus program\u2026to raising the debt ceiling\u2026to massive tax increases\u2026to the most government regulations in history\u2026to massive entitlement spending\u2026to complete overhaul of healthcare (Obamacare)\u2026to a takeover of student loans\u2026to the virtual halt of deportations of illegal aliens and eventually a complete amnesty for 5 million or more \u2026to complete overhaul of the financial industry (Dodd Frank)\u2026to a complete takeover of the Internet\u2026to passing major legislation (for the first time in history) with Executive Orders. The list goes on and on. Obama certainly understands the power of RELENTLESS.\n\nBut the best example yet of my \u201cPower of Relentless\u201d philosophy and strategy is how Obama handled the biggest landslide in modern political history. That happened in November of 2014. It was a complete repudiation of Obama and his policies. It was a repudiation of Obamacare. It was a repudiation of the terrible economy. He actually publicly dared voters to make him the centerpiece of the election. He was so confident of his support and popularity that he dared voters to vote up or down on him and his policies. The result? An overwhelming, dominating, historic landslide by the GOP at every level of politics and government- Senate, Congress, Governors, State Legislatures, even local offices. Republicans won everything, everywhere.\n\nBut it gets even more humiliating for Obama. His own Democratic candidates treated him like the plague. Like he had Ebola. Like he never existed and they had never voted for anything he ever proposed and passed. In short, his own party disowned him for the election. They refused to campaign with him. They ran ads disassociating from him. They turned down offers to have him speak on their behalf. Virtually no Democrat anywhere in the country wanted to be in a picture with Obama. He was in a word- toxic.\n\nThen came the results. Landslide. Tsunami. A final nail in the coffin. The end of Obama. Pure repudiation.\n\nHow would a typical president respond? Anyone else would have hidden from public view for the last 2 years of his presidency, with his tail between his legs, licking his wounds. Anyone else would have hidden in the Oval Office among his few remaining loyal friends and confidants. Anyone else would be in severe depression. Anyone else would have realized that his presidency was over and the chance to pass a single important bill was dead.\n\nSo just hide in the White House and go to fancy state dinners, then quietly slide into retirement. See George Bush. That is the exact description of his last 2 years in office after the humiliation of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nBut how would a relentless president respond? He\u2019d completely ignore the landslide. He\u2019d act like it never happened. It would be business as usual. He\u2019d make believe that it didn\u2019t even bother him. He wouldn\u2019t even let it slow him down. He\u2019d just go ahead and ignore the will of the people, make believe he\u2019s in the right, and pass every single thing he ever wanted without Congress\u2019 approval- via Executive Order.\n\nThat\u2019s the exact description of Barack Obama\u2019s reaction and actions post historic landslide and repudiation. That\u2019s the power of RELENTLESS.\n\nI hate to admit it, but we are very much alike- Obama and I. We are symbiotic. Two exact personality matches- just on opposite sides if every issue. Yin and Yang. He will fight with every breath to impose socialism upon America\u2026 weaken and perhaps kill capitalism\u2026redistribute income\u2026 regulate business to death\u2026 and put government in charge of\u2026everything.\n\nHe believes \u201cthe state\u201d always knows best. He will use the power of RELENTLESS to grow government ever bigger. No one can stop him or slow him\u2026\n\nunless they are equally relentless.\n\nI will fight with every breath to make government smaller\u2026to reduce its power\u2026to make taxes lower\u2026and regulations fewer\u2026and to support capitalism\u2026and champion small business. I will use the power of RELENTLESS to give power back to the people. I\u2019m the anti-Obama.\n\nThe good news is that the power of RELENTLESS works\u2026for either side, for any goal, to turn any dream into reality. God help the people on the other side who don\u2019t understand this mindset. Far too few Republicans understand this mindset. Now you understand how Obama has run rough-shod over this entire country, and imposed his agenda. The opposition was not relentless. The opposition had no idea how to deal with a relentless president. The opposition plays by the rules. The opposition actually naively thought that \u201celections have consequences.\u201d If you defeat your opponent, it\u2019s over. He loses. Not true- if your opponent understands the power of RELENTLESS. Mere historic landslide defat won\u2019t even cause him to pause.\n\nBut I understand. After all, I wrote the book!
