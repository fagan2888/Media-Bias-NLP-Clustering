LAKEWOOD â€” It wasn't the high note Matthew Miller wanted to end his magical state track meet on.

Ever the optimist, though, Miller was still smiling after taking ninth place in the 300-meter hurdles on Saturday at the Class 3A State Track & Field Championships at Jeffco Stadium.

"Choked," he said. "It's one of those where you know what you've got to do and you just can't do it.

"I stuttered on the hurdles, but I felt like it was mental," the Florence Huskies senior added. "Physically, I could've done it. Mentally, I wasn't ready."

Earlier in the day, Miller placed fourth in the 110-meter hurdles, much higher than what he was seeded at entering the state meet (11th).

He entered the meet in the 300-meter hurdles tied with the eighth fastest qualifying time. In the preliminaries, he ran the third fastest time.

Last year, Miller entered the meet seeded 13th in the 300s and 14th in the 110s, but he made the finals in both.

Also for Florence in the meet, Makenna Green capped her prep career with a 10th-place finish in the shot put Friday.

Green finished 13th as a freshman, 11th as a sophomore and seventh last year.

Taylor Holand didn't clear any of her three jumps in the high jump Thursday.

When Holand was a freshman, she tied for second in the high jump and tied for third last season. She entered Thursday's competition tied for seventh, but wasn't optimistic heading in. Earlier this season, the junior suffered a sprained ankle on her jumping leg.
