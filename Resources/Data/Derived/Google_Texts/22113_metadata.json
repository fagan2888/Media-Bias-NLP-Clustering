The bank has nearly $30 trillion in assets under custody and administration. Smooth fund accounting is something its clients rely on.\n\nIts archrival, State Street Corp is considered the No. 1 provider of mutual fund accounting services.\n\nBNY Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine said he did not know how many funds had been affected.\n\nIn addition to Federated Investors, Guggenheim Investments and First Trust Advisors both had ETFs affected by the glitch, the firms said.\n\n\"The SunGard system became available with limited capacity late yesterday,\" Heine said on Wednesday. \"Our teams have been working together to clear the backlog and we are working with SunGard to resume normal processing as soon as possible.\"\n\nBNY Mellon said it was able to construct Monday net asset values (NAVs) for all affected funds. But there remains a backlog of Tuesday NAVs that still need to be generated.\n\nFirst Trust, which manages several exchange-traded funds, said on Wednesday in a statement that the net asset value of some of its funds contained errors greater than 1 percent.\n\n\"The errors resulted from a technical malfunction at our third party administrator, the Bank of New York Mellon,\" First Trust said.\n\n(Reporting by Tim McLaughlin in Boston and Jessica Toonkel in New York; Additional reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston.; Editing by Andrew Hay, Carmel Crimmins and Lisa Shumaker)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - BNY Mellon Corp was scrambling to fix a computer glitch on Wednesday that", "title": "BNY Mellon pricing glitch affects billions of dollars of funds", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/26/BNY-Mellon-says-fund-pricing-system-collapsed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/bnymellon_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/26/BNY-Mellon-says-fund-pricing-system-collapsed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/bnymellon_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - BNY Mellon Corp was scrambling to fix a computer glitch on Wednesday that", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabd1\"", "article_summary": "BNY Mellon raised the alarm with regulators and held emergency calls with customers to try and resolve the problem.\nBNY Mellon said it was able to construct Monday net asset values (NAVs) for all affected funds.\nNew York-based BNY Mellon has been under fire from some hedge fund investors for having too many employees and not reining in expenses.\nBNY Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine said he did not know how many funds had been affected.\nSeveral dozen funds run by Federated Investors Inc alone were affected by the pricing glitch, including the $1.2 billion Federated Muni and Stock Advantage Fund, Federated said."}
