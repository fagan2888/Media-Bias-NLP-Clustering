Nor did she say how she would intend to achieve them, because the Pacific trade deal can only be accepted or rejected by Congress in full \u2014 not further negotiated.\n\nClinton campaigned with Brown in Youngstown, Ohio, on Saturday.\n\nThe Democratic presidential contender came out against the trade agreement in the fall, driving a wedge between Obama and herself. As his secretary of state, she had advocated for the agreement dozens of times, calling it the \u201cgold standard\u201d of trade deals as it took shape.\n\nAfter a loss in Michigan last week, she is trying to boost support in Rust Belt states, where rival Bernie Sanders has shown strength. He\u2019s made opposition to trade agreements, which he argues hurt American workers, central in his campaign.\n\nSanders frequently criticizes Clinton\u2019s past support for trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and one normalizing trade relations with China. Both were signed by President Bill Clinton while she was first lady.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Ohio, Clinton opposes Obama auto parts trade standard", "author": "Lisa Lerer", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In Ohio, Clinton opposes Obama auto parts trade standard", "title": "In Ohio, Clinton opposes Obama auto parts trade standard", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/12/in_ohio_clinton_opposes_obama_auto_parts_trade_standard/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/dem-2016-clinton.jpeg19-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Ohio, Clinton opposes Obama auto parts trade standard", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/dem-2016-clinton.jpeg19-1280x960.jpg", "title": "In Ohio, Clinton opposes Obama auto parts trade standard", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "In Ohio, Clinton opposes Obama auto parts trade standard", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Sanders frequently criticizes Clinton\u2019s past support for trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and one normalizing trade relations with China.\nThe Democratic presidential contender came out against the trade agreement in the fall, driving a wedge between Obama and herself.\nDespite her tougher line, Clinton did not specify what rules on domestic auto parts she would favor as she campaigned in advance of the Ohio presidential primaries Tuesday.\nTopics: From the Wires, News, Politics NewsCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Hillary Clinton wants stricter rules on auto imports than the Obama administration negotiated in a sweeping Pacific trade deal that\u2019s a major priority for the White House.\nNor did she say how she would intend to achieve them, because the Pacific trade deal can only be accepted or rejected by Congress in full \u2014 not further negotiated."}
