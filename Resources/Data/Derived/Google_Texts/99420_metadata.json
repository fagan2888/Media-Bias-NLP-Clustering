Patrick Harlan, 36, of Galesburg, is a truck driver and president of the Knox County Tea Party.\n\nHarlan says he would repeal ObamaCare without replacement, returning to \u201ca true free market\u201d in health care, which is contradicted by his desire to retain Medicare and Medicaid, at least for now, \u201ceven though it\u2019s socialized medicine.\u201d Those with pre-existing conditions that lock them out of the private health insurance market can receive charitable care, he says. That same fidelity to free market principles would have him gutting the Farm Bill. He\u2019d eliminate any public assistance for crop insurance and ethanol.\n\nHe would abolish the Department of Education, the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Security Agency on the basis that they interfere with states\u2019 rights. He would eliminate the federal minimum wage for much the same reason. He wants a flat tax of 18 percent and would drop many standard deductions, with a \u201cmaybe\u201d on mortgage interest, though he acknowledges that he hasn\u2019t done the math on what that would mean for the federal budget. Reducing the national debt is a top priority. He would give Americans a choice as to whether to participate in Social Security.\n\nHe would be a reliable \u201cno\u201d on all free trade agreements, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. On immigration, he vows to \u201cseal\u201d the border but calls Donald Trump\u2019s wall \u201cridiculous.\u201d Regarding the taking of Syrian refugees and others from the Middle East, he says \u201cthe majority of Muslims are getting a bad rap\u201d but curiously adds that he would impose an unprecedented religious test for immigration that would keep Muslims out until there are ironclad security assurances, which also does not quite square with his advocacy for religious freedom as codified in the First Amendment. To that, he says the United States is a \u201cJudeo-Christian country.\u201d\n\nOn foreign policy matters, Harlan is opposed to the nuclear deal with Iran, reluctant to commit ground troops to fight ISIS, insistent that North Korea is \u201cnot that big of a threat\u201d but open to intervening in Ukraine against Russian aggression. He says climate change is a myth.\n\nOn abortion he is 100 percent pro-life, no exceptions. He confesses to not knowing much about what the Peoria part of the 17th District wants from its congressman, but ultimately says, \u201cI can\u2019t be any worse than what we have.\u201d\n\nBoccarossa also is a social conservative, saying that \u201cAmerica\u2019s got a hole in its soul,\u201d which he would like to begin repairing, though he is slightly less absolute on abortion (exception for life of the mother) and gun control (generally favors background checks, restricting ownership to the mentally ill) than his opponent. He, too, would repeal ObamaCare, though he\u2019d replace it with Health Savings Accounts, while permitting insurance companies to compete across state lines and implementing tort reform to reduce the cost to consumers.\n\nOn the Farm Bill, he says \u201cAmerica must take care of farmers.\u201d Free trade must be \u201cfair trade,\u201d he says, and while he\u2019s open to such agreements, it seems the U.S. \u201calways gets taken.\u201d His purpose in going to Washington would not be to eliminate multiple federal agencies, though he\u2019d tame some to reduce the burden on small business. To that end he\u2019d also simplify the tax code. He, too, would get rid of some deductions.\n\nHe calls Trump\u2019s mass deportation plan impractical, says he\u2019s no fan of a wall and believes the borders can be policed and protected with drones and other technologies. He\u2019d push for wider use of the E-verify program but provide a path for citizenship to those who serve in the U.S. military or some other public service such as the Peace Corps and who agree to learn and speak English. He favors immigration restrictions by country, not belief.\n\nOn foreign policy, he prefers economic sanctions to war as \u201ca last resort\u201d and can only see committing American troops to the battle against ISIS if part of a real coalition of nations. He\u2019d create a safe haven for Syrian refugees in the Middle East rather than bringing any here. He arguably is Quad Cities-focused, saying his top priority is preservation of the Rock Island Arsenal after years of cuts.\n\nUltimately, both candidates express support for GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz of Texas, which may provide the best glimpse into their politics. That said, we're not confident there is any room to the right of Harlan, we find Jack Boccarossa a tad more measured and pragmatic in his positions - which is how we prefer our elected officials regardless of party, as those are the ones who get things done - and he is endorsed. The winner will take on Bustos in November.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two candidates motivated by their opposition to public funding for Planned Parenthood and their support for gun rights are seeking the Republican nomination for the 17th Congressional District seat now held by Democrat Cheri Bustos.\r\nJack Boccarossa, 69, of Milan, is retired from the Rock Island Arsenal as an engineer and small arms designer, with a stint as a procurement analyst at the Small Business Administration and experience in the private sector as owner of a Christmas tree farm.
