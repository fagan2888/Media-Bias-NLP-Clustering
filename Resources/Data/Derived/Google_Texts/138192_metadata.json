A cool end-of-day breeze kicked up.\n\nLater Sunday night in downtown Mariupol when the artillery started, the booms and flashing lights over the rooftops looked like lightning and sounded like thunder.\n\nTo the trained ear, however, the sounds of artillery are easily distinguished from those of thunder. Artillery rumbles in shorter, higher treble pulses. After living with war on their doorstep for more than a year, the citizens of Mariupol\u2014an industrial city of 500,000 on the Sea of Azov\u2014can easily detect the difference.\n\nCombined Russian-separatist forces launched an artillery and rocket attack on several small villages on Mariupol\u2019s periphery Sunday night. Electricity flickered in the city center, while the sounds of explosions lasted from 10 p.m. until about 11 p.m.\n\nThe attack destroyed houses and caused civilian casualties. As of Monday morning, local authorities reported two civilians killed and six wounded, as well as more than 50 homes damaged. The Ukrainian military reported no killed or wounded soldiers.\n\nA statement from the 0629 news site (which covers Mariupol) read: \u201cA child with a ripped off foot was taken by an ambulance to town hospital No. 3. Two other residents, one missing an arm, another one missing a leg, were admitted to town hospital No. 4. Several civilians managed to walk to hospitals on their own and requested medical assistance.\u201d\n\nA later statement said the body of a young woman was also found near the attack area.\n\nInitial reports indicated that a rocket attack caused the civilian casualties, although the overall attack also comprised heavy artillery up to 152-mm, according to Ukrainian National Guard soldiers in the area.\n\nNotably, Sunday\u2019s attack occurred in a section of Mariupol\u2019s outlying neighborhoods through which an advancing combined Russian-separatist force would avoid a bridge crossing over the Kal\u2019mius river, which divides Mariupol in two. That bridge, where the present-day M14 road crosses the river, was the scene of a protracted Red Army defense against Nazi invaders in 1941 during World War II.\n\nA combined Russian-separatist advance on Mariupol from nearby Shyrokyne would have to cross the river along M14, while an offensive from a more northerly direction\u2014such as from Sartana, a location of Sunday night\u2019s attack\u2014would bypass the river crossing altogether, allowing for an encirclement of the city from the north.\n\nUkrainian military and intelligence officials stationed in Mariupol say that a combined Russian-separatist offensive would likely involve an attack from the north to surround the city, which, if successful, would force defending Ukrainian forces backed up against the Sea of Azov into a Dunkirk-like retreat.\n\nThe Ukrainian military is dug in around Mariupol, however, and is much better equipped and trained than one year ago, when it successfully repelled a separatist tank attack on the city\u2019s outskirts in the days and hours leading up to the first cease-fire on Sept. 5.\n\nOne Ukrainian soldier, speaking on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, said taking Mariupol would be \u201cimpossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian army is ready to fight, many to the death,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a real war if the separatists attacked.\u201d\n\nLife as Usual\n\nMonday morning in Mariupol, life went on as usual, underscoring the battle-hardened resiliency of the population in this industrial seaside town that has endured the threat of war for more than a year.\n\nFighting raged in the streets in May and June 2014, when Ukrainian forces retook the city from pro-Russian separatists. And in September 2014, tank battles on the city\u2019s outskirts (comprising about 30 combined Russian-separatist tanks, according to Ukrainian military reports) rattled windows in the city center.\n\nAnd in January 2015, a separatist Grad rocket hit a civilian neighborhood, killing 29.\n\nYet the early July withdrawal of combined Russian-separatist forces from Shyrokyne spurred reluctant optimism that the war could be drawing down.\n\nOn Sunday evening, hours before the deadly attack, the mood in Mariupol was festive. In Mis\u2019kyi Garden, which overlooks the Sea of Azov on a bluff, families attended an outdoor play, couples pushed strollers, and children were riding bikes and rollerblading. The coarse sand beaches on the Sea of Azov down below were filled with sunbathers. Young adults played beach volleyball and a group of boys were taking turns diving off the end of a pier. Beachside caf\u00e9s were full. Patrons in bathing suits and flip-flops dined on calamari and Greek salad (a specialty in Mariupol due to the large Greek population) and drank Stella Artois.\n\nYet, like the gathering thunderheads over the Sea of Azov throughout the afternoon, the war loomed in the distance. Although it is difficult to detect in their outward behavior, in private conversations, residents admit they are afraid. Many have the trunks of their cars packed with clothes and important documents, ready to flee if things fall apart.\n\nAn \u2018Explosive\u2019 Situation\n\nSunday\u2019s attacks were the latest in a recent escalation of fighting in eastern Ukraine, which has lasted for more than a week. A Ukrainian military spokesman said Sunday that the fighting was at its highest levels in more than six months since the Feb. 12 cease-fire.\n\nIn a Sunday newspaper interview, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said, \u201cThe situation in eastern Ukraine is explosive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a lot at stake,\u201d he added. \u201cIf both parties in the conflict don\u2019t return to the peace process, a new military escalation spiral could be triggered at any time.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, according to the Ukrainian military, combined Russian-separatist forces violated the cease-fire a record 175 times, including: 25 artillery attacks, 64 mortar attacks, 19 BM-21 Grad rocket launcher attacks, and 93 small arms and rocket-propelled grenade attacks.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian military, combined Russian-separatist forces also attacked Ukrainian positions 136 times on Aug. 15 and 148 times on Aug. 16.\n\nTwo Ukrainian soldiers died Sunday.\n\nThe escalation in the war\u2019s intensity has spurred Mariupol\u2019s residents to oppose a proposal by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to establish a 30-kilometer-wide \u201cbuffer zone\u201d along the line of contact between Ukrainian and combined Russian-separatist forces.\n\nThey are particularly fearful of Ukrainian abdication of control over nearby Shyrokyne as part of a larger demilitarization plan. Residents also question the logistics of the move, since Mariupol lies in the middle of where the proposed buffer zone would exist.\n\nIn the park in front of Mariupol\u2019s destroyed city administration building (which separatists torched in 2014) protesters against the buffer zone proposal have set up an encampment. Tents are plastered with signs, such as \u201cNo to the demilitarization of Shyrokyne.\u201d\n\nEven in Kyiv, protesters on the Maidan, the city\u2019s central square, recently rallied against the demilitarization of Shyrokyne and the buffer zone proposal.\n\nOne Kyiv protestor held a sign that read: \u201cNo to demilitarization. Yes to impeachment.\u201d\n\nPoroshenko recently pushed back against claims that he was abandoning Mariupol.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018buffer zone\u2019 does not include Mariupol,\u201d he said, according to a Ukrainska Pravda report. \u201cEach unit remains at its location. Only heavy artillery and MLRS are withdrawn, which will be returned upon conflict escalation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo here is a separate message for Mariupol residents: The president is with you, the army is with you, do not listen to those who panic,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile taking Mariupol would be a challenge for combined Russian-separatist forces without overt Russian intervention (such as air support), Mariupol is still a primary target, according to some experts.\n\n\u201cAny Russian offensive in southeastern Ukraine would probably be much harder for the Russians than the ones last year, and they were not easy, as the Ukrainians have been preparing for further Russian moves furiously since the end of the battle of Debaltseve,\u201d said Andrew Fink, a national security analyst based in Kyiv.\n\n\u201cIf the Russians are going to try another actual offensive,\u201d he added, \u201cwhat propaganda I\u2019ve read suggests that the most likely target for any big offensive is still the obvious one\u2014Mariupol.\u201d\n\nThe Next Night\n\nThe mood is calm at a seaside caf\u00e9 (across from a beach named Santa Barbara) on Monday night. There is another storm over the Sea of Azov, catching the setting sun like the night before. The late afternoon sea breeze rustles tree branches.\n\nBeneath the caf\u00e9 is a road that parallels the coast. Sometimes, the stereo bass from a passing car sounds like the percussion from distant artillery, provoking, just for an instant, the question: \u201cHas it started again?\u201d\n\nIn Mariupol\u2014a European city in 2015\u2014one thinks about such things.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Sunday night in downtown Mariupol artillery started, the booms and flashing lights over the rooftops looked like lightning and sounded like thunder.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On Sunday night in downtown Mariupol artillery started, the booms and flashing lights over the rooftops looked like lightning and sounded like thunder.", "title": "Artillery Attack Rattles Ukrainian City as War Heats Up", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150817_MariupolAttack_Peterson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-17T23:54:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1WzdLmr"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On Sunday night in downtown Mariupol artillery started, the booms and flashing lights over the rooftops looked like lightning and sounded like thunder.", "title": "Artillery Attack Rattles Ukrainian City as War Heats Up", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150817_MariupolAttack_Peterson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Ukraine", "published_time": "2015-08-17T13:54:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-17T23:54:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, Lavrov, Mariupol"}, "article_summary": "According to the Ukrainian military, combined Russian-separatist forces also attacked Ukrainian positions 136 times on Aug. 15 and 148 times on Aug. 16.\nCombined Russian-separatist forces launched an artillery and rocket attack on several small villages on Mariupol\u2019s periphery Sunday night.\nYet the early July withdrawal of combined Russian-separatist forces from Shyrokyne spurred reluctant optimism that the war could be drawing down.\nFighting raged in the streets in May and June 2014, when Ukrainian forces retook the city from pro-Russian separatists.\nA Ukrainian military spokesman said Sunday that the fighting was at its highest levels in more than six months since the Feb. 12 cease-fire."}
