By 2030, Colorado\u2019s population of residents older than 65 will be 125 percent larger than it was in 2010, growing from 550,000 to more than 1.2 million.\n\nWith the prospect of an aging Colorado quickly becoming a reality, virtually everyone would prefer to remain at home and independent. We hope our family and friends can do so as well.\n\nHelping to fulfill that hope for the frail elderly and disabled, Programs of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) offers a range of services to people over 55 who qualify for nursing-home level care but wish to remain independent. PACE programs provide enrollees with doctor visits, medications, day programs, behavioral services, hospital care, and long-term services and supports. Most PACE participants are enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nDuring the last Colorado legislative session, Denver-based InnovAge backed a bill that would let nonprofit PACE providers operate as for-profits \u2014 anticipating a parallel change in federal law. InnovAge is Colorado\u2019s largest PACE provider and among the largest nationally. The bill was approved and made effective earlier this year.\n\nConcerned about conversion\n\nIn late October, the nonprofit InnovAge filed a plan with the Colorado attorney general to convert to a for-profit company. Officials from InnovAge say conversion is necessary for the company\u2019s growth. But InnovAge\u2019s proposal has raised concerns with advocacy groups, including the Colorado Center on Law and Policy, Colorado Consumer Health Initiative and Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition. Additionally, several public charities \u2014 including the Rose Community Foundation, The Colorado Trust and the Colorado Health Foundation \u2014 have voiced their concerns through written public comments and testimony at a public hearing in December.\n\nWhy are these organizations concerned? In short, the conversion affects thousands of elderly and disabled Coloradans and involves hundreds of millions in community assets. Among the issues at stake:\n\n\u2022 InnovAge wants to dedicate proceeds from the conversion to its own foundation, with a self-appointed board. An organization with direct ties to InnovAge may not be the appropriate custodian because there is a risk it could inappropriately favor the newly formed for-profit. It is critical to involve affected communities regarding how they would best be served by the hundreds of millions of dollars of community assets that will be realized by the conversion.\n\nA new independent foundation may better serve elderly and disabled Coloradans, or an existing foundation may be able to disburse funds more efficiently. Colorado has significant experience with conversion foundations, and we should learn from that experience. For example, public input had a substantial positive effect on the creation of the Caring for Colorado Foundation, realized as a result of the conversion of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Colorado.\n\nReview InnovAge assets\n\n\u2022 An independent valuation expert should review the assets stated by InnovAge. While InnovAge estimates the value of its assets at $213 million, the valuation might be closer to $400 million by the time the transaction occurs because the potential market for PACE services is growing and Denver\u2019s real estate market is booming. Under common law, such assets belong to the people, and should benefit the populations that the converting nonprofit was established to serve.\n\n\u2022 If the conversion is approved, the quality of care should be monitored. Any change of ownership in an organization that serves a fragile population raises concerns.\n\nColoradans should encourage Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman to consider whether InnovAge\u2019s assets are valued fairly and allocated appropriately and to ensure that the level of care provided by the new for-profit entity is not degraded. The attorney general will accept written comments on the conversion proposal on her website until Jan. 8.\n\nInnovAge\u2019s substantial value \u2014 which was built through public funding and years of tax-exempt status \u2014 should be used to benefit the frail elderly and disabled.\n\nElisabeth Arenales is the director of the Colorado Center on Law and Policy\u2019s Health Program.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: InnovAge assets must help elderly, disabled", "title": "Guest Commentary: InnovAge assets must help elderly, disabled", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/31/guest-commentary-innovage-assets-must-help-elderly-disabled/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151231__OP03ARENALESp1.jpg", "height": 429}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151231__OP03ARENALESp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-31T10:14:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T21:57:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Review InnovAge assets\u2022 An independent valuation expert should review the assets stated by InnovAge.\nIn short, the conversion affects thousands of elderly and disabled Coloradans and involves hundreds of millions in community assets.\nPACE programs provide enrollees with doctor visits, medications, day programs, behavioral services, hospital care, and long-term services and supports.\nA new independent foundation may better serve elderly and disabled Coloradans, or an existing foundation may be able to disburse funds more efficiently.\nHelping to fulfill that hope for the frail elderly and disabled, Programs of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) offers a range of services to people over 55 who qualify for nursing-home level care but wish to remain independent."}
