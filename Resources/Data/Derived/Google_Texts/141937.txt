Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders have something in common. Neither believe in Obamacare. But Ted Cruz is trying to repeal it. And Bernie Sanders is trying to save it.

And therein lies one major difference between Cruz and Sanders.

Cruz is a market based Texas Tea Partier. He would let the market rule in insurance. And he fights for what he believes in.

Sanders is a Vermont based socialist. He would get the insurance companies out of game and replace all those payers with a single payer national health insurance system.

But while Cruz spent 21 hours on the Senate floor last month fighting for what he believes in, Sanders spent 21 minutes yesterday fighting for what he says he doesn’t believe in — Obamacare.

Cruz spent 21 hours straight last month in a filibuster calling for the repeal of Obamacare.

Sanders would also repeal Obamacare and replace it with single payer.

But Sanders won’t take to the Senate floor and fight for single payer, because even though he calls himself an independent, he’s tied to the Democrats in Congress.

As such, he is bound to defend a law he doesn’t believe in.

Sanders calls Obamacare “a good Republican program,” which it is — based on Mitt Romney’s health care law in Massachusetts.

So why didn’t Sanders take to the floor of the Senate when Cruz was holding his filibuster and say to Cruz — I agree with you, we need to repeal Obamacare — and replace it with single payer?

And then engage Cruz in a debate?

Sanders could have put single payer back on the map.

Why didn’t he do that?

Because like all the single payer Democrats in the House and Senate — Sanders, despite calling himself an independent — is bound and gagged by the dictates of Obama and the Democratic Party.

Yesterday, Sanders spent 21 minutes or so on the floor of the Senate defending a law he doesn’t believe in.

Or as Sanders put it yesterday — “I don’t believe in Obamacare.”

Then why are you defending it, Bernie?
