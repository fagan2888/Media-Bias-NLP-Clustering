Gutting the Affordable Care Act through the courts obviously isn\u2019t going to happen, and the odds of Congress repealing the law anytime soon are zero.\n\nIf the goal is to prevent ACA benefits from reaching more American consumers, the right can continue to fight against Medicaid expansion at the state level, but conservatives are quietly failing on this front, too, even in \u201cred\u201d states.\n\nIn April, Montana , hardly a bastion of liberalism, ignored the Koch-financed Americans for Prosperity and approved Medicaid expansion. Last week, Alaska Gov. Bill Walker (I) did the same. And just one day later, a deal was struck in Utah . The Salt Lake Tribune reported:\n\nThe so-called Gang of Six \u2013 Gov. Gary Herbert, Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, House Speaker Greg Hughes, House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan and Sen. Brian Shiozawa \u2013 huddled this week constructing the skeleton of a new Medicaid plan to replace the governor\u2019s Healthy Utah and the House\u2019s Utah Cares proposals. On Friday, they announced their agreement, saying it was sustainable and would protect other key areas of the budget.\n\n\u201cThere is still work to be done,\u201d Herbert said in a statement, \u201cbut I believe we now have a framework in place that will provide care for Utahns most in need while being responsible with limited taxpayer funds.\u201d\n\nThis puts Utah on track to become the 31st state to accept Medicaid expansion \u2013 32nd if we include the District of Columbia \u2013 through \u201cObamacare.\u201d Estimates vary, but roughly 120,000 low-income Utahans are expected to gain coverage through the compromise agreement, assuming the Obama administration signs off on the deal.\n\nIf this sounds vaguely familiar, Utah\u2019s Republican governor announced a related plan two years ago, which would have brought Medicaid expansion to the state, but which was ultimately derailed by far-right lawmakers in the state House.\n\nOfficials are reportedly far more optimistic about this new effort, thanks in part to buy-in from the Republican state House Speaker and the Republican state House Majority Leader.\n\nAs for the bigger picture, what we discussed last week holds true: conservatives should prepare for similar defeats soon. There will no doubt be some holdouts and dead-enders, but the arithmetic and common sense can only be denied for so long.\n\nThose who continue to argue that states should reject the policy out of partisan spite \u2013 regardless of the benefits for families, regardless of the needs of state hospitals, regardless of the effects on state finances \u2013 are facing headwinds that are only growing stronger.\n\nS tates can only hurt themselves on purpose for so long before the madness ends.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "In the race for Medicaid expansion, it's 31 states down, 19 to go.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/over-rights-objections-obamacare-scores-another-win", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "In the race for Medicaid expansion, it's 31 states down, 19 to go.", "title": "Over right's objections, 'Obamacare' scores another win", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/over-rights-objections-obamacare-scores-another-win", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/2013-09-29t010721z_1832254206_gm1e99t0p9501_rtrmadp_3_usa.jpg?itok=r7ZUIbER", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/over-rights-objections-obamacare-scores-another-win", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/2013-09-29t010721z_1832254206_gm1e99t0p9501_rtrmadp_3_usa.jpg?itok=VlkmNjZk", "height": 553}, "title": "Over right's objections, 'Obamacare' scores another win", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "In the race for Medicaid expansion, it's 31 states down, 19 to go."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-20T10:42:04-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care,health-care-reform,medicaid,obamacare,utah,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Over right's objections, 'Obamacare' scores another win", "published": 1, "date": "07/20/2015 10:42:04 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/over-rights-objections-obamacare-scores-another-win"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "In the race for Medicaid expansion, it's 31 states down, 19 to go.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Health Care, Medicaid, Obamacare, Utah"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc833\"", "article_summary": "Officials are reportedly far more optimistic about this new effort, thanks in part to buy-in from the Republican state House Speaker and the Republican state House Majority Leader.\nIn April, Montana , hardly a bastion of liberalism, ignored the Koch-financed Americans for Prosperity and approved Medicaid expansion.\nLast week, Alaska Gov.\nAs for the bigger picture, what we discussed last week holds true: conservatives should prepare for similar defeats soon.\nOn Friday, they announced their agreement, saying it was sustainable and would protect other key areas of the budget."}
