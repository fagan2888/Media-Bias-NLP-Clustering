Who would be opposed to two years of free college? But Lesko does know full well that there can be problems when the federal government offers such a potentially huge program. After reading my analysis criticizing the proposal, Lesko reached out for an interview to help understand why this \"free\" program could end up being a bad deal. In a nine-minute interview we talk about the massive administrative bloat that has driven up the price of college without improving the quality of education, how making community college free would increase this bloat, and the role the government would play in deciding what types of educational programs qualify for the program and how that could drive up tuition for those who don\u2019t choose approved training paths. I also discuss my own background as a graduate of community college back in the day. This interview was recorded before I knew about the plans in the Obama budget to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to create new and additional workplace credential programs, or I would have had even more to say.
