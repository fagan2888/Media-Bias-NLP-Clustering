A mechanical issue sparked a fire on a United Airlines jet Saturday morning at a Denver International Airport gate, fire and airline officials said.

Lt. Mike Pylar, a spokesman for the city’s fire department, said no one was injured in the blaze, which happened about 10 a.m. as only mechanics were aboard the Boeing 757 aircraft.

Pylar said the fire was in an engine, but the airline says it was not one of the aircraft’s wing-mounted motors.

“They were attempting to start it,” Pylar said of the mechanics. “When they did, it evidently started a fire.”

The plane was parked at the airport’s B Concourse when the blaze was sparked. Pylar said there was only minor damage to the aircraft.

“They got it under control pretty quick,” Pylar explained. Airport officials said further inquiries on the incident should be directed to United.

Luke Punzenberger, a spokesman for the airline, called the fire a “mechanical issue.”

The plane had initially boarded passengers and briefly pushed back from its gate en route to Orlando, Fla., when the pilots discovered a problem. The aircraft returned to the terminal and unloaded before the fire.
