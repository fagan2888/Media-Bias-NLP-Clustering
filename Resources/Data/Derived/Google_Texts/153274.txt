Communities in South Carolina continue to be a big stumping ground for presidential hopefuls.

Sen. Marco Rubio told residents Thursday why he deserves their vote.

He addressed a very hot-button issue that he says he knows a lot about.

Rubio told the crowd gathered at Sun City about the story of his parents, born in Cuba, who came to live the American dream.

Despite that link to legal immigrants, Rubio isn't shying away from the topic of illegal immigration

“It’s a problem we have to control. We need an e-verify system, more security at the southern border, and entry-exit tracking system to prevent visa overstays,” Rubio said.

Rubio said legal immigration needs reform too, and he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.

Rubio faces an uphill battle for the nomination in South Carolina.

A recent poll puts Donald Trump solidly in the lead in this critical, early primary state with 30 percent support. Ben Carson has 15 percent, and Rubio is in the single digits.

However, Rubio found some supporters.

“He supports Israel and wants to enhance our military,” Sue Harmon, from Lake Wylie, said.

Even voters admit it’s a long road to Election Day with plenty of talk between now and then.

“We look forward to more candidates coming through. We need to be informed for this next election,” voter Debbie Drabic said.
