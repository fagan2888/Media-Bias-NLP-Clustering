Four and a half months ago, Nina Pham, a nurse and patient quarantined with the Ebola virus, was joking around with the nursing staff at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Now she is preparing to sue.

Pham was the first person in the U.S. to contract the virus, after caring for a Liberian patient at the hospital. New allegations from Pham, together with her attorney Charla Aldous, say the infection likely stemmed from unsafe work conditions and a lack of training. After she got sick, the hospital continued to use her story as a boost for their public relations, the lawsuit contends.

“She wants answers,” said Aldous to CBS News. “She wants transparency.”

It wasn’t until Pham’s third day of training that she was finally given a hazmat suit to replace her double gloves and gowns as the first line of defense. Before then, nobody on the hospital staff had even said the word “Ebola,” Aldous claims. And during her recovery, added Aldous, Texas Health repeatedly shared Pham’s private medical records and “used” her illness as a way to build up their image.

“They put it out into the news media that Nina Pham wants to tell you the following – which wasn’t true,” Aldous said. “To me it just shows a callus. It looks like that THR was more concerned about its image than about Nine Pham.”

Wendell Watson, a Texas Health Resources spokesperson, released a statement in response. “Nina Pham bravely served Texas Health Dallas during a most difficult time. We continue to support and wish the best for her, and we remain optimistic that constructive dialogue can resolve this matter.”
