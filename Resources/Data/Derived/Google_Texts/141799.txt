Partners Healthcare is opening an urgent care center in the Boston area later this month as commercial clinics continue to gain steam.

The new Partners Urgent Care in Brookline, Massachusetts will be open 12 hours a day, representing direct competition to walk-in retail health centers.

It is owned and operated by MedSpring Urgent Care and Partners HealthCare, the latter founded in 1994 by Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital.

Two other urgent care centers in Newton and Watertown are expected to open this fall, according to Partners Urgent Care.

All Partners Urgent Care centers will have a physician on site and will be open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.

The urgent care centers will treat a wide range of illnesses and injuries for adults and children older than 12 months of age, offering an alternative to emergency room visits.

The health system plans to open as many as a dozen urgent care clinics over the next three years, according to The Boston Globe.

Steward Health Care System, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Lahey Health, and others have already opened similar centers in the Boston area, the Globe stated.

Partners is the largest system in the state. It is the parent organization to Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women's and 10 community and specialty hospitals, a managed care organization, a physician network, community health centers, home care and other health-related entities.

Several of the hospitals are teaching affiliates of Harvard Medical School, according to Partners.
