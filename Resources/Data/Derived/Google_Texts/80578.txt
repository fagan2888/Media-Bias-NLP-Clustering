American artist Ashley Olsen has been found dead at her apartment in Florence, Italy.

Her death is being treated as a homicide, police spokeswoman Maddalena Carosi said on Italian TV.

Italian news agency ANSA reported that Olsen, 35, was found strangled, but authorities declined to comment on the cause of death until an autopsy is complete.

Olsen's boyfriend, a fellow artist, reportedly found her body on Saturday.

He was concerned because he had not heard from her, so he asked Olsen's landlord to go with him to Olsen's apartment to check on her, ANSA said.

"The police haven't really said anything yet. My son is waiting for the police to share more," Olsen's grandmother, Ann Olsen, told CNN by phone from Florida.

Olsen's father, an architect, works for the Florence Art School Bianca Cappello.

Ann Olsen described her granddaughter as a beautiful girl. She owned a beagle named Scout.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the consulate in Florence was providing assistance.

"We can confirm the deaâ€Žth of U.S. citizen Ashley Olsen in Florence," the spokesperson said. "We extend our deepest condolences to her loved ones."
