House Democrats on Monday invoked Groundhog Day ahead of this week's vote to repeal ObamaCare yet again.

The Tuesday vote, which will be nearly the 60th against the healthcare overhaul, will miss Groundhog Day by 24 hours. But that isn't stopping Democrats from making comparisons to being stuck in a time warp.

"Happy #GroundhogDay. House Republicans will celebrate with their 56th vote to undermine or repeal the ACA," House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) tweeted

"If the #GOP sees it's shadow, it means we have 6 more weeks of #Obamacare repeal votes. #GroundhogDay," tweeted Rep. Sam Farr Sam FarrDems want oversight after 4 arrested for Honduran activist’s murder Congress has saved lives before and can do it again 27 Dems who haven't endorsed Clinton or Sanders MORE (D-Calif.).

Farr's tweet included a photo of Bill Murray, who stars in the 1993 film "Groundhog Day," with the caption: "Well it's Groundhog Day… Again. And that must mean that the GOP will call for their 56th vote to repeal the healthcare law."

But Democrats weren't the only lawmakers to compare politics to Groundhog Day. In a statement opposing President Obama's 2016 budget, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said the policies offered "more of the Washington gridlock."

"It may be Groundhog Day, but the American people can’t afford a repeat of the same old top-down policies of the past," Boehner said.
