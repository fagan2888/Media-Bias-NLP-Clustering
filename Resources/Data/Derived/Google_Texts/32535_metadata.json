In addition, DHS must prohibit using SNAP benefits for the purchase of crab, lobster, shrimp, or any other shellfish.\u201d\n\nThe bill was passed in a 60-35 vote.\n\nSupporters say the measure is fiscally responsible and encourages healthy eating, while opponents say that limiting the types of food that can be purchased places additional hardship on those receiving aid.\n\n\u201cA lot of people, an awful lot of people who are on FoodShare are also on BadgerCare, so there is a direct financial benefit not just to the individual, which of course is obvious to have better health, but also to state taxpayers and society as a whole,\u201d Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, told the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a restriction that\u2019s designed just to make the lives of those that are already struggling that much harder,\u201d Rep. Lisa Subeck, D-Madison, told The Capital Times. \u201cAnd instead, we should be focusing not on the foods people buy but on putting people to work by creating jobs that get people off of FoodShare.\u201d\n\nRachel Sheffield, a policy analyst for The Heritage Foundation\u2019s DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society, said that the \u201cfood stamps program is in serious need of reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost importantly food stamps should include a work requirement that requires able-bodied adults to work, prepare for work or look for work in exchange for receiving assistance,\u201d said Sheffield.\n\nThe bill will go on to the state Senate for approval. The AP reports that the Wisconsin Senate declined to take up a similar bill last year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Junk foods would be limited.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Junk foods would be limited.", "title": "WI Bill Limits Foods Food Stamps Can Be Spent On", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150519_Wisconsin_Scanlon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1HeXd8E"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Junk foods would be limited.", "title": "WI Bill Limits Foods Food Stamps Can Be Spent On", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150519_Wisconsin_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "welfare", "published_time": "2015-05-20T11:28:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Food stamps, SNAP, Wisconsin, FoodShare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbb4\"", "article_summary": "Assembly Bill 177 would limit the types of food that could be purchased with Wisconsin\u2019s food stamp program, FoodShare.\nWisconsin\u2019s State Assembly approved legislation last week that puts in place new rules about what recipients of food stamps may purchase with the benefits.\nThe AP reports that the Wisconsin Senate declined to take up a similar bill last year.\nIn addition, DHS must prohibit using SNAP benefits for the purchase of crab, lobster, shrimp, or any other shellfish.\u201dThe bill was passed in a 60-35 vote.\nThe bill will go on to the state Senate for approval."}
