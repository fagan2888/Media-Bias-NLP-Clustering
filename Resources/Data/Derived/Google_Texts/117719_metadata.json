(Matthew Jonas / Longmont Times-Call)\n\nLozinski said some of those wells \"were here already here when I got here\" and moved into the home about 15 years ago. He said they apparently were being re-drilled this summer, and the work has included directional and horizontal drilling that 's intended to extend tap more deposits than could be accessed by the original wells.\n\nThe fracking noise is sporadic, Lozinski said, with the worst noises coming when the oil and gas companies are building up the pressures needed to inject the fluids into the wells and while the fluids are being injected, a process he said can last several hours each time it happens.\n\n\"During the day, it's no big deal,\" he said, but when it happens at night, it's \"unreal.\"\n\n'When you're lying in bed, you can feel it'\n\nEncana spokeswoman Wendy Wiedenbeck said in a Saturday email to the Times-Call that \"we've had issues getting our decibel levels . . .noise down at this site,\" but that \"we've been working closely with noise control experts to identify and mitigate the noise.\"\n\nSaid Wiedenbeck: \"We anticipate wrapping up this stage\" of fracking \"by the end of next week.\"\n\nFracking at all three nearby wells reportedly is scheduled to conclude by the end of this month, Lozinski said. But he said he wants the companies to at least cease nighttime fracking now, even if that would mean extending daytime fracking for several more weeks.\n\nHe said there's been \"a humming noise that vibrates my house continually while the noise is at its loudest. My house doesn't move, but when you're lying in bed, you can feel it.\"\n\nLozinski said, \"I cannot get a good night's sleep. I wake up some days with headaches.\"\n\nHe said that there have been times he has gone to work \"sleepy, with a mild headache\" and wound up leaving because of his duty to ensure the safety of the aircraft crews and passengers the control center monitors.\n\nLozinski said he has met and communicated with Encana representatives about his concerns but that he's not satisfied with the response he has gotten thus far.\n\nHe said Encana offered at one point to pay the costs of temporarily checking Lozinski, his wife Tammy, their son Ryan, who's a Colorado State University student, and daughter Kari, a Mead High School student, into an area hotel or motel \u2014 as well as to cover the costs of their meals while they're not at home, until the fracking ends. But he said he's reluctant to leave his home and lawn and garden and the rest of his farmstead \u2014 including several goats he has there \u2014 unattended.\n\nEncana's Wiedenbeck wrote in her email that \"we work hard to manage the temporary impacts of our active operations, whether through the installation of hay bales and sound walls to address the noise or through offers of temporary housing and a related per diem.\"\n\nShe said Lozinski \"declined this and other offers to offset the impacts,\" such as offers to install window air conditioning units at his house and to cover any additional utility costs that the Lozinskis might incur in running that air conditioning.\n\nLozinski said there also have been discussions of some sort of other forms of Encana compensation for the problems he said he's been experiencing during the fracking, although he said no agreement has been reached on that score.\n\nHomeowner at the end of his rope\n\nMeanwhile, temporary noise-abatement walls that Encana erected around part of its nearby operation haven't done enough to reduce that noise, Lozinski said \u2014 something he said he has been told the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission discovered for itself when it measured decibel levels with equipment it recently brought to his front yard.\n\nLozinski said that an inspector for that state agency told him that he has recommended that the COGCC director Matt Lepore order Encana to do its fracking during daytime hours only.\n\nLozinski said the inspector told him Friday afternoon that he has written a citation alleging that Encana has been violating the state agency's maximum noise decibel levels that apply to areas like that in which the Lozinskis' home sits.\n\nLozinski said he's been told that the citation is the equivalent of a ticket that Lozinski said could face Encana \u2014 if it's found to have been in violation of those standards \u2014 with daily fines dating back to July 28, when Lozinski initially contacted the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to complain about the noise.\n\nEven so, the nighttime fracking, and the noise that came with it, resumed after midnight Friday, Lozinski said on Saturday, and lasted for several hours afterward\n\n\"I'm at my rope's end,\" Lozinski said.\n\nEncana's Wiedenbeck said the company \"initially received complaints from multiple areas nearby,\" but \"at this point complaints have significantly decreased, if not stopped altogether, with one exception.\"\n\nAs for Lozinski's concerns about the inability to sleep getting in the way of properly performing his air traffic control duties, Wiedenbeck wrote: \"Everyone has a responsibility to perform their work safely. We take that very seriously.\"\n\nSaid Wiedenbeck: \"We continue to demonstrate a commitment to addressing the temporary impacts of drilling and completions. We believe that is a cost of doing business. It's the right thing to do.\"\n\nTodd Hartman, the communications director for the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, a department that includes the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, could not be reached for comment about Lozinski's situation and the COGCC 's response to Lozinski's noise complaint.\n\nContact Times-Call staff writer John Fryar at 303-684-5211 or jfryar@times-call.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26350144/weld-county-resident-says-fracking-is-costing-him", "modificationDate": "2014-08-16T17:34:49-0600", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By John Fryar \n \n  Times-Call staff writer", "description": "Mike Lozinski says he's tired of not being able to get enough of the nighttime sleep  he needs in order to be to be alert  on his daytime job.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26350144:view"}, "startDate": "2014-08-16T15:05:21-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26350144/weld-county-resident-says-fracking-is-costing-him", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0816/20140816__17TCAFRACKw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Mike Lozinski says he's tired of not being able to get enough of the nighttime sleep  he needs in order to be to be alert  on his daytime job.", "title": "Weld County resident says fracking is costing him sleep"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Mike Lozinski says he's tired of not being able to get enough of the nighttime sleep  he needs in order to be to be alert  on his daytime job.", "title": "Weld County resident says fracking is costing him sleep", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26350144/weld-county-resident-says-fracking-is-costing-him", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0816/20140816__17TCAFRACKw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-16T15:05:21-0600", "endDate": "2024-08-16T15:02:46-0600", "sailthru.title": "Weld County resident says fracking is costing him sleep", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By John FryarTimes-Call", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-08-16T15:14:18-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd359e\"", "article_summary": "Lozinski's home sits on a small acreage at 11755 Weld County Road 15, and he said the southeast corner of the property is only about 325 yards away from the nearest Encana Oil and Gas well.\nFracking at all three nearby wells reportedly is scheduled to conclude by the end of this month, Lozinski said.\nLozinski said Friday that his sleep deprivation \"has become a safety issue with me\" because in his work, \"I'm dealing with lives.\"\nBut he said he wants the companies to at least cease nighttime fracking now, even if that would mean extending daytime fracking for several more weeks.\nSaid Wiedenbeck: \"We anticipate wrapping up this stage\" of fracking \"by the end of next week.\""}
