Thad Cochran\u2019s latest TV ad says he is the \u201conly\u201d candidate with a \u201c100 percent pro-life voting record from National Right to Life.\u201d Not so. He has voted against the NRLC five times since 1997 \u2014 notably on stem cell research \u2014 for a 92 percent score, not 100 percent. The claim is also misleading, because Cochran is the incumbent in the race, so of course he is the \u201conly one\u201d included in the NRLC congressional scorecard.\n\nChris McDaniel\u2019s campaign responded to the ad by claiming Cochran has supported \u201ctaxpayer funding for abortions.\u201d That\u2019s a stretch. Cochran has a long record \u2014 reflected in the NRLC scorecard and elsewhere \u2014 of opposing taxpayer-funded abortions. The McDaniel campaign rests its case on three votes in the 1980s, and there\u2019s more to those votes than meets the eye.\n\nNot the \u2018Only One\u2019\n\nThe Mississippi Senate primary has attracted national attention as a test of the tea party and its ability to challenge the Republican establishment. Cochran, a six-term senator, has the support of the state\u2019s top party leaders \u2014 including Gov. Phil Bryant, Sen. Roger Wicker and former Gov. Haley Barbour. Barbour was chairman of the Republican National Committee and is now helping to raise money for a political action committee, Mississippi Conservatives PAC, formed to help Cochran. McDaniel, a state senator since 2008, has endorsements from Sarah Palin, Club for Growth, Tea Party Patriots Citizen Fund and FreedomWorks.\n\nCochran\u2019s campaign went on the air April 2 with a 30-second TV spot called \u201cOnly One.\u201d The ad stresses Cochran\u2019s conservative voting record on three issues: guns, abortion and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe ad says \u201conly one candidate has a 100 percent pro-life voting record from National Right to Life. That conservative candidate is Thad Cochran.\u201d On the screen, voters see these words, \u201c100% Pro-Life Voting Record,\u201d with the URL for the National Right to Life homepage in small print.\n\nCochran does have a 100 percent score in the current Congress \u2014 and the two prior congressional sessions that ended in 2012 and 2010 \u2014 but that has not always been the case. The ad does not provide a time frame, so a viewer may come away with the mistaken impression that Cochran voted with the NRLC on every issue. Jordan Russell, a spokesman for the Cochran campaign, said the ad was referring to the current Congress. But, for example, the senator also scored 33 percent in the 107th Congress, 75 percent in the 109th Congress and 85 percent in the 110th \u2014 so the campaign does some cherry-picking with the record.\n\nOverall, Cochran has voted 59 times with the NRLC and five times against it since 1997, according to the NRLC website cited by the TV ad. (That\u2019s as far back as the website goes, even though Cochran has been in the Senate for 36 years and served almost six years in the House before that.) That\u2019s a 92 percent score during the last 17 years, from 1997 to 2013 \u2014 which indicates strong support of the organization\u2019s legislative agenda, but not 100 percent. He has voted multiple times for a ban on so-called partial-birth abortions, including in 2003. He has voted against repealing a ban on abortions at military facilities, and he has voted to cut off federal funding to Planned Parenthood.\n\nHis votes against the National Right to Life have come on stem cell research and campaign finance legislation. Cochran voted for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007 and the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005, and he voted against an amendment offered by Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana in 1997 that would have banned federal funding for research that uses embryonic tissue, cells or organs from induced abortions. Cochran was also one of 14 Republicans who signed a letter to President Bush in 2004, urging him to expand embryonic stem cell research.\n\nAs the National Journal put it in 2012: \u201cAs former head of the GOP caucus, Cochran is usually a reliable Republican vote, but he has crossed party lines, such as when he opposed restrictions on stem cell research.\u201d\n\nIn two other votes against the National Right to Life, Cochran voted in 2001 and 2002 to give final approval to campaign finance bills that the NRLC said would restrict the group\u2019s freedom of speech.\n\nIn a spirited exchange with a Cochran critic on its Facebook webpage, the Mississippi Right to Life defends Cochran and refers to his votes against the NRLC as \u201cin the far distant past.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have two really good pro-life candidates here whose candidate questionnaires and records we will be publishing as we get closer to election time but we will NOT allow this page to be used by either side to spread hate and discontent,\u201d the Mississippi Right to Life says.\n\nThat leads us to our second point: Both candidates are anti-abortion, but Cochran is the \u201conly one\u201d scored by the National Right to Life, because it is a congressional scorecard based on votes in Congress. The ad omits that.\n\nThe fact is that McDaniel has a strong record opposing abortion, too, and his supporters, not surprisingly, argue it is stronger. McDaniel, for example, supported the state\u2019s failed \u201cpersonhood amendment\u201d in 2011 that would have defined \u201cperson\u201d from the moment of fertilization. The ballot initiative was defeated, but it sparked a heated debate among opponents who believed it was unconstitutional and supporters who believed it was a moral imperative. (We could find no record of Cochran taking a position on the statewide ballot initiative, and neither could his campaign spokesman Jordan Russell. \u201cAs far as I can tell, Senator Cochran has never weighed in on a state ballot initiative,\u201d Russell told us.)\n\nMcDaniel spoke in support of the ballot initiative \u2014 Statewide Initiative Measure No. 26 \u2014 at an event sponsored by the Center for Pregnancy Choices of South Central Mississippi, as reported by the Laurel Leader-Call.\n\nLaurel Leader-Call, June 4, 2011: McDaniel said he favors the Personhood Amendment and anything else that promotes the pro-life message. \u201cIt\u2019s important to discuss it so everyone can understand it,\u201d he said.\n\nMcDaniel\u2019s record in the Mississippi Senate also includes sponsoring legislation in 2014 to ban so-called gender-selection abortions, co-sponsoring a bill in 2013 that would require a doctor\u2019s prescription for an \u201cabortion inducing drug,\u201d and sponsoring a bill in 2012 that would have prohibited abortions without \u201cinformed written consent\u201d if the fetal heartbeat can be detected. In 2010, he co-sponsored a bill that would have outlawed all abortions in Mississippi except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.\n\nCochran and Taxpayer-Funded Abortions\n\nIn response to the Cochran \u201cOnly One\u201d ad, McDaniel spokesman Noel Fritsch says in an April 1 press release that Cochran has supported \u201ctaxpayer funding for abortions.\u201d It\u2019s a claim that the campaign has made more than once, and it\u2019s an exaggeration.\n\nWhen we asked for evidence, the McDaniel campaign cited three votes in the 1980s restricting the use of taxpayer funds for abortions through Medicaid. Cochran has a decades-long history of supporting such restrictions. Nevertheless, the McDaniel campaign cited two votes on the so-called Hyde amendment, which restricts federal funding of certain abortions through Medicaid, and a third vote on an amendment restricting the District of Columbia from spending its own money on abortions.\n\nLet\u2019s take the Hyde amendment votes first \u2014 starting with a little background on the amendment, Cochran\u2019s early voting record on it, and the legislative skirmishes over exceptions to it that form the basis of McDaniel\u2019s claim.\n\nThe Hyde amendment, named after former Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, was enacted in 1976 as an amendment to the appropriations bill that funds Medicaid and has been added to annual spending bills ever since. But from the beginning there have been fights over the wording of the amendment and whether it should allow exceptions for cases of rape, incest or endangerment of the life of the mother. On June 24, 1976, the House took two votes on the Hyde amendment. The language said, \u201cNone of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to pay for abortions or to promote or encourage abortions.\u201d No exceptions. The House passed it both times that day. First it passed 207 to 167 with 57 members, including Cochran, not voting (pages 20412\u201320413 in the Congressional Record). Later that day it passed again 199 to 165, with 67 members not voting (page 20425). Cochran voted for it the second time, and the bill went to the Senate.\n\nThe Senate insisted on exceptions to the Hyde amendment and, in a compromise, the House voted 256 to 114 on Sept. 16, 1976, (page 30901) to provide an exception \u201cwhere the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.\u201d Cochran voted for that, too, and that became the law.\n\nA year later, there was an attempt by the Senate again to broaden the exceptions. On Dec. 7, 1977, Cochran voted (page 38728) for a motion offered by then-Rep. George Mahon of Texas to accept a Senate amendment that would expand the exceptions to include rape and incest. The motion failed, by a 171-178 tally, but that same day the House voted 181 to 167 to pass compromise language that added the new exceptions \u201cwhen such rape or incest has been reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public health service.\u201d Cochran also voted (page 38784) for that language, which became law for fiscal year 1978.\n\nSo, over the course of two years, Cochran voted for three versions of the Hyde amendment: one without exceptions; one with only an exception for the endangerment of the mother; and one with exceptions for rape, incest and the endangerment of the mother. But in every case he voted for a ban on federal funding of abortions through Medicaid.\n\nThe McDaniel campaign cites two of Cochran\u2019s votes during similar skirmishes in 1981 and 1989. We\u2019ll take them in chronological order.\n\nIn 1981, then-Sen. Jesse Helms sponsored an amendment to a supplemental appropriations bill that would have dropped the rape and incest exceptions added to the Hyde amendment in fiscal 1978. Cochran voted against the Helms amendment. McDaniel\u2019s campaign called this a vote for \u201ctaxpayer funding for abortion.\u201d It\u2019s not that simple.\n\nRussell, of the Cochran campaign, tells us the senator\u2019s vote against the amendment was on procedural grounds, not because he opposed the amendment. Russell says Cochran, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, supported then-chairman Mark Hatfield\u2019s position that the abortion provision should be taken up separately and not as part of the appropriations bill. Hatfield said during the debate that it was time for the abortion issue to be taken up in separate legislation because the Republicans won control of the Senate in the 1980 elections and could now move a separate bill through the Senate.\n\nThe Associated Press wrote of the disputed roll call vote: \u201cSome Senators who supported Helms in principle voted against him on procedural grounds.\u201d\n\nWe cannot independently confirm that Cochran cast his vote on procedural grounds, because the senator did not speak on the bill during the floor debate. But as a member of the appropriations committee he would have been likely to support the committee process and the chairman. Plus, his voting history to this point shows his support for the Hyde amendment \u2014 and the same is true for Hatfield and some others who voted against the Helms amendment.\n\nFinally, Cochran did vote for the final bill, which included the Helms amendment and became law. The spending bill easily passed 95-0.\n\nSimilarly, the McDaniel campaign cites Cochran\u2019s vote in the Senate on Oct. 19, 1989, for an appropriations bill that included House language that would have restored the exceptions for rape and incest that were stripped out by Helms in 1981.\n\nFritsch, McDaniel\u2019s spokesman, says in an email to us that Cochran\u2019s vote in 1989 expanded federal funding for abortion, so that justifies the campaign\u2019s claim that Cochran voted for taxpayer-funded abortions. But in this case, there was no direct vote on the abortion language. The Senate agreed to it in a voice vote a few weeks before the final vote on the $156.7 billion appropriations bill, so we don\u2019t know how he would have voted on the abortion language. It\u2019s possible he would have voted for it, given his votes in 1977 to allow exceptions in cases of rape and incest. But, even though Cochran voted for exceptions to the Hyde amendment, he still supported the funding ban \u2014 which is not the action of someone who supports taxpayer-funded abortions.\n\nIt turned out to be a moot point, anyway. President George H.W. Bush vetoed the bill because of the abortion language and Congress failed to override it. The House language was removed \u2014 see page 3 of a Nov. 14, 1989, House report on the bill \u2014 and the tougher Helms language remained until 1993.\n\nThe third vote cited by the McDaniel campaign came Nov. 7, 1985, on an amendment offered by Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire to the District of Columbia Appropriation Act of 1986. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, annual spending bills for the District from fiscal 1980 to 1988 included language prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest or endangerment of the mother\u2019s life. In 1985, Humphrey offered an amendment that would have barred the District from spending federal and local funds for abortion services, except when the life of the mother is in danger.\n\nCritics of the amendment cited home rule and claimed it would set a bad precedent by dictating how the District could spend its own money. The Washington Post, reporting on the amendment, said that \u201c15 states use their own funds to pay for abortions.\u201d By a 54-41 vote, the Senate voted to table the Humphrey amendment \u2014 which blocked the amendment from even coming up for a vote. Cochran and 17 other Republicans joined 36 Democrats to table the amendment.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until fiscal 1989 that Congress imposed a ban on the use of locally raised funds to pay for abortions, except if the mother\u2019s life is in danger. Under the threat of a presidential veto, the Senate voted 45-44 on Sept. 30, 1988, to add abortion language to the District appropriations bill. Cochran voted for it, so his position had changed since the 1985 vote. And his vote was critical in passing the legislation. McDaniel doesn\u2019t mention that vote. The ban on using local funds for abortion remained in place through fiscal 1993. Some type of ban \u2014 either on the use of federal funds or federal and local funds \u2014 has been in place every year since fiscal 1980, depending on party control of the White House and Congress.\n\nCochran\u2019s abortion record isn\u2019t perfect, as the NRLC scorecard shows and we noted in the section on Cochran\u2019s TV ad. But the scorecard also shows the senator has repeatedly sided with the group on issues it considers to be federal funding of abortion:\n\nWhen someone has been in office as long as Cochran has \u2014 41 years \u2014 there will be votes that his opponents can use against him. Some establish a track record and point to legitimate differences between candidates. Cochran did, after all, repeatedly support federal funding for stem cell research, and it hurt his perfect score that he falsely touts. Other votes are cherry-picked and used to build a false narrative about the incumbent. That\u2019s the case with McDaniel\u2019s exaggerated claim that Cochran supports \u201ctaxpayer funding for abortions.\u201d\n\nWe leave it to Mississippi voters to determine which candidate has the stronger voting record on abortion. The fact is that both strongly oppose abortion and both have the records to prove it.\n\n\u2014 Eugene Kiely", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ec8\"", "article_summary": "Jordan Russell, a spokesman for the Cochran campaign, said the ad was referring to the current Congress.\nThe ad does not provide a time frame, so a viewer may come away with the mistaken impression that Cochran voted with the NRLC on every issue.\nNot the \u2018Only One\u2019The Mississippi Senate primary has attracted national attention as a test of the tea party and its ability to challenge the Republican establishment.\nCochran\u2019s abortion record isn\u2019t perfect, as the NRLC scorecard shows and we noted in the section on Cochran\u2019s TV ad.\nRussell, of the Cochran campaign, tells us the senator\u2019s vote against the amendment was on procedural grounds, not because he opposed the amendment."}
