According to a report in Politico, we can count Michele Bachmann among the many who have recently had their health insurance canceled.

During a CNN debate with Democratic adviser Paul Begala, Bachmann claimed that she and her husband recently had their health insurance plan canceled and will now have to get a new plan through D.C.’s Obamacare exchange.

When asked by host Wolf Blitzer whether she’d signed up yet through the exchange system, Bachmann responded, “Are you kidding? I’m not going to waste an hour on that thing.”

“I lost my health insurance under Obamacare,” Bachmann said. “And so now I’m forced to go into the D.C. health exchange. I’m waiting until they fix this thing. I’m not going to sit there and frustrate myself for hours and hours.”
