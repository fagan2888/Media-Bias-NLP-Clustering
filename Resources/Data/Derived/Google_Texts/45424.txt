NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Prince teased the crowd at the 20th Essence Festival with appearances Friday night during sets by Janelle Monae and Nile Rodgers and his band, Chic.

Janelle Monae, wearing her signature white and black, lit up the stage with a high-energy performance that included a surprise cameo appearance by Prince as she covered his hit song, “Let’s Go Crazy.”

Prince, wearing all black in contrast, played the song’s final few bars on his guitar, prompting Monae to drop to her knees and drawing a huge roar from the audience.

Earlier in her set, she danced and strutted across the stage, working up a sweat as she entertained the crowd with her songs “Primetime” and “Electric Lady.”

When guitarist Nile Rodgers took the stage, Monae joined him for a performance of “We Are Family,” led by Kathy Sledge, who with her sisters “Sister Sledge” made the song famous.

“I was a surprise tonight so I couldn’t tweet it or Instagram it,” Sledge said. “That was very frustrating.”

Asked how she felt about returning to the stage, Sledge said, “It was like coming home.”

Chic ran through their top hits, “Everybody Dance,” ”I Want Your Love,” and “Le Freak.” Prince also joined his set, playing guitar on their song, “Dance, Dance, Dance.”
