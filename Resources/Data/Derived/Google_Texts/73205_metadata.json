Rodgers Health Center, Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences, and the Housing Authority of Kansas City, Mo.\n\nIn addition to dental services, there were vision screenings, healthy eating consultations, checks of height, weight and blood pressure, and information on applying for Medicaid and for insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis marks the screening\u2019s second year.\n\nOrganizers said it was part of a larger effort to improve care and access to medical services at Chouteau Courts and the nearby Riverview Gardens complex. Data shows these public housing complexes are hot spots for hospitalizations and emergency room use at Truman.\n\nThe two complexes combined have more than 350 families and perhaps triple that number of children, says Edwin Lowndes, executive director of the Housing Authority of Kansas City.\n\nBringing services to the residents was an \u201can opportunity to show the families that live here that our community cares,\u201d Lowndes says.\n\nHealth is an important element of that, he says: The health fair reminds them that \u201cthey have to take care of themselves, and we are going to help.\u201d\n\nYayhe\u2019s complaints notwithstanding, organizers chose to hold the event during spring break while kids were out of school. The event targeted kids from 5 to 13 years old.\n\nHilda Fuentes, CEO of Samuel U. Rodgers, says it\u2019s important to start early with messages about eating the right foods and making healthy choices. She got a glimpse of how the health fair contributed to that education.\n\n\u201cI just saw a child walk out, and he was brushing his teeth because he had just gotten a toothbrush and toothpaste,\u201d Fuentes says, \u201cand somebody was saying to him, \u2018OK, now don\u2019t forget to get the back and don\u2019t forget to brush your tongue.\u2019 And he was paying attention.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Funding for the initiative described in the story is provided by a grant from the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City, which also helps underwrite Heartland Health Monitor.\n\nMike Sherry is a reporter for KCPT television in Kansas City, Mo., a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Yahye Mohamed wants to be a surgeon when he grows up, but the shoe was on the other foot Monday when he attended a health fair at his public housing", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/kansas-city-public-housing-residents-get-spring-break-visit-health-providers", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/styles/medium/public/201503/YAYHE_HEALTHSCREEN.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Yahye Mohamed wants to be a surgeon when he grows up, but the shoe was on the other foot Monday when he attended a health fair at his public housing", "title": "Kansas City Public Housing Residents Get Spring Break Visit From Health Providers"}, "story_id": 393542550, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@mikesherrykcpt"}, "author": "Mike Sherry", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Kansas City Public Housing Residents Get Spring Break Visit From Health Providers"}, "nid": 70453, "datePublished": "2015-03-17", "wordCount": 575, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd29\"", "article_summary": "Mike Sherry is a reporter for KCPT television in Kansas City, Mo., a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I like the bus.\u201dMonday\u2019s health screening resulted from a partnership between Truman, Samuel U.
