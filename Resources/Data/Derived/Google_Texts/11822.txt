Will Robinson made the trip with his wife from Sacramento, Calif., to Denver for his first-ever pride fest and parade.

Standing at the Broadway end of Civic Center park after having marched 14 blocks down East Colfax Avenue to support the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community, he was all smiles.

“I’m just doing the right thing,” the 45-year-old said.

Sunday marked the conclusion of Denver’s 39th annual PrideFest with the event’s iconic parade to the festival in Civic Center park. The CoorsLight PrideFest Parade began at 9:30 a.m. in Cheesman Park and ended downtown.

Organizers expected about 325,000 people to attend the two-day festival, and by the looks of the celebration Sunday, they were right. Thousands were milling around some 250 vendor booths while listening to the bass beats of techno music and enjoying other live entertainment in the park.

The festival began Saturday with the “Big Gay 5K” and a kid’s parade.

Eileen Proctor, 56, of Denver, was ecstatic as she embraced her girlfriend near the parade’s finish after folding a giant rainbow flag. It was her first time marching with a group, which, she said, made her feel “so close” to the community.

“It’s growing for sure,” Proctor said of Denver’s acceptance for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender population. “If the government is not ready, the people are.”

Several streets are closed off downtown. Much of East Colfax Avenue will be closed during the parade.

The festival ends at 6 p.m. Sunday. Admission is free.
