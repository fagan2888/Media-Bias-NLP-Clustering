Mr. Abbott, the former Texas attorney general and a Republican like Mr. Perry, championed and defended some of Mr. Perry\u2019s and the Texas Legislature\u2019s most conservative initiatives, and echoed his predecessor in his inaugural speech, saying he would secure the border and fight the Obama administration\u2019s reach into the state.\n\n\u201cAs governor I will continue my legacy of pushing back against Washington, if they spend too much, regulate too much or violate our state sovereignty,\u201d Mr. Abbott, 57, told thousands of spectators and officials outside the Texas Capitol. \u201cAny government that uses the guise of fairness to rob us of our freedom will get a uniquely Texan response: \u2018Come and take it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Abbott has already taken pages from Mr. Perry\u2019s anti-Washington playbook.\n\nDemocrats and health care advocates had hoped that Mr. Abbott would reverse Mr. Perry\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid in the state, which has the highest rate of uninsured residents in the country. But Mr. Abbott made it clear recently that he would not expand the government health insurance program for low-income and sick people, with a spokeswoman saying that he had \u201cfought Obamacare and will continue to fight against it.\u201d\n\nSuch statements angered Democrats, many of whom worry that Mr. Abbott will continue to promote Mr. Perry\u2019s small-government mantra, which they said fails to provide an adequate safety net for all. But Mr. Abbott\u2019s approach has reassured Republicans, who control the Legislature and every top office and who argue that the Texas model has brought jobs and built a strong economy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think basically everyone is in the honeymoon period right now,\u201d said State Representative Jimmie Don Aycock, a Republican from Killeen, in Central Texas. \u201cI think he goes in with a good track record of trying to legally defend what the Legislature\u2019s views were.\u201d\n\nBut a Democratic congressman, Representative Joaqu\u00edn Castro of San Antonio, said the start of Mr. Abbott\u2019s administration \u201cseems so far like it\u2019s more of the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe gave some signs that he might be willing to be bipartisan,\u201d Mr. Castro said, \u201cbut at the end of the day, he\u2019s scared of the Tea Party and he\u2019s beholden to them, and so he\u2019s going to continue a very hard-right agenda in Texas.\u201d\n\nFor Texas Republicans, the inaugural ceremony was a festive occasion, marked by touches of state history, swagger and even a fighter jet flyover. Mr. Abbott took the oath of office with his left hand on a family Bible as well as a Bible believed to have belonged to Sam Houston, the first president of the Republic of Texas. The official program\u2019s front cover declared, \u201cEven the future is bigger in Texas.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Abbott\u2019s inauguration represented two firsts for the state \u2014 he is the first governor of Texas to use a wheelchair, and his wife, Cecilia Phalen Abbott, 55, is the state\u2019s first Latina first lady.\n\nMr. Abbott was 26 and a recent law school graduate in 1984 when a giant oak tree weakened by a storm fell on him as he was jogging in Houston. The tree crushed his spinal cord and left him paralyzed. On Tuesday, he called his inauguration \u201chighly improbable.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring this month 30 years ago, I laid in a hospital bed recovering from injuries that broke my back and left me forever unable to walk,\u201d Mr. Abbott said. \u201cThe journey from that Houston hospital to the Texas governorship was possible because of two powerful forces.\u201d\n\nThe first, he said, was the grace of God, and the second was Texas itself. \u201cI am living proof that we live in a state where a young man\u2019s life can literally be broken in half, and yet he can still rise up to be governor of this great state,\u201d said Mr. Abbott, who spoke at a lectern that was lowered so the crowd could see him as he sat in his wheelchair.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the state\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Abbott had mounted the legal defense in all of Texas\u2019 most high-profile courtroom battles in recent years, including its passage of the country\u2019s toughest voter-identification law, its strict new abortion rules, its ban on same-sex marriage and its legal challenges of President Obama\u2019s environmental, immigration and health care agenda.\n\nThe state remains starkly divided. With a handful of exceptions, out of the 181 members of the Legislature, most of the Democrats are either black or Hispanic, and most of the Republicans are white. Three times since 2012, federal courts have ruled that voting-related laws defended by Mr. Abbott discriminated against or disproportionately hurt black and Hispanic voters.\n\nThe new lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, a Tea Party favorite and former state senator from Houston who was also sworn in Tuesday, has outraged many Democrats with his conservative stands on border security, abortion and same-sex marriage. Mr. Patrick once criticized the openly lesbian mayor of Houston, Annise Parker, for marrying her longtime partner in Palm Springs, Calif., describing it as \u201cpart of a larger strategy of hers to turn Texas into California.\u201d\n\nAt the lectern, Mr. Patrick took a few selfies and later repeated a statement that has become his calling card: \u201cI respect all faiths and religions, but I am a Christian first, a conservative second and a Republican third, and I praise Jesus for this moment and this day.\u201d\n\nTexas has been bolstered by tax revenues on oil and gas production and by a boom in energy-related jobs. But the sudden, steep drop in crude oil prices \u2014 from more than $100 a barrel in June to below $50 in recent days \u2014 has caused widespread concern. A senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said the collapse of oil prices could be a \u201cheadwind for the Texas economy.\u201d\n\nNeither Mr. Abbott nor Mr. Patrick referred to oil prices in their speeches.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150120102348, "twitter": {"description": "Greg Abbott, who served as state attorney general under Rick Perry, has championed and defended his conservative initiatives.", "title": "Texas\u2019 New Governor Echoes the Plans of Perry", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/new-texas-governor-greg-abbott-expected-to-continue-on-perrys-path.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003460148"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/21/us/ABBOTT1/ABBOTT1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/new-texas-governor-greg-abbott-expected-to-continue-on-perrys-path.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003460148", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/new-texas-governor-greg-abbott-expected-to-continue-on-perrys-path.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Texas\u2019 New Governor Echoes the Plans of Perry", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 20, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Texas,Abbott  Gregory W (1957- ),Republican Party,Abbott  Cecilia Phalen,Perry  Rick", "news_keywords": "Texas", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Manny Fernandez", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Perry, Rick", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By MANNY FERNANDEZ", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Greg Abbott, who served as state attorney general under Rick Perry, has championed and defended his conservative initiatives.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/21/us/ABBOTT1/ABBOTT1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Greg Abbott, who served as state attorney general under Rick Perry, has championed and defended his conservative initiatives.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 20, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/f/manny_fernandez/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2015-01-21", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Perry, Rick", "published": "2015-01-20", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Texas", "slug": "21abbott", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150121140520, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/new-texas-governor-greg-abbott-expected-to-continue-on-perrys-path.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/21/us/ABBOTT1/ABBOTT1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Greg Abbott, who served as state attorney general under Rick Perry, has championed and defended his conservative initiatives.", "title": "Texas\u2019 New Governor Echoes the Plans of Perry"}, "pdate": 20150120, "articleid": 100000003460148, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Texas\u2019 New Governor Echoes the Plans of Perry", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/21/us/ABBOTT1/ABBOTT1-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4bd\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Perry stepped down after a 14-year tenure as the longest-serving governor and one of the most powerful in the history of Texas.\nThree times since 2012, federal courts have ruled that voting-related laws defended by Mr. Abbott discriminated against or disproportionately hurt black and Hispanic voters.\n\u201cAny government that uses the guise of fairness to rob us of our freedom will get a uniquely Texan response: \u2018Come and take it.\u2019 \u201dMr. Abbott has already taken pages from Mr. Perry\u2019s anti-Washington playbook.\nA senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said the collapse of oil prices could be a \u201cheadwind for the Texas economy.\u201dNeither Mr. Abbott nor Mr. Patrick referred to oil prices in their speeches.\nDemocrats and health care advocates had hoped that Mr. Abbott would reverse Mr. Perry\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid in the state, which has the highest rate of uninsured residents in the country."}
