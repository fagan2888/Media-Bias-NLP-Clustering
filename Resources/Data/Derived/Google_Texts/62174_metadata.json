Well, thanks to the above video from Life Noggin, now you can.\n\nSure, the animation quality is no Disney/Marvel film, but the sights are still something to behold.\n\nYou can see the heart pumping as our lab human goes jogging; a still not-entirely digested pizza lunch navigating its way through his digestive system (otherwise known as a bolus); the inverted vision of a beautiful date that can\u2019t help but give him gut butterflies; and how exactly the body breathes in oxygen and pumps out carbon dioxide.\n\nAmong one of the more interesting facts brought to us by Blocko, Life Noggin\u2019s mascot? That pizza slice, no matter how vocariously we eat it, doesn\u2019t simply rocket down our gullet like someone sliding a water chute. Instead, it\u2019s funneled to the stomach (and its digestive juices) through the careful contraction of the muscles within the esophagus.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping the video gives you an extra appreciation for all the hidden things our bodies do for us every second of the day.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "watch, human, body, perform, its, daily, routines, inside, belly, beast", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Ever wanted to see how the body eats, runs and falls in love from the inside?
