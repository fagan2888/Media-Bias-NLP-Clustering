Sitake replaces Mendenhall, who returned to coach the bowl games after taking the Virginia job.\n\nSitake was Oregon State\u2019s assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.\n\nMendenhall coached 11 years at BYU, finishing with a record of 99-43. He might have had win No. 100, but for five turnovers that put the Cougars in a 35-0 hole in the first quarter of Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nWhat could have been a bad way to leave was softened by the way BYU came back to make it a game. BYU got to within one score with 3:23 left, but wasn\u2019t able to get the ball back.\n\n\u201cWe did lose the game,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cBut I\u2019m taking with me a pretty good going away present.\u201d\n\nMendenhall said other teams might have simply folded rather than try for a comeback that seemed impossible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever been more proud of my team,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stayed together and unified and battled back and made it a great football game.\u201d\n\nBYU finished the season 9-4, losing to its bitter rival in the first game between the two teams played at a neutral site.\n\nA former Cougars running back (1994, 1997-2000), Sitake returns to his alma mater with 15 years of coaching experience, including seven years a defensive coordinator and four seasons as an assistant head coach.\n\nBorn in Tonga, and raised in Hawaii and Provo, Utah, Sitake becomes the first FBS head football coach of Tongan descent. He is the 14th head coach in BYU history, and just the fourth since 1972, when Hall of Fame coach LaVell Edwards took over the program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bronco Mendenhall was proud his team came back, happy to get one last going away gift, even if it wasn't a win for BYU in the Las Vegas Bowl.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Bronco Mendenhall was proud his team came back, happy to get one last going away gift, even if it wasn\u2019t a win for BYU in the Las Vegas Bowl.", "title": "Kalani Sitake hired as new coach of BYU", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/19/kalani-sitake-hired-as-new-coach-of-byu/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/18/las_vegas_bowl_football.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/18/las_vegas_bowl_football.jpeg", "title": "Kalani Sitake hired as new coach of BYU", "description": "Bronco Mendenhall was proud his team came back, happy to get one last going away gift, even if it wasn't a win for BYU in the Las Vegas Bowl.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "Now former BYU running back Kalani Sitake will take over as coach of the team Mendenhall led for 11 years.\nHe is the 14th head coach in BYU history, and just the fourth since 1972, when Hall of Fame coach LaVell Edwards took over the program.\nSitake was Oregon State\u2019s assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.\nBorn in Tonga, and raised in Hawaii and Provo, Utah, Sitake becomes the first FBS head football coach of Tongan descent.\nSitake replaces Mendenhall, who returned to coach the bowl games after taking the Virginia job."}
