Free Enterprise: What’s the biggest health reform sweeping the country today? If you answered ObamaCare, you’re wrong. The biggest trend is the rapid growth in private Health Savings Account plans.

HSAs let people buy high-deductible insurance and put pretax dollars into savings accounts to cover — tax-free — out-of-pocket costs. Extra funds are rolled over. The accounts are portable.

For years, conservatives championed HSAs as market-based health reform that gives consumers more control of their health care and their spending.

Democrats, naturally, hated the idea, claiming that HSAs would appeal only to the young and healthy, would destabilize the insurance market and wouldn’t hold down health costs. Ted Kennedy, for instance, dismissed them as “an untried, untested, expensive system that could provide billions of dollars of benefits to wealthy individuals and insurance companies.”

Republicans were finally able to overcome this intense opposition, authorizing HSAs in 2004. They’ve proved a big hit ever since.

According to America’s Health Insurance Plans, nearly 17.4 million people are in HSAs today, up 12% from last year and more than double the number in 2009.

And none of the Democrats’ attacks proved true.

Far from destabilizing the insurance market, premium growth slowed as HSAs grew. And now they’re helping slow the growth of health costs.

The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that these plans account for a quarter of the recent health-spending slowdown. And the Rand Corp. says a 50% HSA market share would slash health costs by $57 billion a year.

Unfortunately, ObamaCare may be thwarting this healthy trend. Individual and small-group enrollment has dropped in the past two years, just as ObamaCare’s onerous insurance rules kicked in. While large-group HSA plans are still growing, ObamaCare’s market distortions might put an end to that, too.
