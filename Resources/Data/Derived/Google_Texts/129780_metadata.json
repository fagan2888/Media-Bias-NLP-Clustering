For all the complaints about the state\u2019s caucus system, Iowans\u2019 demand that candidates show up in person, at small venues, is a solid test of a campaign\u2019s strength. Donald Trump, who thought he could get by on mass media and a few big rallies, got schooled on that. Ted Cruz, who outperformed nearly every poll leading up to the caucus, demonstrated a mastery of how to turn out his supporters that makes him a serious contender.\n\nNew Hampshire will perform a different service next Tuesday. The flinty voters of that state are far less susceptible to the preacher rhythms beloved by evangelicals and will be waiting to hear GOP ideas on the fiscal issues they hold dear. It\u2019s past time for that, and they should press candidates for more than the sound bites that have dominated to this point. In particular, voters should seek answers from those who would repeal the Affordable Care Act on what their replacement would be. A return to previous high numbers of uninsured and coverage being refused for preexisting conditions is not acceptable. The pace will only quicken after New Hampshire, so the time for a close examination of candidates\u2019 proposals is growing short.\n\nThe big personalities and high drama among this year\u2019s candidates have resulted in record ratings and engaged voters. It\u2019s been fun and is far preferable to the apathy of some past elections, but there is work to be done by voters before some of the most experienced candidates are forced out, leaving mostly the untested.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s turn is coming soon. On the GOP side, a winner-take-all format heightens the responsibilities of caucusgoers to ensure the state\u2019s delegates are awarded to a serious candidate with sound ideas. Marco Rubio, who surged to a strong third-place in Iowa, and who did well in a recent Star Tribune Minnesota Poll, could find fertile ground here if he brings substance as well as show.\n\nHillary Clinton eked out a win over Bernie Sanders, but revealed an enormous \u201cyouth gap\u201d that she must close to remain viable, particularly if Republicans choose a candidate who can energize young GOP voters. Declaring victory last night while the Iowa race was too close to call was poor form on Clinton\u2019s part and could create lasting enmity among those whom she can ill afford to have stay home if she\u2019s the nominee.\n\nSanders\u2019 appeal to progressive elements of the party is unquestionable, but Democrats will have to ask themselves some hard questions about which candidate could work productively with what may well be another GOP-dominated Congress that would be deeply skeptical of any new spending or increased taxes.\n\nRepublicans have a deep yearning, evidenced throughout this race, for a non-establishment candidate. Well and good. The republic needs those from time to time. But they also are badly in need of a candidate who can rebuild a vibrant, ideas-based GOP that goes beyond fear-mongering and cheap rhetoric.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "As campaign moves on, it's time to move beyond rhetoric to real ideas.", "title": "Iowa holds lessons for candidates and voters alike", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/iowa-holds-lessons-for-candidates-and-voters-alike/367398011/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145439185855171.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145439185855171.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "As campaign moves on, it's time to move beyond rhetoric to real ideas.", "title": "Iowa holds lessons for candidates and voters alike", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/iowa-holds-lessons-for-candidates-and-voters-alike/367398011/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145439185855171.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145439185855171.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "As campaign moves on, it's time to move beyond rhetoric to real ideas."}, "article_summary": "The big personalities and high drama among this year\u2019s candidates have resulted in record ratings and engaged voters.\nThe pace will only quicken after New Hampshire, so the time for a close examination of candidates\u2019 proposals is growing short.\nIt\u2019s past time for that, and they should press candidates for more than the sound bites that have dominated to this point.\nIn particular, voters should seek answers from those who would repeal the Affordable Care Act on what their replacement would be.\nIowa performed its quadrennial service to the nation, and for that we should be thankful."}
