The 12th annual Frankfort Wellness Fair will be held from 8:30 a.m. to noon, on Feb. 28, officials announced in a news release.

Michael Shepherd, vice president of marketing and public relations with Franciscan Alliance, said the event is beneficial for members of the community.

"There's great value for people who want to keep monitoring their health or those who want to find out where they're at for the first time," he said. "It's a great community service."

The event, to be held at Founders Center, 140 Oak St., offers free screenings and physician seminars, as well as opportunities for people to talk to doctors and service line staff, Shepherd said.

Workers with Franciscan St. James, Franciscan Physician Network and Specialty Physicians of Illinois will give free screenings for blood glucose and cholesterol, blood oxygen, blood pressure, osteoporosis and body mass index, event organizers said.

From 9 to 10:30 a.m., the fair will host a question-and-answer session with Franciscan St. James physicians, specialists and surgeons, they said.

There will also be a seminar on the Affordable Care Act enrollment period at 10 a.m. Free flu shots and 10-minute chair massages will be available, too, according to officials.

Typically the event attracts between 400 and 500 people, Shepherd said, though the total can be affected by the weather.

Families travel from all over the greater Chicagoland region to attend the event, he said.

Franciscan St. James president Arnie Kimmel lauded the festival in the press release.

"Our active participation in this valuable community event is entirely consistent with our mission to deliver quality healthcare to the communities we serve," he said.

The event is sponsored by the Village of Frankfort and the Frankfort Park District.
