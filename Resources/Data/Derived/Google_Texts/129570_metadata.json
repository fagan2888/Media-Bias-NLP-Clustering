Because the interplay between Ban the Box laws and long-term care background checks can be complex, health care providers should keep a close eye on their states\u2019 progress to ensure compliance once fully implemented.\n\nEstablished by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the background check program provides as much as $160 million in federal funds for states that voluntarily implement the program.\n\nHowever, the report found that out of the 25 participating states:\n\nOnly six states have submitted sufficient data in order to calculate percentage of prospective employees disqualified because of background checks.\n\nIn the six states that participated, 3 percent of prospective employees were disqualified from employment because of background checks.\n\nOf the remaining 19 states, 11 states had not yet submitted data reports. Eight of these states had gaps that prevented calculation of disqualification rates.\n\nThirteen states were still in the process of obtaining legislation to enable background checks.\n\nTen states did not yet have the ability to collect fingerprints.\n\nThe stringent requirements of the program may be a cause of the implementation delays. The program requires states to include three types of background checks in their processes:\n\nSearch of state-based abuse and neglect registries and databases Check of state criminal history records Fingerprint-based check of FBI criminal history records\n\nOIG recommended that CMS should continue working with states to fully implement these programs, and to improve the required reporting.\n\nAnother potential cause for delay is that the program may conflict with recent trends in state legislation that require employers to postpone background checks until later in the hiring process. These so-called \u201cban the box\u201d laws do not prohibit employers from utilizing background checks generally, but delay the time in which an employer is allowed to inquire into an applicant\u2019s background.\n\nRecently, several states have extended these requirements to private employers. In addition, while some jurisdictions exclude health care providers from complying with the laws, others make no such exception. States that have adopted Ban the Box Laws and have not yet submitted data reports or did not submit sufficient data include:\n\nCalifornia\n\nConnecticut\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgia\n\nHawaii\n\nIllinois\n\nMaryland\n\nMinnesota\n\nOhio\n\nOregon\n\nRhode Island\n\nTo avoid future compliance issues, health care providers, particularly those in the states listed above, should keep abreast of their states\u2019 progress in implementing these long-term care background checks programs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Office of Inspector General\u2019s recent report found significant delays in states\u2019 implementation of a background check program for long term care employees", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/most-states-delayed-implementing-long-term-care-background-check-program-oig-finds", "site_name": "The National Law Review", "type": "article", "description": "The Office of Inspector General&amp;rsquo;s (OIG&amp;rsquo;s) recent report found significant delays in states&amp;rsquo; implementation of a background check program for long-term care employees.
