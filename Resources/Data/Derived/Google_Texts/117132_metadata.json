Both attributed the losses to new costs of the federal health care law, also known as Obamacare, which requires health insurers with relatively healthy members to make payments to insurers who cover sicker members, in order to share the risks and costs of providing medical coverage to people who use a lot of services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarvard Pilgrim\u2019s $7.5 million loss reverses a surplus of $9.9 million the insurer reported in the same quarter last year. Fallon\u2019s $7.1 million loss comes after a $3.9 million loss in 2014.\n\n\u201cOur financial results reflect the challenging fiscal environment as we continue to adjust to changes in our industry related to implementation of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Charley Goheen, chief financial officer of Harvard Pilgrim, said in a statement.\n\nFederal law required insurers to make so-called \u201crisk adjustment\u201d payments for the first time in 2015. Several insurers collectively paid $61 million into the program, the bulk of which went to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the state\u2019s largest health insurer.\n\nBoston-based Blue Cross reported a $21.8 million operating surplus in the quarter, reversing a $4.3 million loss in the same period of 2014.\n\nTufts Health Plan of Watertown reported a $29.1 million surplus, down from a $34.2 million surplus last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlue Cross said the risk adjustment payments were expected and therefore did not contribute to its surplus. Both Blue Cross and Tufts attributed their earnings to better cost control.\n\nInsurers say they\u2019re still concerned about rising prices of medications but are taking steps to curb costs, such as by negotiating discounts with drug makers.\n\nBlue Cross has also reduced the size of its corporate offices to save money, chief financial officer Allen Maltz said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping a real tight rein on administrative costs and what it takes to run the business,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.1178558499", "eomportal-id": 625808, "description": "Insurers continue to contend with rising drug prices and new costs associated with the federal Affordable Care Act.", "eomportal-instanceid": 14, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Insurers continue to contend with rising drug prices and new costs associated with the federal Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Health insurers report mixed earnings results - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/11/13/healthplans/Mb4IO6SZxSovTR5asqy35K/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg-small-square.jpg", "longitude": "-71.38243740000001", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.4072107", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "health insurers,blue cross blue shield,harvard pilgrim health care,tufts health plan,fallon health,affordable care act,risk adjustment,obamacare", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 11:59:34 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "health insurers,blue cross blue shield,harvard pilgrim health care,tufts health plan,fallon health,affordable care act,risk adjustment,obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "c337c174-8a71-11e5-9556-fff4bd5cb241"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb285\"", "article_summary": "Fallon\u2019s $7.1 million loss comes after a $3.9 million loss in 2014.\nTufts Health Plan of Watertown reported a $29.1 million surplus, down from a $34.2 million surplus last year.\nThe state\u2019s biggest nonprofit health insurers reported mixed financial results Friday as they continue to contend with rising drug prices and new costs associated with the federal Affordable Care Act.\nHarvard Pilgrim Health Care of Wellesley and Fallon Health of Worcester each reported losses of more than $7 million for the three-month period ending Sept. 30.\nAdvertisementHarvard Pilgrim\u2019s $7.5 million loss reverses a surplus of $9.9 million the insurer reported in the same quarter last year."}
