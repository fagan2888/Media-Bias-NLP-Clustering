Think Glenn Beck will take criticism from Karl Rove lying down?

Think again.

Beck made waves through the media when he declared, “I’m out [of the Republican Party]” on Wednesday, prompting GOP strategist Rove to offer a dismissive farewell on Fox News Friday night.

Beck’s response came fast and furious on Facebook mere hours later, very early Saturday morning.

“You want to rumble [R]ove?” Beck asked in his scathing response. “Come on to my show and let’s have it out. Bring it on. I would love to take you on WITH YOUR RECORD AND THE RECORD OF THE GOP. I could do it with my eyes closed and in a coma.”

Beck hammered Rove for the GOP’s mixed record on immigration, healthcare and the NSA’s abuse of power, writing, “If you don’t think that the republicans are progressive light then you don’t know the History of the movement started by [T]eddy Roosevelt and the GOP.”

Beck also slammed Rove for the Republican Party’s failure to achieve meaningful conservative change when the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House were all in Republican hands in the mid-2000s.

“You guys have the spine of a worm, the ethics of whores and the integrity of pirates,” Beck wrote. “(My apologies to worms, whores and pirates.)”

But Beck also held out the hope that Rove and the GOP could change.

“It is never to late to change,” Beck wrote. “You just have to be willing to admit your mistakes and live by principles. I have done so. When will you?”
