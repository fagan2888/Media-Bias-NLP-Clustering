Me neither. But I did catch a scene of the FOX slasher-comedy and was surprised to see that my father, Justice Antonin Scalia, made a cameo appearance. Sort of.\n\nThe show, set on a college campus, is about a murder spree waged by mysterious figures dressed as devils, and features Jamie Lee Curtis evading death as she did in 1978\u2019s Halloween. The scene in question begins with Curtis re-enacting the famous shower scene from Psycho in which her mother, Janet Leigh, plays a character murdered by\u2014I\u2019d better not give anything away.\n\nBut Curtis avoids her mother\u2019s fate, emerges safely from the shower, and is fending off the devils when a surprise third assailant arrives, wearing a different disguise. Curtis asks, \u201cAre you supposed to be Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia?\u201d (Give her credit for pronouncing his name correctly.)\n\nThe masked man nods his head before attacking her. But, a skilled martial artist, she thwarts him and his devilish companions. She takes particular delight in knocking the Scalia-guised assailant to the ground, punching him like Ronda Rousey Holly Holm and talking to him like Linda Greenhouse. Between every punch to the face, she makes a claim that, presumably, is meant to rebut something Justice Scalia has said.\n\n\u201cThe homosexual lifestyle is not destructive to the fabric of American society!\u201d\n\nBam!\n\n\u201cThe Voting Rights Act should be authorized in every state!\u201d\n\nPow!\n\n\u201cAnd the Affordable Care Act does not require people to eat broccoli!\u201d\n\nBash!\n\nWhy, it\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s speaking to the real judge.\n\nI imagine that at both of the Scream Queen viewing parties around the country, people wondered who this guy was supposed to be. But the ideal Scream Queen viewer, the enlightened type the show\u2019s writers congratulate themselves for attracting, stood up and cheered Curtis on. She\u2019s not only a tough grrrrrrl, but she\u2019s also striking blows for truth, justice, and progressivism! (Though they were probably disappointed that Curtis didn\u2019t mention Citizens United. Oh well, gotta leave \u2019em wanting more.)\n\nYet the character\u2019s righteous indignation comes off as particularly strange given that she hasn\u2019t exactly been a beacon of morality. She has affairs with students; she decapitated her husband; and she framed her husband\u2019s mistress for the murder. But hey, at least she\u2019s not an originalist.\n\nAnother problem is that she\u2019s making rejoinders to claims that Justice Scalia never made. \u201cThe homosexual lifestyle is not destructive to the fabric of American society!\u201d is probably a reference to his dissent in this summer\u2019s Obergefell decision, which begins: \u201cI write separately to call attention to this Court\u2019s threat to American democracy.\u201d His point was that the Court threatened democracy by usurping the role of the legislature. But that\u2019s not as good a reason to punch him.\n\nAs for \u201cThe Voting Rights Act should be authorized in every state,\u201d I have good news: it is! Presumably, she\u2019s taking issue with the Court\u2019s decision in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), which invalidated an element of the Voting Rights Act that required nine entire states and certain counties in seven others to get federal approval before changing election laws. The ruling did not throw out the VRA in any state, and jurisdictions that violate voting rights are still subject to judicial oversight.\n\nFinally, Justice Scalia did not say Obamacare \u201crequire[s] people to eat broccoli.\u201d She\u2019s probably referring to his question during the oral arguments of HHS v. Florida: \u201cCould you define the market\u2014everybody has to buy food sooner or later, so you define the market as food, therefore, everybody is in the market; therefore, you can make people buy broccoli.\u201d Anyone reading above the second-grade level can recognize that he was alerting us to the slippery slope that the ACA was walking down. (What\u2019s more, he was picking up on an idea put forth by Judge Vinson in an earlier opinion that declared the ACA unconstitutional.)\n\nApart from these minor details, her tirade was completely accurate.\n\nAm I going overboard by nit-picking an obscure television show? Perhaps. Then again, Andrew Breitbart\u2019s oft-quoted remark that politics is downstream from culture applies here. Most people watching this scene will never read any of Justice Scalia\u2019s opinions or books, or encounter a news article that accurately represents his opinions or statements. If they hear his name, they won\u2019t say, \u201che\u2019s such an articulate textualist\u201d or \u201che\u2019s absolutely right about deep dish,\u201d or even ask \u201cdoesn\u2019t he have a son who watches too much bad television?\u201d Instead, they\u2019ll ask, \u201cdidn\u2019t he, like, say that, President Obama wants to, like, make us all eat our vegetables?\u201d\n\nIn other words, it matters that his ideas are so misrepresented because this could be the only representation that viewers see.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting there\u2019s precedent for this bizarre scene. In one of her books, at the start of a chapter called \u201cRevenge Fantasies,\u201d the actress Mindy Kaling jokes that to motivate herself during workouts, she imagines that her make-believe husband is murdered \u201cby a deranged man wearing an Antonin Scalia mask.\u201d She tracks the killer (whom she simply calls \u201cScalia,\u201d not \u201cMan in a Scalia Disguise\u201d) to Miami: \u201cI choke him to death with his own mask. When his body goes lifeless in my arms, I\u2019m tempted to pull off his mask to see who it was. But I stop just before I do it. I don\u2019t even care anymore.\u201d Not to mention, keeping the mask on lets her and the reader imagine that she really has murdered a conservative judge.\n\nI understand that I\u2019m less likely than most people to find these scenes hilarious. Nonetheless, I think it\u2019s fair to point out that these scenes raise the usual questions about media double standards. How would the left react if, say, a rodeo clown wore the mask of a Democrat president? It turns out that liberals own their fair share of the hatred and intolerance, incivility and rage that the right is supposed to monopolize.\n\nMore to the point, these scenes of semi-ironic violence are desperate and pathetic. They are juvenile revenge fantasies with Hollywood production values, in which the writers finally get to say everything they\u2019ve ever wanted to someone they despise, and kick his butt in the bargain (even if it turns out he never said what they think). They\u2019re so eager to vent their ire that they do so at the expense of character consistency, plot coherence, and accuracy.\n\nAnd in these moments, the violent anger of many on the left is unmasked.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "culture,Supreme Court,television,Christopher J.
