They charged it was a waste of taxpayer money and an abuse of power by legislative leaders.\n\nBut it turns out pork barrel spending is fine and not an inappropriate use of taxpayer money when Republicans do it.\n\nSaturday and Sunday stories in the News & Observer explain in great detail how legislative leaders steered money to their districts in the recently adopted budget.\n\nThe long list of discretionary spending ranges from state funding for a baseball tournament in Shelby in Cleveland County that House Speaker Tim Moore represents to museum funding in Onslow County, the home of Senate Majority Leader Harry Brown.\n\nThe testy responses to questions about the hypocrisy were the most telling. House budget chair Nelson Dollar defended giving certain towns state money for downtown revitalization without any process by saying it takes too long to have criteria.\n\nDollar said House leaders decided not to allocate the downtown money through a competitive grant process. \u201cThe advantage is that the money will get to those communities much faster,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the grant process takes a considerable amount of time.\u201d\n\nIn other words, legislators will decide who gets the money. It\u2019s probably just a coincidence that only one of the 13 towns receiving the funding is represented by a Democrat.\n\nMeanwhile the spokesperson for Speaker Moore has had it with questions about the baseball tournament and other pork barrel projects in the Speaker\u2019s district.\n\nMoore declined an interview request for this story. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what is new on this topic,\u201d spokeswoman Mollie Young said, referring to an earlier News & Observer story about Moore\u2019s earmarks in the original House budget. \u201cThe speaker will not be commenting on this again.\u201d\n\nIn other words, leave them alone. Sure they complained that pork barrel spending was wrong when they were in the minority. But that was then and this is now, or in other words, they were against pork barrel spending before they were for it.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Sure they complained that pork barrel spending was wrong when they were in the minority.\nBut it turns out pork barrel spending is fine and not an inappropriate use of taxpayer money when Republicans do it.\nBut that was then and this is now, or in other words, they were against pork barrel spending before they were for it.\nNot too many years ago Republicans railed against provisions in the state budget put together by the Democratic majority that benefited specific parts of state, calling them pork barrel spending.\nMeanwhile the spokesperson for Speaker Moore has had it with questions about the baseball tournament and other pork barrel projects in the Speaker\u2019s district."}
