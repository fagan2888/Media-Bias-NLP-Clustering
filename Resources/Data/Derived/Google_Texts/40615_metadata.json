Multiple European news outlets said that for months he had been battling illness.\n\nMichele Ferrero\n\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella called Ferrero \"entrepreneur bred\" and praised his \"innovative products\" and \"hard work.\"\n\n\"We are proud of you. Thank you Michele,\" the company, Ferrero, posted to its website.\n\nHe was \"the richest candyman on the planet,\" according to Forbes, which put his wealth at $23.4 billion.\n\nFerrero's father, Pietro, turned the family pastry shop into a production facility back in the 1940s. Because of World War II, chocolate was rationed, so he mixed in hazelnuts to produce more product. The spread now known as Nutella was once six times less expensive than chocolate, according to the company.\n\nThe company soon became known for its distinctive products, like the namesake confections wrapped in gold foil.\n\nIt now produces tons upon tons of Nutella -- every year, an amount that weighs as much as the Empire State Building.\n\nFerrero products came to the United States in 1969. The first arrival was the Tic Tac mint. The company also produces Kinder chocolates.\n\nThe company is family-owned and run by Ferrero's son Giovanni.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "michele ferrero, ferrero, ferrero rocher , nutella", "title": "Michele Ferrero: Billionaire Nutella founder dies at 89", "og": {"site_name": "CNNMoney", "description": "Michele Ferrero, the founder and patriarch of the Italian Nutella and Ferrero Rocher empire, died on Saturday, Valentine's Day.", "title": "Michele Ferrero: Billionaire Nutella founder dies at 89", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/15/news/nutella-ferrero/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150215164323-nutella-780x439.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "news", "author": "Gregory Wallace", "vr": {"category": "news", "type": "Article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-02-15T04:51:02", "keywords": "michele ferrero, ferrero, ferrero rocher , nutella", "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "date": "2015-02-15 04:51:02", "twitter": {"description": "Michele Ferrero, the founder and patriarch of the Italian Nutella and Ferrero Rocher empire, died on Saturday, Valentine's Day.", "title": "Michele Ferrero: Billionaire Nutella founder dies at 89", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/15/news/nutella-ferrero/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150215164323-nutella-540x304.jpg", "site": "@CNNMoney", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=1140", "description": "Michele Ferrero, the founder and patriarch of the Italian Nutella and Ferrero Rocher empire, died on Saturday, Valentine's Day."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1ca\"", "article_summary": "Michele Ferrero, the founder and patriarch of the Italian Nutella and Ferrero Rocher empire, died on Saturday, Valentine's Day.\nThank you Michele,\" the company, Ferrero, posted to its website.\nIt now produces tons upon tons of Nutella -- every year, an amount that weighs as much as the Empire State Building.\nFerrero products came to the United States in 1969.\nMichele FerreroItalian President Sergio Mattarella called Ferrero \"entrepreneur bred\" and praised his \"innovative products\" and \"hard work.\""}
