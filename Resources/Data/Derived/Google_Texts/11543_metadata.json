Paul LePage, lepage racism, maine governor, Paul LePage, racist governor, Media News, News, Politics News\n\nMaine Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s recent behavior fits a ritual that has become so familiar to Americans we can predict every beat: Public figure says something racist, people get outraged, public figure offers a semi-apology while denying, despite all evidence to the contrary, to have meant anything racist by the racist thing they said. (He\u2019s not the only politician who has gone through this cycle just this week.)\n\nBut while we knew the semi-apology/excuse was coming, it was exciting to wonder how he was going to wriggle out of saying that New York sends its heroin dealers to Maine where they \u201cimpregnate a young white girl before they leave.\u201d\n\nAs Salon\u2019s Michael Garofalo reports, LePage finally came back with, \u201cInstead of saying \u2018Maine women\u2019 I said \u2018white women\u2019 and I\u2019m not going to apologize to the Maine women for that,\u201d which he justified by claiming that 95% of Maine women are white. He also angrily noted that he did not indicate the race of said impregnators.\n\nOverall, a disappointing performance. Look, we all realize that, after a bone-headed comment like that, what you actually say to defend yourself isn\u2019t going to matter. His defenders, who almost surely are obsessed with the same racialized fantasies as LePage, will angrily deny that he\u2019s racist, even if he offered his excuses while wearing blackface. The rest of us will continue to believe that LePage is exactly the slimy racist he pretends not to be.\n\nUnder the circumstances, why not just get freaky with it? Be creative, have a little fun. We all know you\u2019re bullshitting, so make that bullshit count.\n\nWith that in mind, I came up with a few alternatives that would have accomplished the same goal \u2013 defensiveness from supporters, get-a-load-of-this-guy reactions from everyone else \u2014 but at least would have been more entertaining for everyone.\n\n1. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to imply that heroin dealers target white girls for impregnation. No, I was referring to the well-known scientific fact that only white women\u2019s eggs are capable of being fertilized by the sperm of drug dealers. True story. I learned it from my friend, Todd Akin, who said some doctor told him. What? It\u2019s not true. Well, at least you can\u2019t say it\u2019s racist, because I was saying it about white women.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
