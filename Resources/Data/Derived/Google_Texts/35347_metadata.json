I, for one, am tired of the Republican Party doing nothing about them. So, I\u2019m ready for a change.\n\n\n\nFor all of you self-styled \u201cconservatives\u201d out there. The ones screaming in petrified unison that Donald Trump is not a conservative. You know who you are. The ones who signed a pledge to support the nominee of the Republican Party and then broke that pledge. Before you go to war with Republican voters, get off your self-righteous horse and answer some simple questions.\n\n\n\nFirst, we are approaching $20 trillion in debt on our way to $30 trillion in a heartbeat. Soon we may not be able to service this debt, much less pay it off. You did nothing about this when you were in power, even when you held the power of the purse. In fact, you just upped the debt a trillion dollars in six months and funded all of Obama\u2019s programs. Don\u2019t lecture me about a conservative fiscal agenda and how you are the \u2018conservatives\u2019 in the room. You were an equal branch of government and did nothing. I sincerely doubt you will do anything about it in the future if given power. Don\u2019t lecture me about how your \u2018agenda\u2019 is more conservative than Trump\u2019s. You enabled this debt because you are bought and sold by special interests. You wanted to get reelected above all else so you could serve your globalist masters. You are not for the common man and the people know it. They have figured it out. Trump will deal with the debt.\n\n\n\nSecond, uncontrolled illegal immigration is killing America. It is hurting the American worker. It is killing our culture of the rule of law and bursting our entitlement budgets. Illegal immigrants are literally, routinely killing Americans. You didn\u2019t care. You still don\u2019t care. You enabled this great cancer eating at the American soul. You did nothing about this since the Clinton presidency. You did nothing because your masters wanted cheap labor. Admit it. You could have built a wall and you didn\u2019t. You could have stopped it and you didn\u2019t. And don\u2019t say I\u2019m a racist. Immigration is a wonderful thing\u2014IF done legally. Trump will deal with illegal immigration.\n\n\n\nThird, federal involvement in education is killing our culture and our children\u2019s future. The Left has absconded with our university system and is creating socialist zombies who can\u2019t survive in the real world and demand free stuff. The Left is winning the second act of the Cold War subtly through education and you\u2019ve done nothing about it. You enabled Common Core. In fact, the 3rd Bush was its standard bearer. You refused to do anything to do anything about shrinking the size of the federal education bureaucracy, even when you controlled the power of the purse or the executive branch. Trump will shrink the Department of Education and send education back to the local level.\n\n\n\nLastly, Obamacare. You allowed it to continue. You held the power of the purse and didn\u2019t stop it. Our healthcare system has been destroyed, while you were more worried about being reelected. Trump will install a market based, competitive healthcare system. You talk about limited government but the government keeps growing. You don\u2019t stop it when you have the power. So why are you calling yourself a conservative? You\u2019ve had your chance and you blew it.\n\nThese four issues alone are enough for anyone who loves this country to vote for Trump. All your think tanks, magazines, angry \u2018conservative\u2019 journalists, and highbrow talking points won\u2019t hide the fact that the Republican Party has been complicit as these cancers metastasize to stage four in America. All the other issues don\u2019t matter. Bathrooms, minimum wage, Planned Parenthood, et cetera won\u2019t put a sword through the heart of America in the next few years. These issues will.\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t vote in November, or vote for Hillary Clinton, or a third party, America as we know it will die. It\u2019s that simple.
