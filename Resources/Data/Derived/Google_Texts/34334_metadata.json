Plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose, Karr observed \u2013 the more things change, the more they stay the same. No other government program in recent memory has had more problems, fewer solutions, and the amplification of the issues that legislators intended to resolve than the Affordable Care Act and HHS\u2019 management of the system.\n\nTwo developments in recent days make that more apparent than ever. The first involves the troubled federal exchange system, and the continuing incompetence of HHS in providing effective management. The General Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a \u201csecret shopper\u201d study of Healthcare.gov. The agency enrolled 12 fake identities in health care plans through the exchange, either on line or by phone. Eleven of the fake identities qualified for subsidies, with the system unable to detect fictitious or fraudulent documentation submitted to HHS to substantiate eligibility for seven of the eleven.\n\nRelated: If Hillary\u2019s Elected President, Get Ready for Massive Obamacare Taxes\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it should. GAO actually started this test in early 2014 for the 2014 cycle. The agency reported the results to Congress almost exactly a year ago. The other part of the secret-shopper test could not be completed at that time, GAO reported, because when their investigators made six attempts at registering new fake enrollees, they could not get in-person assistance.\n\nCongress demanded answers at the time, and HHS pledged to do better. \"We are examining this report carefully and will work with GAO to identify additional strategies to strengthen our verification processes,\" administration spokesperson Aaron Albright told Fox News.\n\nNot only did HHS fail to make any progress, they didn\u2019t do anything to suss out any of the GAO\u2019s fraudulent accounts that had been opened a year earlier. The Obamacare system automatically renewed all eleven enrollments. The story gets even stranger at this point. Even though the GAO had done nothing with its phony enrollments, Healthcare.gov reported that six of the enrollees had submitted new applications, and canceled their insurance based on a lack of documentation. The GAO investigators supplied new documentation for all six accounts, succeeding in restoring five of them \u2013 and getting more subsidies than they previously received.\n\nRelated: Two New Studies Raise Red Flags on Obamacare\n\nFurthermore, HHS still does not require its contractors to detect fraud \u2013 a year after the GAO exposed the ease in which it takes place. \u201cWe found that the CMS document-processing contractor is not required to seek to detect fraud,\u201d the report states. The executives at contracting agencies told GAO that all they are required to do is \u201cdetermine if the document image is legible and appears unaltered by visually inspecting it.\u201d\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch pronounced himself \u201cappalled\u201d at the easy way the GAO defrauded HHS, in amounts of approximately $30,000 a year per account. \u201cBad actors can game the system,\u201d Hatch told ABC News. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of gross mismanagement.\u201d\n\nSo much for the expertise of government in creating and running an enrollment system. The Obama administration hasn\u2019t done any better in its other goal of driving the cost of care down for American families. Even Slate wondered last week just when the Democrats would start taking ownership of \u201cskyrocketing premiums\u201d in the third enrollment year of the Affordable Care Act. Oregon approved a 25 percent increase from its largest health insurer, and a 33 percent increase from the next largest. BlueCross BlueShield in Tennessee needs a 36 percent increase after getting a 19 percent increase the year before. In my state of Minnesota, BCBS wants to hike rates 54 percent, and 51.6 percent in New Mexico.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Could Face Large Numbers of Enrollees\n\nAt the same time, deductibles have also skyrocketed, leaving people with higher monthly payments and even less ability to access the insurance that those premiums provide. Slate\u2019s Helaine Olen heaps scorn on Obamacare opponents and fails to admit that their predictions of spiraling costs have come true, but she does admit that the system does not work at controlling costs \u2013 the most significant reason to have government overhaul the health-insurance system in the first place.\n\nWhat have we accomplished in the last five years since the passage of Obamacare? We still have roughly the same number of uninsured, estimated to be roughly 30 million people, although the rate of uninsured has dropped significantly. Costs for the insured are skyrocketing, however, and many of the newly insured will find that high deductibles mean they will still have to fund their routine care out of pocket. Provider networks have narrowed considerably, making access even more difficult than before. Emergency room visits for routine care have actually increased. The bureaucracy that runs all of this cannot fix its fraud problem, not even after having it specifically pointed out to them by the GAO and given a year to resolve.\n\nThose who pointed out all of the impossibilities of central planning and control over one-sixth of the nation\u2019s economy may not want to say I told you so. We will just stick with plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Perhaps the Obamacare system can best be summed up by this epigram from 19th", "title": "Obamacare: Still Failing and Picking Your Pocket", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/07/16/Obamacare-Still-Failing-and-Picking-Your-Pocket", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08172012_health_money_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/07/16/Obamacare-Still-Failing-and-Picking-Your-Pocket", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08172012_health_money_article.jpg", "creator": "@EdMorrissey", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Perhaps the Obamacare system can best be summed up by this epigram from 19th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda72a\"", "article_summary": "Perhaps the Obamacare system can best be summed up by this epigram from 19th-century French novelist Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr.\nThe Obamacare system automatically renewed all eleven enrollments.\nPlus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose, Karr observed \u2013 the more things change, the more they stay the same.\nRelated: If Hillary\u2019s Elected President, Get Ready for Massive Obamacare TaxesIf this sounds familiar, it should.\nThe other part of the secret-shopper test could not be completed at that time, GAO reported, because when their investigators made six attempts at registering new fake enrollees, they could not get in-person assistance."}
