The program allows participants to earn Associates in Science degrees and take a national certification exam to work as radiologic technologists who position patients and take X-rays.\n\nAdministrators noticed an upward shift in test scores after students began receiving email messages from \u201cJane Doe\u201d offering answers and warnings for students to keep quiet and \u201cslightly diminish\u201d scores, so as to not raise suspicion with perfect scores.\n\n\u201cYes, emails can be sent to a whole bunch of people, but it\u2019s what the recipient does that matters,\u201d Suwa said. \u201cThere is no way to absolutely prove whether they used it or not. I\u2019m not about to go headhunting or witch hunting. I\u2019m very reluctant to point fingers at anyone without proof.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Honolulu Star-Advertiser, http://www.staradvertiser.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kapiolani Community College has made changes to its radiologic technology program after officials discovered students were cheating on exams.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/21/cheating-uncovered-at-kapiolani-community-college/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Kapiolani Community College has made changes to its radiologic technology program after officials discovered students were cheating on exams.", "title": "Cheating uncovered at Kapiolani Community College"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kapiolani Community College has made changes to its radiologic technology program after officials discovered students were cheating on exams.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Cheating uncovered at Kapiolani Community College"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Education, Kimberly Suwa, Kapiolani Community College"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24ba\"", "article_summary": "HONOLULU (AP) - Kapiolani Community College has made changes to its radiologic technology program after officials discovered students were cheating on exams.\nThe school found any cheating would elevate other students\u2019 grades but not lower hers, because students are graded on a point system.\nThe newspaper said it learned of the cheating from a former student who filed an academic grievance in June, claiming her grade suffered because she opted not to cheat.\n\u201cYes, emails can be sent to a whole bunch of people, but it\u2019s what the recipient does that matters,\u201d Suwa said.\n\u201cThe committee finds that the evidence of cheating in the fall 2012 course appears pervasive and substantial,\u201d Academic Grievance Chairwoman Susan Jaworowski concluded in a memo dated Nov. 21."}
