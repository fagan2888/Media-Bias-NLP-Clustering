Thankfully, older Americans\u2014who have the biggest health expenses\u2014already benefit via Medicare. But what many people may not realize, until it\u2019s too late, is that Medicare doesn\u2019t pay for everything.\n\nA majority of Americans have no idea what their future medical expenses will cost (pdf), nor do they much consider how to pay for them by taking out extra insurance, paying out of pocket, or educating themselves about what Medicare will cover. Of course, it\u2019s hard to know how long you\u2019ll live or what illnesses you might face in old age. Insurance is supposed to address this uncertainty, but only if it is comprehensive.\n\nA study from the Employer Benefits Research Institute (EBRI) found that Medicare typically only covers 60% of the average retiree\u2019s health expenses. About 13% of healthcare expenses are paid out-of-pocket:\n\nThe expenses that aren\u2019t covered by Medicare or insurance policies include Medicare premiums, co-pays, supplemental health care premiums, extended hospital stays, and other costs that vary tremendously depending on when and how you die. The average person who retires at 65 and dies at 90 will need $68,000 if they are a man and $89,000 if they are a woman to cover these costs, according to the EBRI.\n\n(Greater costs fall on women because they tend to live longer. Old-age poverty is high among widows because many couples burn through their wealth when one partner\u2014often the husband\u2014gets ill and dies. The widow is then left behind with fewer assets and reduced Social Security, because she can no longer claim a couple\u2019s benefit.)\n\nBut the EBRI says that there\u2019s a 50% chance that even these large amounts won\u2019t be enough. If a couple wants to ensure that they can pay for all their health care needs, they\u2019ll need to set aside around $250,000. And that excludes the cost of long-term care in a nursing home, which can run to tens of thousands of dollars and is not covered by Medicare.\n\nMost households don\u2019t save that much. According the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent survey of consumer finances, the median financial assets of households led by 65- to 69-year-olds in America was just $64,000. Including less liquid assets, like housing, the average median net worth rises to around $260,000\u2014enough to cover expenses, just, assuming houses can be sold easily and not much is spent on anything else. Social Security benefits are worth another $300,000, but this isn\u2019t available to pay for large, unexpected health expenses.\n\nTaking out additional health insurance can reduce the bill. Many Americans used to get supplemental health insurance from their former employers, but hardly any do now unless they worked for the government. Another alternative is Medigap insurance, which pays for part of long hospital stays and some expenses that would otherwise come out of pocket. The Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, expands coverage somewhat, mainly to do with prescription drugs, but substantial costs still fall on individuals.\n\nIn short, as Baby Boomers enter retirement living longer and suffering from more expensive diseases than ever, many will discover that they don\u2019t have the money to pay for their care. Saving more and taking out extra insurance can help avoid this fate, but even then the amount it takes to cover for all post-retirement eventualities is beyond many people\u2019s capabilities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Universal health care promises to relieve Americans from the daunting medical costs that can drag\u00a0them into poverty.
