The investigation exposes Planned Parenthood\u2019s wide-spread propensity to give dangerous sex advice to young teenagers.\n\nIn the investigation, an actress posing as a 15-year-old tells various Planned Parenthood workers across the country that \u201cher boyfriend\u201d wants to \u201ctry new things\u201d sexually. In all three videos that have been released so far (there is more to come), Planned Parenthood sex counselors barely wait for the young girl to finish explaining her situation before excitedly jumping in with a slew of inappropriate \u2014 and sometimes illegal \u2014 advice.\n\nThe installment featured on The O\u2019Reilly Factor was filmed at a Planned Parenthood in Oregon, where the young girl relayed that her boyfriend wanted to try role-playing. The counselor quips that there are \u201ceducational pornos\u201d that they can watch to get ideas, and in segments that were not shown on last night\u2019s episode she continues Planned Parenthood\u2019s popular trend of promoting dangerous bondage sex practices to the young girl.\n\nThis sex trend, popularized to some degree by the explosive popularity of the book 50 Shades of Grey, includes sadomasochistic behavior that can be extremely dangerous (to the point of death) to the partner taking on the submissive \u201crole.\u201d\n\nLila stressed to O\u2019Reilly the fact that this behavior on Planned Parenthood\u2019s part is possible in large part due to the fact that the abortion business receives massive amounts of tax funding. Lila also explained that, in addition to this tax funding, Obamacare is lining Planned Parenthood\u2019s coffers via a $75 million allocation towards sex ed. However, thanks to the confusing nature of ObamaCare, it is unclear exactly how much of this amount is going directly to Planned Parenthood affiliates across the country.\n\nUnlike Planned Parenthood, Live Action doesn\u2019t get hundreds of millions of dollars in forced taxpayer funding to keep us going. We rely completely on the generosity of our donors.
