Between now and then, the FAA is planning to test the interaction between drones and other types of airplanes at six sites across the country.\n\nIn the meantime, the agency has shut down drone operations that were being conducted by groups as varied as an Internet beer company and the Washington Nationals Major League Baseball team.\n\nPolice and other law enforcement groups originally sought the technology. Privacy advocates have raised concerns about increased surveillance, however, and are warning the FAA to tread carefully.\n\nFAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the approval of AeroVironment was proof the agency was following Congress\u2019s directives on drone use.\n\n\u201cThe 2012 [FAA] Reauthorization law tasks us with integrating small UAS in the Arctic on a permanent basis,\u201d Huerta said in a statement. \u201cThis operation will help us accomplish the goal set for us by Congress.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "AeroVironment will use unmanned aircraft to survey oil pipelines for BP.", "description": "AeroVironment will use unmanned aircraft to survey oil pipelines for BP.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "AeroVironment will use unmanned aircraft to survey oil pipelines for BP.", "title": "Feds approve first commercial drone flight", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/208779-bp-contractor-granted-first-commercial-drone-flight", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/drone_020114getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-10T13:16:44-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-06-10T13:16-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/208779-bp-contractor-granted-first-commercial-drone-flight", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-10T10:17-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-10T10:17:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-10T13:16:44-04:00"}, "keywords": "Federal Aviation Administration, drones, Unmanned aerial vehicle, BP,Anthony Foxx, Michael Huerta,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/208779-bp-contractor-granted-first-commercial-drone-flight", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "AeroVironment will use unmanned aircraft to survey oil pipelines for BP.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds approve first commercial drone flight"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds approve first commercial drone flight"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeeb0\"", "article_summary": "The Federal Aviation Administration has granted a contractor for oil company BP the right to fly the first approved commercial drone flights in the United States.\nADVERTISEMENTTransportation Secretarysaid the flights to survey oil pipelines were an important part of the agency\u2019s testing of the impact of increased nonmilitary drone use.\nArlington, Va.-based drone manufacturer AeroVironment is planning to use the unmanned aircraft to survey BP oil pipelines in Alaska, the FAA said.\nFAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the approval of AeroVironment was proof the agency was following Congress\u2019s directives on drone use.\n\u201cThese surveys on Alaska\u2019s North Slope are another important step toward broader commercial use of unmanned aircraft,\u201d Foxx said in a statement."}
