Researchers looked at data from 45 different studies until they came to the conclusion that the key to keeping off weight, even for obese individuals, are programs with both a diet and exercise component.\n\n\u201cLong term weight loss through changes in eating and physical activity is possible, even in adults who have already acquired obesity related illness, and effective weight loss programs are now available,\u201d the study\u2019s researcher wrote in the study published in the British Medical Journal.\n\nThe 7,788 total participants in the studies lost five percent of their body weight with an average of 24 lbs. lost in weight. Researchers looked at their ability to keep the weight off and found that participants who were in a program with a combination of diet and exercise only, gained back 3.4 lbs. less than everyone else did after one year. Aside from the classic diet and exercise regimen, the studies also looked at participants who tried medication, lifestyle changes such as diet, physical activity, meal replacements alone and in combination of each other.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that they covered so many different studies but there\u2019s also so much variety and the long-term research isn\u2019t there, you know \u2014 going beyond 24 months,\u201d lead researcher Stephan Dombrowski of Newcastle University in the UK told Reuters Health.\n\nIn addition, researchers found that with the help of Orlistat, an obesity drug, participants regained 4 lbs. fewer than those who received a drug-free placebo. Currently, Orlistat is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved prescription drug to treat obesity. It works by reducing the amount of fat absorbed from certain foods. Although larger doses of Orlistat proved to show more weight loss success, it also accompanied more gastrointestinal side effects than did regular dosages.\n\n\u201cWeight management is hard,\u201d Dombrowski said. \u201cPeople have to realize that it\u2019s not just the losing it \u2014 it\u2019s for life, and if you don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing, if it doesn\u2019t work for you, you\u2019re not going to stick with it.\u201d\n\nIf those who are obese don\u2019t stick with their healthy lifestyle goals, then they will significantly increase the risk of coronary heart disease; type 2 diabetes; endometrial, breast, and colon cancer; hypertension, which is high blood pressure; dyslipidemia, or high cholesterol; liver and gallbladder disease; sleep apnea; osteoarthritis; and infertility, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Being overweight will increase many of these risks as well, which is why it\u2019s important to stop the bad health habits as early as possible and stay committed to programs that rely heavily on diet and exercise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to remember that weight management is a mind and a stomach game,\u201d Dombrowski said. \u201cYou have to feel good about what you\u2019re having.\u201d\n\nSource: Dombrowski SU, Knittle K, Sniehotta FF, et al.
