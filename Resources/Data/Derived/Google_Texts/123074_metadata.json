(Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)\n\nWith two months to go before the Feb. 2 Super Bowl, Fox had already sold out of all available ad slots for the game, the Wall Street Journal reported \u2014 but those who shelled out an average $4 million for 30 seconds of airtime might be fooling themselves.\n\nSome 80% of Super Bowl ads don't help sales at all, says a study reported by AdAge. Non-Super Bowl commercials, on the other hand, do better: Only 60% fail to increase sales.\n\nThe study by research firm Communicus was based on pre- and post-game interviews with 1,000 people who watched the 2012 and 2013 games. (What fared well in 2013: Budweiser's \"Brotherhood\" ad. What didn't: Tide's \"Miracle Stain\" ad.)\n\nSTORY: Italian cops decipher Mafia code on initiation rite\n\nSuper Bowl ads are, researchers note, better-remembered than your typical commercial: Some 44% recall having seen game ads versus 32% who recall regular ads.\n\nTrouble is, while viewers may remember the ad's storyline, only 35% tend to remember the brand involved.
