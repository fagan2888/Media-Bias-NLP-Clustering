Revered Tea Party leader, and failed governor and vice presidential candidate, Sarah Palin is sad today. You see, the announcement of a deal to reopen the federal government and avoid an imminent debt default means that Palin won’t get the impeachment of President Obama that she was salivating for just two days ago.

It hasn’t been a good week for Palin.

First she crashed this weekend’s Tea Party rally protesting the GOP shutdown of the federal government, even though Palin and the Tea Party, and her co-crasher Ted Cruz were all in favor of the shutdown.

Then some idiots with some confederate flags showed up to seal the deal as to how loony Palin’s protest really was.

Then the Tea Partyers start shouting racist slurs at the White House cops.

And now Palin’s secret plan to impeach the president has gone sadly awry.

Palin thought she had it all planned out. Here she was on Facebook, just two days ago, explaining how no matter President Obama did, she’d impeach him. Or at least she’d Facebook him:

PALIN: It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense, and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense.

Did you catch that?

If the Republicans force the country into default, Obama gets impeached. And if the President finds a way to avoid default, he’s impeached.

It’s like arguing with a bratty ten year old who thinks they’re the smartest kid in the world.
