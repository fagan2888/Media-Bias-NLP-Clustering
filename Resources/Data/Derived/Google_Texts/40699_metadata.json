Pretty much all of the money has come from organized labor. You\u2019ve got another group called Illinois Freedom PAC, which is really run by the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association,\u201d Maisch said. \u201c(We\u2019re) asking voters to consider the real agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Illinois Freedom PAC would not answer questions from Illinois Watchdog about the group\u2019s agenda. A spokesman said simply that he had \u201cno comment.\u201d\n\nBut the group\u2019s fundraising speaks volumes.\n\nThe Illinois Freedom PAC was created on Feb. 5, the same day the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees labor union gave the group $500,000.\n\nThe Illinois Freedom PAC has since raised almost $2 million, almost exclusively from labor unions including the Illinois Federation of Teachers and Service Employees International Union.\n\nMaisch said voters need to know why big labor wants to play favorites in the Illinois Republican primary.\n\n\u201cThey ought to be paying attention, not just to those ads, but to who is funding them and what their real agenda is,\u201d Maisch added.\n\nThe agenda seems to be to defeat Republican gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner.\n\nRauner is a multimillionaire first-time candidate who has a commanding lead in the gubernatorial polls. He says he promises to fight the labor unions that he says control too much of state government.\n\n\u201cThey know he is the only candidate in this race who will truly shake up the status quo as governor and deliver lower taxes and spending, better schools and term limits. That frightens them,\u201d Rauner\u2019s campaign spokesman, Mike Schrimpf, said.\n\nMaisch said this is the first time Illinois has seen a flood of outside money pour into the Republican primary.\n\n\u201cWe thought it was unacceptable for the employer community to be silent with such a big political action undertaken for the first time,\u201d Maisch said.\n\nBut the March primary will likely not the end of the union spending.\n\nIllinois\u2019 Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn has been propped-up by big labor campaign contributions, receiving more than $1.8 million from unions last year alone.\n\nRauner leads Quinn in the latest polls. A CapitolFax/We Ask America telephone poll of 1,354 likely general election voters gives Rauner a 47 percent to 39 percent lead over the governor. The poll was conducted Jan. 30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percent.\n\nRauner faces candidates state Sen. Bill Brady, state Sen. Kirk Dillard and state Treasurer Dan Rutherford in the March 18 Republican primary.\n\nContact Benjamin Yount at Ben@IllinoisWatchdog.org and find him on Twitter @BenYount.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Labor unions are flooding the GOP primary with outside money to defeat Bruce Rauner", "title": "Unions are flooding IL's GOP primary with money to defeat Bruce Rauner", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/02/Illinois-Chamber-of-Commerce-Logo.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-21T10:08:43+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/129611/union-money-has-business-leaders-telling-il-gop-voters-to-know-the-messenger/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Illinois", "tag": "attack ads,Bruce Rauner,Illinois Chamber of Commerce,Illinois Freedom PAC,illinois primary,Todd Maisch,union front groups,union money", "published_time": "2014-02-21T10:00:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-21T10:08:43+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Labor unions are flooding the GOP primary with outside money to defeat Bruce Rauner", "title": "Unions are flooding IL's GOP primary with money to defeat Bruce Rauner", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/02/curtain.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Labor unions are flooding the GOP primary with outside money to defeat Bruce Rauner"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc787\"", "article_summary": "You\u2019ve got another group called Illinois Freedom PAC, which is really run by the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association,\u201d Maisch said.\n\u201c(We\u2019re) asking voters to consider the real agenda.\u201dThe Illinois Freedom PAC would not answer questions from Illinois Watchdog about the group\u2019s agenda.\nThe Illinois Freedom PAC has since raised almost $2 million, almost exclusively from labor unions including the Illinois Federation of Teachers and Service Employees International Union.\nHe says he promises to fight the labor unions that he says control too much of state government.\nMaisch said voters need to know why big labor wants to play favorites in the Illinois Republican primary."}
