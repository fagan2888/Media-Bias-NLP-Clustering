USA Today\n\nA little girl from Jacksonville, Fla., can teach us a thing or two about beauty. Eleven-year-old Juliana Wetmore goes to school, talks, and plays with her classmates, beating all odds after being born with Treacher Collins syndrome, or without a face. It was after a complicated pregnancy, Juliana\u2019s parents, Tom and Tami Wetmore, discovered they gave birth to a girl who was missing 40 percent of the bones in her face. Despite critics on social media that suggested euthanizing Juliana, the Wetmores are rejoicing today, as Juliana can now talk and communicate in sign language after 45 surgeries in 11 years.\n\n\"Where is she? Where's her face?\" Tami remembers asking, First Coast News (FCN) reported. Since she had a complicated pregnancy, she had not seen Juliana until her husband took a photograph and braced his wife for what she was about to see. Treacher Collins patients suffer from facial development that is believed to be caused by a change in the gene on chromosome 5. The rare genetic disorder is characterized by abnormalities in the development of the head and face, and the underdevelopment of the cheek bones and similar structures, including the jawbone, according to the Genetics Home Reference.\n\nThe Wetmores' decision to keep Juliana brought different reactions, especially on social media: \"Damn thing should have been euthanized,\u201d read one of the comments, FCN reported. The Wetmores, doctors, and others remained horrified by this reaction, but used it as motivation to continue to give Juliana a normal and healthy life.\n\nHer parents support her entirely and believe Juliana is \u201cshowing the world\u201d beauty is only skin deep. Parents from all walks of life have even used the 11-year-old\u2019s story to teach their own children that true beauty is not defined by what\u2019s on the outside. \"This story is much bigger than us or Juliana,\" Thom said, the NY Daily News reported. \"God never gives you more than you can handle.\"\n\nJuliana is not alone in her day-to-day struggles. Alongside the help she gets from her parents and her older sister Kendra, the adolescent receives the support from her Ukrainian adopted sister Danica, who also suffers from the same condition. In 2010, the Wetmores did a Google search on \"Treacher Collins adoption,\u201d where they found a photo of Danica in an orphanage in Ukraine, USA Today reported. Her medical condition is not as severe as Juliana\u2019s.\n\nThe girls have been inseparable since they\u2019ve met. They speak sign language to each other and swing together on the playground at school. The Wetmores believe Juliana and Danica will always be able to understand the struggles they face when other people cannot relate.\n\nJuliana still has some hurdles to overcome as she still relies on a tracheotomy tube to eat, primarily receiving liquid nutrition. Currently, she can swallow and digest foods such as Italian Ice. Her parents hope she will be able to eat on her own one day.\n\nThe 11-year-old still has a pending surgery this summer to define her cheek bones. Although her surgeries haven\u2019t given her a \u201ctypical\u201d looking face, Juliana has expressed to her parents she is satisfied now with how she looks. The Wetmores say they don\u2019t want to pressure her into any more surgeries.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "juliana wetmore, girl born without a face, treacher collins, chromosome 5, gene mutation, rare genetic disorder, sign language, tracheotomy tube", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Juliana Wetmore, known as the \"girl born without a face\" around the world, continues to thrive in childhood, talking and playing after 45 surgeries in 11 years.", "title": "Girl Born Without A Face Finally Talks, 11 Years And 45 Surgeries Later [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/girl-born-without-face-redefines-beauty-juliana-wetmore-treacher-collins-sufferer-can-finally-talk", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/juliana-wetmore-school.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Juliana Wetmore, known as the \"girl born without a face\" around the world, continues to thrive in childhood, talking and playing after 45 surgeries in 11 years.", "title": "Girl Born Without A Face Finally Talks, 11 Years And 45 Surgeries Later [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/girl-born-without-face-redefines-beauty-juliana-wetmore-treacher-collins-sufferer-can-finally-talk", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/juliana-wetmore-school.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/juliana-wetmore-school.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-05-27T13:50:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T13:50:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Juliana Wetmore, known as the \"girl born without a face\" around the world, continues to thrive in childhood, talking and playing after 45 surgeries in 11 years."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9b2\"", "article_summary": "Eleven-year-old Juliana Wetmore goes to school, talks, and plays with her classmates, beating all odds after being born with Treacher Collins syndrome, or without a face.\nJuliana Wetmore, known as the \"girl born without a face\" around the world, continues to thrive in childhood, talking and playing after 45 surgeries in 11 years.\nDespite critics on social media that suggested euthanizing Juliana, the Wetmores are rejoicing today, as Juliana can now talk and communicate in sign language after 45 surgeries in 11 years.\nAlthough her surgeries haven\u2019t given her a \u201ctypical\u201d looking face, Juliana has expressed to her parents she is satisfied now with how she looks.\nThe Wetmores believe Juliana and Danica will always be able to understand the struggles they face when other people cannot relate."}
