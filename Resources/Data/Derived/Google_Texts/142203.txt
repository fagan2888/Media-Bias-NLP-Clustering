Over the last two weeks, Reason ran its annual webathon, in which we ask readers of this website to make tax-deductible donations to the 501(c)3 nonprofit that publishes Reason magazine, Reason.com, and Reason TV.

We started out by asking for $100,000 over an eight-day period but after a tremendously generous gift of $50,000 from a single donor, we upped the total to $150,000. I'm happy to report that 650 of you ginned up $165,000 in support.

From all of us at Reason, thank you. Your support is essential to our efforts to produce cutting-edge journalism that makes the case for "Free Minds and Free Markets" in politics, culture, and ideas. Without it, we wouldn't be able to publish 11 issues of Reason a year, post thousands of articles and blog entries at Reason.com, or produce hundreds of videos at Reason TV.

So thank you, thank you, thank you.

Here's a little Remy, to keep the mood upbeat:
