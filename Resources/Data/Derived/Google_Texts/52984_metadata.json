She says she qualified for free coverage because she\u2019s pregnant. Her husband still doesn\u2019t know if he has temporary coverage and hasn\u2019t been told if he qualifies for a ConnectorCare plan. That\u2019s frustrating, says Jessica, \u201cbut we do not need to spend time fighting that battle. Our priority was to make sure I could see a doctor as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nJessica Stanford of Sharon, Mass., is 40 and newly pregnant. She\u2019d really like to see a doctor soon because she\u2019s had several miscarriages and developed gestational diabetes during her last pregnancy. But she doesn\u2019t have health insurance and is worried about racking up medical bills.\n\nStanford applied for subsidized coverage in early December. She keeps calling the Connector to find out about her enrollment status. One customer rep told Stanford she could take her application number to a doctor\u2019s office for proof that the state will cover her, at least temporarily, but Stanford wants something more certain.\n\nThe Connector says it has extended coverage, through March, to 254,000 residents who applied for free or subsidized insurance and all residents who have had government backed coverage.\n\nThe agency is sending out letters explaining a temporary coverage plan that begins today (Jan. 1) for 22,371 residents who, like Stanford, are applying for the first time.\n\nBut Stanford doesn\u2019t have her letter. The Connector is trying to expedite Stanford\u2019s case. If anyone else doesn\u2019t have a letter, let us know in the comments below and we\u2019ll forward your name. It might help.\n\nBut it\u2019s pretty obvious the application process is still a mess. Only 497 of the almost 50,000 applicants who filed online have a new ConnectorCare plan. The agency can\u2019t say how long it will take to finish processing the other 45,000 applications or bring 89,000 residents who have subsidized coverage, but haven\u2019t even started to re-enroll, into the new, post Obamacare plans.\n\nThe Connector issued this statement, along with the charts above, yesterday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As delays in obtaining new health insurance through the Massachusetts Health Connector continue, one newly pregnant woman exemplifies the problem.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "As delays in obtaining new health insurance through the Massachusetts Health Connector continue, one newly pregnant woman exemplifies the problem.", "title": "Come On, Massachusetts, Get This Pregnant Woman Covered", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/01/massachusetts-connector-mess", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/12/Picture-6-620x442.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/01/massachusetts-connector-mess", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/12/Picture-6-620x442.png", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Come On, Massachusetts, Get This Pregnant Woman Covered"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-01", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Wed, 01 Jan 2014 10:56:09 -0500"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9f5\"", "article_summary": "Come On, Massachusetts, Get This Pregnant Woman CoveredUPDATE 1/9:Jessica Stanford is now on MassHealth and has her first prenatal visit next week.\nHer husband still doesn\u2019t know if he has temporary coverage and hasn\u2019t been told if he qualifies for a ConnectorCare plan.\nBut Stanford doesn\u2019t have her letter.\nStanford applied for subsidized coverage in early December.\nOne customer rep told Stanford she could take her application number to a doctor\u2019s office for proof that the state will cover her, at least temporarily, but Stanford wants something more certain."}
