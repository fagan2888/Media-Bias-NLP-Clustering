The National Republican Senatorial Committee released \"Giopi: Mission Majority\" this week to wide coverage across the web. But is it any good?\n\nI beat it in one sitting, in about fifteen minutes, and I can tell you: it's a mild disappointment. You play as Giopi the elephant, whose job is to collect keys and turn light switches in order to win back the Senate for the Republicans. Trying to stop you are two kinds of enemies: \"taxers,\" which walk back and forth and injure Giopi on contact; and \"mudslingers,\" large blue-grey blobs. Both can be defeated by jumping on their heads. When you jump on them, they let out little soundbites, like \"phoney scandals\" or \"what difference, at this point, does it make?\"\n\n\n\nAlso, 8-bit Joe Biden shows up\n\nWhich brings us to the most problematic part of the game: the controls. Admittedly, I was playing on my work PC, not a high-end gaming machine, so lag might have been a problem, but Giopi controls pretty poorly. You have to get used to a microsecond lag between when you tell Giopi to jump and when he actually does. Additionally, the hit-boxes on both the Taxer and Mudslinger are oddly wide; this caused poor Giopi much more injury in my playthrough than he deserved.\n\n\n\nThe little papers are \"Taxers\", and the grayish blob at the bottom is a \"Mudslinger\"\n\nThe stages themselves are pretty indistinguishable. There isn't even a color swap to tell them apart. In the first level, Giopi collects keys and stomps on Taxers. In the second and third levels, he collects keys and stomps on both Taxers and Mudslingers. In the fourth stage, he flicks light switches.\n\nI'll say this: the game is slightly more competent and entertaining than I was expecting. That might be a low bar, though. As Asawin Suebsaeng wrote at the Daily Beast, partisan flash games have a checkered history:\n\nIn 2008, John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign launched a Facebook game called Pork Invaders, which spoofed the arcade staple Space Invaders with a pork barrel-spending theme. In 2004, the Republican National Committee launched John Kerry: Tax Invaders and Kerry vs. Kerry, the latter a nod to the Democratic candidate\u2019s reputation for flip-flopping on key political issues.\n\nBut look, the point of Giopi is not to make a good game. It's to get your email address or social media information (one of those must be given as a condition for playing the game) so that the NRSC can market and solicit donations from you.\n\nStill, the game is a mild disappointment. It's a shame, because Giopi is an adorable little mascot. There's a lot of character stuffed into those little pixels! His tanktop is awesome!\n\n.\n\nOh, and you can merchandise featuring the little guy as well\n\nI'm not asking for the Emogame, perhaps the greatest flash game of all time. But even just tightening the screws and a little paint job in a few different places could have turned Giopi: Mission Majority into a hit. Especially with that little mascot.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National Republican Senatorial Committee <a href=\"http://www.missionmajority.com/\" target=\"_blank\">released \"Giopi: Mission Majority\" this week to wide coverage across the web</a>.
