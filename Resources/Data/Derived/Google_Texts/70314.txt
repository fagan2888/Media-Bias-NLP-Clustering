Wintry weather caused Mount Washington Auto Road to restrict access to private vehicles on Saturday



— The Mount Washington Observatory on Saturday received its first snow of autumn 2015.



Between 1 and 6 a.m. yesterday, .5 inches of snow fell on the Rock Pile, according to Kaitlyn O'Brien, who is a meteorologist and the co-director of summit operations for the observatory.

Located at the 6,288-foot peak of the tallest mountain in the Northeast, the observatory in that same period also recorded a wind gust of 99 mph.



Although its guided tours were unaffected, the wintry weather caused the Mount Washington Auto Road to restrict access to private vehicles, said General Manager Howie Wemyss, who noted that they were allowed to travel only a little more than half of the road's eight-mile length.

..

“We are battling winter at the summit,” said Wemyss, “but we think we'll come out of it tomorrow (Sunday) and be fully open again.”



“Home of the world's worst weather,” Saturday's conditions were not unique on Mount Washington, said Wemyss.

..

“This is very routine for this time of year,” he said.



O'Brien, too, said getting snow at the observatory is a regular occurrence.



Over its 83-year history, the observatory has received snow every month of the year, she said, albeit not for 12 months consecutively.

..

On average, the observatory gets 2.2 inches of snow in September – although it recorded none this year – and an average of 17.6 inches in October.



“This is just the start. It's certainly late but not terribly under” seasonal norms, O'Brien said of Saturday's snow.

..

“We have a lot of rime ice as well covering all of the buildings and structure as well,” she said, adding that the fog covered the observatory until about 9 a.m. Saturday.



When the fog lifted, “we had pretty much a wintry scene with 130-mile visibility,” said O'Brien, along with a stunning visual juxtaposition of the white snow and rime ice with the fall foliage below.
