In an effort to reach resolution for our patients, we made offers to reduce costs over time as part of a new agreement that would incorporate other affiliated hospitals but United refused.\u201d\n\nLynch did not address United\u2019s claim that Harton\u2019s rates were substantially higher than the state average.\n\nThe day before the contracts were set to expire, Tony Stubbs of Knoxville-based Trinity Benefit Advisors explained the situation to a local employer that provides United Healthcare coverage to its employees.\n\n\u201cThey (United) have reached an impasse with Tennova Health System and basically, at this point, neither side is willing to give what the other side wants.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, contract disagreements between insurance carriers and health care providers tend to resolve themselves as deadlines come and go, when providers face an undesirable loss of patient volume as insured patients seek alternate care providers.\n\nIn the Knoxville area, where United Healthcare represents almost half of the insurance market and patients have a choice of providers, the loss of United customers would have been a substantial blow to Tennova.\n\n\u201cTypically they work it out and we think that\u2019s going to happen here,\u201d Stubbs said. \u201cWe think that this will remedy itself, it\u2019s just a matter of when.\u201d\n\nThough it seemed that Harton would be a part of any eleventh-hour agreement between United and Tennova, Stubbs acknowledged that might not be the case. The stakes here, where Harton serves four counties without a comprehensive care competitor, weren\u2019t as high as they were in Knoxville.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen them exclude a hospital,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve also never seen a hospital so out of skew with the rest of their peers.\u201d\n\nAs predicted, United and the six East Tennessee hospitals did reach an eleventh hour agreement, ensuring that Knoxville-area customers would see no interruption of service. But the deal did not include Harton.\n\nAs the March deadline passed, the United contract with Harton expired.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, United customers are still entitled to emergency and non-elective services at the Tullahoma hospital without higher out-of-network costs, but in-network services are required for all elective, non-emergency services.\n\nAccording to United, the nearest alternate in-network facilities are United Regional Medical Center in Manchester and Southern Tennessee Regional Health System in Winchester.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work toward resolution with United,\u201d said Lynch. \u201cTennova Healthcare \u2013 Harton is committed to providing services for the Tullahoma community and has contracts with most other major health plans in our area. We will work with patients who have United on a case-by-case basis to see what options are available to them.\n\n\u201cPatients with United can continue to access emergency care here and United is obligated to process their claims. Certain patients receiving ongoing treatment for special conditions or pregnant women may be eligible for Continuation of Care benefits. We encourage patients with questions to contact Teresa Ervin, Revenue Cycle Director, at 931-393-7991 or Teresa.ervin@tennova.com.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s exclusion of Tennova Healthcare \u2013 Harton from its network does not affect Tennova-affiliated independent physicians and no other insurers are involved in the dispute.\n\nHarton continues to provide in-network care for patients covered by most other major health plans in the area, including BlueCross BlueShield, Cigna, Aetna and Humana.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "DSuZnC9hJQAMvp9aACU2GR1smwoMgHv-RH5LWmQ0SkM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.2"}, "article_summary": "Six of the contracts set to expire March 1 were between the insurer and Knoxville-area Tennova hospitals; the seventh was with Tennova Healthcare \u2013 Harton, formerly Harton Regional Medical Center.\n\u201cTennova Healthcare \u2013 Harton is committed to providing services for the Tullahoma community and has contracts with most other major health plans in our area.\nSTAFF WRITERkelly lapczynskiInsurance company United Healthcare reached an agreement last week that allows its customers to continue using Tennova Healthcare hospitals for their medical needs \u2014 unless they are in Tullahoma.\nThe day before the contracts were set to expire, Tony Stubbs of Knoxville-based Trinity Benefit Advisors explained the situation to a local employer that provides United Healthcare coverage to its employees.\n\u201cPatients with United can continue to access emergency care here and United is obligated to process their claims."}
