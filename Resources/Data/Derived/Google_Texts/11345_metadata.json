It\u2019s not one of different vision \u2026 It\u2019s a disagreement over tactics, from time to time,\u201d said Speaker of the House John Boehner, on 60 Minutes Sunday night.\n\nMore than a year ago, Speaker Boehner took serious offense when conservative groups criticized a budget deal he favored. They had \u201clost all credibility\u2026 I don\u2019t care what they do.\u201d So irrelevant is the Tea Party movement that the Speaker took to 60 Minutes to complain about its criticism of him Sunday night.\n\nThe Speaker trivializes the differences that led to the biggest intraparty rebellion against a sitting Speaker since the Civil War. His first problem isn\u2019t with outside groups, it\u2019s his own GOP colleagues in the House. When one out of every ten takes the extraordinary step of standing before his colleagues and calling out the name of someone else for his job, he should realize he\u2019s got a problem.\n\nAs for us, our opposition to his leadership centers on our belief that we do NOT, in fact, share visions and strategies.\n\nFor example, we oppose amnesty for illegal immigrants because we believe it would not be fair to the millions waiting in line to get into America legally, nor to the millions who already arrived legally after waiting in line. Amnesty rewards lawbreaking, and only serves to incentivize further lawbreaking.\n\nThe Speaker, on the other hand, dances to the tune of the Chamber of Commerce, whose members and supporters want cheaper labor, and are, consequently, major proponents of the kind of comprehensive amnesty legislation that passed the Senate in 2013 and which the Speaker clearly wanted to put on the floor of the House last year before Dave Brat\u2019s stunning upset of the former Majority Leader put the kibosh on those plans.\n\nMoreover, we seek a federal government that is actually smaller than the one we have now, not merely one that is smaller than the one Barack Obama would prefer. We note with disdain the Speaker\u2019s willingness to sign off on budget and debt ceiling increase \u201cdeals\u201d that appear to have been negotiated by Popeye\u2019s J. Wellington Wimpy \u2014 he will gladly give the president a spending/debt ceiling increase now, in exchange for the promise of spending cuts to come Tuesday. And when Tuesday arrives, somehow the spending cuts never materialize.\n\nSimilarly, we seek the repeal of Obamacare because we believe it tramples the fundamental liberties guaranteed us by our Constitution, destroys patient choice, degrades the quality of health care delivered, increases costs, and will ultimately break the bank. The Speaker, on the other hand, seems perfectly content to tinker at the margins (1099 repeal? Medical device tax repeal?) secure in the knowledge that many of his major funders \u2014 the health insurance and pharmaceutical companies who support Obamacare because of its mandates, which lead to a massively growing client base, and, hence, increased profits \u2014 don\u2019t actually want him to fight to repeal the legislation.\n\nHere\u2019s a test of the Speaker\u2019s assertion that our differences are merely differences in degree, not kind: Why has he refused to lead his GOP Conference to vote in favor of the bill introduced by his colleague Ron DeSantis of Florida, which seeks to overturn the August 2013 OPM ruling granting generous employer subsidies to Members of Congress and their staffs for the purchase of health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges, in clear violation of the law? That legislation is a fundamental part of a strategy designed to raise the temperature inside the offices of the Democrat Members of Congress whose votes are needed to build the necessary majorities for repeal in both House and Senate; yet, given multiple opportunities to put the bill on the floor, he has refused to do so.\n\nFinally, I would note one other difference with the Speaker\u2019s view, specifically regarding his assertion that the Tea Party\u2019s opposition is manufactured for fundraising purposes: Every dollar we raise is contributed voluntarily, by donors whose only interest is seeking to influence their government to tax less, spend less, and stop running up a massive debt. They seek little from the government other than to be left alone, and we have nothing to offer them other than our promise that we will use the resources they contribute to do the best job we can to achieve our shared vision of greater personal freedom, economic freedom, and a debt-free future.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jenny Beth Martin", "description": "Speaker Boehner goes after the Tea Party on '60 Minutes'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "\"The issue with the Tea Party isn't one of strategy.
