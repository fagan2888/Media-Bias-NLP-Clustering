While many long time conservatives hold the same kind of icky aversion to the thought of two men or two women joining nuptials, the Reason-Rupe poll in June 2014 found that 53 percent of millennials would get behind a candidate who is both socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\n\n\"I think it's really unfair to preach a free market and to preach liberty yet at the same time be advocating for laws that tell you who you can and cannot be with in your own bedroom,\" said one young CPAC attendee.\n\nThat push towards individual freedom also extends to legalizing recreational marijuana. CPAC even hosted a debate this year between former Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson and New York Republican Rep.
