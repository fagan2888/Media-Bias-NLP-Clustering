Chris Christie was wrong when he claimed in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference that no \u201cpro-life Democrat\u201d has ever been allowed to speak at a Democratic National Convention.\n\nIn an attempt to turn the tables on those who call the Republican Party intolerant, Christie relayed an exchange he had with a reporter (at the 1:01:57 mark).\n\nChristie, March 6: And this is what I mean about the media. I got asked a question last year: \u201cGovernor, you\u2019re very popular in a blue state. How can you export that to the rest of the country given the intolerance on social issues in your party?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, let me ask you a question. You say the Republicans are intolerant. Well, I\u2019ll just tell you this, at our national convention, we\u2019ve had people like Tom Ridge and Colin Powell and Condi Rice speak at our national conventions, even though our party platform, and I, don\u2019t agree with their position on abortion. Tell me, sir, the last pro-life Democrat who was allowed to speak at a Democratic convention?\u201d And I said, \u201cBy the way, don\u2019t strain yourself, because there\u2019s never been one.\u201d They\u2019re the party of intolerance, not us.\n\nChristie\u2019s claim about anti-abortion Democrats is false. Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr. \u2014 who began an op-ed last year, \u201cI am a pro-life senator\u201d \u2014 delivered a prime time address during the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\n\nIn fact, he said this:\n\nCasey, Aug. 26, 2008: Barack Obama and I have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion. But the fact that I\u2019m speaking here tonight is testament to Barack\u2019s ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him.\n\nAnother featured speaker at the 2008 Democratic National Convention was Sen. Joe Manchin, then governor of West Virginia and chair of the Democratic Governors Association. In 2011, Manchin said from the floor of the Senate, \u201cI am pro-life, and proud of it,\u201d though he did not raise the issue in his speech at the convention. Also in 2008, former Indiana U.S. Rep. Timothy Roemer, a Catholic Democrat who is against abortion, was among those who participated in a panel at the Democratic convention that sought to find \u201ccommon ground on abortion.\u201d\n\nAnd an Interfaith Gathering was held on the opening day of that convention, during which Bishop Charles Blake made the following anti-abortion appeal:\n\nBlake, Aug. 24, 2008: Our children have sacred value, and every child is equally valuable. May I observe, as a pro-life Democrat, that some of us have philosophic, humanitarian and theological differences with those who put forth abortion as an appropriate, routine and acceptable birth control procedure. There are millions of us who would hold that such a position conflicts with our conviction regarding our sacred responsibility to our youth and to human life itself. Surely we cannot be pleased with the routine administration of millions of surgically terminated pregnancies. Something within all of us must be calling for a better way. If we do not resist at this point, at what point will we resist? We know that our party will understand and acknowledge the moral and spiritual pain that so many feel because of this disregard for the lives of the unborn. Those of us who support the Democratic Party, despite our disagreement on this issue, do so because the Democratic Party articulate and pursues more of the positions that are relevant to the lives and circumstances of our people, the people of America in general, and the people of the world. \u2026\n\nAlthough no elected anti-abortion Democrat delivered an address at the most recent Democratic National Convention in 2012, one of the convention speakers was Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of the Roman Catholic social justice organization NETWORK. And she expressed her \u201cpro-life\u201d position.\n\nCampbell, Sept. 5, 2012: The Affordable Care Act will cover people like Margaret. We all share responsibility to ensure that this vital health care reform law is properly implemented and that all governors expand Medicaid coverage so no more Margarets die from lack of care. This is part of my pro-life stance and the right thing to do.\n\nKristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life of America, told us that while the Democratic conventions have become less welcoming to those who oppose abortion rights, it\u2019s simply not true that anti-abortion Democrats have not been allowed to speak at conventions. Christie\u2019s error, she said, is likely linked to the controversy surrounding anti-abortion Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey Sr. (father of Sen. Bob Casey Jr.) being denied a speaking spot at the 1992 Democratic National Convention.\n\nCasey Sr. alleged in the Wall Street Journal that \u201cthe party denied me \u2026 the right to speak because I am pro-life and planned to say so from the podium.\u201d That account was disputed by some in the party who claimed Casey was denied a speaking slot for the sole reason that he did not endorse the Clinton-Gore ticket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not factual!\u201d Clinton campaign manager James Carville told the New Republic of Casey\u2019s claim. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be idiotic to give a speaking role to a person who hadn\u2019t even endorsed you.\u201d The 1996 New Republic article noted that \u201ca slew of pro-life Democrats, including Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, Sens. John Breaux and Howell Heflin, and five governors, did address the delegates in 1992.\u201d The article noted that those speakers \u201cdidn\u2019t dwell on abortion.\u201d\n\nWe note that none of the three speakers at Republican conventions who were mentioned by Christie \u2014 Tom Ridge in 2000 and 2008, Colin Powell in 1996 and 2000, and Condoleezza Rice in 2012 \u2014 made abortion rights a focus of those addresses either. But in his 1996 speech, Powell stated, \u201cYou all know that I believe in a woman\u2019s right to choose and I strongly support affirmative action. And, I was invited here by my party to share my views with you because we are a big enough party \u2014 and big enough people \u2014 to disagree on individual issues and still work together for our common goal: restoring the American dream.\u201d The comment earned Powell some \u201cscattered boos from the convention floor,\u201d according to the Baltimore Sun.\n\nCorrection, March 7: In our original story, we incorrectly stated that none of the three speakers at Republican conventions who were mentioned by Christie referenced the abortion issue. However, as the report now reflects, Powell did state in his 1996 speech, \u201cI believe in a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d (Our fact-checking colleague at the Washington Post, Glenn Kessler, gets a h/t for spotting our error.)\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce013\"", "article_summary": "Bob Casey Sr. (father of Sen.
