He grew up in Coahoma, Miss., and graduated from Clarksdale (Miss.) High School at mid-term in 1945 in an accelerated class designed for students who wished to enlist in the military during World War II. He served in the Army Air Corps.\n\nFarley graduated from the University of Mississippi in 1949, where he was a member of Kappa Alpha fraternity, the Mortar Board and the M-Club.\n\nSalmon was a member of the Ole Miss football team as a halfback in 1946 and 1947 and as quarterback under Coach John Vaught in 1948. He became the Southeastern Conference\u2019s first Split-T quarterback in 1948 when Vaught brought the offensive formation to the South a year after leading his first Rebel team to their first of six SEC crowns.\n\nStanding only 5-8 and weighing just 145 pounds, Vaught had some concerns about Salmon being big enough to run the Split-T.\n\n\u201cCoach Vaught never could accept the fact I was the No. 1 quarterback,\u201d Salmon recalled for the 1976 book \u201cOle Miss Rebels, Mississippi Football\u201d by William W. Sorrels and Charles Cavagnaro. \u201cHe\u2019d keep looking for somebody else, because I was so small. When I moved to first string in the spring, I figured I had it in the fall. But when we got back, I was on the third string. I got upset, but it worked out pretty good.\u201d\n\nAll Salmon did was lead Ole Miss to an 8-1 record, with the only setback coming at Tulane, which paved the way for Georgia to win the SEC with its 6-0 league record. Football wasn\u2019t his only sport at Ole Miss as Salmon also lettered twice in basketball.\n\nIn 1993, he was inducted into the Ole Miss Athletic Hall of Fame and into the Clarksdale/Coahoma County Sports Hall of Fame in 2014. In 1996, he was honored by the Ole Miss Chapter of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame with its Distinguished American Award.\n\nHe married the former Stella Caroline Connell of Clarksdale in 1951. He founded Salmon Sales Company, an agricultural chemical business in Clarksdale and was later a sales executive with Display Sales of Minneapolis, Minn. At the time of his retirement, Farley was director of Sunflower Landing in Clarksdale, a substance abuse treatment center for adolescents.\n\nFarley was a communicant of St. George's Episcopal Church in Clarksdale, where he served as a vestry member, Senior Warden, lay reader, and Eucharistic lay minister. He was a past-president of the Clarksdale Chamber of Commerce and a member of the American Legion.\n\nIn addition to his wife of 64 years, he is survived by three children, Terre Sullivant (Henry) of Memphis, Tenn., Farley \"Fel\" Salmon, III of Jackson, Miss., and Caroline Mayo (Cal) of Oxford, Miss.; eight grandchildren, Connell Sullivant NeSmith (Eric) of Athens, Ga., Henry \"Hank\" Sullivant (Daisy) of Athens, Ga., Farley Salmon, IV (Suzanna) of Atlanta, Ga., Bryant Salmon of Jackson, Miss., Virginia, William, Callie and Thomas Mayo of Oxford, Miss; and three great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents and his brother, William Thomas (Billy) Salmon.\n\nVisitation will be in the parish hall at St. George's Episcopal Church in Clarksdale Wednesday, June 10 at 12:30 p.m. A memorial service will follow at St. George's Church at 2:00 p.m.\n\nMemorials may be made to St. George's Episcopal Church in Clarksdale, St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Oxford, the Ole Miss Athletics Foundation in Oxford, or to the charity of the donor's choice.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Member of Football Team from 1946-48", "language": "english", "author": "Ole Miss Media Relations", "og": {"url": "http://www.wtok.com/sports/headlines/Ole-Miss-Great-Farley-Salmon-Passes-Away-306430281.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/1417*315/NC11_WTOK_350x100+banner+copy.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Member of Football Team from 1946-48", "title": "Ole Miss Great Farley Salmon Passes Away"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Member of Football Team from 1946-48", "title": "Ole Miss Great Farley Salmon Passes Away", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/sports/headlines/Ole-Miss-Great-Farley-Salmon-Passes-Away-306430281.html", "image": "$cms.content.Thumbnail.url", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Ole Miss Great Farley Salmon Passes Away", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ole Miss Great Farley Salmon"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb17e\"", "article_summary": "Born November 20, 1926, Farley was the son of Raymond Farley Salmon and Alma Bell Black Salmon.\nHe grew up in Coahoma, Miss., and graduated from Clarksdale (Miss.)\n1 quarterback,\u201d Salmon recalled for the 1976 book \u201cOle Miss Rebels, Mississippi Football\u201d by William W.
