He \u201cposterized\u201d former Denver forward Nene with back-to-back dunks in the fourth quarter to light the fire behind a 116-100 comeback win over Washington. .\n\nThe young Nuggets have taken to heart coach Michael Malone\u2019s message of finishing strong as they ended their seven-game homestand 5-2 and are on their first four-game winning streak of the season.\n\nIt was a much-needed strong second half from Nurkic that turned the game around for the Nuggets (28-38), who fell behind by double digits in the third quarter. He began to impose his will in the post and finished with 17 points.\n\n\u201cHe deserved what he got tonight,\u201d Malone said. \u201cIt has not be easy for Nurkic. I admit that wholeheartedly. It\u2019s been a rough go for him at times. This is not the season he anticipated with the injury hasn\u2019t gone his way. But how he\u2019s been lately \u2014 his state of mind, his work ethic, his commitment \u2014 allowed him to have a positive impact.\u201d\n\nDenver trailed 89-85 before Nurkic\u2019s dunks sent the Nuggets on a 18-2 frenzy for which Washington (30-35) had no answer. Denver outscored the Wizards 41-17 in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Nuggets\u2019 bench played the majority of the second half, outscoring the starters 75-41. Forward Darrell Arthur and guard D.J. Augustin each finished with 17 points.\n\n\u201cTonight I give all the credit to the bench,\u201d Malone said. \u201cThey were terrific. We held them to 28 percent (shooting) in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nForward Joffrey Lauvergne took an elbow to the eye while trying to prevent Washington\u2019s Otto Porter, who led all scorers with 23 points, from an easy layup late in the third quarter.\n\nTrainers tended to Lauvergne on the ground for a couple minutes before he headed to the locker room with a towel over his eye. He was diagnosed with a right zygomatic contusion with laceration and did not return. Malone said after the game that Lauvergne had a \u201chuge gash\u201d on his eye.\n\nThe Wizards went on a 12-1 run in the third quarter, jumping ahead 74-63 after Denver center Nikola Jokic picked up his fourth foul and headed to the bench. Nurkic also was limited to 4\u00bd minutes in the first half because of foul trouble.\n\nDenver shot a fiery 54 percent from the field in the first half but only held a 52-50 lead because of 16 turnovers that led to 18 points. Washington had seven first-half turnovers.\n\nFormer Nuggets center J.J. Hickson finished with 10 points in his first meeting against Denver since the team released him last month. Point guard John Wall had 19 points and 11 assists.\n\nGuards Emmanuel Mudiay and Gary Harris combined to score 14 of the Nuggets\u2019 first 16 points. Will Barton had 14 points.\n\nIt\u2019s a long shot, but the Nuggets\u2019 streak has put them on the edge of playoff contention. They are five games back of the Mavericks (33-33) for the eighth seed in the West with 16 games to play.\n\nCameron Wolfe: cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jusuf Nurkic leads Nuggets to comeback win over Wizards", "title": "Jusuf Nurkic leads Nuggets to comeback win over Wizards", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/12/jusuf-nurkic-leads-nuggets-to-comeback-win-over-wizards/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-12T23:06:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-12T23:06:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6cde\"", "article_summary": "Nuggets center Jusuf Nurkic on Saturday night had some extra flare that ignited the Pepsi Center crowd and sparked his team.\nHe \u201cposterized\u201d former Denver forward Nene with back-to-back dunks in the fourth quarter to light the fire behind a 116-100 comeback win over Washington.\nFormer Nuggets center J.J.
