Bill Clinton had Monica Lewinsky. George W. Bush had Hurricane Katrina and failures in Iraq. All were dragged down in the home stretch.\n\nNow, thanks to a broken website and a broken promise, Barack Obama is enduring the same presidential hex. And yet, just as Mr. Reagan was saved by victory in the Cold War, rumours of a possibly imminent deal on Iranian nuclear weapons hint at a potential boost to Mr. Obama\u2019s fortunes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any president has left more popular than he entered, except for maybe John F. Kennedy, for obvious reasons,\u201d said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute in Hamden, Ct., which pegs Mr. Obama\u2019s disapproval levels at 54%.\n\nDistrust levels, likewise, are in majority terrain, even among his natural constituency of millennials, for the first time since he was elected in an historic national moment of hope, optimism and reconciliation.\n\nEvents, however, have eclipsed the halcyon vision of that honeymoon period. The president of hope and change is now in real danger of bungling his key legacy \u2014 a national health plan, known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cTrust is a muscle \u2014 if not exercised effectively, it withers, and if torn, it takes a lot of time and luck to repair,\u201d said Gil Troy, an historian of American politics and presidents at McGill University in Montreal.\n\nYou don\u2019t get do-overs in politics\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get do-overs in politics. [To lose trust is to lose the] essential political insulation he has enjoyed during these tumultuous times.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama took office promising to remedy Americans\u2019 disillusionment over the Iraq war and the stockpiled weapons of mass destruction that were never found. But a review of \u201ctrust\u201d polling in the past few months shows he has \u201cvirtually the same numbers\u201d as George W. Bush at the same time in his second term, said Mr. Malloy, a former reporter for NBC and CBS.\n\n\u201cWe asked questions about how\u2019s he doing on foreign policy, immigration, federal budget, health care, economy and terrorism, and the only thing he had in the plus column was a ten percent-plus rating for terrorism. Everything else was 15 points south,\u201d said Mr. Malloy.\n\nStarting at around 60%, where they stood steady since 2008, Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201ctrust\u201d numbers plunged 10 points in May, after renegade security analyst Edward Snowden revealed the U.S. was engaged in massive online surveillance of its own citizens and world leaders.\n\nA steady climb in the summer back to the mid-50s suggested domestic outrage was cooling. Then, last month came a disaster on the home front, a personal pocketbook scandal that trumped any top-level cyber-shenanigans.\n\nRelated\n\nThe abject failure of the rollout of Obamacare sent those numbers plunging, crossing into majority distrust in the last week or so. The curse, at last, is come upon him.\n\nNot only did Mr. Obama promise something that turned out to be false \u2014 everyone who wished to keep their current health plan would be able to \u2014 but the website to register new users in the federal plan failed miserably, leaving some people with no coverage at all.\n\nThough the technical problems might well be fixed in short order, Brand Obama is damaged.\n\nProf. Troy said trust has two aspects: faith in a president\u2019s competence and in his personal integrity. Both have been damaged by the Obamacare fiasco.\n\n\u201cThe website glitches and the promise of better health care for millions of people, when you promise that and it doesn\u2019t happen, that goes right into the American home,\u201d said Mr. Malloy.\n\n\u201cPeople who needed health care tried to get it, were told they\u2019d get it, and couldn\u2019t get it. They may eventually get it, but this is something that affects your kids, affects your income, it\u2019s an American home issue. So when it didn\u2019t happen, people took it personally.\u201d\n\nThe easy charm of \u201cNo Drama Obama\u201d has carried the president through tough times, just as Mr. Reagan\u2019s folksiness did, but personal appeal only goes so far.\n\n\u201cObama has had a longer and luckier run [than recent presidents]. He is a sober, straightforward type, broadly respected, in marked contrast to Clinton\u2019s charming and needy sloppiness. He has enjoyed tremendous personal support from the American people, even when they have questioned his policies. The Obamacare threatens to undo all that good work and goodwill,\u201d said Prof. Troy.\n\nHe described the \u201ccredibility gap\u201d for American presidents as a phenomenon that arose in the 1960s, as media became hyper-critical, the electorate became more informed and presidents like Richard Nixon violated trust on a historic scale. Modern presidents therefore \u201csuffer from trying to govern in the age of exposure.\u201d\n\nIn Mr. Reagan\u2019s case, he oversaw the end of the Cold War \u2014 a mixture of good diplomacy, shrewd strategy and historical good fortune \u2014 which allowed him to end on a high note. He remains an icon for Republicans, especially in comparison to the most recent crop of aspiring leaders.\n\nFor Mr. Obama, there seems to be a similar potential, as talk builds of an Iranian nuclear deal. After the debacle of chemical weapons in Syria, in which Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d was violated with no consequences, there is a clear appetite for a major global page-turner. But the possibility poses the question: Do big foreign policy successes fix home issues? The answer, as ever in politics, is maybe.\n\nKilling Osama bin Laden was a high point, perhaps the highest, of the Obama administration. A deal on Iran would be a similarly welcome moment for Democrats.\n\nObamacare was going to be his legacy\n\n\u201cHe needs a win. These are the worst ratings he\u2019s ever had with us. A monumental foreign policy triumph right now sure would be welcome, because on the domestic front, he\u2019s got real issues,\u201d said Mr. Malloy.\n\nBut foreign policy, even war, is not often the prime motivator at the ballot box, where health care and the economy tend to trump all other considerations.\n\n\u201cPulling off an Iranian deal somehow will certainly lead to articles talking about how he shored up his credibility, but it won\u2019t be the kind of boost that Reagan got for winning the Cold War,\u201d Prof. Troy said.\n\nAiming too high, especially on the nuclear file, also carries its own particular dangers, which in hindsight could make the Syrian debacle seem like a minor hiccough.\n\n\u201cObamacare was going to be his legacy. It may still be. They could right the ship here. Six months from now, maybe we won\u2019t be talking about this anymore,\u201d Mr. Malloy said.\n\n\u201cThe other side of the coin for the president right now is that the stock market just went through 16,000 [on the Dow Jones Industrial Average] for the first time. People\u2019s 401Ks [pensions] are turning around. Houses are starting to sell. The job picture is better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying this [trust problem] is a glitch, or something that\u2019s going to go away in a few weeks, but the economy has gotten better since the president became president. His supporters will say he took something that was going over a cliff and saved it.\u201d\n\nStill, the damage has been done by the second-term curse.\n\nThe good ship Obama still lists, and as Prof. Troy put it, \u201cThere is no excuse for blowing the website of your signature piece of legislation in the age of Facebook, Twitter and Google.\u201d\n\nNational Post\n\n\u2022 Email: jbrean@nationalpost.com | Twitter: JosephBrean", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to a broken website and a broken promise, the president of hope and change is in danger of bungling his key legacy \u2014 a national health plan known as Obamacare", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "National Post", "description": "Thanks to a broken website and a broken promise, the president of hope and change is in danger of bungling his key legacy \u2014 a national health plan known as Obamacare", "title": "Second-term curse: 'Trust' polls show Obama has 'virtually same' numbers George W.
