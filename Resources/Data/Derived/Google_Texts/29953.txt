A source within the South Korean defense ministry has told the South Korean press on Friday that North Korea has produced at least 88 pounds of plutonium which would allow the Stalinist state to produce multiple nuclear weapons, according to Newsis. The number in questions seems to be anywhere from 6-7 to 22, depending on the design of the weapon.

The bottom line is that the North’s nuclear arsenal continues to grow as well as its capability to produce more weapons of mass destruction in the future. The website 38north.org, which focuses on North Korea, said earlier in the year that commercial satellite images taken of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site showed the North is preparing to conduct an additional nuclear test, although preparations for the test seemed to have a long way to go before ready.

Several weeks ago, North Korean Dear Leader, Kim Jong-un visited an historic weapons test site in North Korea and stated the North was, “a powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation.”

Although this claim seems suspect, there is no doubt North Korea is expanding its nuclear weapons capability and the delivery systems as well to threaten America’s Asian allies as well as the west coast of the United States.
