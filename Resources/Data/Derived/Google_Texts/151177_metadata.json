Brian Sandoval.\n\nSchultz appeared on Ralston Reports, a Nevada-based political talk show hosted by John Ralston, to discuss two federal appeals court rulings issued on Tuesday which raise questions over whether federal subsidies can be given to individuals who purchased health insurance on state exchanges.\n\n\u201cJust take a state like Nevada, where you have a governor who refused to implement a state exchange and as a result people who get Affordable Care Act health-care plans are getting them on the federal exchange,\u201d Wasserman Schultz told Ralston.\n\nBut the Democrat had her facts completely wrong, and Ralston let her know.\n\n\u201cLet me just stop you for a second, because you\u2019re misinformed about that,\u201d Ralston said. \u201cBrian Sandoval put in a state exchange. He did, so whoever briefed you on that is wrong. He did put in a state exchange. He was the first Republican governor to do that.\u201d\n\nThe correction put Wasserman Schultz on the defensive.\n\n\u201cOK. That\u2019s not even the point I\u2019m making,\u201d she said, adding \u201cI stand corrected. I\u2019m not from Nevada.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, that\u2019s why I say, it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d said Ralston, throwing the congresswoman a desperately-needed lifeline.\n\nWATCH:\n\n(h/t Washington Free Beacon)\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "'Whoever briefed you on that is wrong'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman and chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, was called out during an interview for making a false statement about Nevada Republican Gov.
