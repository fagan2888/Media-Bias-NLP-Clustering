According to new research from the University of Michigan Health System and Michigan Technological University, people who have a better night\u2019s sleep age better and look more youthful in the long run.\n\nThe study was conducted using 20 middle-aged sleep apnea patients. Over the course of a few months, scientist used a \u201cface mapping\u201d technique and a panel of independent face appearance raters to detect changes after patients used the CPAP system. A CPAP, which stands for continuous positive airway pressure, is one treatment option for sleep apnea. It\u2019s a mask that works by adjusting a person\u2019s air pressure to be high enough so that his or her airway won\u2019t collapse.\n\n\u201cWe perceived that our CPAP patients often looked better, or reported that they'd been told they looked better, after treatment. But no one has ever actually studied this,\" said Roland Chervin, M.D., M.S., director at the University Of Michigan Sleep Disorders Center.\n\nChervin, alongside University Of Michigan plastic surgeon Steven Buchman, M.D., used photogrammetry to take pictures of the patients before and after the CPAP treatments; they recorded the facial differences.\n\nAccording to the raters, post-treatment photos looked more attractive two out of three times.\n\nResearchers also noted that there were not any big changes in facial characteristics. \u201cWe were surprised that our approach could not document any improvement, after treatment, in tendency to have dark blue circles or puffiness under the eyes,\" Chervin said. \"Further research is needed, to assess facial changes in more patients, and over a longer period of CPAP treatment.\"\n\nSleep apnea affects approximately 50 to 70 million U.S. adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s a sleep disorder that causes breathing to repeatedly stop and start. Often, chronic snoring is an indicator of sleep apnea.\n\nThere are two types of sleep apnea: obstructive, which happens when the throat muscles relax, and central sleep apnea, which occurs when a person\u2019s brain doesn\u2019t correctly signal the muscles that control breathing.\n\nChervin and his team are interested in how sleep affects not only people's youthfulness, but also their health on a larger scale.\n\n\"We want sleep to be on people's minds, and to educate them about the importance of getting enough sleep and getting attention for sleep disorders,\" said Chervin.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sleep apnea, university of michigan, sleep disorder, cpap", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "University of Michigan researchers find that sleep apnea affects youthfulness and attractiveness.", "title": "How Sleep Apnea Impacts Attractiveness: More Sleep Makes You Look Better", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-sleep-apnea-impacts-youthfulness-attractiveness-more-sleep-makes-you-look-better-256684", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/sleep-apnea-linked-ageing.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "University of Michigan researchers find that sleep apnea affects youthfulness and attractiveness.", "title": "How Sleep Apnea Impacts Attractiveness: More Sleep Makes You Look Better", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-sleep-apnea-impacts-youthfulness-attractiveness-more-sleep-makes-you-look-better-256684", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/sleep-apnea-linked-ageing.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/sleep-apnea-linked-ageing.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-13T16:01:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-13T16:01:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "University of Michigan researchers find that sleep apnea affects youthfulness and attractiveness."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5e0a\"", "article_summary": "There are two types of sleep apnea: obstructive, which happens when the throat muscles relax, and central sleep apnea, which occurs when a person\u2019s brain doesn\u2019t correctly signal the muscles that control breathing.\nThe study was conducted using 20 middle-aged sleep apnea patients.\nSleep apnea affects approximately 50 to 70 million U.S. adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\u201cWe perceived that our CPAP patients often looked better, or reported that they'd been told they looked better, after treatment.\nOften, chronic snoring is an indicator of sleep apnea."}
