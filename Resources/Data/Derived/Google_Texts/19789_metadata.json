And it created a new flash point in the discussion about the value of N.B.A. players\u2019 participation in off-season international basketball competitions.\n\nPlayers generally like to represent their country, but many will opt out if their contract status in the N.B.A. becomes uncertain. Coaches extol the virtues of learning and improving in international settings. The league appreciates the global exposure of its players, though it gets few tangible benefits. Team owners worry that their players, in whom they have invested a lot of money, will be hurt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many angles to consider,\u201d said Jon Barry, a former player who is an analyst at ESPN.\n\nThe United States team is preparing for the FIBA World Cup, formerly called the World Championship, a 28-team tournament that begins this month in Spain and whose winner automatically qualifies for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\u201cNothing has given me more satisfaction or been more meaningful than having USA on my shirt,\u201d said P. J. Carlesimo, who has coached four N.B.A. teams and has worked with the national program since the 1980s.\n\nCarlesimo said players who went through a national team training camp often improved. He said the camp setting was more controlled and thus safer than the pickup games, charity events and personal training sessions many players take part in during the summer.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe noted, as have others, that no other major injury had been sustained by a player in a USA Basketball setting since the first Dream Team was formed in 1992.\n\nSeveral officials with N.B.A. teams said Saturday that George\u2019s injury, sustained when he leapt to contest a fast-break layup and struck the base of a backboard stanchion, was a freak incident, though it was unclear whether the stanchion had been properly positioned.\n\nBarry said the N.B.A., from a marketing standpoint, had more to lose than to gain from the Olympics because fans expected the United States national team to dominate. He said he understood how an owner spending tens of millions of dollars on a player might be wary of seeing him play competitive games away from the team.\n\nOne such owner is Mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks, a longtime critic of how the league approaches international competitions. The subject of altering the system \u2014 including instituting an age limit for N.B.A. players in the Olympics or having the league host its own global competition \u2014 gathered steam during the 2012 Games in London, but Cuban said Saturday that discussions had not developed in any substantial way.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCuban said the Olympics made significant revenue from N.B.A. players. He pointed out that players in all sports, not just basketball, often declined to participate in international tournaments when they were free agents, or were about to be, out of fear that they would be injured. That, he said, was the smart financial decision.\n\nCuban said the only parties left financially vulnerable in such situations were the league and its clubs.\n\n\u201cWe are so stupid that we are willing to commit what amounts to more than a billion dollars in salaries to help the Olympics line their pockets so we can pretend that the Olympic Games are about national pride,\u201d Cuban said.\n\nOn Saturday, Bird expressed strong support for the national team.\n\n\u201cWe still support USA Basketball and believe in the N.B.A.\u2019s goals of exposing our game, our teams and players worldwide,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis is an extremely unfortunate injury that occurred on a highly visible stage, but could also have occurred anytime, anywhere.\u201d\n\nBird said that it was inappropriate to speculate on the future of the Pacers\u2019 roster and that the focus should be on George\u2019s health and recovery. But the injury is a blow to a team that is among the elite in the Eastern Conference. George, a two-time All-Star, averaged 21.7 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.9 steals per game last season.\n\nOne longtime N.B.A. agent, who asked for anonymity while discussing a player he did not represent, said, \u201cPaul is so important to the Pacers that I am not sure they can make up for his loss in any way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140802120013, "twitter": {"description": "The league receives global exposure through such play but gets few tangible benefits, and team owners worry about injuries to players they have invested a lot of money in.", "title": "Paul George\u2019s Injury Fuels Concerns in N.B.A. Over International Competition", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/sports/basketball/pacers-paul-george-has-surgery-after-badly-injuring-leg.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003035846"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/sports/03PAULGEORGE/03PAULGEORGE-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/sports/basketball/pacers-paul-george-has-surgery-after-badly-injuring-leg.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003035846", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/sports/basketball/pacers-paul-george-has-surgery-after-badly-injuring-leg.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sports/basketball", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/basketball/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 2, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Indiana Pacers", "keywords": "Basketball,George  Paul,Sports Injuries,USA Basketball,Indiana Pacers", "news_keywords": "Basketball", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Andrew Keh", "SCG": "basketball", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "George, Paul", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ANDREW KEH", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The league receives global exposure through such play but gets few tangible benefits, and team owners worry about injuries to players they have invested a lot of money in.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/sports/03PAULGEORGE/03PAULGEORGE-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "The league receives global exposure through such play but gets few tangible benefits, and team owners worry about injuries to players they have invested a lot of money in.", "CG": "sports", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 2, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "Pro Basketball", "modified": "2014-08-08", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/basketball/index.jsonp", "tag": "Indiana Pacers", "published": "2014-08-02", "section-taxonomy-id": "DE2B278B-2783-4506-AAD5-C15A5BB6DA1A"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "03george", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140808102303, "hdl_p": "Injury to Pacers\u2019 George Fuels Concerns in N.B.A. Over International Play", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/sports/basketball/pacers-paul-george-has-surgery-after-badly-injuring-leg.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/sports/03PAULGEORGE/03PAULGEORGE-videoSixteenByNine1050-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The league receives global exposure through such play but gets few tangible benefits, and team owners worry about injuries to players they have invested a lot of money in.", "title": "Paul George\u2019s Injury Fuels Concerns in N.B.A. Over International Competition"}, "pdate": 20140802, "des": "Sports Injuries", "articleid": 100000003035846, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Paul George\u2019s Injury Fuels Concerns in N.B.A. Over International Competition", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/sports/03PAULGEORGE/03PAULGEORGE-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca851\"", "article_summary": "The severity of Paul George\u2019s injury \u2014 the sight of his right leg bent grotesquely \u2014 has sent a jolt through the N.B.A.\nOn Saturday, Bird expressed strong support for the national team.\nPlayers generally like to represent their country, but many will opt out if their contract status in the N.B.A.\nCarlesimo said players who went through a national team training camp often improved.\nBut the injury is a blow to a team that is among the elite in the Eastern Conference."}
