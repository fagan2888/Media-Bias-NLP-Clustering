Others discourage workers from seeking health care coverage or charge more for a plan than the law allows, Schrager said.\n\nThe result has been that Nevada minimum wage workers have been paid \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars less in wages than is appropriate, he said.\n\nMany of the employers paying the lower wage are based outside Nevada as well, meaning the unpaid wages did not make it into the local economy, Schrager said.\n\nJames Nelson, representing the Nevada Association of Employers, said the rules are ambiguous and need clarification.\n\n\u201cEmployers just want to know what the right thing to do is,\u201d he said.\n\nBrian McAnallen, vice president of government affairs for the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce, said the issue is critical for its members.\n\nA $1 increase in the minimum wage can affect a business significantly, he said. This, along with the business margins tax on the November ballot and other threats from Washington, D.C., could jeopardize the thin profit margins that exist now for many businesses, he said.\n\nBut Schrager said the issue is ensuring the current law is followed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not dealing with an increase in the minimum wage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with compliance with the existing minimum wage law. The faithful implementation of it.\u201d\n\nRegulations adopted by a former labor commissioner in 2007 to enact Nevada\u2019s minimum wage law as approved by voters in 2006 are \u201cplagued with clearly unlawful gaps, exceptions and loopholes,\u201d Schrager said.\n\n\u201cThis demands swift correction,\u201d he said.\n\nSchrager has filed class action lawsuits against several employers, including Wendy\u2019s and Denny\u2019s restaurants, seeking back wages for their minimum wage employees.\n\nThe hearing was conducted by Labor Commissioner Thoran Towler from the capital and teleconferenced to Las Vegas. He noted that since many of the minimum wage rules were voter-approved and in the state constitution, he has no authority to make changes that would conflict with those provisions.\n\nTowler said he wants those interested in the issue to submit written comments by Aug. 29 on how the rules could be clarified under the guidelines established in the state constitution.\n\nAll comments will be made public for review by stakeholders, he said.\n\nContact Capital Bureau reporter Sean Whaley at swhaley@reviewjournal.com or 775-687-3900.
