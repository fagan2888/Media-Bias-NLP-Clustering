But eight different religious non-profit organizations \u2014 including Southern Nazarene University in Oklahoma, Geneva College in Pennsylvania, and the Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged \u2014 challenged this compromise in federal court, claiming, among other things, that the arrangement still made them complicit in their employees\u2019 use of birth control.\n\nSeven of these challenges failed to convince U.S. appeals courts, but in September the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in Missouri sided with the non-profit groups.\n\nThis morning, SCOTUS agreed [PDF] to hear at least part of each of the remaining seven challenges, which will be consolidated when the court hears arguments in March 2016.\n\nThe groups allege that even the compromise violates the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which states that \u201cGovernment shall not substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, except\u2026 if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d\n\nAs ScotusBlog notes, the Little Sisters case will also look at the question of whether or not the group \u2014 a Catholic religious order of nuns that also runs homes for the elderly \u2014 is required to obey the contraceptive mandate even though its insurer would not take part because it has an exempt \u201cchurch plan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "application-name": "Consumerist", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Consumerist", "description": "Today, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear its fourth challenge to the five-year-old Affordable Care Act \u2014 and the second challenge involving the law\u2019s requirement that employers prov\u2026", "title": "Supreme Court To Hear Another Challenge To Affordable Care Act Contraception Rules", "url": "https://consumerist.com/2015/11/06/supreme-court-to-hear-another-challenge-to-affordable-care-act-contraception-rules/", "image": "https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/2713580189_ff89c28b44_b.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Today, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear its fourth challenge to the five-year-old Affordable Care Act -- and the second challenge involving the law's requirement that employers provide insurance\u2026", "title": "Supreme Court To Hear Another Challenge To Affordable Care Act Contraception\u00a0Rules", "image": "https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/2713580189_ff89c28b44_b.jpg?w=240", "creator": "@consumerist", "site": "@consumerist", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "9LN2ANQdloei4Y0cgQLG83NVGd5Dd2eDPH2g0s2Gal8", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-11-06T20:32:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-06T21:29:27+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://consumerist.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/498da4a1827c0de26bc1854d0c809a17?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d46\"", "article_summary": "ByToday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear its fourth challenge to the five-year-old Affordable Care Act \u2014 and the second challenge involving the law\u2019s requirement that employers provide insurance that includes coverage for female workers who choose to use birth control.\nSeven of these challenges failed to convince U.S. appeals courts, but in September the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in Missouri sided with the non-profit groups.\nThis morning, SCOTUS agreed [PDF] to hear at least part of each of the remaining seven challenges, which will be consolidated when the court hears arguments in March 2016.\nIn creating the ACA, the Obama administration in an exception to the contraceptive mandate for strictly religious organizations like churches, but not for church-affiliated non-profit institutions like schools or hospitals.\nThe idea was that, by having the government pay for any birth control, the employers were not in any way responsible for financing something to which they object."}
