As 2015 came to an end, cities around the world were celebrating the start of a new year and bidding goodbye to one marred by terrorist attacks that left people on edge. Despite the rattled nerves, most places pressed on with their holiday revels.

In Dubai, a massive fireworks display kicked off New Year's at the world's tallest building, while a raging fire sent smoke billowing into the air from nearby tower.

In France, Parisians still recovering from deadly attacks in November held scaled-down celebrations.

And in Brussels, Belgium's capital, a holiday terror plot led to the cancellation of festivities altogether.

Tokyo was on a special security alert during Japan's biggest holiday, as millions crammed into trains to leave cities for their hometowns.
