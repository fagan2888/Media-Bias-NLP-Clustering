But, in exchange, they may find that they are losing something far greater: the trust of the American people. Americans have a fundamental, decent, and just demand: that the people they elect defend their interests. And every issue to come before us in the coming months will have to pass this test: does this strengthen, or weaken, the position of the everyday, loyal American citizen?\u201d\n\n\"For instance: thousands of loyal Americans have been laid off and forced to train the foreign workers brought in to fill their jobs\u2014at Disney, at Southern California Edison, across the country. Does Washington rush to their defense? No, the politicians and the lobbyists rush to move legislation that would double or triple the very program responsible for replacing them.\n\n\"Washington broke arms and heads to get that 60th vote\u2014not one to spare\u2014to impose on the American people a plan which imperils their jobs, wages, and control over their own affairs. It is remarkable that so much energy has been expended on advancing the things Americans oppose, and preventing the things Americans want.\n\n\"The same routine plays out over and again. We are told a massive bill must be passed, all the business lobbyists and leaders tell how grand it will be, but that it must be rushed through before the voters spoil the plan. As with Obamacare and the Gang of Eight, the politicians meet with the consultants to craft the talking points\u2014not based on what the bill actually does, but what they hope people will believe it does. And when ordinary Americans who never asked for the plan, who don\u2019t want the plan, who want no part of the plan, resist, they are scorned, mocked, and heaped with condescension.\n\n\u201cAmericans increasingly believe that their country isn\u2019t serving its own citizens. They need look no further than a bipartisan vote of Congress that will transfer congressional power to the Executive Branch and, in turn, to a transnational Pacific Union and the global interests who will help write its rules.\n\n\u201cAmericans increasingly believe that their country isn\u2019t serving its own citizens.
