Gather 'round, kids. Sarah Palin is going to read you a Dr. Seuss story--well, sort of. During her speech at the American Conservative Union's CPAC conference, Sarah shared her feelings on Obamacare, but decided she was going to try to mix politics and fun, which are clearly not compatible.



"I do not like this Uncle Sam. I do not like his healthcare scam," she read. You see where this is going, right? "I do not like these dirty crooks or how they lie and cook the books...I do not like when Congress steals. I do not like their crony deals," she said, as she read...and didn't eat bread.



"I do not like this spyin', man. I do not like 'Oh, yes we can.' I do not like this spending spree--we're smart, we know there's nothing free. I do not like reporters' smug replies when I complain about their lies. I do not like this kind of hope and we won't take it, nope, nope, nope." Then, she hat-tipped the Internet, because obvi she reads all of those fwds her friends are sending her and it showed that she's also totally up on her pop culture lingo.



We actually have to give her credit, it's kind of funny, but probably not in the way she meant for it to be.
