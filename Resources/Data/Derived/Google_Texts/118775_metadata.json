Bennett became premier, there were two private ferry systems operating just two profitable routes. The Black Ball Ferry and the CPR Ferry. They refused to operate ferries to the Gulf Islands and so Bennett started the B.C. Ferry system, providing service to most of the Gulf Islands.\n\nHis motto was to unite all B.C. residents through an affordable and reliable transportation system. They called it Bennett\u2019s Navy. It led to the settlement of many of the Gulf Islands. The service was expanded to previously un-serviced islands. They were water roads and vital to communities.\n\nSuccessive governments failed to recognize this as a service to the people. They played with the concept and failed to honour the intent to be of service to residents. They started building larger and more luxurious ships. Then they started outsourcing the construction. They saddled B.C. Ferries with billions of dollars of unnecessary debt, forcing it to raise prices to cover the losses of their stupidity. When they did that, they priced the cost of travel outside the reach of the non-government employee and ridership fell!\n\nThey knew it would because it reached critical economic value. The reduced ridership made the vessels too large for the service and too costly to maintain. To remedy the loss, B.C. Ferries decided to \u2014 wait for it \u2014 raise rates again. Simultaneously it also decided to cut service to \u201cunprofitable\u201d routes.\n\nThe current government intends to undo the system so that it goes back to the two or three routes that were profitable before W.A.C. Bennett launched the system.\n\nIn the Washington State, a 200-foot ferry requires 17 crew. In B.C., thanks to Transport Canada, that figure is 48. Logic dictates that if a 17-person crew can successfully run a ferry for 70 years without incident that it should be emulated. Remember, B.C. Ferries and Transport Canada are the partners who have a ship on the bottom of the sea. Washington State Ferries does not.\n\nWe need a new W.A.C. Bennett now!\n\nLeo Vanderbyl, North Vancouver\n\nThe editorial pages editor is Gordon Clark, who can be reached at gclark@theprovince.com.
