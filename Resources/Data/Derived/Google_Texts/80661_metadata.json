Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio), top far left, and Kevin Brady (R-Texas), top far right, or the top two contenders to replace Paul Ryan as Ways and Means chairman.\n\nThe race to replace Paul Ryan as chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee is on and it is shaping up to be a two-man battle between Republican Reps. Kevin Brady and Pat Tiberi.\n\nRyan moved closer to securing the speaker\u2019s gavel after he won the support, if not the official endorsement, on Wednesday of the hard line conservatives who make up the House Freedom Caucus.\n\n[Paul Ryan consolidates support for House speaker bid]\n\nRyan\u2019s likely ascension to speaker has touched off a rare mid-session race for a committee chairmanship, one that oversees the vast terrain of tax policy and entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Social Security.\n\nNeither Brady (R-Texas) nor Tiberi (R-Ohio) would confirm they will attempt to replace Ryan, but both have quietly begun laying the groundwork for a run at the gavel, according to several aides and lobbyists.\n\nWhile Brady is viewed as the favorite due to his seniority on the panel, the race will likely come down to whether there\u2019s room for a moderate like Tiberi in a conference being strong-armed by a cadre of conservatives.\n\nBrady, who chairs the panel\u2019s health subcommittee, is a conservative who is viewed as an effective member of the committee and takes policy issues seriously. But he has a meager fundraising record and was already passed over once for the gavel when Ryan leap-frogged him at the beginning of this Congress.\n\nTiberi, who chairs the trade subcommittee, is an Ohio moderate with close ties to outgoing Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and the business community, which has helped him with fundraising. He has consistently raised more than $3 million each election cycle since 2010, nearly doubling the House average at least twice during that period.\n\nBrady declined on Wednesday to say if will run to replace Ryan.\n\n\u201cFirst things first, we need to unite behind Paul Ryan,\u201d Brady said. \u201cHe is our current chairman and great job and once that\u2019s decided I\u2019ll make a decision.\u201d\n\nTiberi dodged questions on the subject as well.\n\n\u201cRight now Congressman Tiberi is focused on electing Chairman Ryan as a unifying Speaker of the House,\u201d said his spokeswoman, Breann Gonzalez.\n\nThe next chairman will have to work closely with Ryan, who has made overhauling the tax code and entitlement programs the cornerstone of his career. Ryan can be expected to continue to show a deep interest in the committee\u2019s work \u2014 he has called being Ways and Means chairman his dream job.\n\nHe has not given an indication of whom he would like to replace him.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to love about being chairman of Ways and Means. Not only does the committee oversee some of the biggest issues in Congress, it also opens the doors for a flood of campaign cash.\n\nThere are several issues that the committee will have to tackle during the remainder of this Congress. This list includes, consideration of the contentious Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, a looming Medicare premium increase and a potentially nasty fight to shore up the Social Security Disability Fund.\n\nThe vastness of the committee\u2019s jurisdiction makes it a focal point for the lobbying industry and a fundraising spigot for the chairman.\n\nLobby firms hire teams of experts who focus on Ways and Means and industries throw millions at lobbying the committee. Ryan\u2019s predecessor, former Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), was such a fundraising powerhouse that he out raised the House average in 2014 by nearly $400,000 despite announcing his retirement in March of that year.\n\nAssuming Ryan prevails in the Oct. 29 speaker\u2019s election, the race to replace him as chairman will officially begin. Tiberi and Brady would then have to convince members of the House Steering Committee that they are up to the job. That committee is made up of Republican leaders, committee chairmen, representatives from 12 geographic regions and representatives from small states, and some recently elected members.\n\nThe composition of that committee is subject to change, but right now the speaker gets five votes, the majority leader gets two and every other member gets one. The steering committee currently has a strong contingent of Boehner loyalists who would likely back Tiberi, but all that could change if Ryan takes the speaker\u2019s gavel.\n\nBrady has his own ties to leadership \u2014 he is roommates in Washington with House GOP Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).\n\nSeveral lobbyists said that along with his seniority, Brady\u2019s conservative bona fides and tight ties to the Texas delegation, the largest in the House GOP conference, give him an edge in the race.\n\nBrady\u2019s main focus in recent years has been on attacking the Affordable Care Act. He also shares Ryan\u2019s big-picture approach to talking about the economy and is the former chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.\n\nTiberi was once seen as a favorite to climb the committee\u2019s ranks due to his close relationship with former Chairman Camp. The two worked closely together when Tiberi led the subcommittee that oversees tax policy. Tiberi is an expert on business tax issues and has been a champion of expanding expensing in the tax code. That has made him a favorite of traditional Republican friendly groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable.\n\nHe has also shown a willingness to work with Democrats, such as Ways and Means colleague Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.)\n\nBut while being a moderate, business friendly Republican may have been advantageous in the past, it could now be what sinks Tiberi\u2019s chances for the chairmanship as the House Republican Conference continues to swing further to the right.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The committee is one of the most powerful in Congress, with jurisdiction over tax policy and entitlement programs.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The committee is one of the most powerful in Congress, with jurisdiction over tax policy and entitlement programs.", "title": "The race to replace Ryan at Ways and Means has begun", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/22/the-race-to-replace-ryan-at-ways-and-means-has-begun/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-10-19/AP/Congress_Republicans-06316.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kelsey_snell"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Ryan, Ways and Means", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Ryan, Ways and Means"}, "article_summary": "Reps.
