REPRESENTING Washington’s 8th Congressional District for the past 10 years, U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Auburn, has consistently rated among the most moderate members of Congress. Voters should send him back for another term, and urge him to avoid the hyper-partisanship that consumes Congress.

Reichert has a solid agenda. He has focused on expanding trade, eliminating human trafficking, creating an Alpine Lakes wilderness area and reworking the tax code. Representing a swing district dependent on technology and agriculture, Reichert shows independence on immigration reform, supporting a path to citizenship and reform of work visas.

But voters should keep an eye on his willingness to remain independent. During the 2013 government shutdown, he lacked a strong voice calling out the House GOP’s disastrous tactic of tying a budget vote to repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

Reichert’s primary challenger, Democrat Jason Ritchie, is promising — articulate and passionate about making government work. A first-time candidate, he could use some seasoning, perhaps in the Legislature. He is skeptical about trade agreements, an incongruous position in the nation’s most trade-dependent state.

A second challenger, Democrat Keith Arnold, came in a distant fourth in a 2012 run against Reichert.
