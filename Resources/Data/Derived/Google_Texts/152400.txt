Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky Sunday called former President Bill Clinton “predatory” for his 1996-1997 liaison with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

Paul, a potential 2016 GOP presidential nominee, also said that the Democrats’ argument that Republicans are waging a “War on Women” by opposing coverage for birth control in Obamacare and by opposing abortion is undercut by the memory of Bill Clinton as a sexual predator.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul talks about Hillary Clinton's potential 2016 run for president and whether her husband's transgressions will impact the race.

“One of the workplace laws and rules that I think are good is that bosses should not prey on young interns in their office. And I think really the media seems to have given President Clinton a pass on this. He took advantage of a girl that was 20 years old and an intern in his office. There is no excuse for that, and that is predatory behavior….. Then they (Democrats) have the gall to stand up and say, ‘Republicans are having a war on women.’ ”

He added, “It’s not Hillary’s fault, but it is a factor in judging Bill Clinton in history.”

He added with Bill and Hillary Clinton, “Sometimes it’s hard to separate one from the other.”

Paul’s comments were quickly rebutted by Senate Majority Whip Sen Dick Durbin of Illinois who told NBC’s David Gregory that that questions about Bill Clinton’s sexual behavior “were litigated in the public square for over a decade” and the American people decided years ago that the Lewinsky episode was over and that they wanted to shift their focus to other matters.

“Let’s judge Hillary Clinton based on her talents and her vision of America should she choose to run for president,” Durbin said.
