Paul Ryan (R- Wis.) admits that Obamacare might just be broken beyond repair.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fix a fundamentally broken law; you\u2019ve got to replace it,\u201d Ryan argued in a new op-ed in USA Today. \u201cThat\u2019s why Congress can\u2019t save Obamacare with a few tweaks, despite what its defenders say. No quick fix can correct the main flaw: The law takes power away from patients and hands it to bureaucrats.\u201d\n\nBut since \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d \u2014 the individual mandate, tax season \u2014 Paul argues that changes must be made to the law. Although they won\u2019t solve the larger problem, he said, they can help ease the burden.\n\n\u201cBut just because we can\u2019t fix Obamacare doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t start to get rid of its worst features,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPaul timed the op-ed to coincide with the House\u2019s efforts to reinstate the 40 hour work week. Under the healthcare law, large employers must provide insurance to employees working full time or face a penalty. But right now Obamacare defines full-time work as 30 hours per week, cutting hours for many employees and leaving businesses in a lurch.\n\nThe House will take up the issue Thursday.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the law will collapse under its own weight,\u201d Paul wrote. \u201cUntil then, we have to start building a better health care system in its place. And we need to start with a new principle: Put the patient in the driver\u2019s seat.
