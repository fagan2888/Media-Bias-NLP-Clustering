Still, many officials held their breath.\n\nLocal government leaders from Denver to smaller cities and rural hamlets say the pivotal first-year rollout went smoothly, and in some cases it has proved quite profitable for local coffers.\n\n\u201cTo be able to pull that off in that short amount of time, and to one year later have a pretty good understanding of what the rules of the road are, it\u2019s a pretty monumental achievement,\u201d Kevin Bommer said. As deputy director of the Colorado Municipal League, he has tracked the experiences of cities and towns across the state.\n\nStill, while 53 of them have chosen to permit retail marijuana \u2014 with 27 levying special taxes \u2014 more did not. The group counts 165 cities and towns that decided against taking the leap. An additional 16 municipalities have moratoriums on the idea of legalized recreational marijuana.\n\nAnd looking at unincorporated areas, 23 of Colorado\u2019s 64 counties have opted to allow retail marijuana sales or cultivation or both.\n\n\u201cI think the local option is one of the best aspects of Amendment 64,\u201d said industry spokesman Mike Elliott, executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group. \u201cIf communities don\u2019t want this, it shouldn\u2019t be forced down their throats. At the same time, those who want it shouldn\u2019t be stopped.\u201d\n\nPueblo County officials recently told The Denver Post that its plans to become the leading pot-growing county are all about economic development.\n\n\u201cThis was obviously foisted upon us by will of the people, and everyone had to react fairly quickly,\u201d Bommer said. But he credits state policymakers and lawmakers for setting the right tone for sober implementation of 2012\u2019s Amendment 64.\n\nHere is a look at the experiences of cities and towns that have allowed retail marijuana, often following on a track record of medical pot shops, and some that have rejected it emphatically.\n\nDenver\n\nColorado\u2019s capital and largest city attracted international attention when its recreational pot shops opened Jan. 1 with long lines out the door. It hasn\u2019t let up.\n\n\u201cWe just met with France and Germany last week,\u201d Ashley Kilroy, the city\u2019s executive director on marijuana policy, said in November about the many requests for briefings she\u2019s gotten from government officials. Often, they have come from states that just legalized marijuana in some way or were considering it.\n\nDenver, with about 100 retail marijuana licenses granted thus far, has had few hiccups in its rollout.\n\nAnd it\u2019s reaped a good chunk of new local sales tax revenue \u2014 $7.6 million through September, about half of that from a special 3.5 percent tax approved by voters. It\u2019s also gotten a share of a state marijuana tax.\n\nThe city in June tapped $3.4 million of the expected proceeds to beef up its inspection and regulatory staffs, expand public safety efforts and pay for a public education campaign.\n\nAnd the newfound money got the city\u2019s parks department out of a tough spot, with more than $3 million helping cover cost increases in the Central Denver Recreation Center project.\n\nGiven Amendment 64\u2019s nearly 10-point margin among Denver voters, \u201cwe wanted to ensure that we adopted and implemented the will of the voters,\u201d Kilroy said, \u201cwhile, at the same time, balancing that with public health and safety and enforcing the regulations around it.\u201d\n\nCity officials also have adapted to new challenges by adopting new rules restricting amateur hash-oil production and monitoring unregulated, small marijuana growing co-ops.\n\nA remaining point of tension: the stringency of Denver\u2019s ban on public pot consumption. It\u2019s frustrated marijuana tourists as well as enthusiasts who want to celebrate their new freedom in public gatherings, including the massive 4/20 festival at Civic Center.\n\nLakewood\n\nIn November, voters in Lakewood decided against allowing retail marijuana stores in the city by a ratio of 54 percent to 46 percent.\n\nMayor Bob Murphy said the issue was important enough that city leaders felt it should go to a vote of the people rather than being decided by the City Council.\n\nDan Cohrs, chief financial officer for Colorado Christian University in Lakewood, campaigned against Ballot Question 2A last fall. Even though Lakewood residents resoundingly passed Amendment 64 two years ago, Cohrs said, they didn\u2019t envision pot stores on every corner.\n\n\u201cWhen people voted for Amendment 64, they thought they voted for decriminalization of marijuana,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they got were these superstores selling gummy bears, lollipops and THC-laced candies. That\u2019s a far cry from decriminalization.\n\n\u201cWhat they are seeing on South Broadway and in some parts of Denver, they didn\u2019t want here.\u201d\n\nBut Shaun Gindi, owner of Compassionate Pain Management in Lakewood, said the city \u201cis giving up on a lot\u201d in terms of potential sales tax revenue by disallowing retail marijuana businesses. CPM is one of a dozen medical marijuana dispensaries in Lakewood.\n\n\u201cThe same amount of marijuana is going to get consumed in Lakewood, whether it\u2019s legal or not to buy here,\u201d Gindi said. \u201cThe difference is people are going to drive out of the city and go to Denver and to Edgewater to get it.\u201d\n\nAurora\n\nThe marijuana industry is just getting started in the metro area\u2019s largest suburban city, which had the distinction of launching retail pot sales this fall with no medical marijuana experience.\n\nAs in Denver, elected officials felt pressure to respect Aurora voters\u2019 support for Amendment 64.\n\nBut a special City Council committee set up to write Aurora\u2019s rules also had an eye on making its pot shops competitive. They can stay open until 10 p.m., three hours later than in Denver.\n\nSo far, the city of nearly 350,000 has just a handful of dispensaries open, with 23 licenses granted of a maximum 24.\n\n\u201cEverything I understand is that it\u2019s going very well,\u201d said Councilman Bob Roth, who led the marijuana committee.\n\nHe said among its best decisions was to start with tough minimum requirements for applicants.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure that we had operators that not only were good business people,\u201d Roth said, \u201cbut also had a clear understanding of this particular business.\u201d\n\nWith the industry launching recently in Aurora, the revenue question still is open. City voters in November authorized a special 5 percent excise tax and a 2 percent sales tax on marijuana, with combined proceeds estimated at up to $2.4 million next year. Aurora\u2019s regular sales tax is expected to raise $2.8 million more from marijuana sales.\n\nPalisade\n\nVoters in this tiny Western Slope town just east of Grand Junction also said no to recreational pot stores in November, but the margin was just six votes out of more than 1,000 ballots counted.\n\nThe election means Jesse Loughman, co-owner of medical marijuana dispensary Colorado Alternative Health Care in Palisade, won\u2019t be able to expand his business into the world of recreational sales. Besides curtailing his own growth plans, Loughman said the town of 2,600 \u2014 famous for its vineyards and peach orchards \u2014 is forfeiting a potentially lucrative stream of revenue.\n\nAccording to the town, Palisade stood to collect $200,000 annually in sales taxes from recreational marijuana operations.\n\n\u201cTwo hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money for a town the size of Palisade,\u201d Loughman said.\n\nPot stores, he said, would have fit in well with \u2014 and given an economic boost to \u2014 a town that boasts more than a dozen wineries, a brewery and a distillery.\n\nBut those who fought against Palisade\u2019s recreational marijuana measure, like Diane Cox of the citizens group Safe and Healthy Mesa County, said the voters\u2019 decision in November tells her that people are beginning to recognize the less-than-innocuous effects of marijuana, especially on young people.\n\n\u201cI think people are becoming a lot more alarmed,\u201d Cox said. \u201cEffects of marijuana on young people\u2019s brains are devastating.\u201d\n\nThe decision of voters in Palisade means that De Beque stands as the only town in Mesa County to permit recreational sales of cannabis. Its first store is expected to open this month.\n\nGarden City\n\nThe tiny town of Garden City didn\u2019t hesitate to capitalize on recreational marijuana.\n\nSituated between Greeley and Evans in Weld County, the town of 300 or so residents and 60 businesses previously had embraced medical marijuana. And after the end of Prohibition, it incorporated and welcomed bars and liquor stores a full three decades before Greeley followed suit.\n\n\u201cI think the surrounding communities would rather we didn\u2019t\u201d allow marijuana dispensaries, said Cheryl Campbell, the town administrator. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty vocal about it. We see stuff in the paper.\u201d\n\nBut the town board, reflecting the town\u2019s independent spirit, voted 7-0 to approve the expansion to retail marijuana. All four medical cannabis dispensaries have jumped on board.\n\nRetail marijuana is among the factors driving a surge in sales tax revenue, which Campbell says the town doesn\u2019t break down by source. It didn\u2019t create a special marijuana tax.\n\nIn November, the town collected $105,356 from all businesses, she said, up 81 percent over the same month last year. Sales tax receipts for the year through November were about $924,000, versus $668,000 for all of last year.\n\n\u201cLast year, at this time, I would never have speculated more than $1 million in sales taxes,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nThe excess cash has enabled the town to earmark $300,000 for a \u201cmajor face-lift\u201d of its three-block main street next year, with a revitalization plan still being formulated.\n\nColorado Springs\n\nColorado\u2019s second-largest city put in place its recreational sales ban without going to the ballot box \u2014 the City Council voted 5-4 in summer 2013 to prohibit recreational marijuana sales. In September, the council voted against putting the issue on the ballot for voters to decide in April.\n\nCity Council president Keith King said \u201cthere weren\u2019t enough rules and regulations\u201d ready for a potential recreational cannabis sector in the city for the majority of the council to feel comfortable seeking a vote of the electorate. King specifically wanted a 10 percent city tax on retail pot sales in the city.\n\n\u201cUnless it is highly regulated or highly taxed, it\u2019s not worth doing,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Councilwoman Jill Gaebler said Colorado Springs is essentially putting its head in the sand on the issue. With a popular and highly trafficked recreational marijuana store in nearby Manitou Springs, Gaebler said Colorado Springs is getting hit with the social impacts of legal pot without realizing any of the revenue benefits from sales tax collections.\n\nVoters in the city narrowly passed Amendment 64 in 2012.\n\nCity officials estimate that recreational cannabis businesses would generate $500,000 to $900,000 a year based on a 1 percent sales tax levy. Through the first 10 months of 2014, Colorado Springs collected more than $1.1 million in sales tax revenues from the medical marijuana dispensaries that operate in the city.\n\nElliott, the Marijuana Industry Group director, said Colorado Springs and other communities like it are doing little to keep marijuana out of their midst by prohibiting its legal sale.\n\n\u201cColorado Springs is leaving it to the black market,\u201d he said. \u201cMarijuana is being bought and sold in all of these communities. And by banning it, they have decided to let the drug cartels sell it instead of regulated and taxed businesses.\u201d\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray.
