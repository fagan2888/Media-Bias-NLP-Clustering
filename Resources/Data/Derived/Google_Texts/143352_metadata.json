Joe Heck is an early dead-heat, according to a poll conducted for Democrats and released Wednesday.\n\nMasto leads Heck 42 percent to 41 percent, well within the 3.8 percent margin of error in the poll taken by Public Policy Polling, a firm commissioned by the Senate Majority PAC that is run by allies of Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.\n\nThe poll also showed Hillary Clinton as the presidential favorite in Nevada. The poll was taken of 677 Nevada voters on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the firm, Clinton has a 48-43 percent lead over Marco Rubio; 48-41 on Scott Walker and 49-37 on Jeb Bush. Clinton led Donald Trump, 48-41. It was not clear if other Republicans were measured against Clinton.\n\nThe Senate Majority PAC declined to make public the internal numbers from the poll. Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, said they indicate Clinton will have coattails among undecided voters that probably will mean additional support for Cortez Masto, the state\u2018s former attorney general.\n\nJensen also said 59 percent of Nevadans polled favored raising the federal minimum wage, a position that could give Masto a leg up.\n\n\u201cThe Nevada Senate race starts out about as tight as it can be,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cBut Hillary Clinton\u2019s strength in the state and the continued growth of voters in Democratic-friendly demographic groups leave Catherine Cortez Masto pretty well positioned for next year.\n\nRepublicans attempted to throw cold water on the poll, which comes a week after a GOP poll paid for by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed Heck with a 50-36 lead. It also comes as the chamber is running television ads in Las Vegas and Reno promoting Heck.\n\n\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s surprising that Catherine Cortez Masto isn\u2019t winning by 100 points given that Harry Reid\u2019s Super PAC paid a Democrat polling company to find that his handpicked candidate is winning,\u201d GOP spokesman Jahan Wilcox said. \u201cAnything that comes from Democrat Public Policy Polling is about as credible as Kim Jong-Il shooting 11 holes-in-one the first time he played golf.\"\n\nContact Review-Journal Washington Bureau Chief Steve Tetreault at stetreault@reviewjournal.com or 202-783-1760.
