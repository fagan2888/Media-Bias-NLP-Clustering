You\u2019ll find plenty of vacuumsales and home cleaning deals this month.\n\nThe discounts may not be as steep as they were during Black Friday, but you can still find deals from home-cleaning brands and third-party retailers.\n\nRelated: The 20 Most Expensive Shopping Streets in the U.S.\n\nFor example, Amazon\u2019s Spring Event section includes deals on some of the site\u2019s top vacuums. And Dyson is hosting a limited-time clearance event with discounts of up to $150, while supplies last.\n\nSkip: Mattresses\n\nApril can be a great time for a fresh start \u2014 but don\u2019t get rid of everything old just yet.\n\nMajor household purchases, such as mattresses and furniture, are best made during blowout sale events, which often occur during Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend. Last year, mattresses were often discounted by up to 60% during Memorial Day at outlets including Sears and 1800Mattress.\n\nThis year, Memorial Day is on May 30, but deals will likely start the week before and run throughout the three-day weekend.\n\nBuy: Jewelry\n\nBack in February, we warned you not to buy necklaces, rings and the like for your Valentine because jewelry prices would be better at other times of the year. Now is one of those times.\n\nRelated: Here's How Online Stores Trick You in Paying More\n\nIn general, jewelry stores are more motivated to have sales during non-gift-giving months. And since there aren\u2019t any jewelry-centric holidays \u2014 such as Valentine\u2019s Day or Mother\u2019s Day \u2014 in April, now is a good time to find discounts. Whenever possible, try to negotiate jewelry costs.\n\nSkip: Bedding and linens\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market for fresh bedding, linens or towels, you\u2019re a few months too late. Stores offer the best discounts on bedding each January during what are called \u201cwhite sales.\u201d\n\nWhat if you can\u2019t wait until January 2017 for a low-priced set of sheets? Look for household goods to be included in Memorial Day and Labor Day sales at department stores, including Macy\u2019s and J.C. Penney.\n\nBuy: Easter leftovers\n\nSince Easter fell at the end of March this year, the beginning of April will be an ideal time to stock up on Easter leftovers, such as candy, treats and decorations. Look for close-out sales at drug stores and department chains, as retailers clear inventory to make room for Mother\u2019s Day displays.\n\nRelated: 7 Ways to Spring Clean Your Finances for Savings\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find deals of 50% off (or more), so you can stock up on baskets and plush bunnies for next year.\n\nSkip: Summer essentials\n\nLong months of winter blues could have you itching to skip spring and head straight to summer, but there are better times to stock up on swimsuits, beach hats and outdoor grills. Prices for seasonal items tend to be highest at the beginning of the given season and lowest at the end.\n\nIf you really need to replace those old flip-flops, try to hold out a few more months. You can expect midseason sales after demand has died down slightly.\n\nBonus: Tax Day goodies\n\nThis year, Tax Day is on April 18. To brighten up this often-dreaded day, look for Tax Day deals from retailers, restaurants and others.\n\nLast year, Sonic offered half-off cheeseburgers, and Staples offered to shred your papers for free. Expect to find plenty of discounts and giveaways again this year.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in NerdWallet.
