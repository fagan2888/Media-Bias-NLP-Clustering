These treatments efficiently cure 90 percent of those infected and cost between $63,000 to $94,500; prior to the application of any discounts.\n\nAs for cancer treatments, Herceptin, which is sold by Roche, and Gleevec, which is sold by Novartis, were also added to the WHO list, along with 14 other cancer treatments.\n\n[quote text_size=\u201dsmall\u201d author=\u201d\u2013 Dr Kees De Joncheere\u201d author_title=\u201dWHO Director of Essential Medicines\u201d]\n\nThe Essential Medicines List includes medicines on the basis of safety and efficacy evidence, not on the basis of approved indications within national jurisdictions or availability of licensed alternatives. (\u2026) For example, when it reviewed the application to include ranibizumab, a treatment for for severe eye diseases, such as macular degeneration, the Committee compared it with bevacizumab, the medicine currently listed, in terms of efficiency and price, and agreed to maintain bevacizumab as preferred medicine, rejecting the ranibizumab application.\n\n[/quote]\n\n\u201cThe whole purpose of WHO\u2019s list is to provide guidance for prioritization of medicines from a clinical and public health perspective. The Essential Medicines List is just a start and ensuring that those medicines are available to patients is the real challenge,\u201d concluded Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation.\n\nIn other unrelated health news here on Immortal News, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, indicated that data harnessed by Obamacare\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative will require software transparency.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.immortal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pills.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The World Health Organization (WHO)\u00a0has expanded\u00a0its list of essential medicines by adding several treatments for hepatitis C, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and a variety of cancers.
