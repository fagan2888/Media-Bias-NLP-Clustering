Near war. War drums. General threats. And of course, the GOP favorite, the perpetual re-do of the Cold War.\n\nSo it was that McCain was on CNN\u2019s State of the Union to give his expert opinion on Ukraine and Russia, which is that while it\u2019s not the Cold War (so fresh!), and we don\u2019t need boots on the ground, we need to offer military assistance to Ukraine and impose economic sanctions against Russia. This is pretty much what the President has been saying, and is a far cry from McCain\u2019s recent \u201cthe President needs to be stronger against Russia\u201d rhetoric.\n\nIt\u2019s also a big reversal from his Vice Presidential pick\u2019s announcement that the only way to stop a bad guy with a nuke is with a good guy with a nuke. (And here Sarah Palin promised us she was keepin\u2019 an eye on Putin.)\n\nWatch here:\n\nMcCain was ostensibly on because he had just returned from a Congressional trip to Ukraine. (Remember McCain\u2019s secret trip to Syria, where he said we should arm Syrian rebels because we can tell who the good guys are, and then he was accused of posing with rebels who kidnapped 11 Lebanese Shi\u2019ite pilgrims? Maybe it\u2019s time for Republicans to hang up the whole good guy versus bad guy fairy tale.)\n\nBomb-bomb-bomb McCain is gone for the moment. This new McCain, a reasonable McCain, said we don\u2019t need boots on the ground, \u201cNo boots on the ground. It\u2019s not the Cold War over again.\u201d And then he championed economic sanctions \u2013 hello, President Obama! \u2014 against Russia and military assistance to Ukraine in terms of sending aid to their military, but no boots on the ground for the U.S. McCain bolstered his \u201cargument\u201d for economic sanctions (Obama\u2019s strategy from the beginning) by saying that since Russia depends on oil and gas exports, this is a great idea. HUH. Thank God he\u2019s here to parrot as the actual President. It\u2019s better than his attempts to be a shadow president.\n\nAlso, this McCainism, \u201cRussia is a gas station masquerading as a country.\u201d So that\u2019s a no for nuance. He can parrot Obama but he just can\u2019t quite get to the place where he\u2019s not inflammatory and seeing the world in high relief.\n\nMcCain made the seemingly profound statement that we need to reassess our relationship with Putin, saying we need a \u201cfundamental reassessment of our relationship with Vladimir Putin.\u201d I\u2019m not sure to whom this is directed, because his party is the only party embracing Putin.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if McCain knows that his Vice Presidential pick can\u2019t stop talking about how Putin is a real man whereas the President of the U.S. is a weak loser because Palin can\u2019t picture Obama wrestling a bear or something equally irrelevant and bizarre. It might behoove Republicans to follow McCain\u2019s lead on this, as it appears like they are jumping into bed with Putin at the worst of times. It\u2019s going to be awkward to wave that red, white and blue in campaigns as they salivate over Putin and his naked chest.\n\nEarlier McCain was pushing for Obama to be stronger against Russia, demanding that the President spell out the consequences if Russia failed to respect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. This is pretty much a demand for Obama to threaten some kind of force, since Obama had already been pushing for economic sanctions. It\u2019s also really bad strategy unless you want war, because only weak, foolish leaders make specific threats. Foreign policy is dynamic \u2014 the landscape is constantly shifting. A smart leader has to leave room to respond to the changes. Republicans don\u2019t like the vagueness, but the vagueness is necessary. Life is not black and white.\n\nPresident Obama has already issued a strong warning to Russia. While urging dialogue instead of escalation, he further noted that the US would be consulting with the UN and other international groups over Russia\u2019s continued violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. He said, \u201cThe United States will suspend upcoming participation in preparatory meetings for the G-8. Going forward, Russia\u2019s continued violation of international law will lead to greater political and economic isolation.\u201d\n\nVice President Joe Biden made sure everyone understands that this administration, unlike the previous Republican administration, respects the sovereignty of other nations, in this case Ukraine.\n\nIn other words, John McCain reiterated President Obama\u2019s foreign policy, in what can only be seen as a huge downshift from his previous saber rattling. McCain does have hard core values, unlike many in his party and he would rather stand with his President to stop what he sees as a Commie dictator than allow his bitterness to rule the day. He also seems to be trying to lure his party out of Putin\u2019s bed and back home in time for election season.", "article_metadata": {"description": "John McCain reiterated President Obama's foreign policy, in what can only be seen as a huge downshift from his previous saber rattling.
