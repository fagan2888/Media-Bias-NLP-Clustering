May this Memorial Day Weekend bring happy thoughts and kind remembrances to all, as we enjoy our variable weather.

The roads today, Sunday and Monday will be filled with cars and trucks, including a rush of late-model beauties.

Show me something in a size 2, please, in red metallic, with some flair and a faster-than-heck look.

Matching that request is the 2014 BMW M235i Coupe, which reached showrooms two months ago.

This one competes in a new-to-the-U.S. class of undersized premium models against Mercedes-Benz CLA and Audi’s A3 and S3.

The 235 replaces BMW’s 135i from a year ago. BMW’s model nomenclature is now even-numbered for coupes (2, 4 and 6) and odd-numbered for four-doors (3, 5 and 7). Thus, the 328ix I reviewed in December was a four-door sedan, the 435ix was a two-door.

Beneath the hood of the new M235i is a 320-horsepower, 3.0-liter inline-6-cylinder engine, twin-scroll turbocharged with direct-injection, mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission.

Slip down into the relatively narrow, bolstered, thigh-lengthened driver’s sport seat and participate in the performance. Push the Sport button on the center console and move the shifter into manual mode for more sensitive throttle and quickened shifts. In Sport mode, the coupe will run 0 to 60 in fewer than 5 seconds.

Electronically controlled, sport-tuned dampers enhance the car’s handling. Adding to the impression is the sound emitting from the dual exhausts. The combination of grip and rolling ease is gained from Michelin Pilot Super Sport 225/40ZR18 tires. Adding security are larger M Sport brakes, 13.4-inch discs in front and 13.6 at the rear.

The coupe’s rear seat lacks legroom and headroom. Access and egress are okay, as the front seats, with push of a lever, slide far forward for open space to crawl through. The small coupe is bigger than expected in the luggage compartment – 13.8 cubic feet.

Even at its curb weight of 3,535 pounds, this is one of the smaller BMWs I’ve driven in recent years. Smallest was the Z3 back in the late ’90s. One of the most fun to drive was the 1999 M Coupe, based on the Z3 chassis. The M Coupe, with a long hood and odd-looking rear end, stood only 50 inches in height and was barely over 13 feet in length. Above the rear wheel arches, the body tucked in sharply to rear-quarter windows. It was a rough rider, yet so much fun to drive – a great handler. Under the hood, of course, was an inline-6, generating 240 horsepower and 236 lb.-ft. of torque. In the upper left-hand corner of the windshield was a small-type notice reading, “Over the car’s first 1,200 miles don’t use full throttle and don’t exceed 106 miles per hour; and over the first 3,100 miles don’t exceed137 miles per hour.”

The M package pushed sticker price on the 2014 coupe to $46,025. That’s $5,000 higher than a 2014 328i xDrive GT I reviewed five months ago and $10,000 higher than a ’14 320i xDrive about that same time.

Melbourne red metallic exterior with M badging and black leather interior with alcantra headliner highlighted the overall appearance. The coupe was equipped with moonroof, fine-wood trim, automatic climate control, navigation and AM/FM/CD/MP3 with hands-free Bluetooth and USB, xenon headlights and retractable headlight washers.

The 235 has two usable cupholders, never a priority with BMW, at the front of the center console.

The M235i averaged 23.4 miles per gallon, at the lower end of its 22/32 EPA estimate.

Adding interest for U.S. luxury-make consumers is recent talk from Leipzig, Germany, where the M235i Coupe is built, that within the next year it will be available in this country with BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system.

Bud, I read your column every week and, partially upon your writing, I purchased a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee loaded. And (in regards to your column last week), to think I could have purchased a Kia for the same amount. The Jeep will climb circles around any Korean vehicle. And you can keep the moonroof, as Colorado is the skin cancer capital of the nation. Thanks for your articles. – B.R.

Well, Brent, I can find lots of favorables for both the Grand Cherokee and the Sorento. I will tell you, though, when we host the annual family Christmas gathering, it looks like a Jeep convention outside our home.
