Frustrated residents returned to a place they once called home only to pick up the pieces and to salvage what they can.

Severe storms last week caused the roof to collapse at an apartment building in northwest Oklahoma City forcing some tenants to find a new place to call home.

Frustrated residents returned to Oakwood Apartments to pick up the pieces and to try to salvage what they can.

The roof caved in Friday morning at 5824 N.W. 34th St. Riley Webb says her apartment is still leaking two days later.

"Ever since the roof came down the first time, it just keeps coming down on the stuff that's already ruined," said Webb. "It's still leaking. It looks like a waterfall in there."

Webb is a single mother trying to make ends meet to support her son. Her friend Rebecca, was over to help sort through the mess, but there wasn't much to save.

"She can't salvage any of his toys, the beds, her living room suit, none of that," said Rebecca Doss, Webb's friend. "The roof fell down on everything."

Other residents tell News 9 they are frustrated with the property owner for giving them a short notice to pack up with no place to go.

The owner tells News 9 that she's doing everything in her power to make it right with her tenants.

Katy Bookstore has been staying at a local hotel for the past couple of nights, but with a baby on the way she's not sure what's next.

"I don't have anywhere to go to live for me and my baby and with all the health problems," said Bookstore. "It was already tough before this and now not having a stable place to live."

The American Red Cross set up a temporary shelter at the Messiah Lutheran Church for two days, but closed the shelter Sunday. Volunteers were able to help two people during that time.

The property owner says a restoration company will come out to inspect the damage Monday. She's in the process of refunding tenants their deposit money.
