Thursday as an additional feature we are tracking Santa,\" Chief of Combat Operations Division, Michael Valle said.\n\nNORAD has been tracking 'Ole Saint Nick for 60 years, and while some may think it's an easy task, think again!\n\n\"Santa, he is very fast! In fact, for us to get him on camera or to keep up with him in the airplane, he actually has to slow down,\" Senior Operations Duty Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Ward said. \"So, he slows down, let's us see him and he gets on his way because he's got a lot of toys to deliver this year!\"\n\nSo, how do the commanders keep up with Kris Kringle?\n\n\"We've got a sophisticated system of satellites and radar and some cameras we've set up around the world that'll keep track of him. We also have Rudolph's red nose, it puts off a good heat signature and we keep track of Santa by where Rudolph is,\" Ward said.\n\nIf there's bad weather in your area tonight, no need to fear, Santa's got his magical sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.\n\n\"Thursday night, he'll likely get his umbrella out before he enters the Northwest. Sometimes, even before he reaches Florida he'll take off his big heavy coat and his big black boots and put his flip flops on,\" USAF Meteorologist, Amber Martinez said.\n\nSo kids, you've been waiting for Christmas and it's almost here, so, don't wait up for Santa when he is near!\n\nTo find out when Santa will arrive at your house you can call 1-877-HI-NORAD (1-877-446-6723) or visit NORAD's Santa tracking website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Where in the world is Santa?
