And when I want to communicate with a foreign leader privately, I type or write the letter myself, put it in the post office, and mail it.\"\n\n\"Old fashioned snail mail,\" Mitchell said.\n\n\"Yeah. Because I believe if I send an email it will be monitored,\" he said.\n\nCarter has previously expressed support for Edward Snowden, the former government contractor who leaked documents on the NSA's controversial surveillance programs.\n\n\"He's obviously violated the laws of America, for which he's responsible, but I think the invasion of human rights and American privacy has gone too far,\" Carter said in an interview with CNN last June. \"I think that the secrecy that has been surrounding this invasion of privacy has been excessive, so I think that the bringing of it to the public notice has probably been, in the long term, beneficial.\"\n\nThe former president later said the United States' democracy had been compromised by the spying.\n\n\u201cAmerica does not at the moment have a functioning democracy,\" Carter said at an event in Atlanta in July.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Presidents On Inauguration Day Presidents On Inauguration Day\n\n1 of 38 Barack Obama (2009) Barack Obama delivers his inaugural address after being sworn in as 44th U.S. president at the Capitol in Washington on January 20, 2009.
