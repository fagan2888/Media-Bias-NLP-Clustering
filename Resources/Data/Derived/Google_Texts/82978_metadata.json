The two-dozen attendees - mostly elderly African Americans \u2013 did not know the duo was connected to the Fiorella Insurance Agency in Stuart until reporters started asking questions.\n\nEven worse, some of the information provided at the forum was false, and the team asked attendees for their social security numbers.\n\nThe Florida Attorney General\u2019s Office has received a complaint that the team is misleading consumers about who its employees work for.\n\nThe Obamacare Enrollment Team uses different websites to promote its forums hosted by different pastors and representatives in other states.\n\nTia Mitchell in the Herald/Times Tallahassee Bureau was at the meeting in Tallahassee and tells us why concerns are being raised about the group.\n\nWLRN: How does the event appear to people who stop by for information?\n\nMitchell: The event looks like an Affordable Care Act forum that is tied actually to the federal government or at least people who are certified and authorized to speak about the law. It\u2019s sponsored by the Obamacare Enrollment Team.\n\nThey use the red, white and blue \"O\" logo that President Barack Obama used during his campaign. So they really give an air of legitimacy and an air of being tied to the federal government. But when you dig deeper into the group\u2026 they\u2019re a group that is a subsidiary of an insurance company that\u2019s based in Stuart.\n\nWLRN: Katrina Copeland and Pastor H.B. Holmes hosted the forum at St. Mary's Primitive Baptist Church in Tallahassee. What should we know about them?\n\nMitchell: After I raised questions at the forum, they did admit that they represent insurance agents. I did mention the company and they didn\u2019t deny that they were affiliated with the company. And they did admit that they do not work for the federal government, which some people in the audience were surprised to hear.\n\n(The duo included) a pastor from Lakeland - his name is Pastor H.B. Holmes. There is a woman (Katrina Copeland) who registered as a lobbyist \u2013 anyone can submit paperwork and file it saying \u2018I want to be a lobbyist.\u2019 That\u2019s what she did, but she only represents herself and she hasn\u2019t submitted any paperwork since 2011. But even if she were an active lobbyist in D.C., those people still for the most part don\u2019t have the certification or the training to speak on behalf of the healthcare law.\n\nWLRN: So, it\u2019s okay for now for this group to use the Obamacare moniker?\n\nMitchell: No one has so far in Florida or anywhere else I can tell told the group to change its logo or its name. But the group seems to have just kicked off its activities within the last week or so, and media are just now starting to report on the group and raise concerns.\n\nTo be clear, insurance agents are signing people up for health insurance everyday. There\u2019s nothing wrong or illegal about that. With the healthcare law being so prominent, more people are shopping for insurance. So insurance agencies are very busy right now.\n\nBut the concern about this Obamacare Enrollment Team is that they don\u2019t seem to be as forthcoming about their ties to the insurance agency, and people could be misled \u2013 thinking that they\u2019re an organization that represents the federal government. Some of the websites they use make that clear; other ones\u2026 do not make that clear.\n\nThe concern is that people who are looking to make money off of the law might be confusing constituents who just want information that\u2019s unbiased.\n\nFor example, the insurance company... only represents one insurance (provider), which is Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Florida. So of course, they\u2019re pushing Blue Cross, Blue Shield of Florida even though there are other insurance companies that have policies that could qualify for the subsidies and that are on the health exchange. But you didn\u2019t hear that at the forum they had in Tallahassee \u2013 you only heard about Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Florida.\n\nWhen they write policies for whatever company, they get a portion of the proceeds. That\u2019s just how it works. There\u2019s nothing illegal about that. That\u2019s how they make money - when it comes through their agency \u2013 as opposed to people (going) straight on the health exchange to buy policies.\n\nIf these same customers went to an unbiased resource that was affiliated with the federal government, they might have had a little bit more information about the different choices.\n\nWLRN: Bottom line \u2013 what do people need to know about groups like this?\n\nMitchell: If they want information about the healthcare law, they need to go to healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596. They need to go to people who have been trained as navigators or people who are certified by the federal government, and they can ask for that documentation if they\u2019re not sure if someone is certified.\n\nThey can go on healthcare.gov and put in their zip code to find out who the navigators are in their area. They can call Florida Covering Kids and Families at the University of South Florida. But they need to seek out unbiased, certified, trained people who have information about the law - to be on the safe side.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Forums are being offered around the country about the Affordable Care Act.
