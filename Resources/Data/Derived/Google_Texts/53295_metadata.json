Rand Paul spent his Fri\u00adday speech to the Value Voters Sum\u00admit de\u00adscrib\u00ading a glob\u00adal war on Chris\u00adtian\u00adity. And, the sen\u00adat\u00ador said, we\u2019ve already been vic\u00adtims of this at\u00adtack by rad\u00adic\u00adal Is\u00adlam\u00adists this year.\n\nThe \u201cwar on Chris\u00adtian\u00adity,\u201d Paul said, \u201ccame to Bo\u00adston this year, just in time for the mara\u00adthon.\u201d Paul said the April bomb\u00ading was part of a glob\u00adal re\u00adli\u00adgious at\u00adtack: \u201cYou may ar\u00adgue they\u2019re not tar\u00adget\u00ading Chris\u00adti\u00adans, but they didn\u2019t at\u00adtack a mosque. They came to at\u00adtack our people, a Chris\u00adti\u00adan people.\u201d\n\nThe Ken\u00adtucky Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan ar\u00adgued from the be\u00adgin\u00adning of his speech that Muslim ant\u00adag\u00adon\u00adism to\u00adward Chris\u00adtian\u00adity \u201cshouldn\u2019t be un\u00adder\u00adstated.\u201d Even though Paul ac\u00adknow\u00adledged that rad\u00adic\u00adal Is\u00adlam is just a small fac\u00adtion of the glob\u00adal re\u00adli\u00adgion, it still makes up, Paul says, up to 100 mil\u00adlion people.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s 50 mil\u00adlion, 100 mil\u00adlion, this isn\u2019t go\u00ading to be fought with a con\u00adven\u00adtion\u00adal war. It will re\u00adquire Is\u00adlam to de\u00adfend Is\u00adlam\u201d\u00a6. There are times when mil\u00adit\u00adary ac\u00adtion is jus\u00adti\u00adfied, and ne\u00adces\u00adsary \u201c\u00a6 we must be will\u00ading and able to de\u00adfend ourselves against the ji\u00adhadists.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s main ar\u00adgu\u00adment for fight\u00ading rad\u00adic\u00adal Is\u00adlam con\u00adsisted of strip\u00adping fund\u00ading for Egypt and Pakistan.\n\nPaul did make a point of say\u00ading that Is\u00adlam has non\u00advi\u00adol\u00adent roots that \u201cpaved the way for our en\u00adlight\u00aden\u00adment,\u201d and said that the re\u00adli\u00adgion needs to go back to this.\n\nThe idea that Muslims aren\u2019t look\u00ading out for, or con\u00adcerned with, ex\u00adtrem\u00adism doesn\u2019t really hold up. A spring Pew study found grow\u00ading con\u00adcerns among Muslims in the areas con\u00adnec\u00adted to the Bo\u00adston bomb\u00ading sus\u00adpects about rad\u00adic\u00adal\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion.
