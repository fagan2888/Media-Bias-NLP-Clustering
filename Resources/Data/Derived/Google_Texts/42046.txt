Kanye West is set to perform twice at tonight's 2015 Grammy Awards ceremony, once with Rihanna and Paul McCartney for the trio's new track "FourFiveSeconds," and another performance is rumored to include a new single from the "Yeezus" rapper. In addition to a new rumored track, insiders are also hinting that West may bring daughter North West on stage for the first time, sending fans into a frenzy over the exciting rumor.



Inquisitr reports that although it hasn't been confirmed when West will debut his never-before-seen solo performance, insiders reveal that it wouldn't be out of West-fashion to include his daughter for a buzzworthy performance.



"If his new song, 'Only One,' is any indication, we may see a tender, softer side of 'Ye. The ode to his late mother, Donda West, references wife Kim Kardashian and daughter North (who also stars in the music video), so it's possible the rapper will trade in the usual rants for some tears."



Fans have also looked to Kardashian's social media account for hints regarding her husband's performance, with some claiming that the reality star's photos of her daughter playing the piano in an adorable ballerina outfit may point to her involvement in the performance.



Regardless if baby West will be involved or not, it's undeniable that the iconic rapper will give a buzzworthy performance.



Watch the 57th Annual Grammy Awards tonight starting at 8 PM ET on CBS.
