If so, the National Labor Relations Board says the company would be liable for labor law violations for franchisees, which include 90 percent of McDonald\u2019s U.S. locations.\n\nThe trial has garnered national attention as the outcome will determine how the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s new standards for joint employment defines franchisor-franchisee relationships. Although the ruling will only apply to McDonald\u2019s, critics believe the new standard may pose a threat to the very existence of the franchise model.\n\nNLRB lawyer Jamie Rucker illustrated McDonald\u2019s overarching control over franchisee standards\u2013 from cleaning requirements to the number of seconds for order-taking, even standardized interview question for perspective hires, McDonald\u2019s oversight is omnipresent.\n\nIn 2012 workers began filing complaints at the Washington based NLRB, reporting that McDonald\u2019s and other franchisees surveilled, disciplined, threatened and fired employees for requesting union rights and higher wages.\n\n\u201cIf McDonald\u2019s is involved in determining working conditions at its franchised operations, it is responsible for what happens to workers subject to those conditions,\u201d said Rucker.\n\nA case was eventually consolidated in 2014 after accumulating complaints were received by the NLRB, bringing franchisees in six cities to trial.\n\nWillis Goldsmith, lawyer for McDonald\u2019s, contends that the company \u201cis not now and never has been\u201d a joint employer and that its franchises are independent.\n\nGoldsmith added that McDonald\u2019s does not control workers\u2019 wages, who the franchisees hire nor the scheduling or benefits.\n\nAttorney for New York City franchisees, Robert Brody, defends McDonald\u2019s, saying that while the company provides the \u201ccookbook,\u201d the franchisees are independent in their decisions on employment issues.\n\nIn August, the NLRB expanded standards for joint employment in a landmark decision that involved Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. The new standard allows companies to consider indirect and unexercised control while still being a joint employer, whereas the old standard required the company to have direct control over employment conditions.\n\nIf the trial rules for joint employment it could make negotiating wages and conditions easier for workers as they would be communicating with parent companies directly.\n\nSource: McDonald\u2019s Squares Off Against U.S. Labor Board in Trial\n\nPhoto credit: www.snopes.com\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"description": "after franchisees\u2019 alleged backlash against employees who protested fast-food working conditions.U.S. Labor Board and McDonald\u2019s Trial Over Labor Laws.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Eric Needs", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "after franchisees\u2019 alleged backlash against employees who protested fast-food working conditions.U.S. Labor Board and McDonald\u2019s Trial Over Labor Laws.", "title": "U.S. Labor Board and McDonald\u2019s Trial Over Labor Laws - Legal Reader", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mcdonalds.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-17T12:52:25+00:00", "url": "http://www.legalreader.com/u-s-labor-and-mcdonalds-trial-over-labor-laws/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 1598871133679697}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thelegalreader", "section": "News & Politics", "published_time": "2016-03-12T17:16:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-17T12:52:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17f5\"", "article_summary": "U.S. Labor Board and McDonald\u2019s trial over labor laws after franchisees\u2019 alleged backlash against employees who protested fast-food working conditions.\nIf so, the National Labor Relations Board says the company would be liable for labor law violations for franchisees, which include 90 percent of McDonald\u2019s U.S. locations.\nThe trial has garnered national attention as the outcome will determine how the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s new standards for joint employment defines franchisor-franchisee relationships.\nGoldsmith added that McDonald\u2019s does not control workers\u2019 wages, who the franchisees hire nor the scheduling or benefits.\nSource: McDonald\u2019s Squares Off Against U.S. Labor Board in TrialPhoto credit: www.snopes.comJoin the Discussion"}
