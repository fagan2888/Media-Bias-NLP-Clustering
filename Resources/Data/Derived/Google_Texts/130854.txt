The Kentucky State Police is investigating a single-vehicle, double fatality collision that occurred on KY 507, approximately seven miles north of Elkton, on Saturday, January 3, 2015, at 6:10 a.m.

The preliminary investigation revealed that Scott D. Ferguson, 25, of Elkton, was operating a 2001 Chevrolet Lumina eastbound on KY 507. Darius J. Brewer, 20, of Hopkinsville, was the passenger in the vehicle. As Mr. Ferguson topped a hill crest, he lost control of his vehicle causing it to exit the left side of the roadway and strike an earth embankment. The vehicle continued eastbound, striking a tree, and coming to final rest beside the roadway.

The Todd County Coroner, Timothy Wells, pronounced both Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Brewer deceased at the scene.

Trooper James McArthur is investigating the collision. Sergeant Derek Smith, the Todd County Sheriff’s Department, Todd County Rescue and EMS, Sharon Grove Fire Department, and the Todd County Coroner’s Office assisted at the scene.
