Kandiero noted that a large percentage of the growth in the witch doctor market came from Harare, the nation\u2019s capital, where many who lost their jobs live. Those in more rural areas often live off the land or are self-employed.\n\nKandiero noted also that traditional healers do not merely offer magic services, but \u201ccounseling\u201d for those who need to discuss their misfortunes. This counseling may be used to substitute, but is unlike, Western psychological therapy. He added that healers are used to seeing clients for help with job interviews, or individuals seeking promotions or help getting out of trouble at work. The volume of clients looking for help finding work, however, is not normal.\n\nThousands of workers\u2013estimated between 25,000 to 30,000\u2013lost their jobs following the Supreme Court ruling, which decreed that employers were not obligated to offer severance pay. Zimbabwe has an 80 percent unemployment rate, according to Reuters, but employers are also strapped for cash due to hyperinflation and an extremely weak economy. The ruling allowed indebted employers to find new ways to save money, even if that meant downsizing their business. Many shops and restaurants struggle to pay electric bills and keep inventory stocked, much less pay their workers.\n\n\u201cMore than 20,000 workers have lost their jobs due to the Supreme Court ruling and as a union we are worried that if the situation is not urgently addressed more workers will continue to lose their jobs,\u201d Japhet Moyo, secretary general of the main Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, told Reuters in July. The Trade Union has also reported that numerous deaths related to the stress of losing jobs have been reported to their officials.\n\nDictator Robert Mugabe had vowed to create 2 million jobs during the last round of \u201celections\u201d in 2013.\n\nZimbabwean politicians are now struggling to pass legislation that will help undo the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. A number of amendments have been introduced to a new labor law this week that would force employers who have fired workers following the court decision to provide each worker with two weeks\u2019 severance pay. This provision is among the most controversial, as many argue that it would further cripple businesses and cost more jobs in the long-term.\n\nThe strength of Zimbabwe\u2019s currency has hit unprecedented lows this year. In June, Zimbabwe announced it would begin to trade its dollars for U.S. dollars. While hyperinflation had hit 500 billion percent as early as 2008, it had somehow grown from there. At the time, 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars would yield $5 American.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Supreme Court decision allowing employers to fire workers with only three months' notice has led to a boom in the witch doctor industry.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "A Supreme Court decision allowing employers to fire workers with only three months' notice has led to a boom in the witch doctor industry.", "title": "Witch Doctor Business Booms as 30,000 Lose Jobs in Zimbabwe", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/witch-doctor-getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-09-11T12:28:51-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/09/11/witch-doctor-business-booms-as-30000-lose-jobs-in-zimbabwe/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Supreme Court decision allowing employers to fire workers with only three months' notice has led to a boom in the witch doctor industry.", "title": "Witch Doctor Business Booms as 30,000 Lose Jobs in Zimbabwe", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/witch-doctor-getty.jpg", "creator": "@francesmartel", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Africa, economy, Robert Mugabe, witch doctors, zimbabwe,National Security, Weird News,Witch Doctor", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-09-11T10:54:37-07:00", "section": "National Security", "modified_time": "2015-09-11T12:28:51-07:00", "tag": "zimbabwe", "categories": "National Security,Weird News"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Kandiero noted that a large percentage of the growth in the witch doctor market came from Harare, the nation\u2019s capital, where many who lost their jobs live.\nThousands of workers\u2013estimated between 25,000 to 30,000\u2013lost their jobs following the Supreme Court ruling, which decreed that employers were not obligated to offer severance pay.\nMany shops and restaurants struggle to pay electric bills and keep inventory stocked, much less pay their workers.\nThe ruling allowed indebted employers to find new ways to save money, even if that meant downsizing their business.\nDictator Robert Mugabe had vowed to create 2 million jobs during the last round of \u201celections\u201d in 2013."}
