Those people will want medical care, which means the demand for all health care services will only continue to rise.\u201d\n\nKimball said it is important to understand the differences between urgent care and emergency centers prior to seeking medical care.\n\nUrgent care centers accommodate patients with minor conditions, such as sprains, the flu, colds, infections and minor stitches. Freestanding emergency centers or hospital-based emergency rooms should only be visited in the event of a life-threatening situation, Kimball said.\n\nEmergency centers\n\nHealth care providers, such as the North Cypress Medical Center and Houston Methodist Hospital System, made efforts in 2015 to better serve Cypress residents by opening emergency care centers in the area.\n\nNorth Cypress Medical Center opened two centers targeting major master-planned communities. An ER and imaging center set to serve Towne Lake residents opened on Barker Cypress Road on May 4, and another stand-alone ER opened Oct. 5 on Mason Road to serve Fairfield residents.\n\nThe Fairfield location includes a physicians plaza, emergency care and outpatient imaging lab. The Towne Lake center offers outpatient testing and radiology services and includes 20,000 square feet of office space, separating it from typical ERs.\n\n\u201cIt is an emergency room, but it really addresses a number of different needs a community might have,\u201d said Dr. Mounang Desai with North Cypress Medical Center.\n\nHouston Methodist opened its emergency care center Nov. 3 on the Hwy. 290 frontage road near the intersection of Fairfield Creek. Farther up the road, a First Choice Emergency Room is under construction in the Fairfield Towne Center.\n\nThe Houston Methodist ECC opening marks the first major effort by the hospital system to reach Cypress beyond its Willowbrook Hospital. ECC Manager Carly Espinosa said by offering pharmacy services, outpatient imaging and CT scanning on a 64-slice scanner, Houston Methodist will distinguish its center from independent competitors in the area.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of saturation in the market,\u201d she said. \u201cI think our honest business practices will bring people here. This is an outlet to give Willowbrook a release and serve those who decide to choose Houston Methodist.\u201d\n\nUrgent care centers\n\nSeveral urgent care centers have opened in Cy-Fair over the past year, including a Cy-Fair Medical Center Urgent Care on West Road in December 2014 and a RediClinic on Spring Cypress Road in January.\n\n\u201cTraditional ERs serve an important purpose, but urgent cares are a more convenient option for certain needs, often available at a cost five to 10 times less,\u201d said Dr. Juliet Breeze, founder of Next Level Urgent Care.\n\nAn average visit to an urgent care center is roughly $155 compared to $750 to $1,250 for a typical ER visit, Kimball said. Wait times can vary from a few minutes to several hours.\n\nUrgent care facilities, emergency rooms and hospitals all serve a different purpose, said Scott Barbe, CEO of the Memorial Hermann Cypress Hospital under construction on\n\nHwy. 290. With Phase 1 of the project set to open next spring\u2014a convenient care center catering to both urgent and not-so-urgent needs\u2014Barbe said he is not concerned about the prospect of an overabundance of options opening in the area.\n\n\u201cI think the comprehensive nature of services behind one door will make us very attractive,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "November 18, 2015: The health care landscape is continuing to expand in the Cy-Fair area with a number of new emergency centers popping up over the past year. \u201cThe number of", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Community Impact Newspaper", "description": "November 18, 2015: The health care landscape is continuing to expand in the Cy-Fair area with a number of new emergency centers popping up over the past year. \u201cThe number of", "title": "Health care providers launch emergency centers in Cypress | Community Impact Newspaper", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://communityimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CYF-2015-11-37-11-460x584.jpg", "url": "https://communityimpact.com/houston/healthcare/2015/11/18/health-care-providers-launch-emergency-centers-in-cypress/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "November 18, 2015: The health care landscape is continuing to expand in the Cy-Fair area with a number of new emergency centers popping up over the past year. \u201cThe number of", "creator": "@impactnews_cyf", "image": "http://communityimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CYF-2015-11-37-11-460x584.jpg", "title": "Health care providers launch emergency centers in Cypress | Community Impact Newspaper", "site": "@impactnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "robots": "noodp", "bitly-verification": "6bcd44a334c1", "p": {"domain_verify": "586ad831859a33caa88da9358144e4cd"}, "fb": {"admins": 10203978947544147}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "local, news, community impact, impact news, Cy-Fair, Houston Metro, business, city, county, dining, development, education, transportation, real estate, elections, nonprofit, guides, housing, health care, water, neighborhoods vote, employment, parks, recreation, arts, entertainment", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CommunityImpact", "section": "Cy-Fair", "tag": "Urgent Care Association of America", "published_time": "2015-11-18T15:21:54-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CommunityImpactCyFair"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "news_keywords": "cy-fair health care directory 2015, cy-fair november 2015, emergency centers, houston methodist hospital system, north cypress medical center, urgent care association of america, local news, community impact, impact news"}, "article_summary": "Emergency centersHealth care providers, such as the North Cypress Medical Center and Houston Methodist Hospital System, made efforts in 2015 to better serve Cypress residents by opening emergency care centers in the area.\nThose people will want medical care, which means the demand for all health care services will only continue to rise.\u201dKimball said it is important to understand the differences between urgent care and emergency centers prior to seeking medical care.\nFreestanding emergency centers or hospital-based emergency rooms should only be visited in the event of a life-threatening situation, Kimball said.\nUrgent care centers accommodate patients with minor conditions, such as sprains, the flu, colds, infections and minor stitches.\n\u201cThe number of urgent care centers across the country has increased over the past decade and more will continue to open,\u201d said Dr. Robert Kimball, president of the board for the Urgent Care Association of America."}
