One doesn\u2019t have to be a seasoned technical analyst to see that the stock has emphatically broken out from the downtrend it has suffered through for the last 15 years.\n\nGE\u2019s stock GE, +0.80% soared 11% Friday to close at the highest level since Sept. 8, 2008. Volume, which technicians view as a validator of a stocks rally -- the more the better -- was 351.1 million shares, or 10 times the full-day average, according to FactSet.\n\n\u201cThis is very good in the bigger scheme of things, for the company and the stock,\u201d said Mark Newton, partner and chief technical analyst at Greywolf Execution Partners. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see fundamentals and technicals both support this nice move.\u201d\n\nEven on a shorter-term basis, the chart looks pretty bullish, as the stock has broken out from the downward sloping channel it has been following the last 16 months.\n\nFactSet GE changes the channel pattern to bullish\n\nWhile the stock could see some minor weakness in the near term after such a big rally on Friday, Newton believes that would just provide a better buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFor now, a structurally significant move out of GE today, and for those who hold [the stock], it looks premature to sell, and would use any weakness down under $27 to $26.50 to buy,\u201d Newton said.\n\nHis intermediate-term target for the stock is around $33, which is 16% above Friday\u2019s closing price. That level represents the half-way-back point of the stock\u2019s decline from its all-time intraday high of $60.50 reached on Aug. 28, 2000 and its Great Recession low of $5.73 hit on March 4, 2009.\n\nThe next retracement target, based on the Fibonacci, or golden ratio, of 0.618, would take GE up to about $40, or 40% above current levels.
