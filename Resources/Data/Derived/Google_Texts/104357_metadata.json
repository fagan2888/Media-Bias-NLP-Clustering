He said his efforts would be a total waste if he doesn\u2019t take the White House.\n\n\u201cI really feel that if I don\u2019t win I can\u2019t make the difference,\u201d Mr. Trump told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to bring back trade. We\u2019re not going to straighten out our military. We\u2019re not going to get rid of Obamacare and come up with a real health care plan.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Rubio says voters will swing his way, knocks Cruz on phone-snooping\n\nMr. Trump has led the GOP field for months but is in a horse race with Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, for the Feb. 1 contest in Iowa, and he might come up short.\n\nMr. Cruz leads Mr. Trump by four points among likely caucus-goers, 28 percent to 24 percent, according to a NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Sunday.\n\n\u201cI hope I win Iowa. If I don\u2019t win, I mean, you know, that can also happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I go right to New Hampshire, where we\u2019re doing great. I go right to South Carolina, where we\u2019re doing great. We go into Nevada where we\u2019re leading big.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Bernie Sanders changes course, attacks Hillary Clinton directly but politely\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Trump is raising questions about Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility for the presidency because he was born in Canada.\n\nMany scholars believe Mr. Cruz is a \u201cnatural-born citizen\u201d because he was born to an American mother. Others, particularly some of Mr. Cruz\u2019s GOP rivals for president, say it\u2019s still an open question.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only saying that Ted has to get this problem solved because if he\u2019s running against a Democrat, and they bring a lawsuit, he\u2019s got a hell of a thing over his head,\u201d Mr. Trump told Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe businessman insisted he was only responding to questions in the media, and not needling Mr. Cruz under the guise of wanting to help him down the road.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trolling,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile it is a trifling topic for some, the issue has amused liberals who felt Hawaii-born President Obama had been unfairly attacked by Mr. Trump and other \u201cbirthers\u201d who demanded to see his birth certificate. It\u2019s also forced other Republicans to weigh in.\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, said Mr. Cruz is obviously a U.S. citizen, but the Constitution\u2019s call for a \u201cnatural born\u201d candidate could pose an open legal question for Mr. Cruz, should he become the nominee. He said the Supreme Court may have to settle the issue if Democrats sue.\n\n\u201cHe would be the first president not born in the United States, and so that alone would be extraordinary,\u201d Mr. Paul told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation.\n\nMr. Cruz said Sunday the law is straightforward, and he won\u2019t engage in personal attacks with other candidates. He cast the recent barbs as a badge of honor.\n\n\u201cThree weeks ago, almost every Republican candidate was attacking Donald Trump,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cToday, almost every Republican candidate is attacking me. And that kind of suggests maybe something has changed in the race.\u201d\n\nThe Senate passed a resolution in 2008 to declare then-nominee Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who was born in the Panama Canal Zone, a \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d eligible for the presidency.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican who\u2019s frequently sparred with Mr. Cruz, said he doesn\u2019t want to wade into the race this time around.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think the Senate ought to get into the middle of this,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cThese guys will all slug it out in Iowa and New Hampshire. We\u2019ll have a nominee hopefully by sometime in the spring.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Businessman Donald Trump on Sunday said he's got the momentum to win the GOP presidential nomination regardless of whether he finishes first in Iowa and again questioned his top rival's eligibility for the office.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Businessman Donald Trump on Sunday said he\u2019s got the momentum to win the GOP presidential nomination regardless of whether he finishes first in Iowa and again questioned his top rival\u2019s eligibility for the office.", "title": "Ted Cruz leads in Iowa as \u2018birther\u2019 talk intensifies", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/10/ted-cruz-leads-in-iowa-as-birther-talk-intensifies/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/08/GOP_2016_Cruz.JPEG-0108c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/08/GOP_2016_Cruz.JPEG-0108c.jpg", "description": "Businessman Donald Trump on Sunday said he's got the momentum to win the GOP presidential nomination regardless of whether he finishes first in Iowa and again questioned his top rival's eligibility fo", "card": "summary", "title": "Ted Cruz leads in Iowa as \u2018birther\u2019 talk intensifies"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Human Interest, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Cruz leads Mr. Trump by four points among likely caucus-goers, 28 percent to 24 percent, according to a NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Sunday.\nMr. Cruz said Sunday the law is straightforward, and he won\u2019t engage in personal attacks with other candidates.\n\u201cI really feel that if I don\u2019t win I can\u2019t make the difference,\u201d Mr. Trump told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\nSen.
