Federer also put together record Slam runs of 10 finals and 23 semifinals in a row when he was at his dominant best.\n\nNow the 32-year-old Federer has bowed out before the quarterfinals at three of the last four majors.\n\n\u201cI think it was the biggest, probably, win of my career,\u201d said Gulbis, who most certainly could have dispensed with the word \u201cprobably.\u201d\n\nAddressing spectators who sang Federer\u2019s first name between points, Gulbis said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry I had to win. I know all of you like Roger.\u201d\n\nThe fourth-seeded Federer\u2019s resume includes the 2009 French Open title, and he was a four-time runner-up in Paris to Rafael Nadal. But Federer was hardly in top form Sunday, making 59 unforced errors and getting broken twice while serving for a set.\n\nThat included at 5-3, 40-15 in the second, when Federer sent an overhead right to Gulbis, who whipped a backhand passing winner.\n\n\u201cI was lucky, I have to say,\u201d Gulbis said about that point. \u201cI was really lucky.\u201d\n\nSaid Federer: \u201cThings got tough from then on for, like, a half-hour for me.\u201d\n\nHe lost the last five points of the second-set tiebreaker, then dropped the third set, too.\n\nAnother key moment came when Gulbis left the court with a trainer to take a medical timeout while trailing 5-2 in the fourth. As he walked out, Gulbis motioned to Federer, as if asking for permission to go. When Gulbis returned, some fans jeered and whistled at him, and he pointed to his lower back as if to say, \u201cHey, I was injured.\u201d\n\nAt his news conference, Federer alternated between sounding a little perturbed about the lengthy intermission \u2014 and resigned to the idea that what Gulbis did was within the rules.\n\n\u201cIn the past, I guess, it\u2019s been abused much more than today, but still, what can you tell?\u201d Federer said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look hurt in any way. But if you can use it, you know, might as well do it.\u201d\n\nGulbis\u2019 strokes had momentarily gone astray before that break, but afterward, the 25-year-old Gulbis once again displayed the big-hitting tennis that had many marking him as a future star when he was a teenager. He won 10 of the next 12 points, punctuating shots with exhales that sounded like growls.\n\nThe fifth set was all Gulbis, who hadn\u2019t been to the quarterfinals at a major tournament since the 2008 French Open. He\u2019s spoken openly about focusing more on enjoying the nightlife than perfecting his craft, and drew attention last week for saying he wouldn\u2019t encourage his younger sisters to pursue professional tennis because a woman \u201cneeds to think about family, needs to think about kids.\u201d\n\nIn the concluding set, Gulbis raced to a 3-0 lead, thanks largely to Federer miscues. In the second game, Federer netted backhands and forehands to offer up break points, then pushed a forehand wide to give Gulbis a lead he never relinquished.\n\nAfter that miss, Federer grabbed a ball and swatted it in anger straight up in the air, a rare sign of exasperation from him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s Roger Federer, but he also gets tight, you know,\u201d Gulbis said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably going to make (that forehand) seven out of 10 (times). Other guys are going to make two out of 10. Mistakes happen.\u201d\n\nThe result fit with the topsy-turvy nature of this tournament: Both reigning Australian Open champions, No. 3 Stan Wawrinka and No. 2 Li Na, lost in the first round; No. 1 Serena Williams left in the second round.\n\nGulbis now plays No. 6 Tomas Berdych, who eliminated the last American man, No. 10 John Isner. In another quarterfinal, No. 2 Novak Djokovic will face No. 8 Milos Raonic. Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and No. 24 Fernando Verdasco set up a fourth-round meeting by finishing off victories in matches suspended Saturday night because of fading light.\n\nIn women\u2019s action, No. 18 Eugenie Bouchard of Canada swept No. 8 Angelique Kerber of Germany 6-1, 6-2 and will face No. 14 Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain in the quarterfinals.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Roger Federer leaves French Open with \u201ca lot of regrets\u201d", "title": "Roger Federer leaves French Open with \u201ca lot of regrets\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/01/roger-federer-leaves-french-open-with-a-lot-of-regrets/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140601__federerp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140601__federerp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-01T12:19:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T04:53:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7c6\"", "article_summary": "Another key moment came when Gulbis left the court with a trainer to take a medical timeout while trailing 5-2 in the fourth.\nPARIS \u2014 So unbeatable for so long until the closing days of Grand Slam tournaments, Roger Federer is suddenly accumulating early exits.\nThe fifth set was all Gulbis, who hadn\u2019t been to the quarterfinals at a major tournament since the 2008 French Open.\nThat included at 5-3, 40-15 in the second, when Federer sent an overhead right to Gulbis, who whipped a backhand passing winner.\nNow the 32-year-old Federer has bowed out before the quarterfinals at three of the last four majors."}
