It’s safe to say that President Obama became the first president ever to discuss feminine care products before a live audience Friday.

During an interview in the East Room, YouTube personality Ingrid Nilson asked Mr. Obama why “pads, tampons and other menstrual products are taxed as luxury goods in 40 states.”

“I don’t know anyone who has a period who thinks it’s a luxury,” said Ms. Nilson, who has nearly 4 million subscribers to her YouTube channel under the name “Miss Glamorazzi.”

Mr. Obama replied, “I think that’s fair to say. Michelle would agree with you.”

“Why do these items continue to be taxed?” Ms. Nilson asked.

“I have to tell you, I have no idea why states would tax these as luxury items,” Mr. Obama said. “I suspect it’s because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed.”

He said it would be “pretty sensible for women in those states … to work to get those taxes removed.”

“Those aren’t federal taxes, those are state taxes,” the president added.

Mr. Obama went on to say that one of the primary features of Obamacare is to make sure that women are not discriminated against in the health-care marketplace.
