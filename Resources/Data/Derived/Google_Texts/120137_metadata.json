Small businesses were reconstituted as those having 100 employees or fewer.\n\n\u201cThe federal Affordable Care Act created various unintended consequences that both businesses and consumers continue to run up against,\u201d Senate Insurance Committee Chairman James L. Seward said in a statement. \u201cMy legislation would help clear up one of those costly regulatory hurdles for mid-sized employers and help them continue to offer affordable health insurance benefits to their workers.\u201d\n\nBusinesses that have 100 or fewer employees have experienced a substantial increase in health costs. They\u2019ve experienced this rise in health costs through higher deductibles, co-pays and subscriber costs, according to the sponsors of the bill.\n\nThe measure would reverse New York\u2019s \u201csmall business\u201d definition back to what it previously was, which was between one and 50 employees.\n\nThe senate passed four other measures, including a legislation that would require state agencies to pay back small businesses within 15 days of a sent invoice. State agencies have a year to implement these changes.\n\nThe other measure is one that would establish a Task Force for the Review of the State Administrative Procedure Act (SAPA) to reduce state regulatory burdens on businesses. The task force would examine and evaluate SAPA and make recommendations for changes.\n\nThe two final measures establish a law that creates additional opportunities for small businesses, while the other gives a way for businesses to seek a delay in the proposed state agency payment measure if it negatively affects them.\n\nThe bills have been sent to the Assembly, with the exception of the state agency payment measure. That has been sent to the governor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe passage of these bills sends a clear signal that my colleagues in the Senate recognize the need for serious regulatory reform for our state,\u201d Senator Terrence Murphy said in a statement. \u201cThe burden placed on the business community by the layers of bureaucracy needs to significantly reduced if we are going to elevate New York to the prominence it once held as an economic juggernaut.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Small businesses were reconstituted as those having 100 employees or fewer.\nThe measure would reverse New York\u2019s \u201csmall business\u201d definition back to what it previously was, which was between one and 50 employees.\nThe New York State Senate passed a series of legislation on Wednesday, which includes a measure that would reverse state regulations that reconstitute what a small business was, driving up healthcare costs.\nThe senate passed four other measures, including a legislation that would require state agencies to pay back small businesses within 15 days of a sent invoice.\nThe other measure is one that would establish a Task Force for the Review of the State Administrative Procedure Act (SAPA) to reduce state regulatory burdens on businesses."}
