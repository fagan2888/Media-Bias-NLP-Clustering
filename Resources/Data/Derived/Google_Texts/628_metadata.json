Sanders' campaign has tried to link Clinton to Wall Street financiers by highlighting speeches she delivered at their companies and for taking campaign contributions from them.\n\n\u201cNot everything is about an economic theory,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIf we broke up banks tomorrow \u2013 and I will if they deserve it, if they pose systemic risk, I will \u2013 would that end racism? Would that end sexism? Would that end discrimination against the LGBT community? Would that make people feel more welcoming to immigrants overnight?\u201d\n\n\u201cI also will not you make you promises I can\u2019t keep,\u201d she said.\n\nAntipathy toward Wall Street appeared to be not as vehement among Clinton\u2019s supporters as it is among Sanders'.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t hate Wall Street,\u201d said David Kolbe, political and legislative director for an iron-workers union that is affiliated with AFL-CIO and had endorsed Clinton.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have major industries building manufacturing plants or offices, we\u2019re not working,\u201d he said while waiting for Clinton to arrive.\n\n\u201cThey [financiers] have to prosper, but it\u2019s got to be a shared prosperity that skilled work has to be paid for,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cMy opponent wants us to start all over again.&quot;", "title": "In Nevada, Clinton hits Sanders' campaign promises", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-las-vegas-219243", "image": "http://static.politico.com/a1/a8/1291dc364aeba8a5dfe5c244ff7b/160213-clinton-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "\u201cMy opponent wants us to start all over again.&quot;", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| AP Photo In Nevada, Clinton hits Sanders' campaign promisesLAS VEGAS -- Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton on Saturday defined herself as a progressive while attacking rival Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign platform as unrealistic.\nSanders' campaign has tried to link Clinton to Wall Street financiers by highlighting speeches she delivered at their companies and for taking campaign contributions from them.\nIn a 15-minute speech at a union hall in a suburb of Las Vegas, Clinton painted Sanders as a scorched-earth candidate who cannot accomplish what he\u2019s saying.\nAntipathy toward Wall Street appeared to be not as vehement among Clinton\u2019s supporters as it is among Sanders'.\n\u201cNot everything is about an economic theory,\u201d Clinton said."}
