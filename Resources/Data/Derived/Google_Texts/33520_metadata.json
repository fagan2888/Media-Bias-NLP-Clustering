But the Urban Institute says that 40% of Americans don't know they're about to get hit with the ACA tax, payable when filing their 2014 taxes.\n\nThe penalty is $95 per uninsured adult ($47.50 per uninsured child), or 1% of household income, whichever is higher. The tax rises significantly in 2015 to a $325 fine or 2% of your annual income, whichever is higher.Signing up late also doesn't mean you avoid a 2015 tax penalty, Smola notes. \"You may still owe a partial penalty based on the number of months [you] were uninsured,\" he says.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Americans who owe an ACA tax penalty can takes steps to stop the pain with this extension.", "author": "Brian O'Connell", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Americans who owe an ACA tax penalty can takes steps to stop the pain with this extension.", "title": "Tax Season Extension Gives You Another Chance at Obamacare", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/tax-season-extension-gives-you-another-chance-at-obamacare", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/taxforms2.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/taxforms2.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Taxes", "keywords": "ACA, ACA penalty, ACA tax penalty, health care insurance, health care tax, CMC, Urban Institute, GetInsured, health care, health care tax, health care taxes, special enrollment period,", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Taxes", "tag": "", "published_time": "2015-02-26T09:45Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/459200"}, "date": "2015-02-26T09:45Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13058430, "twitter": {"description": "Americans who owe an ACA tax penalty can takes steps to stop the pain with this extension.", "title": "Tax Season Extension Gives You Another Chance at Obamacare", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/tax-season-extension-gives-you-another-chance-at-obamacare", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/taxforms2.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/taxforms2.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ACA, ACA penalty, ACA tax penalty, health care insurance, health care tax, CMC, Urban Institute, GetInsured, health care, health care tax, health care taxes, special enrollment period,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd28\"", "article_summary": "Under the Affordable Care Act, adults have to sign up for health insurance or pay a tax penalty.\nThe tax rises significantly in 2015 to a $325 fine or 2% of your annual income, whichever is higher.Signing up late also doesn't mean you avoid a 2015 tax penalty, Smola notes.\n\"At least for this year, tax season will bring many Americans a last-minute chance to get enrolled, and that's great news,\" says Egon Smola, senior vice president and general manager of consumer business at GetInsured, a cloud-based health insurance exchange platform.\nThe penalty is $95 per uninsured adult ($47.50 per uninsured child), or 1% of household income, whichever is higher.\n\"You may still owe a partial penalty based on the number of months [you] were uninsured,\" he says."}
