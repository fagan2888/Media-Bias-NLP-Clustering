It helped bring Poland into the European Union, sent troops to Iraq and let the CIA operate a secret prison for terror suspects.\n\nToday the Democratic Left Alliance \u2014 heir to the Cold War-era\u2019s Communists \u2014 is fighting for its very existence. Corruption scandals and a failure to inspire young voters have eroded its standing, leaving Poland\u2019s political scene without a viable center-left party.\n\nWith presidential and parliamentary elections coming up this year, the left-wing party\u2019s leader, Leszek Miller, has gambled on an unknown and untested presidential candidate to reverse the party\u2019s sharp decline: Magdalena Ogorek, a 36-year-old former bit-part actress and TV presenter with striking good looks \u2014 whom some Poles dub a \u201cBarbie\u201d candidate. While Ogorek has a doctorate in history, she has virtually no political experience.\n\nThe 68-year-old Miller says he is counting on her youth and energy to attract new voters to the party, whose ranks include many former communists like himself \u2014 a major factor in the party\u2019s decline in this young, Western-looking democracy.\n\nSo far the tactic seems to be backfiring. Ogorek has attracted the praise of Playboy and other men\u2019s magazines thanks to her looks, but many Poles, even the party\u2019s traditional supporters, say Miller has made the party look foolish by choosing an unknown candidate without political experience to compete for the prestigious position, a job once held by Solidarity founder Lech Walesa.\n\n\u201cThis is a disaster \u2014 it shows the party has no serious program,\u201d said Stanislaw Mrowczynski, a physics professor who has supported the party in the past but won\u2019t vote for Ogorek. \u201cFor me this is like a cabaret. She isn\u2019t a serious candidate.\u201d\n\nHe and many other left-leaning Poles are hugely frustrated because they would like a strong left-wing party to stand up for secular causes in this largely Roman Catholic country. They say a progressive force is needed to work for a better health care system, women\u2019s rights, and other issues of social justice. Instead, the Democratic Left Alliance\u2019s support (in coalition with a smaller left-wing party) has dropped from more than 41 percent in 2001 to less than 9 percent in local elections in November.\n\nConservatives have controlled the government and the presidency since 2005.\n\nToday both the ruling party, Civic Platform, and the main opposition party, Law and Justice, are broadly conservative. Both have succeeded in siphoning off some of the left\u2019s supporters, Civic Platform by embracing liberal positions on some issues, like in vitro fertilization; Law and Justice by advocating a stronger welfare state along with conservative pro-Catholic values.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Poland\u2019s \u2018Barbie\u2019 candidate dashes hope for left\u2019s revival", "title": "Poland\u2019s \u2018Barbie\u2019 candidate dashes hope for left\u2019s revival", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Poland\u2019s \u2018Barbie\u2019 candidate dashes hope for left\u2019s revival", "title": "Poland\u2019s \u2018Barbie\u2019 candidate dashes hope for left\u2019s revival", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/28/polands_barbie_candidate_dashes_hope_for_lefts_revival/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/poland-no-left-wing.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Poland\u2019s \u2018Barbie\u2019 candidate dashes hope for left\u2019s revival", "title": "Poland\u2019s \u2018Barbie\u2019 candidate dashes hope for left\u2019s revival", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/poland-no-left-wing.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Vanessa Gera", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca2c5\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsWARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Poland\u2019s main left-wing party was once a major player.\nCorruption scandals and a failure to inspire young voters have eroded its standing, leaving Poland\u2019s political scene without a viable center-left party.\nInstead, the Democratic Left Alliance\u2019s support (in coalition with a smaller left-wing party) has dropped from more than 41 percent in 2001 to less than 9 percent in local elections in November.\nToday both the ruling party, Civic Platform, and the main opposition party, Law and Justice, are broadly conservative.\nToday the Democratic Left Alliance \u2014 heir to the Cold War-era\u2019s Communists \u2014 is fighting for its very existence."}
