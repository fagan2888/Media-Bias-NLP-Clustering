Bush's brother.\n\nIn a breaking Borowitz Report , Andy Borowitz explains the reasons for this development:\n\n\"No longer being related to his brother is a key step to clearing Jeb's path to the nomination,\" an aide said on New Year's Day. \"We expect his poll numbers to soar on this.\"\n\nAccording to the aide, the former Florida governor resigned his post as brother in a 10-minute phone call with George W. Bush, after which he blocked the former President's phone number and e-mail address.\n\nIn an official statement, George W. Bush said that he \"understands and supports\" his former brother's decision.\n\n\"If I were him, I would no longer be related to me either,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A sure sign that former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is planning to do more than just \"explore\" a run for the White House in 2016 is the fact that he is sev...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-01-03 11:02:10 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "A sure sign that former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is planning to do more than just \"explore\" a run for the White House in 2016 is the fact that he is sev...", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dorian-de-wind/jeb-bush-severing-problem_b_6406916.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2448758/images/o-JEB-BUSH-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2448758/images/o-JEB-BUSH-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A sure sign that former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is planning to do more than just \"explore\" a run for the White House in 2016 is the fact that he is sev..."}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-02 11:02:10 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6406916", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "political satire,jeb bush 2016,George W.
