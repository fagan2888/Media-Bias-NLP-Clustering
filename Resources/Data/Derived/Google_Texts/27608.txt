“Real Time” host Bill Maher — himself a Bernie Sanders supporter who says he would just as easily vote for Hillary Clinton in the general election to prevent a President Trump — last night railed against the #BernieOrBust movement, whose adherents promise to stay home in November (or vote third-party) if Sanders isn’t on the ballot.

When Elizabeth Warren failed to endorse Sanders, Maher explained, her Facebook page was “bombarded” with angry messages from Bernie supporters.

“Really? Elizabeth Warren is the enemy now?” Maher said. “She’s helped more millennials than Adderall.”
