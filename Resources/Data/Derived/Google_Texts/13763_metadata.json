Justice Scalia has never been shy on the bench, but as he approaches the end of his third decade on the court, he is letting loose to a degree that is surprising even for him. Some say the Ronald Reagan appointee may even be growing a touch unhinged.\n\nIn his dissents last week to the same-sex marriage and Obamacare rulings, Justice Scalia was in rare form. The case for gay marriage offered by Justice Kennedy is \u201clacking even a thin veneer of law,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI would hide my head in a bag,\u201d he declared, if he ever joined an opinion as weak as Justice Kennedy\u2019s. \u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.\u201d\n\nThis culinary metaphor followed up one that provoked hilarity on social media a day earlier in the case upholding the health-insurance subsidy scheme in Obamacare. Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 rationale for resisting the challengers\u2019 claims, Justice Scalia charged, was \u201cpure applesauce.\u201d The only way the majority could conclude the subsidies were kosher was through \u201cinterpretive jiggery-pokery,\u201d a late-19th-century term meaning \u201cdeceitful or dishonest behavior.\u201d The chief justice, in other words, is nothing short of a lying, cunning rogue.\n\nThis term, nobody has escaped a prick from one of Justice Scalia's barbs. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito stood accused of \"text-free broadening\" of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when he deigned to concur with the Court's holding in Young v. UPS, a pregnancy-discrimination case. Even Clarence Thomas, with whom the Sicilian justice concurred in 95 percent of the 5-4 rulings this term, got some abuse. In Zivotofsky v. Kerry, a separation of powers case, Justice Scalia wrote that his friend had \u201cturn[ed] the Constitution upside-down\u201d and envisioned \u201ca presidency more reminiscent of [King] George III than George Washington.\"\n\nWhy do all the justices just stand there and take this abuse? Maybe the Other Eight are taking the civil high ground to avoid descending into intra-bench smack-talk, saving the court from looking like a bunch of buffoons to the American public. Or maybe they simply lack the chops to compete with Scalia\u2019s rhetorical flourishes. (All Justice Thomas could muster in response to Scalia's takedown of his approach to Zivotofsky was that his dissent \u201craises more questions than it answers.\u201d Not the very snappiest of retorts.)\n\nOf all the good reasons not to try to match Scalia\u2019s crass insults jiggery for pokery or argle for bargle, the best is that you will lose. But at some point, one of the other justices will get so mad that he or she just won\u2019t be able to take it anymore. And if words fail them while in their jurisprudential rage, they may be advised to take a cue from one of Scalia\u2019s most recent sarcastic bouts, a concurrence in a death penalty drug case in which he ridicules Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for \u201cwaving over their heads a ream of the most recent abolitionist studies (a superabundant genre) as though they have discovered the lost folios of Shakespeare.\u201d\n\nThat is the ticket: No one ever penned so many biting, creative insults as William Shakespeare. Here are a few hand-selected moments of invective from the Bard\u2019s words that may prove useful (some come directly from his plays, others from this handy insult generator):\n\nDraw your neck out of your collar. Degenerate and base art thou. Thou caluminous idle-headed nut-hook! Thou gleeking idle-headed hugger-mugger! Thou pribbling hell-hated clack-dish! Thou odiferous fat-kidneyed foot-licker! Truly thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side. Thou art as loathsome as a toad. Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbunkle in my corrupted blood. Peace, ye fat guts.\n\nAnd my personal favorite:\n\nThere is no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune.\n\nOr the justices might take a line from Stephen Colbert, who responded to Scalia\u2019s \u201cbag in a head\u201d insult by saying, \u201cI could\u2019ve sworn he was already hiding his head in a flesh-toned cinch sack.\"\n\nImage credit: Wikipedia\n\nFollow @stevenmazie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "antonin scalia,gay marriage,humor,insults,Justice Scalia,Obamacare,shakespearean insults,supreme court,william shakespeare,Arts & Entertainment,Politics,Society & Culture", "author": "Steven Mazie", "og": {"site_name": "Big Think", "description": "The final weeks of the 2014-2015 Supreme Court term brought us a bumper crop of quotable lines from the ever-cantankerous Antonin Scalia.
