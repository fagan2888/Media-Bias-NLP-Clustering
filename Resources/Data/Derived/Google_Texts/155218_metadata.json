He has changed from being a hater, of sorts, to being a fan, and his obsessiveness has cost him his job.\n\nWe learn that Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) has been cleared of all of the charges that Moriarty had built up, but sadly, it\u2019s too late \u2014 or is it? If Sherlock is dead, it is too late \u2014 but, if he were to suddenly show up, alive, of course it wouldn\u2019t be too late a tall.\n\nThen, we see Sherlock Holmes tortured by a Serbian, or someone who speaks a Slavic language in one of the episode\u2019s opening scenes. Then, his brother, Mycroft (Mark Gatiss) , discovers him and \u201crescues\u201d him, though Sherlock tells Mycroft that he didn\u2019t need to be rescued, and had everything under control.\n\nDr. John Watson has decided to move back to 221 Baker Street. He has a mustache now. Mrs. Hudson tells him that the mustache \u201cages\u201d him, and asks him why he didn\u2019t make her a phone call; he says that it became more and more difficult for him to do so, with time.\n\nMycroft tells Sherlock that he meets with Watson once a week on Fridays for \u201cfish and chips,\u201d during the two years since Holmes\u2019 apparent death, but that he hasn\u2019t told him yet that Sherlock Holmes is still alive.\n\nWatson tells Mrs. Hudson that he\u2019s \u201cmoving on\u201d that he\u2019s found someone he\u2019s going to marry. Mrs. hudson still believes that he\u2019s gay.\n\nSherlock, dressed as a waiter or sommelier, encounters Watson in a restaurant, the exact same one where he\u2019s about too propose to his girlfriend, Mary. Sherlock doesn\u2019t let Watson know who he is, not yet, anyway \u2014 until he\u2019s about to pop the question. Two years have gone by, with Watson believing that Sherlock was dead. Watson looks as if he\u2019s about to have a heart attack. He asks Watson if he\u2019s \u201creally going to keep\u201d his mustache, and then Watson attacks him.\n\nWatson asks Sherlock why he did it; the answer was that he had 13 different possible ways he could have managed the trick, and that only Mycroft had known all along. Watson naturally wanted Sherlock to tell him, also.\n\nSherlock tells Dr. Watson that he wants him to help thwart a terrorist attack. Watson punches Sherlock in the nose, but Mary, speaking to Sherlock, tells him that she will help convince Watson to aid the sleuth.\n\nWe see Sherlock meeting with someone \u2014 he says \u201cI see you\u2019ve been letting things slide, Greg.\u201d It\u2019s LeStrade, though in the Sherlock Holmes canon, it\u2019s only known that his first name begins with the letter \u201cG.\u201d Then, we see Sherlock going to his old digs at 221 Baker Street, and meeting with Mrs. Hudson, who immediately freaks out.\n\nMary reads to Dr. Watson from his blog, and says that everyone loved reading it. He is shaving off his mustache, as Sherlock recommended.\n\n\u201cCertain people are markers, like rats defecting from a sinking ship,\u201d Sherlock thinks, as he crosses off potential suspects and photos of people from a wall of suspects. Mycroft thinks that Sherlock is \u201cslow\u201d compared to him. Mrs. Hudson serves them both tea.\n\nThe terror level has been raised to critical. He and Mycroft trade quips and deductions about the Peruvian hat a suspect has left behind.\n\nMycroft tells him, \u201cI\u2019m not lonely, Sherlock.\u201d Sherlock answers him, \u201cHow would you know?\u201d\n\nMrs, Hudson asks Sherlock to talk with John. Sherlock answers that he has, but it hasn\u2019t done any good so far. He asks Molly to assist him in solving crimes.\n\nA bunch of clients line up for Sherlock to assist them, and he solves the cases in rapid-fire fashion. Then, we see Sherlock and Molly investigate a ritualistic murder, claimed to have been committed by Jack the Ripper. The corpse is 6 months old, dressed in Victorian costume.\n\nSherlock and Molly travel to the house of a man who \u201clikes trains.\u201d The man shows them footage of a man getting into a Tube train but not getting off. The driver of the train hasn\u2019t been seen since, and has \u201ccome into some money.\u201d The train never stopped, but the man somehow vanishes.\n\nSherlock seems to remember the man\u2019s face, but he has a difficult time thinking about who it could be. Watson shows up at the door of 221 B Baker Street, but he\u2019s accosted by some men and has a hypodermic needle inject something into his neck.\n\nSherlock tells Molly that she was the one person who meant the most to him, but she is now married or about to be married. He kisses her on her cheek and walks away as it begins to snow.\n\nWatson awakens, in a groggy haze. He\u2019s trapped, about to be torched up in a bonfire that is being lit to celebrate Guy Fawkes Day. Mary has an enigmatic message on her phone that someone has written \u2014 it every third word is taken, the message is \u201cSave John Watson.\u201d Sherlock believes it\u2019s probably a trap, but that Watson is in very real danger. He and Mary ride on a motorcycle to where Sherlock believes Watson is being held captive.\n\nA boy hears John\u2019s moans, and tells his father \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d The father doesn\u2019t believe that the boy has heard anything \u2014 then John screams out \u201chelp!\u201d Sherlock and Molly pull John out of the fire.\n\nJohn arrives at 221B to see Sherlock meeting with his parents. Sherlock gets rid of them rather quickly, to talk with his old friend. Watson asks Sherlock why he was attacked \u2014 he wonders if it was to get to Sherlock through him. Sherlock tells his friend that he doesn\u2019t know.\n\nSherlock mentions his informants, or rats, to Watson. He suddenly realizes that the underground network is actually an Underground network. A carriage completely vanishes, not arriving at its intended destination. It\u2019s the 5th of November.\n\nWatson and Holmes pour over maps of the Underground, and one informant, via Sherlock\u2019s laptop, mentions that he heard Charing Cross Road spoken of. Dr. Watson believes that a bomb is in the missing carriage.\n\nThe duo explore the Underground searching for the missing carriage. Holmes gets the insight that the carriage containing the bomb is likely intended to blow up Parliament.\n\nThey finally locate the missing carriage, and force their way inside of it. At first, it appears to be empty, but Sherlock notices red wires and informs Watson that \u201cThis is the bomb.\u201d Indeed, the entire carriage has been made into a huge bomb.\n\nWatson says that they need to get Bomb Disposal there, but Sherlock tells him that there might not be enough time for that, He asks Sherlock to defuse the bomb, but Sherlock says that he can\u2019t. He asks Watson to leave, but his friend refuses to do so. Sherlock searches through his prodigious memory, but can\u2019t come up with a way to defuse the bomb. He asks John to please forgive him for all of the hurt he\u2019s caused him. Though Watson thinks it\u2019s a trick of Sherlock\u2019s, it isn\u2019t \u2014 he really doesn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAnderson, who formed The Empty Hearse, imagines Sherlock meeting with him. Sherlock then mentions the 13 likely scenarios, to try to get Moriarty to reveal his hand. He reveals to Watson in this scenario that he contacted his brother, who was in on the whole scheme as he\u2019s been the one to feed Moriarty information about Holmes. He had told Watson that it was all just a trick, but Watson had thought he really had perished. Sherlock hit an airbag when he jumped \u2014 an actual corpse was substituted for Sherlock\u2019s body in this scenario.\n\n\u201cEverything was anticipated \u2014 every eventuality,\u201d Sherlock tells Watson. He tells Watson that Molly found the body in the morgue of a man who Moriarty had killed, who resembled him. But, then Anderson wonders why Sherlock would tell him all of this, and concludes that he wouldn\u2019t, and Sherlock disappears, leaving Anderson alone in the meeting room, with his madness.\n\nBack in the present \u2014 Sherlock informs Watson that there\u2019s an off-switch on the bomb, and he knew how to turn it off all along. \u201cThose were such sweet things you told me,\u201d he said to Watson.\n\nWhen Sherlock is finally introduced to Molly\u2019s intended, he sees how alike the man looks to himself. Sherlock tells Watson he still doesn\u2019t know why he was targeted. He says that he was there, when Watson spoke at his grave, and asked him for \u201cone more miracle.\u201d he then puts on his deerstalker hat and says it\u2019s time to be Sherlock Holmes.\n\nThen, we see a mysterious villain watching the recording of Sherlock and Molly saving John from the bonfire. We only see the man\u2019s eyes, and that he\u2019s wearing glasses. Who is this new villain? Is he someone within Moriarty\u2019s circle, taking over from him; or, is he someone entirely different, unrelated to any of Moriarty\u2019s criminal activities? If you are someone in the U.K. or some other part of the world who already knows, please do not reveal the man\u2019s identity \u2014 but, if not, and you\u2019d like to make a deduction on this matter, please feel welcome to do so in the comment area below!\n\nSherlock has become one of the most popular drama series ever for the BBC, though they have had many notable successes exporting hit series such as Downton Abbey and Doctor Who. The debut or premiere episode of the third season, The Empty Hearse, had some very clever moments, and I thoroughly enjoyed viewing it.\n\nOf course, many questions were still left unanswered by the end of The Empty Hearse, including which one of the 13 ways Sherlock and Mycroft could have fooled the public into believing that Holmes was dead for two years was the one which they eventually used.\n\nAlso, though Sherlock and Watson have foiled the attempt of mysterious terrorists to blow up Parliament, they have not yet managed to find out who is behind the member of the House of Lords who rigged up the bomb and disappeared from the carriage. Sherlock and Molly successfully rescued John Watson, but again, who was the person behind his drugging and kidnapping?\n\nI\u2019m guessing that at least some of these answers will be revealed in the next two episodes of Sherlock, and that all will be revealed by the end of the season \u2014 all but many other questions which will likely be raised, the fodder of future episodes.\n\nFor fans of the series, it\u2019s great to know that Sherlock will have two more seasons, if not more, in which to answer all of these questions, and to wonder at the amazing deductive powers of the famous sleuth, Sherlock Holmes. I can hardly wait to see the next episode, The Sign of the Three, next Sunday.
