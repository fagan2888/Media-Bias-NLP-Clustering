Then, in a sit-down interview Thursday, told Fallon, who's wrapping up his first week as host of the long-running NBC show, that President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are getting ready to show America \"how they move.\"\n\nWith her signature charm and humor, Mrs. Obama also talked about the challenge of raising two young daughters, ages 12 and 15, in the rarified world of the White House.\n\n\"They want nothing to do with us,\" she laughed.\n\n\"They really want normalcy and the White House isn't normal,\" Mrs. Obama said. \"I'll say 'Don't you want to invite your friends over to watch a movie?' They say 'No one wants to come here.'\"\n\nShe then cautioned that her older daughter turns 16 this summer and is ready to learn to drive.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen in D.C. \u2014watch out,\" she warned with a laugh. \"Malia Obama on the road. Frightening.\"\n\nThe first lady also took advantage of her national TV audience to talk about her Let's Move exercise and diet initiative.\n\n\"What we're asking people to do is show us how you're moving. We want people to Facebook it, Tweet it, Instagram it.\" She wants to see \"how people around the country are moving.\"\n\nThe hashtag is #LetsMove.\n\nIf there's enough response, \"we'll have a little surprise. The president, and maybe the vice president, will show us how they move,\" Mrs. Obama said.\n\nShe also pitched the Affordable Care Act, encouraging young people to sign up for health insurance before the end of March deadline.\n\nYoung adults, she said, can now be covered for as little as $50 a month, \"less than the cost of gym shoes.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Michelle Obama stopped by Jimmy Fallon's revamped \"Tonight Show\" to chat about family life in the White House and promote two of her causes, healthy eating and fighting fat.", "og": {"site_name": "Sandusky Register", "description": "Michelle Obama appears in skit, talks about healthy eating and fighting fat", "title": "First lady pays visit to new 'Tonight Show' host", "url": "http://www.sanduskyregister.com/News/2014/02/22/First-lady-pays-visit-to-new-039-Tonight-Show-039-host", "image": "http://www.sanduskyregister.com/image/2014/02/22/x720_q60/F-Inqueue-SR-StoryArchive-Michelle-Obama-Davi-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.sanduskyregister.com", "description": "Michelle Obama appears in skit, talks about healthy eating and fighting fat", "title": "First lady pays visit to new 'Tonight Show' host", "image": {"src": "http://www.sanduskyregister.com/image/2014/02/22/x720_q60/F-Inqueue-SR-StoryArchive-Michelle-Obama-Davi-jpg.jpg"}, "creator": "sanduskyregistr", "site": "@sanduskyregistr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 201402220009}}, "keywords": "Sandusky Register,News", "google-site-verification": "fZibeoFmCJXMlwdTVWdLhmIoBIawotoXlU1VnWOTyc0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb84\"", "article_summary": "First lady pays visit to new 'Tonight Show' hostMichelle Obama stopped by Jimmy Fallon's revamped \"Tonight Show\" to chat about family life in the White House and promote two of her causes, healthy eating and fighting fat.\nThe president, and maybe the vice president, will show us how they move,\" Mrs. Obama said.\nMrs. Obama appeared in a silly skit with Fallon and comedian Will Ferrell.\n\"They really want normalcy and the White House isn't normal,\" Mrs. Obama said.\nThen, in a sit-down interview Thursday, told Fallon, who's wrapping up his first week as host of the long-running NBC show, that President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are getting ready to show America \"how they move.\""}
