The Roosevelt Park Pavilion was ground zero for an explosion of sound Saturday as the 16th Annual Jazz Festival offered music from across the contemporary landscape throughout the warm summer day.

The event kicked off with the Longmont All Star Jazz Band, featuring the top jazz students from the Longmont area. Students were required to audition to participate in the band, and seven different local high schools were represented.

Admission to the event was free, and fans were encouraged to bring their own chairs and blankets, but several food vendors were on scene, and artists' CDs also were for sale. By mid-afternoon, the crowd was estimated at at least 200 strong.

Six bands were advertised on the program, concluding with the Fat City Mardi Gras Band, slated to take the stage last at 5:45 p.m. Additionally, Paul Romaine and the Longmont Jazz All Stars offered a clinic earlier in the program.
