If uncertainty over what to do with one\u2019s life and peer pressure weren\u2019t enough, teenagers also have to deal with intense mood swings, manifested more often as lows than as highs. Although it\u2019s assumed they will grow out of their sulkiness come adulthood, those lows could stick with them and hurt their employment prospects later in life, according to new research published in Social Science and Medicine.\n\nResearchers at the University of Stirling looked at the employment patterns of more than 7,000 Americans, which included nearly 3,000 pairs of siblings, over a 12 year period and found that, irrespective of socio-economic background, distressed adolescents \u2014 those who were nervous or depressed most of the time \u2014 were more likely to be jobless in early adulthood than those who were calm or happy.\n\nThe data showed that people who suffered from high levels of anxiety or extreme feelings of unhappiness between the ages of 16 and 20 were 32 percent more likely to be unemployed, and 26 percent more likely to be unemployed or out of the workforce in early adulthood. Researchers compared the distressed teens to their non-distressed siblings with the same background to control for \u201cunobserved family background characteristics\u201d which may explain the relationship between emotional distress and unemployment, researchers wrote. However, these results held even when distressed teens were compared to their non-distressed siblings, suggesting that emotional problems carry a heavy penalty.\n\n\"These findings provide strong evidence that distressed adolescents are vulnerable to unemployment and suggest that this vulnerability increased during the recent difficult economic period following the Great Recession,\u201d researcher Mark Egan said in a statement.\n\nAccording to the study, the adverse impact psychological distress had on job prospects grew in the years following the Great Recession which lasted from 2007 to 2009, with those with an increased history of distress experiencing a pronounced uptick in joblessness.\n\nGiven the strong correlation between emotional distress and employment prospects, Egan believes treating mental health issues in early life could possibly benefit the economy.\n\n\"Investing in childhood and adolescent mental health services could have economic benefits including reducing population-level unemployment,\u201d Egan explained. \u201cWidening access to effective treatments for early life distress could lead to large economic returns by helping individuals into employment and increasing their lifetime earnings.\u201d\n\nPast research has found that unemployment itself can further take a toll on mental health, causing a vicious cycle and likely worsening a person\u2019s chances of ever getting employed. A 2014 report from the National Alliance on Mental Illness revealed that more than 80 percent of adults with serious mental illness were unemployed in 2012, which was significantly higher than the unemployment rate for the U.S. population that year.\n\nResearchers said their findings help illustrate the economic benefits of investing in adolescent mental health services. They recommend community initiatives that promote resilience by supporting unemployed persons and offering \u201cfully voluntary access to appropriate mental health services where needed.\u201d\n\nSource; Egan M, Daly M, Delaney L.
