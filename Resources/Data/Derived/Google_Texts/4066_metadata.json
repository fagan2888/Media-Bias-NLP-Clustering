It was gutted from the budget. Kasich decided to get the funding in January of 2014 by getting approval from the Obama administration on Ohio\u2019s Medicaid expansion program, MSNBC first reported. Kasich then requested his legislature\u2019s controlling board to allow the use of $2.5 billion in available federal funds.\n\nA 5-2 vote in favor of allowing the transfer of federal funds to the state\u2019s Medicaid account occurred and Ohio was left with some terribly irritated Republican legislators.\n\nThe left celebrated Kasich\u2019s end run around his party at the time. \u201cThis is great news for the 270,000 previously uninsured residents, the state\u2019s health care providers, and [the] Ohio economy, [which] will benefit from this expansion,\u201d Obama aide and Ohio native Chris Jennings wrote in a blog post on the White House website.\n\nRegardless of what could be described as a delayed kiss of death from the Obama administration over two years ago, Kasich does not regret his decision. Although the Ohio Republican governor is expected to declare a run for the presidency, Kasich still celebrates his decision to counter his party on one of its biggest platform issues.\n\n\u201cRight here in this town \u2014 in this state there have been a number of drug overdose deaths \u2014 321 is my understanding. And I use the money that we bring back from Washington and Ohio to treat the drug addicted,\u201d he told The Daily Caller after walking out of a caf\u00e9 on the main strip in Manchester.\n\nHe went on, \u201cAnd we are also treating in the prisons. So we now have the resources to treat them and we treat them in the prisons and we hand them off to the community our recidivism rate\u2013the return rate of those people to prison is 10 percent. The national return rate is almost 50 percent. So we use these resources, so that we can help people get rehab and unfortunately it isn\u2019t always easy.\u201d\n\nHe later said, \u201cWe use those dollars to treat the mentally ill as well. And I don\u2019t know a better way to do it then to have the resources to make sure we realize everyone is made in the image of the Lord, and everybody should be able to live out their God-given purpose so I\u2019m pleased by what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nHowever, a Supreme Court decision could determine the fate of the Affordable Care Act any day now and Ohio\u2019s federal exchange is likely to be affected if the court rules against the administration. As of now, only Delaware and Pennsylvania were \u201cconditionally approved\u201d by Health and Human Services secretary Sylvia Burwell to set up their own health exchange market places if the high court rules against Obama\u2019s HHS.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kerry Picket", "description": "MANCHESTER, N.H.--A question that follows Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich is why he went around his own Republican state legislature over two years ago and", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "MANCHESTER, N.H. -- A question that follows Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich is why he went around his own Republican state legislature over two years ago and expanded the Buckeye state\u2019s Medica", "title": "Kasich: No Regrets Over Medicaid Expansion", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/19/kasich-no-regrets-over-medicaid-expansion/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/John-Kasich-e1440013021764.jpg", "height": 528}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Everybody should be able to live out their God-given purpose so I'm pleased by what we've done'", "title": "Kasich: No Regrets Over Medicaid Expansion Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/19/kasich-no-regrets-over-medicaid-expansion/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/John-Kasich-e1440013021764.jpg"}, "creator": "@KerryPicket", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-19 19:48:18", "sailthru.title": "Kasich: No Regrets Over Medicaid Expansion", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "elections-2016,john-kasich,medicaid,obamacare,ohio,kerry-picket", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "elections 2016,john kasich,medicaid,obamacare,ohio", "sailthru.description": "MANCHESTER, N.H. -- A question that follows Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich is why he went around his own Republican state legislature over two years ago and expanded the Buckeye state\u2019s Medica", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/John-Kasich-e1440013021764.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaffd\"", "article_summary": "Kasich decided to get the funding in January of 2014 by getting approval from the Obama administration on Ohio\u2019s Medicaid expansion program, MSNBC first reported.\n4611843MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 A question that follows Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich is why he went around his own Republican state legislature over two years ago and expanded the Buckeye state\u2019s Medicaid program under President Obama\u2019s health care act.\nA 5-2 vote in favor of allowing the transfer of federal funds to the state\u2019s Medicaid account occurred and Ohio was left with some terribly irritated Republican legislators.\nAlthough the Ohio Republican governor is expected to declare a run for the presidency, Kasich still celebrates his decision to counter his party on one of its biggest platform issues.\nKasich then requested his legislature\u2019s controlling board to allow the use of $2.5 billion in available federal funds."}
