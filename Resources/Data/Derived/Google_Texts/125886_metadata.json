On Saturday a big roadside party event for families will be held to benefit the Western Maine Homeless Outreach shelter.\n\nWe've been very busy,\" Jyssica Boudreault, the district manager at the Farmington tax service office, said of the charity work held so far.\n\nThe roadside party event will be held at the tax office and parking lot on the corner of Wilton Road and Knowlton Corner Road, 586 Wilton Road in Farmington on Dec. 12. The event starts at 1 p.m.\n\nMany activities for children include hands-on craft tables, face painting, a bounce house, balloons, hot chocolate and snacks. Many local businesses have donated gift cards which will be raffled off, of which all proceeds will go to the homeless shelter located nearby on Wilton Road in the lower level of the Living Waters Assembly of God Church.\n\nDuring the party event, cash donations and or donations of various paper products will be accepted to help support the three-year-old shelter.\n\nWhile there are many good charities to choose from to help, Boudreault, a resident of Farmington, decided to focus on the homeless shelter.\n\n\"It's a newer shelter and sometimes gets overlooked,\" she said. \"A lot of people don't even know it's there.\" Boudreault, along with tax service employee Brittany Birmingham, also of Farmington, are organizing Saturday's event. With winter coming the shelter will need help more than ever with accommodating a full house of guests, increased heating costs and more, Boudreault said.\n\nSupporters of the Western Maine Homeless Outreach shelter, Police Chief Jack Peck and state Sen. Tom Saviello will be attending Saturday's benefit shindig.\n\nWinter may be coming sometime but not on Saturday with temperatures expected in the mid-50s. With the unseasonably warm weather Boudreault said she hopes for a great turnout at the roadside party, with all proceeds going to help the homeless shelter.\n\nLiberty Tax Service, with offices in Auburn and Waterville, hold tuition-free tax courses and expect to employ seven or eight people from those taking the course. A 10-week course ends tonight and another week-long course will start 10 a.m. Monday, Dec. 14 with 12 people already enrolled.\n\nThe course will cover the basics of tax preparation-both individual tax preparation as well as small business tax preparation. Topics include: filing information and status; exemptions and dependents, and wages, salaries and tips, etc.; standard deduction and itemized deductions; child tax credit, earned income credit, child and dependent care expenses; education credits; depreciation, profit or loss from a business, Schedule Cs Schedule Es; Affordable Care Act; premium tax credit and how it affects your tax return.\n\nThe course is something that Liberty tries to do to give back to the community, Tuition is free and anyone is welcome to attend (even individuals not looking for employment.) Upon completion of the course, we will have an interview process and hire our tax preparers from the people that completed the class.\n\nTo register for the class, people can call 207-613-0500 or email libtax50@gmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "blog", "description": "FARMINGTON - Since the Liberty Tax Service opened an office on the Wilton Road a month ago, employees have been providing\u00a0 support for local charitable organizations.
