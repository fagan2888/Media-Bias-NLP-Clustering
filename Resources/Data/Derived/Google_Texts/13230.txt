But please, Liam, could you throw us a few crumbs now and then? Since your heartbreaking performance as the world's most famous sex researcher in Kinsey — for which you won our 2004 Movies for Grownups best actor award — your work has consisted almost exclusively of movies that can be described this way: "A man shoots people. Or possibly strangles them. Or stabs them with something pointy."

The body count rises alarmingly in Run All Night, the story of Jimmy, a booze-soaked retired hit man (Neeson, natch) who must protect his virtuous son, Mike (RoboCop star Joel Kinnaman), from an army of thugs hired by a mobbed-up businessman (Ed Harris). Director Jaume Collet-Serra and an army of three screenwriters (never a good sign) tart up the proceedings by arranging for Jimmy to be seized by guilt. (See: just about any hit man movie of the past 10 years.) What's worse, Jimmy's oldest friend just happens to be the very mobster now trying to kill him and Mike.
