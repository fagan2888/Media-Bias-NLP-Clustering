In just the last two weeks, law enforcement officials working with the Major Crimes Apprehension Team joint task force have recovered about 26.6 pounds of methamphetamine in an ongoing criminal investigation.

MCAT detectives have been working with the Show Low Police Department and Phoenix DEA/Phoenix Police to investigate a series of suspects connected to one initial incident stemming from a traffic stop.

The investigation began on March 19 when a Show Low police officer stopped a suspicious vehicle for speeding. The officer paid attention to all of the inconsistencies the suspect was telling him, and planned to search the suspect's vehicle.

The officer contacted a Sheriff’s Traffic Enforcement Unit/K-9 that went to his location. The dog alerted, indicating that the odor of contraband was present. After the dog alerted but before officers began searching the vehicle, the suspect turned around and volunteered his hands for the officers to handcuff him.

When the officers searched the vehicle, they located roughly 7.6 pounds of methamphetamine inside.

This past Wednesday, MCAT detectives and a Show Low police officer drove to Phoenix and began working with a DEA Task Force Group to further the criminal investigation.

The suspects were identified and a traffic stop was conducted on one of the suspects in downtown Phoenix. An additional 10 pounds of methamphetamine was recovered concealed inside the trunk of the suspects' vehicle.

Later that evening, the task force searched the suspect’s home, which yielded about $9,500 and an additional 9 pounds of methamphetamine.

This criminal case is ongoing with multiple agencies and the identity of the suspects has not yet been released.

The street value of 26.6 pounds of methamphetamine is $1,191,680.
