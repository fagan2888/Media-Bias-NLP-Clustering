Of the 50 states, enrollees in 34 states saw a top increase in premiums of 20% or more.\n\nAt a high of nearly 50% rate increase, Minnesota\u2019s market premiums top the chart. Minnesota is followed by Alaska with a 39.6% increase- Oregon and Tennessee trail closely with 37.1% and 36.3%, respectively. The premium percentage increases from private insurance companies are broken down by state, proving that Obama\u2019s claim that \u201chealthcare inflation has slowed\u2026\u201d is clearly false.\n\nWith Obamacare\u2019s mandate forcing individuals to buy increasingly unaffordable health insurance or pay a tax, Americans are finding themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place. With insurance premiums (and also deductibles) increasing at such a rapid rate, many in the middle class are faced with higher and higher bills when visiting their doctor or a hospital.\n\nThe top ten states with premium increases are as follows:\n\n-Minnesota: 49.0%\n\n-Alaska: 39.6%\n\n-Oregon: 37.1%\n\n-Tennessee: 36.3%\n\n-Oklahoma: 34.4%\n\n-Hawaii: 34.4%\n\n-Texas: 34.0%\n\n-Montana: 34.0%\n\n-North Carolina: 32.5%\n\n-Ohio: 32.0%\n\nTo see the full Obamacare Premium Increase Tracker- click here.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "pocket-site-verification": "e8a03e904ad67c23ec990c1928577c", "og": {"site_name": "Americans for Tax Reforms", "description": "In his final State of the Union Address, President Obama touted the success of Obamacare in lowering healthcare costs.
