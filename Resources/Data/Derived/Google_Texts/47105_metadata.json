But a 40-year-old man from India prefers to do his yoga sessions on the back of his Honda motorcycle at high speeds. Gugulotu Lachiram, a 40-year-old farmer from the Indian state of Telangana, rushes past oncoming traffic and wandering livestock while he's sits, stands, and lays down in yoga poses on his bike.\n\n\u201cI saw people performing dangerous stunts on national television,\u201d Lachiram told Barcroft Media. \u201cI thought if they can do it, why can\u2019t I? So I started practicing yoga on my bike. I completely love doing stunts on my bike and I will continue to do so for the next 15 years.\u201d\n\nThe almost fearless Indian daredevil has combined his passion for biking and yoga, and staring death in the face, for the past six years. His need for speed has him hitting about 40 miles per hour, during which he can covers distances of about 3 miles. \"I take the risk while I perform and until today I have not had any accidents,\" he said. \"Sometimes I get scared when I perform stunts but it makes me feel happy too.\"\n\nIn yoga, awareness is more important than rushing through a series of poses just to get them done. Practicing these body positions can lead to misalignment, chronic pain, and even surgical replacements if not done properly and with caution. \u201cTo be smart and safe in yoga, we need to consider postural alignment and natural joint function, rather than blindly following a list of 'must-do' traditional poses and boot camp challenges,\u201d wrote Michelle Edwards, creator of Creator of YogAlign, a pain-free yoga method, in a blog on The Huffington Post. Despite Lachiram\u2019s incredible ability to do yoga on high speed motorcycle, it\u2019s safe to say yoga and danger don\u2019t mix.\n\nThe Indian yogi\u2019s bike stunts have made him a hero in his hometown, yet several people warning him it\u2019s not good for him. Lachiram said people in their 40s and 50s tell him the stunts are dangerous, but the youth appreciate and support him. \"They want me to continue performing,\u201d he said. However, his son, who is also his biggest fan, says he's proud of him, and that he wants him to continue performing the \"brave act.\"\n\nLachiram isn\u2019t the first yogi to take yoga to new heights. In September, yogi Rachele Brooke Smith complete a yoga move while balancing on a New York City building's ledge. The ledge was barely wide enough to accommodate her foot, as she posed 25 stories above the city. \"I did feel safe on that ledge otherwise I would never have done it,\" she told TODAY Health. \"I practice every day and feel extremely confident in the moves that I was doing. It definitely was a little scary being so high but I never felt in any way in danger.\"\n\nIt seems when yoga is presented with stunts, there is a wow factor. But with 20.4 million people practicing yoga in the U.S., safety cannot be stressed enough. The practice can cause a range of injuries among beginners and experienced yogis alike. Yoga is touted for its ability to bring strength, flexibility, and general health.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "yoga poses, hot yoga, postures, life in the fast lane, high speed, motorcycle stunts, exercise, workout", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Indian daredevil takes yoga to new heights on a high speed motorcycle.", "title": "...And This Pose Is Called 'Motorcycle Death Wish' [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/life-fast-lane-indian-daredevil-pulls-yoga-poses-motorcycle-high-speed-313298", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/05/driver-riding-motorcycle-asphalt-road-through-forest.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Indian daredevil takes yoga to new heights on a high speed motorcycle.", "title": "...And This Pose Is Called 'Motorcycle Death Wish' [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/life-fast-lane-indian-daredevil-pulls-yoga-poses-motorcycle-high-speed-313298", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/05/driver-riding-motorcycle-asphalt-road-through-forest.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/05/driver-riding-motorcycle-asphalt-road-through-forest.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-06T13:45:05-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-06T13:45:04-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Indian daredevil takes yoga to new heights on a high speed motorcycle."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3398\"", "article_summary": "Despite Lachiram\u2019s incredible ability to do yoga on high speed motorcycle, it\u2019s safe to say yoga and danger don\u2019t mix.\nBut with 20.4 million people practicing yoga in the U.S., safety cannot be stressed enough.\nSo I started practicing yoga on my bike.\nBut a 40-year-old man from India prefers to do his yoga sessions on the back of his Honda motorcycle at high speeds.\nGugulotu Lachiram, a 40-year-old farmer from the Indian state of Telangana, rushes past oncoming traffic and wandering livestock while he's sits, stands, and lays down in yoga poses on his bike."}
