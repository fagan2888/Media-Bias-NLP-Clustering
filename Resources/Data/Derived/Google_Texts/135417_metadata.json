Supporters have pushed for similar measures in dozens of other statehouses.\n\nIn 2012, Massachusetts voters narrowly rejected a ballot measure on doctor-assisted suicide. That measure called for two fewer doctor opinions than the new legislation being weighed.\n\nReligious, medical and disability rights groups fought the 2012 measure, saying it was open to manipulation and relied on diagnoses that could be wrong. Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, head of the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, called the defeat the best outcome for the \u201ccommon good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just looking for a compassionate way for them to face that inevitability,\u201d state Rep. Louis Kafka, a sponsor of the new legislation, said of terminally ill patients seeking to end their lives.\n\nThe bill being discussed in Tuesday\u2019s public hearing also requires that the patient\u2019s request be drafted in writing and mandates that the patient self-administer the drugs.\n\nPeople would be ineligible for the life-ending drugs if they\u2019re minors, have guardians or are seeking them only because of age or disability.\n\nRepublican Gov. Charlie Baker pointed to the outcome of the 2012 ballot question.\n\n\u201cThis is one where the details really matter, and I do take my lead a bit from the fact that the voters of the commonwealth had an opportunity to consider this and voted it down,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic Senate President Stan Rosenberg said the Senate hasn\u2019t discussed the issue, but he supports it.\n\n\u201cI think we can learn from what the other states that have implemented this have done,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cPersonally I think we should take a hard look at it and find a \u2026 way to move forward with it.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts Medical Society opposes the bill, saying the legislation will do more harm than good.\n\nWith reporting from the WBUR Newsroom and The Associated Press\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bill would require a terminally ill patient be assessed by two doctors and a counselor before being prescribed life-ending medication.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "The bill would require a terminally ill patient be assessed by two doctors and a counselor before being prescribed life-ending medication.", "title": "Lawmakers To Hold Hearing On Physician-Assisted Suicide Bill", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/10/statehouse-hearing-physician-assisted-suicide", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.wbur.org/images/podcasts/commonhealth.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/10/statehouse-hearing-physician-assisted-suicide", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws/cdn.wbur.org/images/podcasts/commonhealth.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmakers To Hold Hearing On Physician-Assisted Suicide Bill"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-27", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 11:29:57 -0400"}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers To Hold Hearing On Physician-Assisted Suicide BillState lawmakers on Beacon Hill will hear arguments Tuesday afternoon on a proposed measure to legalize physician-assisted suicide.\nThe bill being discussed in Tuesday\u2019s public hearing also requires that the patient\u2019s request be drafted in writing and mandates that the patient self-administer the drugs.\nIn 2012, Massachusetts voters narrowly rejected a ballot measure on doctor-assisted suicide.\nThe doctors would need to inform the patient about the diagnosis, prognosis, risks associated with taking the medication and other treatment.\n\u201cI think we can learn from what the other states that have implemented this have done,\u201d Rosenberg said."}
