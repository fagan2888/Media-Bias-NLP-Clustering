Wichita State University art student Autumn Leslie had between 25 and 30 of her student paintings stolen.

Leslie says that apartment staff at Windham Court Apartments informed her that her storage unit was broken into.

The thief or thieves stole her artwork and a bag of Christmas ornaments.

"I'm getting ready to graduate, I'm going into my senior year and I really needed my artwork so that I could apply for exhibition and get my name out there," Leslie said, "and also so I have a portfolio for grad school."

There are no leads on who stole the artwork.

Leslie says she does not want to press charges, she just wants her artwork returned to her.
