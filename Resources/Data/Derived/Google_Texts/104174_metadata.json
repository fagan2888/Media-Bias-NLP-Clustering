(Photo: file)\n\nGreat news, Arizona.\n\nOur leaders are marching ever closer to declaring our independence from the United States of America.\n\nOr at least, from its government.\n\nThis afternoon, the Arizona House approved House Bill 2368, declaring that henceforth the sovereign state of Arizona will not enforce any executive orders issued by the president of the United States or any policy directives from the Department of Justice unless they are affirmed by Congress and signed into law.\n\nSo, there.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by none other than Rep. Bob Thorpe, R-Flagstaff, is one of a series of kooky measures aimed at declaring our independence from federal gun laws, from the Affordable Care Act, from the Environmental Protection Agency, from the Department of Justice, from Barack Obama and from just about anything else associated with the state's most detested f-word.\n\nFederal, that is.\n\nApparently, House Bill 2368 isn't even controversial. The only one to speak about it on the House floor, was Rep. Bruce Wheeler, D-Tucson, who noted that presidents throughout our nation's history have used executive orders.\n\nHe may as well as saved his breath.\n\nThe bill passed on a party line 36-24 vote.\n\nOur leaders are so focused on and passionate about the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. If only we could get them as interested in Article 11, Section 6 of the Arizona Constitution...\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1C2RuEH", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Laurie Roberts: The Arizona House passes a bill declaring our independence from executive orders, among other things.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "Laurie Roberts: The Arizona House passes a bill declaring our independence from executive orders, among other things.", "title": "Oh, just secede already, Arizona Legislature", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/laurieroberts/2015/03/10/hb2368-arizona-house-executive-orders/24728555/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Laurie Roberts: The Arizona House passes a bill declaring our independence from executive orders, among other things.", "title": "Oh, just secede already, Arizona Legislature", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2c76fccf014fdfa2e24c6d0423032a5d2d0361eb/c=216-0-1285-1069&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/03/10/Phoenix/Phoenix/635616101192385880-AZ-State-Capitol-Building-80635.JPG", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/laurie.roberts1?fref=ts"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. Department of Justice", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. Department of Justice", "title": "Oh, just secede already, Arizona Legislature", "author": "Laurie Roberts", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bb43dfcd606bfa13fd2e38abe5c10d6e0f9df802/c=349-0-1151-1069/local/-/media/2015/03/10/Phoenix/Phoenix/635616101192385880-AZ-State-Capitol-Building-80635.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/43cdc928aedce9c82904fd8aa77a431893945c7d/c=216-0-1285-1069/local/-/media/2015/03/10/Phoenix/Phoenix/635616101192385880-AZ-State-Capitol-Building-80635.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d8ce64c1ad1b0f67d37f97e03d5e4602953b5905/c=39-0-1461-1069/local/-/media/2015/03/10/Phoenix/Phoenix/635616101192385880-AZ-State-Capitol-Building-80635.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f40027a35f3bfbd23edf78d362db9b52beb06ca1/c=0-111-1500-958&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/03/10/Phoenix/Phoenix/635616101192385880-AZ-State-Capitol-Building-80635.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-03-10T15:49:07.057000-07:00", "shorthed": "Oh, just secede already, Arizona", "articleid": 24728555, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/08f01e022bb55942814e41b6a7dd1fe81a88c70c/c=0-111-1500-958/local/-/media/2015/03/10/Phoenix/Phoenix/635616101192385880-AZ-State-Capitol-Building-80635.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa1c760435332c2b4ebb4727abe3c54c5ece697e/c=451-0-1050-1069/local/-/media/2015/03/10/Phoenix/Phoenix/635616101192385880-AZ-State-Capitol-Building-80635.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "10th Amendment, executive orders, Rep.
