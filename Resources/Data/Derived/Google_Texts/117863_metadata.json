The report acknowledges that more liberal prescribing of the drug class has led to a rise in addiction, abuse, and overdose, but it maintains that the drugs are considered medically appropriate for acute and intractable pain that doesn't respond to other therapies.\n\nStill, it notes that there aren't enough data to help tell which patients are candidates for opioid therapy, on appropriate dosing strategies, or on risk mitigation, and there's a need for further research on the safety and efficacy of long-term opioids for chronic pain.\n\nA 2011 report from the Institute of Medicine -- which had been commissioned by HHS following the ACA mandate, and called specifically for a National Pain Strategy -- was criticized because it estimated that 100 million people in the U.S. live with chronic pain.\n\nSome experts said the number exaggerated the problem, and pointed to conflicts of interest between IOM panel members and opioid drugmakers.\n\nVon Korff noted that the draft version of the strategy recognizes that the percentage of patients with life-limiting, severe chronic pain is actually much smaller.\n\nMackey said the next step once the strategy is finalized will be to implement the recommendations by getting various stakeholders involved.\n\n\"It's going to be up to all of us to advocate -- legislators, insurance companies, patient advocacy groups, medical associations -- to enact these goals,\" Mackey said.\n\nThe IPRCC will be accepting comments on the draft guidance until May 20, 2015.\n\nThe authors disclosed no financial relationships with industry.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kristina  Fiore", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PainManagement/PainManagement/50826", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/50xxx/50826.jpg", "description": "Federal advisory group wants to frame chronic pain as public health problem.", "card": "Summary", "title": "Is Pain a Public Health Crisis?"}, "dc.date.issued": "2015-04-04 11:00:00", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "neurology,primarycare,psychiatry,publichealthpolicy,generalpsychiatry,healthpolicy,publichealth,generalprimarycare,painmanagement,geriatrics,hospitalbasedmedicine,anesthesiology,nursing,nursing", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-04 11:00:00", "sailthru.title": "Is Pain a Public Health Crisis?", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "Federal advisory group wants to frame chronic pain as public health problem.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-04-05 11:04:00", "date": "2015-04-04 11:00:00", "sailthru.description": "Federal advisory group wants to frame chronic pain as public health problem.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PainManagement/PainManagement/50826", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/50xxx/50826.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Federal advisory group wants to frame chronic pain as public health problem.", "title": "Is Pain a Public Health Crisis?"}, "sailthru.featured": 0, "dc.date": "2015-04-04 11:00:00", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "psychiatry,Other,primarycare,painmanagement,neurology,geriatrics,anesthesiology,hospitalmedicine", "sailthru.image.full": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/50xxx/50826.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35df\"", "article_summary": "Robert Kerns, PhD, of Yale and the Connecticut VA, who also chaired one of the report panels, said the strategy asserts that pain is a \"public health problem -- or, as some say, a public health crisis -- that is in need of a national strategy to transform the way we think about [pain].\"\nA federal advisory group has released a draft version of its National Pain Strategy, which seeks to redefine the way pain is perceived and treated in the U.S.\nThe strategy ultimately derives from a mandate in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which asked the Department of Health and Human Services to \"increase the recognition of pain as a significant public health problem.\"\nOpioids have been a focal point of the debate about pain care.\nIt involved six working groups that tackled various aspects of pain care: population research, prevention and care, disparities, service delivery and reimbursement, professional education and training, and public awareness."}
