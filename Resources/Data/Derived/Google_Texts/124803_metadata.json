The president was so hellbent on \u201cfundamentally transforming\u201d the country with his health care takeover that he intentionally deceived you \u2014 he lied \u2014 not once or twice, but over and over again.\n\nIn 2010, the year Obamacare was signed into law, I wrote \u201cObamacare\u2019s Unkeepable Promises\u201d in The Washington Times. These false promises were easily predictable and are finally now being exposed. It\u2019s starts with nine words that are unmaking an American presidency.\n\n\u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d \u2014 Barack Obama, June 2010\n\nAlready, 5 million Americans have lost their health insurance plans directly because of the president\u2019s law. By next year, as Obamacare starts tearing through employer-based insurance plans, that number will rise to between 50 million and 100 million Americans.\n\nHowever, this was just one of Mr. Obama\u2019s egregious Obamacare lies. The list goes on.\n\n\u201cIf you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period.\u201d \u2014 Barack Obama, June 2010\n\nHow can you keep your doctor, though, if your doctor cannot keep his practice? As health insurance companies buckle under the weight of Obamacare, they are narrowing their provider networks in hopes of controlling costs. This, of course, means that your doctor may no longer be allowed to participate in your plan. Other doctors are dropping or limiting Medicare and Medicaid, and some are even dropping out of all private insurance as well. Still others are leaving the practice of medicine altogether. You won\u2019t be able to keep them.\n\n\u201cI will not sign a [health care] plan that adds one dime to our deficits.\u201d \u2014 Barack Obama, September 2009\n\nThe president originally claimed Obamacare would reduce the deficit by $100 billion in the first decade. Aiding and abetting this lie was Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who buried her own report that showed Obamacare would cost $400 billion more than promised in the first decade. It gets worse. The Government Accountability Office\u2019s long-term projection reveals Obamacare raises the deficit over $1 trillion.\n\n\u201cI can make a firm pledge. Under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital-gains taxes, not any of your taxes.\u201d \u2014 Barack Obama, September 2008\n\nMr. Obama is now a Supreme Court-certified tax-raiser, which means his outright dishonesty has been validated by the high court as well. Despite the president\u2019s public assurances to the contrary, his administration argued and five Supreme Court justices agreed that the individual-mandate penalty \u2014 the linchpin of Obamacare \u2014 is not actually a penalty, but is in fact a tax. What\u2019s more, Obamacare contains 20 new or higher taxes on everything from pharmaceuticals and MRI scanners to tanning salons and the sale of your home.\n\n\u201cBut what we will do is, we\u2019ll have the [Obamacare] negotiations televised on C-SPAN \u2026 .\u201d \u2014 Barack Obama, August 2008\n\nMr. Obama promised the most transparent administration in American history. He proclaimed that by airing the Obamacare negotiations, Americans would see who\u2019s really on their side. Indeed. Perhaps that\u2019s why Mr. Obama never intended to air these in the first place. C-SPAN founder and CEO Brian Lamb later explained that his television network would have broadcast the negotiations, but \u201cHe never asked us .\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing of all: \u201cI will never forget my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final months, having to worry about whether her insurance would refuse to pay for her treatment.\u201d \u2014 Barack Obama, August 2009\n\nThe depths of the president\u2019s dishonesty are fully revealed by his willingness to dishonor his own departed mother when he falsely claimed that her health insurance company attempted to cancel her policy. In actuality, Ann Dunham\u2019s employer-based policy not only paid for her hospital bills and cancer treatment in full, they afforded her care at prestigious institutions like Memorial Sloan Kettering and the Straub Clinic.\n\nThe deceit is breathtaking.\n\nObamacare is the most disastrous law of our lifetimes, one that was forced upon us in the most dishonest of ways in order to fundamentally transform America from the Land of the Free into a nation of dependents. The Obamacare days of reckoning have barely begun, and our only salvation now is to repeal this train wreck in its entirety and to be honest with Americans about what measures actually work: patient-centered, market-driven reforms.\n\nDr. Milton R.
