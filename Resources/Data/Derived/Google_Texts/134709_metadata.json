Yet NHS bosses are still insisting that the service is better than that received in any other country.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOver the last three months, more than 90,000 A&E patients have had to wait on trolleys for between four and 12 hours to be attended to \u2013 the highest number in over a decade, and 40 percent higher than the last recorded peak, the Telegraph has reported.\n\nDr Cliff Mann, President of the College of Emergency Medicine, has conveyed concern over the performance, saying that \u201call bets are off\u201d regarding how the NHS will cope between January and March, traditionally the service\u2019s busiest time of year.\n\nHe added that hospitals were \u201cfull to bursting\u201d, and unable to send people home as there is no community care for them.\n\nYet the Prime Minister David Cameron, although admitting that the NHS was under pressure, has told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a short-term pressure issue which we need to meet with resources and management.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a longer-term issue, which is making sure that there are named GPs in your local area which are responsible for every single frail, elderly person.\u201d\n\nThe health secretary Jeremy Hunt has also conceded that there is \u201chuge pressure on NHS England\u201d and that hospitals were \u201crunning just to keep still\u201d to cope with rising demand, but insisted that the fact that 89 percent of patients are being seen within four hours is \u201cbetter than any other country in the world\u201d.\n\nIt was a claim echoed by Dr Sarah Pinto-Duschinsky, director of operations and delivery for NHS England, who said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show that, in the three months to the end of December, more than nine out of 10 A&E patients in England continued to be seen and treated in under four hours \u2013 the best measured performance of any major Western country.\u201d\n\nBy the end of Tuesday, 14 hospitals across England had declared a \u201cmajor incident\u201d, usually a term reserved for major transport accidents or terror disasters. The status causes all non-essential operations, including cancer operations to be cancelled and outpatients appointments also to be cancelled, whilst people are warned to stay away from A&E unless strictly necessary.\n\nThe 14 hospitals include: the Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stafford Hospital, Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, Cheltenham General Hospital, Scarborough Hospital, Walsall Manor Hospital, Peterborough City Hospital in Cambridgeshire, Royal Bolton Hospital, Croydon University Hospital in South London and Ashford and St Peter\u2019s Hospitals in Surrey; the Princess Royal Brighton and the Royal Sussex and Norwich and Norfolk Hospital.\n\nPatients described Croydon Hospital\u2019s A&E on Monday night as being like a \u201cpacked nightclub\u201d, with some fearing to go inside lest they contracted an infection. They described scenes of people vomiting in the waiting room and supplies running low, before the major incident was declared at 7am.\n\nAnd staff at Great Western Hospital in Swindon were forced to erect a giant \u201cfield tent\u201d in its car park on Monday night, such was the demand for its services. Staff said that the tent was taken down on Tuesday, and that a major incident was not declared.\n\nMeanwhile the 111 telephone service, designed to handle non-urgent out of hours calls, has been blamed for the influx of patients to A&E. Its call handlers are not trained medical staff but instead read from a script to assess patients, and are told by the system where to direct them for assistance.\n\nBut experts have blamed the inbuilt safety-first feature, which directs patients to A&E by default, for overloading A&E with people who don\u2019t need to be there. They point to official NHS figures which show that 111 directs 50 percent more people to A&E on the weekends when GPs surgeries are shut, the Times has reported.\n\nAt present 7 per cent of callers are told to attend A&E, and an ambulance is sent to 10 per cent of callers. Suzanne Mason, professor of emergency medicine at the University of Sheffield, said that the 111 system sending callers to A&E was a huge problem, and that it ambulance services in some areas had been \u201cbrought to their knees\u201d by call handlers following the risk-averse protocol.\n\n\u201cThere are certain times of day and days of the week when call handlers get to the bottom of the algorithm and look at what services are available locally and there isn\u2019t anything there,\u201d she said.\n\nCommenting on the fact that calls to 111 doubled over the Christmas period, Professor Mason added \u201cThe GPs have a choice: they don\u2019t have to open. The emergency department doesn\u2019t [have that choice]. One of the things we need to look at changing is the national availability of things like GP services over the holiday period. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense for them to close down.\u201d\n\nMark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association\u2019s governing council, said: \u201cThe system is struggling to cope with the sheer number of patients coming through the door. Growing pressure on services throughout the year means hospitals have no spare capacity to deal with the winter spike in demand.\u201d He said that the 111 system required a \u201cmarked improvement\u201d to stop patients turning up at hospitals needlessly.\n\nData collected by the Department of Health and NHS England between 1987 and 2013 shows that A&E admissions remained stable for the period between 1987 and 2003 at around 14 million a year. But from 2003 onwards, admissions grew year on year to nearly 22 million in 2012/13; a 50 percent increase in the last decade.\n\nThe rise coincides with a change in the way data was collected. Previously only attendances at major A&E departments were recorded, whereas in 2003 attendances at minor injury units and walk in centres were added. The rise shown has been almost wholly in those minor departments, whilst attendances at major units have remained relatively stable.\n\nCommenting on the figures, John Appleby from the Kings Fund said \u201cThe change in trend attendances is somewhat abrupt, and could well reflect a degree of what economists call \u2018supply induced demand\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe rise also coincides neatly with the uptick in immigration that was recorded from 2003 onward, following Labour\u2019s policy to open the country\u2019s doors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NHS Crisis Deepens As Nine More Hospitals Declare Major Incidents", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "NHS Crisis Deepens As Nine More Hospitals Declare Major Incidents", "title": "NHS Crisis Deepens As Nine More Hospitals Declare Major Incidents - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 682, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/AandE-NHS.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/01/07/nhs-crisis-deepens-as-nine-more-hospitals-declare-major-incidents/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NHS Crisis Deepens As Nine More Hospitals Declare Major Incidents", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/AandE-NHS.jpg", "title": "NHS Crisis Deepens As Nine More Hospitals Declare Major Incidents - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "healthcare, immigration, NHS,Breitbart London,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart London", "tag": "NHS", "published_time": "2015-01-07T06:18:50-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart London"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Previously only attendances at major A&E departments were recorded, whereas in 2003 attendances at minor injury units and walk in centres were added.\nPatients described Croydon Hospital\u2019s A&E on Monday night as being like a \u201cpacked nightclub\u201d, with some fearing to go inside lest they contracted an infection.\nThe 14 hospitals include: the Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stafford Hospital, Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, Cheltenham General Hospital, Scarborough Hospital, Walsall Manor Hospital, Peterborough City Hospital in Cambridgeshire, Royal Bolton Hospital, Croydon University Hospital in South London and Ashford and St Peter\u2019s Hospitals in Surrey; the Princess Royal Brighton and the Royal Sussex and Norwich and Norfolk Hospital.\nThe rise shown has been almost wholly in those minor departments, whilst attendances at major units have remained relatively stable.\nHe added that hospitals were \u201cfull to bursting\u201d, and unable to send people home as there is no community care for them."}
