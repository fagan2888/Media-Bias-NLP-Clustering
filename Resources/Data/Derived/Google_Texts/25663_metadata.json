Pat Quinn.\n\nA few months before that, Beth Fiorini, the health department\u2019s administrator, had applied for the grant, which is part of the state Community Health Center Construction Act.\n\nThe act, adopted in 2009, provides funding to repair outdated buildings, build new facilities, and buy new equipment.\n\n\u201cI think this is an investment that is going to pay great dividends in health care, especially in behavioral health care,\u201d Quinn said in October. \u201cWe want to make sure we cover every aspect of health care \u2013 physical, mental, you name it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve added in our state, in 1 year, 711,000 people now have health care coverage under the [federal] Affordable Care Act, but we have to have places to provide that, you know? And that\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d\n\nThe project is expected to be finished by Christmas, Fiorini said.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 SaukValley.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.saukvalley.com/2015/06/29/whiteside-county-health-department-expansion-underway/alr5mhn/", "image": "http://www.saukvalley.com/_internal/cimg!0/8csorn8h3yppvv7m7qd1h6nzhp9nb19", "site_name": "SaukValley.com", "title": "Whiteside County Health Department expansion underway"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "tout": {"article": {"id": "4d709b3a-880d-4dbd-a44a-099603101abf"}}, "keywords": "#WhitesideCounty", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "ROCK FALLS \u2013 And so it begins \u2013 \u201cit\u201d being construction at the Whiteside County Health Department.\n\u201cI think this is an investment that is going to pay great dividends in health care, especially in behavioral health care,\u201d Quinn said in October.\nThe health department has 13,000 clients \u2013 a number that continues to grow with the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cWe want to make sure we cover every aspect of health care \u2013 physical, mental, you name it.\nThe new building is going to help ease overcrowding, allowing the department to offer more behavioral health services."}
