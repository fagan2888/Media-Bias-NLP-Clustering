Consumers Mutual Co-Op, in consultation with the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (DIFS), has decided to enter into a run off of its health insurance business, the DIFS announced.

Consumers Mutual made the difficult decision to not participate on the health insurance marketplace in 2016, and to wind down operations.

All individual and group policyholders of Consumers Mutual should seek other healthcare coverage options both on and off the Marketplace, especially during this open enrollment period, the department said.

Consumers Mutual and DIFS will continue to work closely to evaluate and determine next steps. As more specific plans for the run off are made clear, further information will be made public at a later date.
