In June, the school board decided to replace all four social workers with school psychologists.\n\nAfter requesting a public hearing, hundreds of residents and students packed the high school\u2019s auditorium on Wednesday to ask that the social workers be reinstated. Roughly 40 people spoke in favor of keeping the social workers, including six students.\n\nOne of the students is Shannon Jordan.\n\n\u201cI just graduated from Avon High School last month, and I know I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that if it was not for the help that I received from the school social worker Laura Knee,\u201d Shannon said.\n\nMost of those who spoke said the same thing -- this is a bad idea. Speakers included school psychologists and psychiatrists who agreed that social workers are a necessary part of a school\u2019s mental health team.\n\nDr. Catherine Lewis, a psychiatrist in Farmington, said the school board\u2019s decision is \u201cdeviant, abhorrent and must be stopped.\u201d\n\n\"One of the things we are concerned about is undiagnosed issues, particularly with younger children.\"\n\nSchool Board Member Houston Putnam Lowery\n\n\u201cI think your decision is dangerous and puts the lives and welfare of your children at risk,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile nobody spoke in favor of the plan, the school board offered a different take. Board member Houston Putnam Lowery said there are different ways to address mental health issues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to get the best way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to continually try to improve what we\u2019re doing. One of the things we are concerned about is undiagnosed issues, particularly with younger children.\u201d\n\nBut Kathy Marzano, a counselor at Avon Middle School, said she has worked with social workers for years and found them to be indispensable.\n\n\u201cIf we need another school psychologist to conduct testing to determine the need for special education services, then hire another school psychologist,\u201d Marzano said. \u201cDon\u2019t fire who we have and who are working well.\u201d\n\nIn Connecticut, social workers are required to have at least 36 hours of course study in special education, which includes obtaining skills to help identify students who might qualify for special education services.\n\nBut according to a document drafted by Kelly Grant, Avon\u2019s director of pupil services, school psychologists are better equipped to handle certain tasks, such as evaluating a student for special education, assessing behavior problems, and collecting and analyzing data.\n\nSchool board Chairman Peggy Roell said school psychologists are different than social workers, but psychologists could eventually learn to do everything that social workers do.\n\n\u201cThe psychologists could do the relationship-building also,\u201d Roell said, adding that an administrator in another district said Avon\u2019s plan was \u201cprogressive\u201d and that \u201cis was a very good way and other districts would be doing this in the future.\u201d\n\nWhen later asked to identify this person, Roell said she would respond later with that information. As of Thursday evening, she had not responded to requests for comment. Grant has also not responded.\n\nSpeaking with WNPR before the public hearing, Duquesne University psychology professor Tammy Hughes sounded surprised at Avon\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cMost districts around the country use psychologists, social workers and school counselors together, kind of for a comprehensive team,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really an either/or approach.\u201d\n\nThe governor-appointed Sandy Hook Advisory Commission reiterated this point in its March 6 report:\n\n\u201cFor many children, however, schools offer the only real possibility of accessing services. School districts should therefore increase the availability of school guidance counselors, social workers, psychologists, and other school health and behavioral health professionals during and after the school day as well as potentially on Saturdays.\u201d\n\nWendy Howard was the only Avon school board member who advised rethinking this decision, and her comment was met with roaring applause. It remains unclear if and when the school board would revisit its plan to replace social workers with school psychologists.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Education", "description": "The report issued after the Newtown school shooting by the state's Office of the Child Advocate cites the importance of having both school psychologists", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/avon-parents-students-rally-save-school-social-workers", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201507/IMG_2441.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "The report issued after the Newtown school shooting by the state's Office of the Child Advocate cites the importance of having both school psychologists", "title": "Avon Parents, Students Rally to Save School Social Workers"}, "story_id": 419793458, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@savingej"}, "author": "David DesRoches", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Avon Parents, Students Rally to Save School Social Workers"}, "nid": 43108, "datePublished": "2015-07-03", "keywords": "The Daily, Hartford Region, schools, mental health, students", "wordCount": 759, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "School board Chairman Peggy Roell said school psychologists are different than social workers, but psychologists could eventually learn to do everything that social workers do.\nIt remains unclear if and when the school board would revisit its plan to replace social workers with school psychologists.\nIn June, the school board decided to replace all four social workers with school psychologists.\n\u201cMost districts around the country use psychologists, social workers and school counselors together, kind of for a comprehensive team,\u201d Hughes said.\nSpeakers included school psychologists and psychiatrists who agreed that social workers are a necessary part of a school\u2019s mental health team."}
