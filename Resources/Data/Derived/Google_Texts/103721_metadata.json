Yanga said an official investigation has not yet started.\n\nAt the Maridi hospital, Jan Wynands, a doctor with the International Committee of the Red Cross, said 80 patients had burns covering over 50 percent of their bodies, but he lacked enough equipment. Wynands said he needed catheters, syringes, pain killers and blades for surgery.\n\nThe death toll will rise if the patients are not taken to Juba, the national capital, for better care, he added.\n\nAbout 50 of the injured were evacuated Friday to Juba on flights provided by the Red Cross, the government and the U.N., which sent in a medical team. However, dozens remained in the hospital and in smaller health clinics.\n\nDeadly fuel tanker explosions are common in East Africa, where poor residents living near highways converge around fuel tankers after accidents to steal gas.\n\nIn June 2013, 29 people were killed and scores injured in an explosion after a collision between a fuel truck and a passenger van in the Ugandan capital of Kampala.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Death toll rises to 183 in South Sudan fuel tanker explosion - AP News: MARIDI, South Sudan (AP) \u2014 The death toll from a .05/26/2016 1:14:43AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "MARIDI, South Sudan (AP) \u2014 The death toll from a fuel tanker explosion in a", "title": "AP News - Death toll rises to 183 in South Sudan fuel tanker explosion", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/09/18/death-toll-rises-to-183-in-south-sudan-fuel-tanker-explosion-n2053966", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\261\\fa69cd7f-208e-42d3-bf24-1bf95bf46b66.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "MARIDI, South Sudan (AP) \u2014 The death toll from a fuel tanker explosion in a", "title": "AP News - Death toll rises to 183 in South Sudan fuel tanker explosion", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/09/18/death-toll-rises-to-183-in-south-sudan-fuel-tanker-explosion-n2053966", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/261/fa69cd7f-208e-42d3-bf24-1bf95bf46b66.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Death toll rises to 183 in South Sudan fuel tanker explosion, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06f0\"", "article_summary": "Deadly fuel tanker explosions are common in East Africa, where poor residents living near highways converge around fuel tankers after accidents to steal gas.\nMARIDI, South Sudan (AP) \u2014 The death toll from a fuel tanker explosion in a rural South Sudanese state reached 183 on Friday, a regional official said, as medical staff and volunteers struggled to keep up with the influx of severely burned patients.\nAt least 60 more people are unaccounted for, said Commissioner Wilson Thomas Yanga of Maridi County in the state of Western Equatoria, where the fuel tanker exploded.\nIn June 2013, 29 people were killed and scores injured in an explosion after a collision between a fuel truck and a passenger van in the Ugandan capital of Kampala.\nThe death toll will rise if the patients are not taken to Juba, the national capital, for better care, he added."}
