In the end the number 1 seeded team beat out the number 6.\n\n\u201cWe played well, as well as we could play and we\u2019re very, very young and so it\u2019s a great experience for the future and we\u2019re really happy with where we\u2019re at,\u201d Del Oro head coach Ron Benjamin said. \u201cWe knew it was going to be close.\u201d\n\nRocklin could thank junior goalkeeper Jaime Goodwin for keeping the match close as Del Oro dominated the shots on goal category, 9-3.\n\nDuring the final overtime\u2019s last two minutes, Goodwin came up big on two occasions. The first was when she jumped high to grab a ball coming into the box just before Del Oro striker Sylvia Sloss could get a foot on it. The second time was a few moments later as she dove to the right corner and stopped a game winner with only seconds left of injury time.\n\nEither way, for this one to come down to penalty kicks just upped the drama for this final between rivals.\n\nDel Oro\u2019s freshman goalkeeper Ailey Collins made a strong mark in penalty kicks as she blocked three out of four.\n\n\u201cI felt I performed pretty well,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI kind of like doing PK\u2019s and I felt for the most part it was a pretty good run for me. I just react, I wait for the shot and react to it.\u201d\n\nSloss put Del Oro on the board first and Collins caught Rocklin captain Lindsay Erl\u2019s kick to put the Golden Eagles up, 1-0.\n\nAfter Goodwin stood in and blocked Del Oro\u2019s next shot, Thunder teammate Faith Halloway found the corner to tie it,1-1.\n\nDel Oro\u2019s Rachel Gensch gave her teammates the big go-ahead goal at 2-1 and Emily Curry sealed the game with a PK to the top right corner and the Golden Eagles rushed the field.\n\n\u201cThey put on some pressure and our defense held tough but to get through the whole 100 minutes against those guys that was the goal,\u201d Rocklin head coach Paul Morrison said. \u201cWe held the shut-out the whole time, but kudos to them.\u201d\n\nIndeed it was time for Del Oro to celebrate.\n\n\u201cIt was really exciting especially because I\u2019m a freshman, getting to being shown the ropes right here and coming into this, it\u2019s an amazing experience,\u201d Collins said.\n\nFor the Thunder there wasn\u2019t much to regret as they played as well as could have been expected with their key injuries.\n\n\u201cEven though we didn\u2019t win we played our hardest, definitely did our best and I\u2019m very happy with it,\u201d Goodwin said.\n\nFor Benjamin it was never about repeating, each game was the single focus.\n\n\u201cHaving back to back section championships is great but really I just tried to keep in mind that we always take one game at a time and (we) didn\u2019t talk about repeating,\u201d Benjamin said.\n\nThey sure can talk about it now.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, local news, auburn journal,auburn news,national news, state news, crime, accident, breaking news, crime log, local sports,national sports, ski report, sports score, living, arts, entertainment, obituaries, classifieds, auburn photos, auburn videos, multimedia, auburn, health, fitness, dinning guide", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local auburn news.
