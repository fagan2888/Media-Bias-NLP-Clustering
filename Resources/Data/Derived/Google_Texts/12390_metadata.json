But a couple of reports this week underscore the fact that just having an ObamaCare insurance card doesn\u2019t guarantee access to care.\n\nAn inspector general audit of Medicaid found that newly enrolled patients who came into the program through ObamaCare won\u2019t necessarily find a doctor willing to treat them.\n\nFor example, the IG reports that a person enrolled in a Medicaid plan in one state would have to drive more than 75 miles to see a urologist.\n\nEnrollees in another state couldn\u2019t make appointments with 45% of the primary care providers listed as participating in one area of the state. (The IG doesn\u2019t identify the states.)\n\nThe IG found that while states have \u201caccess standards\u201d for managed care plans that contract with them to provide Medicaid benefits, these standards can be vague, and only a handful of states bother to conduct tests to see if the plans are complying.\n\nThe federal government checks only whether a state has standards in place, not whether they\u2019re any good.\n\nThanks to Medicaid\u2019s low payment rates and cumbersome regulations, doctor shortages in Medicaid were already a chronic problem before ObamaCare pushed states to expand the program, which 27 have done so far. A 2012 study found that almost a third of doctors refused to take new Medicaid patients.\n\nObamaCare just adds to this problem, handing out millions of freshly minted Medicaid cards for a program that can\u2019t handle those already in it.\n\nWorse, ObamaCare is now expanding this deceptive Medicaid model to the private insurance market.\n\nTo keep premiums down in the face of ObamaCare\u2019s costly market regulations and mandates, most insurers set up narrow \u2014 even extremely narrow \u2014 provider networks.\n\nThe result is the same as in Medicaid.\n\nEnrollees are promised comprehensive benefits and subsidized premiums, only to find care difficult or impossible to get when they need it.\n\nIn California, Anthem Blue Cross has already been sued over its skimpy provider lists. And the Los Angeles Times reported this week that consumers in that state will, if anything, find it harder to see a doctor next year.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s largest health insurers are sticking with their often-criticized narrow networks of doctors, and in some cases they are cutting the number of physicians even more,\u201d the Times found.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, to learn that ER doctors report a surge in hospital visits from ObamaCare enrollees, often for routine care and often after looking in vain for a doctor to see them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve given people an ATM card in a town with no ATMs,\u201d is how Dr. Ryan Stanton of the American College of Emergency Physicians correctly described the situation to USA Today.\n\nNegative word of mouth about such problems might be part of the reason why ObamaCare\u2019s popularity is lower today than when it officially launched a year ago.\n\nPassing out insurance cards is easy. Expanding actual access to health care is hard.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Narrow Networks: ObamaCare promised to expand access to health care.
