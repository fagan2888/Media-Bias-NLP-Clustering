Marlon Marshall, hired by the Obama administration to promote Obamacare in cities with large uninsured populations, is leaving his White House post amid speculation that he’s making himself available to join the campaign staff of Hillary Clinton should she seek the presidency.According to The Washington Post , Marshall is a shoo-in if Clinton hires Robby Mook, Marshall’s former mentor, as her campaign manager. The two, along with some others, are affectionately known to some as the "Mook Mafia."Mook and Marshall worked together on Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, and Marshall stayed on, joining Obama’s general-election campaign only after Clinton conceded the race. He has worked at the White House in the Office of Public Engagement since.He is returning to his position at the consulting firm 270 Strategies, where he was a founding partner.Marshall is respected by both Democrats and Republicans for his skills at organizing, according to The Post."He is known for signing off emails with a rallying cry and personal slogan — 'Please believe' — and for energizing other campaign staffers during the re-election," BuzzFeed reported last month.
