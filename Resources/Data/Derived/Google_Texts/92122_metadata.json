Kevin Brady, whose bulldog-looks belie a softer manner, took the helm of the Ways and Means Committee last week. That puts the 19-year House veteran at the forefront of key issues Congress will tackle heading into the 2016 election year, including taxes, trade and benefit programs such as Medicare and Social Security.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\nBrady\u2019s Chamber of Commerce career before entering Congress molded a mainstream conservative viewpoint, yet he is well regarded by harder-line conservatives. But he has a tough act to follow: the popular Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who led the committee until becoming speaker last month after a revolt by hard-line conservatives pushed former Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to resign.\n\nBrady, who falls short of the oratory spark and reputation for generating ideas that Ryan enjoys, has latched himself to the 45-year-old.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow the speaker\u2019s lead,\u201d Brady said in an interview last week. He said House Republicans \u201cwant us to tackle the big issues, and they want to be involved.\u201d\n\nInvolvement has been a major demand of the House Freedom Caucus, around 40 hard-core conservatives whose frustration with being muscled aside by Boehner fueled their antipathy for him. Ryan, R-Wis., is working with conservatives on giving lawmakers more say on legislation and other decisions.\n\nBrady says he, too, is willing to accommodate them, though no Freedom Caucus members serve on Ways and Means. So far, he has won praise from members of the group.\n\n\u201cVery, very positive,\u201d Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., said of Brady, adding that several conservatives floated Brady\u2019s name as a potential speaker in the chaotic days after Boehner resigned.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the chairman will come under pressure\u201d from the Freedom Caucus \u201cbecause we\u2019ll have the opportunity to offer amendments,\u201d said another member, Rep. Rod Blum, R-Iowa.\n\nSome conservatives remain wary.\n\nAdam Brandon, CEO of FreedomWorks, complimented Brady but said his group of anti-regulation conservatives wants to make sure he does not pursue a narrow agenda \u201cdreamed up by some lobbyists.\u201d\n\nDemocrats consider him someone they can work with.\n\n\u201cKevin and I don\u2019t agree probably on any public policy. But he\u2019s not an unpleasant person,\u201d said Ways and Means veteran Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash.\n\nBrady, from a solidly Republican district north of Houston, headed the trade subcommittee until 2013. That\u2019s when he took over the health subcommittee and helped lead many of the House\u2019s GOP\u2019s repeated, unsuccessful efforts to roll back President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nAs chairman, Brady\u2019s portfolio is much wider.\n\nMeasures he hopes will get Obama\u2019s signature include legislation making dozens of expiring tax breaks permanent, altering taxation of U.S. companies that operate abroad and easing trade barriers with Pacific Rim countries, though Brady said he has taken no final position on that recently negotiated treaty.\n\nAnother goal will be longer range \u2013 broadly rewriting tax laws with lower rates for individuals and businesses, and fewer loopholes. The issue has gridlocked Washington for decades.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming to this job at a time of expectations, but the expectations have always been there\u201d for Ways and Means chairmen, said former Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who led the committee in the 1990s.\n\nBrady calls Ryan coach of the House Republicans and himself \u201cthe quarterback of the Ways and Means team.\u201d Sports analogies seem fitting for Brady, a star athlete in baseball and other sports while growing up in Rapid City, South Dakota.\n\nAs a 12-year-old at football practice one day, Brady\u2019s coach tapped his shoulder and guided him to a policeman nearby. That\u2019s when he learned his father, Bill, an attorney representing a woman in a divorce trial, had been shot to death in the courtroom by her husband. That left Brady\u2019s mother, Nancy, with five children to raise.\n\nThe family purchased and ran a campground, and Brady threw himself into various sports.\n\nHis high school wrestling coach recalls that Brady, injured and out of shape, spent one night sweating off pounds in the gym when a teammate was hurt and Brady was too heavy to compete in his 132-pound weight class. He lost the necessary weight \u2013 Brady says 12 pounds \u2013 and wrestled, losing his match but preventing his team from forfeiting.\n\n\u201cThey were tough kids,\u201d the now-retired coach, David Ploof, said about Brady, his two brothers and two sisters. \u201cThey had to be.\u201d\n\nBrady worked his way through the University of South Dakota with odds jobs including maintenance worker and bartender. He took a job at the local Chamber of Commerce, then started working for Chambers of Commerce in Texas.\n\nBrady\u2019s parents were active Democrats in South Dakota and an uncle was a Democratic state senator. Brady said he became a Republican while working for the chambers, where he spent time helping businesses.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help but know how government burdens those job creators,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that is where the light bulb went off for me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House's newest and perhaps most powerful committee chairman is a 60-year-old Texas Republican who began life in a family of stalwart Democrats from South Dakota and lost his father at age 12 in a courtroom shooting.", "pubdate": 20151108, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The House's newest and perhaps most powerful committee chairman is a 60-year-old Texas Republican who began life in a family of stalwart Democrats from South Dakota and lost his father at age 12 in a courtroom shooting.", "title": "New House GOP chairman had early democratic roots", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RTXZWLZ.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/new-house-gop-chairman-early-democratic-roots/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The House's newest and perhaps most powerful committee chairman is a 60-year-old Texas Republican who began life in a family of stalwart Democrats from South Dakota and lost his father at age 12 in a courtroom shooting.", "title": "New House GOP chairman had early democratic roots", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RTXZWLZ.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Rep.
