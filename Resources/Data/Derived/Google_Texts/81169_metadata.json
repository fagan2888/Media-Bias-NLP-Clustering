And I\u2019m sorry to say, the numbers don\u2019t mean much, good or bad.\n\nThe official figures show around 106,000 people have enrolled for new insurance through the federal and state marketplaces. But only about 27,000 did so via the federal exchange.\n\nNow, first, I have a hard time with how HHS is talking about the data. They say that 1.5m people \u201capplied for coverage.\u201d No they didn\u2019t. 1.5m attempted to browse the plans. They didn\u2019t apply for anything. But HHS keeps calling this \u201capplying for coverage.\u201d It isn\u2019t, and they need to stop saying it because it\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s going to come back and haunt them, just as \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d haunts them today.\n\nThis has been a pet peeve of mine since the exchanges were launched. With the DC exchange, which covers me, in order to browse plans all you had to do was come up with a username and a password, then give them your zip and your age. That\u2019s it. The federal exchange, which covers my sister in Illinois, is a disaster. Forget the glitches that stopped people from accessing the site. I\u2019m talking about the rather high hurdles you have to go through in order to just browse plans on the federal exchange. I was online entering the info for my sister, and it was pretty horrific. But what was worse was at the end of the process of simply applying for permission to browse the plans, they required me to sign a legal affidavit swearing the information was true. While the info was true, it was creepy as hell signing a legal document, holding me liable, for simply wanting to browse the plans.\n\nBut it got worse. It\u2019s been a week and a half and my sister still hasn\u2019t browsed plans because the site won\u2019t let her. She got \u201capproved\u201d to browse, but they simply won\u2019t let her. When we called the 800 number, we were told that \u201cHomeland Security\u201d had to check her application first. Really? Homeland Security didn\u2019t have to check me out in order to browse the DC exchange. Why do they have to check my sister out on the federal exchange?\n\nBut putting that aside for a moment, here\u2019s my concern about the \u201conly 27,000\u201d people actually enrolling in plans. I don\u2019t think that figure says anything about the desirability of the program. It speaks volumes, however, about how hard it is to even browse the plans in the first place.\n\nAnd even putting aside the legal affidavit, which is sure to scare some people off, or the arduous form you have to fill out to even browse plans, or the several day wait to get permission to browse AFTER you \u201capply,\u201d there\u2019s another rather obvious thing that\u2019s going to stop people from even browsing. The entire federal site keeps calling the browsing process \u201capplying\u201d \u2013 and HHS Secretary Sebelius herself on a conference call with reporters today talked about people \u201capplying\u201d for coverage when they were simply trying to \u201cbrowse\u201d plans. I wonder how many people simply got scared off because they didn\u2019t want to \u201capply\u201d for coverage at all, they wanted to browse. I honestly worried, a lot, that I was \u201capplying\u201d for coverage for my sister and locking her into something before we even got to browse the plans. If I thought that, and she thought that, then others thought that too.\n\nThis is not to knock Obamacare. I have high hopes for the program, and it\u2019s why I keep trying to get my sister to go through the federal exchange, because I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nI\u2019m still not convinced that the people \u201cfixing\u201d the federal web site even understand what the problem is. On the media conference call with Sebelius this afternoon, one reporter said he still is having problems creating an account. They told him that he\u2019s likely an exception, that the overwhelming number of people have had their applications approved. Yeah? My sister\u2019s application was approved too, and she still can\u2019t browse plans. If they think the simple fact that applications are \u201capproved\u201d is proof that the system is working, they\u2019re sorely wrong.\n\nThere are some very serious problems with the way the federal exchange is set up, and it\u2019s not just bad code, it\u2019s bad design and bad decisions by the policy people. To reiterate, here\u2019s what the federal site has to do, at a minimum, in order to fix the problems.\n\n1. Stop calling it \u201capplying,\u201d and stop calling the forms they\u2019re filling out \u201capplications,\u201d when people simply want to browse plans \u2013 you\u2019re scaring them off.\n\n2. Emulate the Washington, DC exchange and only require that people pick a username, a password, then enter their birthday and zip code before you let them browse plans. That\u2019s it. And honestly they don\u2019t even need a username and password. All you should need is their birthday and zip, unless they want subsidy info.\n\n3. Browsing plans doesn\u2019t mean showing people the name of the plan and the price for a 27 year old (which is what the federal exchange \u201cbrowse plans\u201d button does), it means showing them the details of the plans and how much it costs for someone their age.\n\n4. No one\u2019s account info needs to be checked by Homeland Security or anybody else. Give people immediate access to browse the plans. Blue Cross Blue Shield let my sister browse the Illinois plans by simply entering her birthday and zip code on their Web site, why does her federal \u201capplication\u201d have to go Homeland Security when BCBS doesn\u2019t require those hurdles to simply browse the same plans?\n\n5. Drop the affidavit, at least until people \u201cpick\u201d the plans they want. You don\u2019t need to sign an affidavit in order to browse, that\u2019s creepy, and you\u2019re scaring people off.\n\nOnly then, when all of these things are fixed, will we have a true sense of whether Obamacare is a success or not.\n\nFollow @aravosis\n\n(I\u2019m told that in order to actually see my Facebook posts in your feed, you need to \u201cfollow\u201d me \u2013 so say the experts.)\n\nHere\u2019s the document on the enrollment numbers that HHS released today:\n\nMid-Nov-Enrollment-ReportEMBARGOED-UNTIL-330PMNOV-13-2013-final.pdf", "article_metadata": {"description": "Until the Obamacare federal exchange is fixed, and I`m not entirely convinced even they understand how bad it is, the enrollment numbers are meaningless.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "AMERICAblog News", "description": "Until the Obamacare federal exchange is fixed, and I`m not entirely convinced even they understand how bad it is, the enrollment numbers are meaningless.", "title": "Why the new Obamacare enrollment numbers mean absolutely nothing", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/hhs-obamacare-study.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-13T21:19:55-04:00", "url": "http://americablog.com/2013/11/new-obamacare-enrollment-numbers-mean-absolutely-nothing.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Until the Obamacare federal exchange is fixed, and I`m not entirely convinced even they understand how bad it is, the enrollment numbers are meaningless.", "creator": "@aravosis", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/hhs-obamacare-study.jpg", "title": "Why the new Obamacare enrollment numbers mean absolutely nothing", "site": "@americablog", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "p": {"domain_verify": "6a65cadbb06b6a8cd2795a412c36d6b4"}, "fb": {"admins": 504024627}, "google-site-verification": "LrdwJVMR_suty6YsOZ4xc1Hv3-F8Ms0Wo-VhCAoXm_U", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AMERICAblog", "published_time": "2013-11-13T16:37:45-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aravosis", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-11-13T21:19:55-04:00", "tag": "Obamacare"}, "news_keywords": "ACA, Affordable Care Act, applications, enrollment, exchange, numbers, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe13\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s a big conference call taking place as I write, with HHS Secretary Sebelius, over the announcement of the official Obamacare enrollment numbers.\nI\u2019m talking about the rather high hurdles you have to go through in order to just browse plans on the federal exchange.\nBut only about 27,000 did so via the federal exchange.\nMy sister\u2019s application was approved too, and she still can\u2019t browse plans.\nTo reiterate, here\u2019s what the federal site has to do, at a minimum, in order to fix the problems."}
