Denver police are looking for two men who allegedly committed a robbery while pretending to be police officers Friday night, police said Saturday.

The two suspects driving a maroon Crown Victoria equipped with red and blue lights and a Colorado license plate pulled over a male victim in the 3800 block of North Sheridan Boulevard. The victim said the pretend officers pulled him from his car and placed him in handcuffs.

The victim was injured when the suspects pushed him back inside his car, and he hit his head on the windshield, causing the glass to break.

One of the suspects took $180 from the victimâ€™s wallet.

The crime occurred around 10:05 p.m. Friday. The victim reported the incident to police around 1:15 a.m.

One of bogus officers is described clean-shaven white man with a stocky build and short blond hair who was wearing a full police uniform. The other is a heavy-set black man weighing about 200 pounds and dressed in tan khaki pants and a blue polo shirt with a badge, holster and gun.
