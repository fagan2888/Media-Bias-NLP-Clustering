The man wanted in connection with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl is now in police custody.

Wednesday morning, a police officer spotted 20-year-old Isiah Tyrek Bogan in a car in the 1900 block of Brooks Drive, two blocks from the scene of the alleged assault. The officer conducted a traffic stop and took Bogan into custody.

Bogan is charged with several sex offenses, second degree assault and other charges.

Last week, the victim told police a man followed her into an elevator at her Forestville apartment complex. When she got off the elevator, the man forced her to the ground and sexually assaulted her. He then ran from the scene.

A few days later, the girl's mother spotted the suspect and pursued him. The woman was able to knock the man down, but he eventually got away. But thanks to her encounter with the suspect, investigators were able to release a detailed description of the suspect, including several unique tattoos.

A tipster later identified the man police were looking for as Bogan.
