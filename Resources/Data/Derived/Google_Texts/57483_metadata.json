And getting rid of its myriad tax hikes would reduce tax revenues by $1.1 trillion, resulting in $281 billion decrease in projected deficits over the next decade.\n\nHowever, the report says that repealing ObamaCare would \u201cboost the economy\u2019s output\u201d by nearly 1% starting in 2021, because it would eliminate ObamaCare\u2019s negative effects on the labor market and on saving and investment.\n\nWhen these positive economic effects of ObamaCare\u2019s repeal are included, the deficit reduction climbs to $474 billion, mainly because the faster economic growth would produce more revenues.\n\nTo be sure, the Senate bill is a partial repeal of ObamaCare that keeps in place the hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare spending cuts included in the law. Republicans, as well as some outside experts, have complained that Obama has been double counting these savings anyway, using them both to \u201cpay for\u201d ObamaCare subsidies, and to claim they were extending Medicare\u2019s solvency.\n\nOn the downside, CBO says 22 million people who would otherwise have gained coverage under ObamaCare won\u2019t if it were repealed. It\u2019s unclear whether CBO adjusted that number to account for the increase in jobs and economic growth that would result from ObamaCare\u2019s repeal.\n\nThe Senate passed its bill as part of the budget \u201creconciliation\u201d process, which means that it can\u2019t be filibustered. The House passed a different version. Obama has promised to veto whatever version reaches his desk, and Republicans are unlikely to have enough votes to override the veto.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A little-noticed report released Friday afternoon by the Congressional Budget Office shows that the Senate bill to repeal most of ObamaCare would cut the", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "A little-noticed report released Friday afternoon by the Congressional Budget Office shows that the Senate bill to repeal most of ObamaCare would cut the deficit by as much as $474 billion, while b\u2026", "title": "Obamacare Repeal Would Cut Deficit, Boost Growth \u2014 CBO", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/obamacare-repeal-would-cut-deficit-boost-growth-cbo/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2015-12-14 14:31:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-14T14:31:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s unclear whether CBO adjusted that number to account for the increase in jobs and economic growth that would result from ObamaCare\u2019s repeal.\nWhen these positive economic effects of ObamaCare\u2019s repeal are included, the deficit reduction climbs to $474 billion, mainly because the faster economic growth would produce more revenues.\nThe findings stand in sharp contrast to promises by President Obama and other Democrats that ObamaCare would accelerate economic growth and lower federal deficits.\nAccording to the CBO, repealing ObamaCare\u2019s subsidies and Medicaid expansion would cut federal spending by almost $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years.\nA little-noticed report released Friday afternoon by the Congressional Budget Office shows that the Senate bill to repeal most of ObamaCare would cut the deficit by as much as $474 billion, while boosting GDP, investment and capital stock."}
