But if you are like countless miserable Americans trapped in the Obamacare 1095-A abyss, it\u2019s hell on stilts on a Segway teetering over the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.\n\nThe screw-ups, incompetence and bureaucratic blame avoidance over the health insurance exchange tax forms make the healthcare.gov website fiasco look like a flawless product launch.\n\nHow do I know? My family inexplicably got ensnared in the 1095-A paperwork pit. It\u2019s a government roach motel: Taxpayers check in, but they can never check out.\n\nIn 2013, our private high-deductible PPO from Anthem Blue Cross got canceled because of \u201cchanges from health care reform (also called the Affordable Care Act or ACA).\u201d Millions of others like us in the individual market for health insurance \u2014 including self-employed people, small-business owners, writers, artists and home-based entrepreneurs \u2014 suffered the same fate.\n\nMy husband reluctantly contacted Colorado\u2019s state health insurance exchange, \u201cConnect for Health Colorado,\u201d just to see what our options were. Months later, we settled on purchasing a new non-Obamacare plan directly from a different private insurer, Rocky Mountain Health. The provider network is much narrower than the Anthem plan we had before the feds intervened. Our two kids\u2019 dental care is no longer covered, and we\u2019ve had our insurance turned down at an urgent care clinic \u2014 something that had never happened before.\n\nBetter off? Bullcrap. But wait, it gets worse.\n\nSomewhere along the way, the worker bees at Connect for Health Colorado dragooned us into an Obamacare exchange plan offered by Rocky Mountain Health without our knowledge or consent. (How else has the White House inflated Obamacare enrollment figures? Things that make you go \u201chmm.\u201d) Last month, we received an IRS 1095-A form, which, much to our shock and chagrin, indicated that we had paid Obamacare premiums every month during 2014.\n\nIt took hours of time on the phone and Internet to receive an explanation from Connect for Health Colorado on how exactly this happened. Here was the government\u2019s response, word for incomprehensible word:\n\n\u201cWe apologize for the delay in responding to your email. After checking your account we are showing you might have had coverage from October 2014 to June 2014. Please call the number below to speak with a Customer Service Representative if this information is incorrect.\u201d \u201cMight\u201d have had coverage? From \u201cOctober 2014 to June 2014\u201d?\n\nThe saga continues. We were finally able to un-enroll after being auto-enrolled in the Obamacare plan. Then, after being bounced around by the state government health exchange to various voicemail dead ends and back, with hours of migraine-inducing, on-hold music in between, we were told there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with the 1095-A form \u2014 which shows payment of premiums we didn\u2019t pay to an Obamacare plan we never enrolled in and didn\u2019t want in the first place!\n\nThis is just one little horror story. In Minnesota, thousands are still waiting for 1095-A forms that were supposed to arrive on Jan. 31. In California, at least 800,000 taxpayers received screwed-up 1095-As. As a result, some 50,000 people filed the wrong form. Another 750,000 are being told they\u2019ll get corrected forms this month. Hah. Good luck with that.\n\nThe costs in time, money and anxiety to hardworking families dealing with this paperwork perdition are enormous. Unknown numbers of people are still waiting for their forms as the April 15 tax-filing deadline looms. More face the added expense and aggravation of filing amended returns through no fault of their own.\n\nWhere\u2019s the rest of the media \u2014 most of whom have been insulated from these problems because they get their health insurance through their employers?\n\nAt least one other journalist smacked head first into reality. Laura Krantz, a former NPR staffer, is now a Scripps Fellow in environmental journalism at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Earlier this month, she found out that Connect for Health Colorado had mysteriously canceled her health and dental insurance. After four days and eight hours in Obamacare Phone Hell (OPH), she learned she had lost her insurance coverage and her tax credit \u2014 and had to redo all of her paperwork.\n\nPoor Krantz still believes the ultimate solution is \u201csingle payer.\u201d But another liberal who encountered 1095-A hell has seen the light. San Francisco resident and former Obama supporter Melissa Klein exposed her ordeal with Covered California last week. The state exchange botched her 1095-A and then insisted she had never enrolled despite invoices she showed them documenting her premium payments. After hours in OPH, her case remains unresolved, and she can\u2019t file her taxes. How is it, she wondered, that \u201cAmazon can ship something to NYC in an hour,\u201d but the White House and Covered California \u201ccan\u2019t create a health care system that functions\u201d?\n\nKlein concluded, better late than never: \u201cI no longer believe that the government should mandate health care. \u2026 A great idea is just an idea if you can\u2019t execute. And the government has proved time and time again, it can\u2019t execute.\u201d\n\nFeelin\u2019 your pain, sister. Is D.C. listening?\n\nAbout: Michelle Malkin\n\nMichelle Malkin is the author of \u201cCulture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks and Cronies\u201d & \u201cUnhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild\u201d.
