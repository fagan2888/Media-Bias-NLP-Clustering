While social conservatives and defenders of the First Amendment cheered, numerous prominent media organizations manipulated basic scientific facts to deny that the mandate \u2013 required by federal law \u2013 forces people to fund abortion-inducing drugs.\n\nThe New York Times has done this as has NBC News. While Pew Research did not deny that the mandate requires abortion funding, its weaselly assessment of the debate surrounding the mandate was almost as bad. To wit, Pew stated that many with religious beliefs \u201coppose abortion and believe that using emergency contraception like the morning-after pill is akin to abortion\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nLike Pew, Politico tried to have its cake and eat it, too (emphasis added):\n\nWhile the FDA calls those products [i.e., intrauterine devices (IUD) and \u201cmorning-after pills\u201d like Plan B and ella] contraception, many organizations say that they could prevent the implantation of a fertilized embryo, which they consider akin to abortion.\n\nThese excerpts are symptomatic of the media\u2019s aggressive push to frame the HHS mandate as a contraception issue. But the coverage of potentially abortifacient drugs like Plan B and ella, as well as indisputably abortifacient intrauterine devices (IUD), makes this an abortion issue as well.\n\nAs pointed out at JustFactsDaily.com last February:\n\n[R]egardless of whether Plan B, Next Choice, or ella cause abortion, the Obama administration is forcing insurers, and thus, their customers to pay for devices that destroy embryos before they implant, which many doctors, scientists, and citizens consider to be abortion.\n\nAnd this says nothing about IUDs, of which HHS\u2019s own Office of Women\u2019s Health says, \u201cIt [sic \u2013 If] fertilization does occur, the IUD keeps the fertilized egg from implanting in the lining of the uterus.\u201d\n\nSo how do the Times and other outlets justify their claim about the mandate\u2019s abortion requirements? They say life begins at implantation, not fertilization, and thus drugs and devices like Plan B, ella, and IUDs do not cause abortions.\n\nThis is a Clintonian strategy: it all depends on what the definition of \u201cconception\u201d is. Also \u201cpregnancy,\u201d \u201ccontraception,\u201d and \u201cabortion.\u201d\n\nFirst, \u201cconception\u201d: in 1965, the American Congress (then the \u201cCollege\u201d) of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)changed its definition of this term to denote implantation of a human blastocyst in the uterine wall, rather than the union of spermatazoon and ovum to form a unique single-celled human organism. Under this new definition of \u201cconception,\u201d any drug or device that destroys the new human being after fertilization but before attachment to the mother\u2019s uterus is a contraceptive rather than an abortifacient.\n\nBut doctors are not above being wrong. And with a moment\u2019s scrutiny, even the average citizen can tell that this definition is absurd.\n\nFirst and foremost, one can find ample scientific evidence that human life begins at fertilization. Likewise, embryology textbooks declare fertilization, not implantation, the beginning of a human\u2019s existence.\n\nOne can also simply apply common sense: are we human beings because of what we do (implant in our mothers\u2019 uteruses), or because of what we are (living organisms with human DNA)? The latter definition resonates on a fundamental level \u2013 indeed, advocacy groups from abolitionists to suffragettes have used it to push for rights and privileges based on common,inherent humanity, not on actions or behavior. Even homosexual activists use this tactic to great effect.\n\nWith the above understood, one\u2019s definition of \u201cconception\u201d will necessarily color what one means when referring to \u201ccontraception\u201d and \u201cabortion.\u201d Using ACOG\u2019s \u2013 and Planned Parenthood\u2019s \u2013 \u201cimplantation\u201d definition of conception (and, therefore, pregnancy), there would have to be six to twelve days when a woman\u2019s body shelters and supports a new human life \u2013 yet, according to ACOG, she is not pregnant.\n\nSemantic gyrations like these are as ludicrous after nine months as they are after nine days. Take the other end of the pregnancy spectrum: the left often defines abortion as \u201ctermination of pregnancy,\u201d which means that even C-sections and births by induced vaginal delivery qualify under this absurd definition, as do miscarriages.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that when one uses the accurate definitions of \u201cconception\u201d and \u201cpregnancy\u201d \u2014 founded on fertilization \u2014 any drug or device that prevents implantation in the mother\u2019s womb is an abortifacient. The copper IUD, included in HHS\u2019s mandate,qualifies without question, because it is designed to kill a baby after fertilization and before implantation.\n\nRegarding Plan B and ella, there is intense debate about whether these drugs, and others like them, interfere with implantation. However, Plan B\u2019s own packaging warns that the drug may destroy a newly conceived human being (referred to as \u201ca fertilized egg\u201d on the box), and the scientific evidence strongly indicates that ella kills \u201ca fertilized egg.\u201d\n\nOne might think the media was blissfully unaware of these facts. However, last week, NBC let the mask slip when its editors changed an originally correct article from noting that the mandate requires abortion coverage to the following (italics in original):\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story stated the Affordable Care Act requires companies to offer health-care coverage that provides abortion-inducing drugs to their employees. It does not.\n\nOn Twitter, NBC News White House Producer Shawna Thomas \u2013 listed as a contributor to the article \u2013 doubled down on the faulty \u201ccorrection\u201d:\n\n@DustinSiggins I contributed some info to the piece but was not the author. Originally article mistakenly said abortion-drugs were required. \u2014 Shawna Thomas (@ShawnaNBCNews) January 2, 2014 @DustinSiggins Contraception mandate covers Plan B. Sometimes this is erroneously called an abortifacient. \u2014 Shawna Thomas (@ShawnaNBCNews) January 2, 2014\n\nBut as the above information proves, for Thomas and her media colleagues to state that the HHS mandate does not require abortion-inducing drugs is disingenuous in the extreme. And while Pew and Politico do not go as far as their mainstream colleagues, they do give the impression that the mandate may end human life in the womb \u2013 even though IUDs unquestionably do this, and Plan B and ella likely do as well.\n\nIn 1973, the Supreme Court infamously decided that even though it \u201c[was] not in a position to speculate as to the answer\u201d of \u201cwhen life begins,\u201d it would err on the side of death. Over 40 years later, the media is setting the stage for the Obama administration to make the same fatal mistake.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Media Change Definition of Abortion to Promote Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Shortly before the new year, a number of religious organizations were given protection from the HHS abortion and contraception mandate. \u00a0While social conservat", "title": "Media Change Definition of Abortion to Promote Obamacare", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/01/08/media-change-definition-of-abortion-to-promote-obamacare/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mediabias6b-190x130.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "media change definition of abortion to promote obamacare", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd369b\"", "article_summary": "Shortly before the new year, a number of religious organizations were given protection from the HHS abortion and contraception mandate.\nThey say life begins at implantation, not fertilization, and thus drugs and devices like Plan B, ella, and IUDs do not cause abortions.\n\u2014 Shawna Thomas (@ShawnaNBCNews) January 2, 2014 @DustinSiggins Contraception mandate covers Plan B.\nRegarding Plan B and ella, there is intense debate about whether these drugs, and others like them, interfere with implantation.\nBut the coverage of potentially abortifacient drugs like Plan B and ella, as well as indisputably abortifacient intrauterine devices (IUD), makes this an abortion issue as well."}
