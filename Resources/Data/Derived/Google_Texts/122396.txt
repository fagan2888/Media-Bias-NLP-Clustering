President Barack Obama has had years to promote his signature health care reform. Now, with a near daily barrage of bad news tied to ObamaCare, from skyrocketing premiums to bald-face lies about its true nature, the president is reduced to working the talk show circuit like a B-lister promoting a cable pilot.

Obama’s latest celebrity interview will take place tomorrow from the cozy confines of Ellen DeGeneres’s daytime show. The talker will speak to Obama via a White House video feed in a last-ditch effort to coax young Americans to sign up for ObamaCare.

We last saw Obama yukking it up with Zach Galifianakis on the comedian’s Between Two Ferns comedy sketch. Before that, Vice President Joe Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama worked Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Tonight Show, respectively, to pitch the flailing heath care agenda.

Obama’s arrival on the national stage was met with a near-uniform belief that he could communicate and convince the masses in ways few other politicians could match. Today, after an endless barrage of speeches and the implementation of his signature legislative achievement, he must beam himself into a frothy daytime talk show to seal the deal.

This may not be the last we see of Obama on the pop culture radar. The deadline to sign up for ObamaCare is March 31, and he could always visit old pal Jimmy Fallon and “slow jam” the news before midnight strikes.
