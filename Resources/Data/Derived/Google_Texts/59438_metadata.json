Mr. Carter emphasized that the fighters are being trained solely to combat the Islamic State, not Mr. Assad\u2019s troops.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of those Syrians being trained attacking their U.S. teachers in a so called green-on-blue attack, Mr. Carter pointed to the thoroughness of the vetting program, as well as the security of the training location and the experience of the U.S. personnel running the training program.\n\nCongress approved the program to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels in December\u2019s annual defense policy bill in an effort to combat the growing threat of the Islamic State.\n\nMr. Carter said Syrians would receive compensation and be armed with \u201csmall arms and small unit arms.\u201d\n\nOver the past six weeks, Syrian rebels have made significant gains in the north of the country in the two-year fight against the Assad regime, Foreign Policy reported.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey said that the regime\u2019s momentum had been slowed and that while a transfer of power to a new regime would increase instability in the region, it would not change the U.S. mission there to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIL.\n\n\u201cFor us and our counter-ISIL strategy, it wouldn\u2019t change the dynamic except that we still have the fundamental challenge of finding moderate Syrian opposition men to train to be a stabilizing influence over time,\u201d Gen. Dempsey said. \u201cSo the challenge wouldn\u2019t change for us, but it would certainly make the situation for Syria more complicated.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Defense Secretary Ashton Carter announced Thursday that the U.S. is beginning to train a group of moderate rebels in fight the Islamic State in Syria.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Defense Secretary Ashton Carter announced Thursday that the U.S. is beginning to train a group of moderate rebels in fight the Islamic State in Syria.", "title": "U.S. beginning to train Syrians to fight Islamic State", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/7/us-beginning-train-syrians-fight-islamic-state/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/07/US_Syria_Training.JPEG-0bb48.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/07/US_Syria_Training.JPEG-0bb48.jpg", "description": "Defense Secretary Ashton Carter announced Thursday that the U.S. is beginning to train a group of moderate rebels in fight the Islamic State in Syria.", "card": "summary", "title": "U.S. beginning to train Syrians to fight Islamic State"}, "Author": "Jacqueline Klimas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict, Ashton Carter, Syria"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Carter emphasized that the fighters are being trained solely to combat the Islamic State, not Mr. Assad\u2019s troops.\nMr. Carter said that the U.S. would have a responsibility to protect Syrian forces if they got in trouble while fighting the Islamic State.\nCongress approved the program to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels in December\u2019s annual defense policy bill in an effort to combat the growing threat of the Islamic State.\nDefense Secretary Ashton Carter announced Thursday that the U.S. is beginning to train a group of moderate rebels to fight the Islamic State in Syria and acknowledged U.S. assets would support those troops in battle against the terrorist group.\nSEE ALSO: Senate forces Obama to submit Iran nuclear deal for congressional approvalVolunteers for the program go through an extensive vetting process before beginning the training program: three weeks of training, one week off, followed by an additional three weeks of training."}
