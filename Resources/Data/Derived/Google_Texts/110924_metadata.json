At a press conference Wednesday morning, Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-KS) used her turn at the microphone to recite a joke by Conan O\u2019Brien, then cite other sources of jokes, before explaining that \u201cnothing is funny about losing your health care plan,\u201d unless you got it from Healthcare.gov. Then, it\u2019s apparently fine.\n\nRep. Jenkins stepped to the microphone after several other Republican House members tried out their new \u201cObamacare is the glitch\u2122\u201d talking point, and launched right into a bit from Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s TBS show. Any comic will tell you that nothing improves material quite like having it recited on C-Span by a member of the House of Representatives (Senators have no delivery), and Jenkins did not disappoint.\n\n\u201cConan said, the other night,\u201d Jenkins began, \u201cObama is now urging Americans having trouble with the website to call 1-800. A 1-800 number. The number is 1-800-we don\u2019t think. We didn\u2019t think this through.\u201d\n\nJenkins added that \u201cWhether it\u2019s Fallon, or Conan or Jon Stewart, Saturday Night Live, all the jokes keep going on and on and on, but nothing is funny about losing your health care plan when you already had what you liked and you wanted to keep it. Nothing\u2019s funny about being forced on a website that doesn\u2019t work, to buy health insurance that you don\u2019t want and can\u2019t afford. And it\u2019s even less funny when a government tax is hanging over your head and you don\u2019t have hours on end to go through the whole circus. This Obamacare exchange has been a complete and total failure and it\u2019s unacceptable. The American people deserve better.\u201d\n\nThe problems with the website have been monumental, to be sure, but they have also exposed a tremendous demand, and an overwhelming public desire to see the law enacted. If Republicans think they can convince people to abandon the law, and throw people like the fainting lady back on the mercy of insurance companies, they\u2019re going to need more than a couple of late-night wisecracks to do it.\n\nHere\u2019s the video, via C-Span, followed by Conan\u2019s actual monologue:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\nHere\u2019s Conan\u2019s actual monologue, via TBS:\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives have a new, airtight case against Obamacare, the health care law that 66% of Americans want to see work: late night comics are making jokes about", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/conan.jpg", "title": "GOP Rep.
