Officer McGuire was hospitalized with bleeding on his brain, but has been recovering and will be released Monday, according to the Wagner Police Department's Facebook page. He released this statement Monday:

"I'd like to thank everyone for your thoughts and well-wishes. I'd like to give a special thank you to Wagner officers DesaRae Gravatt and Shane Larson for their assistance; as well as the FBI, DCI, Charles Mix County Sheriff's Office, Gregory County Sheriff's Office, Douglas County Sheriff's Office and the Yankton Sioux Tribal Police for your response.

Even though this is an unfortunate situation, every officer understands this is part of the job. I am hoping to return to work within a week."

Golus is currently in the Charles Mix County Jail facing charges of assaulting a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest and ingesting a controlled substance.
