For example, see the Mark-Udall-for-Senate campaign\u2019s recent claim that Charles and David Koch want to \u201ctrap \u2026 Colorado families in poverty.\u201d This comment echoes Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s recent statement that the Kochs are \u201cun-American.\u201d Such attacks are directed at everyone who supports the same causes as the Kochs, including the two of us.\n\nThese attacks are blatantly false. We want nothing more than to help the least fortunate.\n\nWe have devoted our lives to lifting people out of poverty. That\u2019s why the two of us proudly stand by the Kochs\u2019 side and support their efforts to defend limited government and the free market. We believe that the free market \u2014 a system in which individuals make choices for themselves, rather than politicians or bureaucrats making choices for them \u2014 is the surest way to raise everyone\u2019s standard of living.\n\nAmerican history bears this out. Since states amended their constitutions in the first half of the 19th century to include \u201cgeneral incorporation laws,\u201d which allow businesses to form without express government approval, individuals and entrepreneurs \u2014 rather than bureaucrats and politicians \u2014 have driven the economic advances that we now take for granted. They have done so by creating products that improve people\u2019s lives. Think of Edison Electric, Ford Motor Company, Sears, Berkshire Hathaway, Wal-Mart, Apple, Google, Uber, and thousands of other historical and modern day examples.\n\nGovernment has an important role to play in facilitating such a system. It must establish a legal system that treats everyone equally \u2014 no subsidies, loopholes, exemptions, special interest giveaways, etc. It must also craft sensible regulations that encourage responsible business practices, rather than burdensome ones that hinder innovation and economic progress.\n\nThis system is increasingly under threat. In their zeal to regulate and mandate both how businesses operate and individuals live, politicians have created a system in which entrepreneurs must focus on keeping government happy, rather than customers. Unsurprisingly, this encourages and empowers lobbyists, not consumers.\n\nAmericans see this all around us, hence the frequent \u2014 and accurate \u2014 complaints that special interests have too much power in Washington. Such is the nature of an ever-larger government \u2014 it gives special interests more reason and opportunities to grease the wheels of power.\n\nOur businesses are good examples of the power of free market innovation absent undue government interference. Twenty-two years ago, we started a technology company that helped catalyze the American shale oil and gas revolution. We did so by inventing, innovating, and experimenting with the technologies involved in hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking.\u201d\n\nOur work has benefited Americans in two main ways:\n\nFirst, the shale boom has lowered annual energy costs by an average of $1,500 per American family. Natural gas is now more than 50 percent cheaper than it is in Europe or Asia, where fracking is essentially non-existent. This lowers heating and electricity bills, which eat up a larger percentage of the poor\u2019s disposable income, while lowering prices on everyday goods at the grocery store and elsewhere.\n\nSecond, fracking creates well-paying jobs. Here in Colorado, it created more than 77,000 jobs by 2012. The cheap energy that\u2019s flowing from fracking has even led to a rebound in American manufacturing. Overall, it supports at least 1.7 million jobs across the country \u2014 a number that may rise to 3.5 million within two decades.\n\nThese benefits have been enhanced and protected by Colorado\u2019s strict and sensible regulation of fracking. Yet now politicians in Colorado and bureaucrats in Washington are trying to curtail or shut down fracking altogether. Our industry now has to divert efforts away from improvements in fracking technology \u2014 which will bring economic benefits to a larger number of people \u2014 and toward government lobbying.\n\nThis perverts and ultimately destroys the free market \u2014 and it helps no one. It only harms the poor and the middle class who benefit from the cheap energy, increased jobs, and the stimulus effects our work has across the wider economy.\n\nThis is why we proudly stand with the Kochs. Whether the issue is energy, health care, housing, or anything else, our experience shows us that individuals and innovators are better at helping the poor than politicians or bureaucrats.\n\nChris and Liz Wright live in Denver.
