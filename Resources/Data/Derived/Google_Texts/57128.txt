Talkshow host Conan O’Brien poked fun at Vice President Biden this week for using the double negative when asked if he plans to run for president in 2016.

On an Amtrak train last week, Biden was asked that question in an interview on CNN.

“There may be reasons I don’t run but there’s no obvious reason for me why I think I should not run,” Biden said.

On TBS’s “Conan” this week, O’Brien aired a fake ad, which he said would be the first of Biden’s campaign.

“I’m Joe Biden and I don’t not fully and especially not partially endorse this message,” a person pretending to be Biden said at the end.

Biden said on CNN he would likely make a decision about a White House bid during the summer of 2015.

He previously ran for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008.

Hillary Clinton is considered the clear front-runner in the 2016 primary race if she decides to run.
