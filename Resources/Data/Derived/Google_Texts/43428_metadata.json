It has one the highest rates of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes in the country, as well as the highest mortality rate for infants and adults.\n\n\n\nThese ills are worst among its black residents: 43.2 percent of Mississippi blacks are afflicted by obesity and its associated problems and 44 percent live at or below the poverty line, compared with a\u2014still high\u201430.2 percent obesity rate and 16 percent poverty rate for whites. Which is to say that, more than anywhere else, the Affordable Care Act is necessary in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nBut, as Sarah Varney describes in a vital piece for Politico Magazine, the state\u2019s Tea Party\u2013tinged Republican leadership\u2014including Gov. Phil Bryant\u2014refuses to budge.\n\n\n\nNot only did it shutter a state-run private exchange for individuals to purchase health insurance, it refused the Medicaid expansion, which would have extended coverage to those living in desperate poverty. The latter consequence is especially destructive.\n\n\n\nAs designed, the Affordable Care Act (e.g. Obamacare) provides Medicaid for everyone at or below 133 percent of the poverty line and subsidized private insurance for everyone above. Chief Justice John Roberts and the Supreme Court made the expansion optional, but they failed to extend the subsidies to poorer families, which left a gap. If you\u2019re too poor to qualify for subsidies\u2014but don\u2019t qualify for the present Medicaid program in your state\u2014you\u2019re left in the cold. In Mississippi, this leaves 138,000 residents\u2014most of them black\u2014with no insurance options at all.\"\n\n\n\nBouie claims it's easy to explain why Mississippi Republicans refuse to work with the ACA: \"A hyper-ideological, small government conservatism that disdains social programs and public investment. But it\u2019s worth a look at the history behind that conservatism, which lives strongest in Mississippi but exists throughout the Deep South.\"\n\n\n\nHe points out something that few northerners may give a second thought about. Mississippi, which has the largest black population in the country, has a \"threadbare\" safety net for its citizens and is the state where \"slavery was very lucrative and Jim Crow the most vicious.\"\n\n\n\nThis is not a coincidence, maintains the author who points out the state as well as the Deep South in general are places where \"white supremacy brought a politics of racist antagonism.\"\n\n\n\nFor instance, the Civil War was hardly over before Mississippi passed the first of the \u201cBlack Codes\u201d that would limit freedom for freed people.\n\n\n\nDuring the civil rights movement of the 1960's, white supremacists \"built a network of state and private agencies to wreak havoc on black activists with surveillance, economic reprisals, and extreme violence.\"\n\n\n\nAnd all of that deeply ingrained history, writes Bouie has carved deep marks in the state's ongoing culture and the ideas of \"exclusion,\" and specifically, of racial hostility to outside interference and public goods are still embedded in the structure of its politics. Public investment isn\u2019t just disdained, \"it\u2019s attacked as racially suspect.\"\n\n\n\nThe full piece can be found\n\n(NATIONAL) -- What might America look like under a strong Tea Party run White House and U.S. Congress?
