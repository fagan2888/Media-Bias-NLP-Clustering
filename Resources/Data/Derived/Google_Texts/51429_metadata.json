The bikers brought in hundreds of toys today, which will be distributed to kids in need by the Salvation Army. Director Doug Bates says this event is a win-win for everyone who rides.\n\n\"We like to ride first. Then we can ride and do something else good, too. So that's the whole purpose,\" he says.\n\nSanta led the way for this brigade on his one-of-a-kind motorcycle. These toys will be added to the salvation army's already-huge collection. Bates says this event has grown every year. And next year's goal is to fill up two trucks instead of just one.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Bikers brought in hundreds of toys for their 14th annual Toy Run at Chunky River Harley Davidson.", "language": "english", "author": "Candace Barnette", "og": {"description": "Bikers brought in hundreds of toys for their 14th annual Toy Run at Chunky River Harley Davidson.", "title": "Bikers Load Hundreds of Gifts for Chunky River Toy Run", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Bikers-Load-Hundreds-of-Gifts-for-Chunky-River-Toy-Run-285717301.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/7F9/6B4/7F96B457AC234E58B43473F40BD3C44C", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/74F/35D/74F35D0C5BBD4A7D915D146D4A9343F2.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Bikers brought in hundreds of toys for their 14th annual Toy Run at Chunky River Harley Davidson.", "title": "Bikers Load Hundreds of Gifts for Chunky River Toy Run", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Bikers-Load-Hundreds-of-Gifts-for-Chunky-River-Toy-Run-285717301.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/chunky+river+(400x248).jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Bikers Load Hundreds of Gifts for Chunky River Toy Run", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bikers Load Hundreds of Gifts, for Chunky River Toy Run"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc0e4\"", "article_summary": "has been teaming up with the Chunky River Harley Davidson for its annual Toy Run.\nFor 14 years, Chunky River H.O.G.\nThe bikers brought in hundreds of toys today, which will be distributed to kids in need by the Salvation Army.\nA local group of bikers showed Saturday that despite the tough leather they wear outside, on the inside, they're soft-hearted.\nDirector Doug Bates says this event is a win-win for everyone who rides."}
