Alex Mooney (R-WV) wasn\u2019t prepared for the lengthy battle he was about to endure when he and his wife Grace tried to put their newborn girl Camille on their health insurance plan. Yet, thanks to the overbearing bureaucratic process of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, that seemingly simple action became World War Three.\n\nAppearing on Fox News\u2019 \u201cVarney & Co.\u201d Friday, Rep. Mooney explained why their daughter, born in October, wasn\u2019t added to their insurance plan until late January.\n\nThe Mooneys\u2019 headache was brought on by Obamacare\u2019s bureaucratic procedure. You see, in order to add your newborn to your insurance plan you have to apply for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and be either accepted or denied. It is an income-based plan, yet even if you know your income is above the threshold and you won\u2019t qualify for CHIP, you nonetheless have to fill out an application and wait for a response. The entire process often takes longer than the 30-day period parents have to add their newborns to their plans.\n\nSince parents aren\u2019t getting their rejection letters back until after the 30-day deadline, they can\u2019t add a child to their plan until the open enrollment period. This means, they are responsible for any medical costs until that period.\n\nMooney is not the only parent who has had to battle the HHS. KUTV.com reported on the plights of three families with newborns who tried to sign their children up through CHIP and similarly missed the deadline. One mother, Maggie, lamented the fact she knew she wouldn\u2019t qualify and saw no reason for submitting an application, \u201cbut they said we had to.\u201d The reporter concluded it is \u201cimpossible\u201d for many of these parents to add their new babies to their plans:\n\n\u201cThey are getting stuck with massive labor and delivery bills they should not have to pay.\u201d\n\nAfter their report on how newborns are being rejected insurance, KUTV reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services for an explanation. The agency responded with this helpful information:\n\n\u201cIt is important to answer all the questions on the application, so the child can receive a correct eligibility determination\u2026To avoid a delay in coverage, parents are encouraged to return to the marketplace to report a birth\u2026as soon as they can.\u201d\n\nIn case you couldn\u2019t tell in my lead in to the quote, my use of \u201chelpful\u201d was sarcastic.\n\nAfter KUTV contacted HHS, the local news station received at least 15 calls from other parents dealing with the same Big Government obstacles. Oh yeah, and each of the three families featured in the segment suddenly heard back that their newborn children had been added to their plans.\n\nFancy that.\n\nSeeking to draw attention to Obamacare\u2019s unfair bureaucratic process, Rep. Mooney is writing a letter to HHS Secretary Silvia Mathews Burwell asking for clarification on the marketplace website. For instance, online it says you have 60 days to report a new birth, but in reality it\u2019s being treated as a regular life event that you have 30 days to report. Mooney also wants clearer language regarding CHIP, as well as the process for getting covered if you miss the deadline \u2013 right now there is no clear alternative option.\n\n\u201cThis is the latest highlight of the terrible effects of putting federal bureaucracy in between a family and their healthcare decisions, \u201c Mooney said. \u201cThe terrible financial impact of having a newborn go uncovered is wreaking havoc on struggling young families. I can attest to the absurdity of this process having lived through it myself in the last year, and being prevented from adding my newborn baby to my family\u2019s insurance plan.\u201d\n\nMoral of the story?
