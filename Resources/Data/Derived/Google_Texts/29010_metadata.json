The Congressional Budget Office estimates this will involve more than $300 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage through 2023.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRepublicans implied the administration is \u201cmasking\u201d the cuts right now to prevent them from angering voters in an election year by increasing bonuses to a growing number of plan providers this year.\n\nRep. Kevin Brady Kevin BradyIRS doubted legality of ObamaCare payments, former official says Report: Pacific trade pact would boost growth, jobs and incomes Puerto Rico debt becomes constitutional fight on the right MORE (R-Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health, at a Thursday hearing said people will really feel the pain of the cuts next year.\n\n\u201cThe difficult reality is 2015 is now upon us and millions of seniors who rely on the Medicare Advantage program may be in jeopardy of losing their plan, their doctor, and the financial protection and benefits they have chosen,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicare Advantage provides more services than traditional Medicare programs through private insurance providers. Brady argued the plans are particularly popular with low income and minority seniors.\n\nThree panelists at the hearing representing insurance and physician groups and a conservative think-tank warned insurers are being forced to cut coverage or pull out of regions altogether because of the impending cuts.\n\nHowever, Rep. Jim McDermott Jim McDermottLawmakers urge Obama not to send shoulder-fired missiles to Syria GOP group promises ObamaCare replacement plan \u2014 soon Sanders fundraising for 3 House candidates MORE (D-Wash.), the subcommittee's ranking member, called them \u201charbingers of disaster\u201d and insisted the cuts in question have been happening since 2011 without hurting seniors.\n\nHe said the Medicare Advantage program had actually improved access to healthcare and reduced costs.
