Alleged criminals are accused of taking the lives of Oklahoma’s finest this year - a state labor commissioner, an OHP trooper and the innocent audience members of a homecoming parade. Also in 2015, some major criminal cases moved closer toward justice, while others sparked governmental changes. Here is a look back at some of the most significant crimes that impacted our state this year.

It became illegal to text and drive in Oklahoma because of Steven Wayne Clark, now convicted of first-degree manslaughter for what he did January. Police said Clark blew through a crash scene in Seminole County and badly hurt an OHP trooper and killed another. Clark was recently sentenced to five years in prison.

And in June of this year, another crash killed a beloved sports broadcaster, Bob Barry Jr.

Gustavo Castillo Gutierrez was charged with causing an accident without a valid driver's license and drug possession.

Then in late August, tragedy struck and Oklahoma family and the Oklahoma Department of Labor.

Christian Costello was accused of stabbing his father, Mark Costello, the state labor commissioner, to death at an Oklahoma City Braum’s.

And there was big news in October with a break in the case of a missing Midwest City girl, Kirsten Hatfield. On a DNA match, police arrested Anthony Palma, who lived next door to her 18 years ago, on complaints of first degree murder and kidnapping. Then a search of his land for her body came up empty.

And a few weeks later - it was OSU's homecoming parade. On October 24, Adacia Chambers, 25, drove her vehicle into a crowd of spectators, killed four people and injured dozens of others. A judge recently ruled Chambers is competent to stand trial.

In December, a former Oklahoma City police officer accused of preying on women while on the job learned his fate. Daniel Holtzclaw sobbed when the guilty verdict was read on 18 of 36 counts of sex crimes. The jury recommended 263 years in prison.
