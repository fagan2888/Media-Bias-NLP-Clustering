This contributed to the highest stage of imperialism and resulted in Africa not being conquered and made prostate. It also contributed to World War I and promoted classic fascism in Italy.\n\n\n\nIn 1936, Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia, appeared before and appealed to the League of Nations denouncing Italian aggression and insisting that the world body condemn such imperialist adventurism when Italy invaded his country.\n\n\n\nIn summing up his address, the Emperor prophetically reminded, \u0093Today for me, tomorrow for You.\u0094\n\n\n\nAs such, in three years, World War II broke out engulfing the world in the most cataclysmic devastation that threatened the very survival of nations and people. In present circumspect reflection, we must be careful not to allow history to be repeated as elements posture on the brink of such devastatingly threatening developments.\n\n\n\nFor nearly eight years Republicans from the highest leadership to rank and file have allowed, engaged in, and meticulously callously pilloried President Obama, staining the Republican \"brand\u0094 and in the process the United States Presidency, the same office GOP contenders aspire to today.\n\n\n\nThe character assassination has been relentless: from \u0093nigger in the White House,\u0094 to allegedly being \"unpatriotic,\" being a \"socialist,\" who was anti-capital, being a closet Muslim, \u0093poisoning the Well\u0094, being a Kenyan, \u0093palling around with terrorist,\u0094 lacking in \u0093testicular fortitude,\u0094 and presiding over a \u0093gangsta\" administration.\n\n\n\nA national child-like but poisonous charade, the Birther Movement launched. The insidious and dangerous vindictive Republican underbelly was exposed for all to see. There was unbridled oral diarrhea on the part of Republicans such as Donald Trump, Michele Bachmann, Rick Santorum, Senator Charles Grassley, Rep. Joe Wilson who infamously interrupted Obama's State of the Union speech with a \"you lie\" shout, and Senator Jim DeMint who was sure Republicans would turn the fight over the Affordable Care Act into Obama's Waterloo.\n\n\n\nAll these hateful attacks going beyond the realm of mere political differences paved the way to the kind of comments we hear today with GOP candidate Ben Carson claiming \u0093Obamacare is worse than Slavery\u0094 and that Syrian refugees were like \"rabid dogs.\"\n\n\n\nThe New York Daily News has labeled Donald Trump a \u0093clown\u0094 perhaps because of his Birther charade; one local paper recently labeled him \u0093chump;\u0094 much of this due to his newly-minted insulting callousness characterizing Mexicans as rapists, criminals and drug dealers. He said he would \u0093build a wall;\u0094 he mockingly attacked Carly Fiorina\u0092s face; he claimed \u0093Iowans are stupid\u0094 for leaning to vote for Ben Carson, when Carson briefly led in the polls. His newest \u0093Lulu\u0094 of \u0093excluding Muslims\u0094 seems rescued fresh from the dark strain of American conscience.\n\nYet, many of the 30% Republican voters who support him see him as worth an applause, worth a standing ovation, and give unquestioned support much of which Alan Dershowitz explained as being \u0093inconsistent with the character of this country.\u0094\n\n\n\nAs the verbal mayhem unfolds the world must watch and wonder; isn\u0092t the ugly American abroad or is he now at home?\n\n\n\nThat designation and the active anti-Obama vituperative accusations with resultant threats to the President and his family, earned Republicans the designation \u0093Party of No\u0094 particularly because they blocked every legislative initiative President Obama proposed.\n\n\n\nThe GOP vociferously and vituperatively attacked his Affordable Care Act law; they eviscerated his Jobs Bill; they challenged the Asian Trade Deal he crafted; they block his immigration initiative; and, they criticized his Cuban embargo breakout with establishment of mutual embassies.\n\n\n\nThey claim he's \"soft on terror\" and say he's pursuing a failed policy on Iraq and Syria. In fact, as a thinker, President Obama has applied an analytically meticulous mindset in a new age of modern warfare and is not falling into an Isis or Al Qaeda trap. He is seeking to garner an active and effective Middle Eastern Coalition as he pounds ISIS encampments while proclaiming no significant boots on the ground.\n\n\n\nKeen observers notice how statesmanlike President Obama appeared to be at the recent Global Climate Change conference in Paris. Espousing that presidential demeanor without question, observers believe none of the 16 Republican contenders would probably have been perceived as resolute American ambassadors as President Obama appeared.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, recent developments point to, some believe, one frightening specter Donald Trump represents to the Republican Party and the facetious representative of the American brand particularly as a potential Commander-in-Chief. This is not only unsettling but can be more dangerous than America\u0092s most virulent enemies hope to be.\n\n\n\nBecause over the last several years Americans did not turn off the Trump spigot, his bigotry is now full blown. He needs to stop spewing such pathological and deep-seated polluted beliefs for such bigotry goes against and will pose a serious problem for the American brand going forward.\n\n\n\nTrump\u0092s most vocal supporters need to take note: Fareed Zakaria spoke of the \u0093rise of the rest\u0094; President Obama recognized America\u0092s approach to the world and that its challenges cannot be met by using Roosevelt\u0092s \u0093big stick\u0094 approached but more of a \u0093smart heart\u0094; President Clinton\u0092s dictum was \u0093America\u0092s greatness lies in its moral not military might.\u0094\n\n\n\nThe Republicans' fools rush in where wise men fail to tread strategy is more appropriate to the horse and buggy era rather than today\u0092s analectic post jet-age speed age.\n\n\n\nRepublicans may disagree with President Obama\u0092s incremental progression in economic and financial policy; the reality is job growth increased tremendously, housing starts have increased, the auto industry is booming, research and development in education and science is very encouraging, and unemployment declined towards the 5 percent historic lows.\n\n\n\nOn Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average is beginning to bang the door at 18,000, up from the 6,500 when Obama's first term began.\n\n\n\nEven Trump and his supporters and associates are laughing all the way to the bank from this financial windfall.\n\n\n\nCollege enrollment is up and also Affordable Care Act registration has topped the 16 million mark. In his studied and sure-footed approach, Mr. Obama has achieved a great deal despite Republican obstructionism and he has masterfully represented the nation in presenting a climate change proposal that became part of the historic deal in Paris.\n\n\n\nReal-politik dictates: the Iran Deal is in full-swing and the strange bedfellows of Mullahs, Bashar Assad, Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin must lay in bed with Francoise Hollande, Angela Merkel and David Cameron to effectively bring Middle Eastern states into coalition to defeat Isis.\n\n\n\nTaking the long view in a more sophisticated military strategy, in his policies Mr. Obama has remained actively and intelligently involved and must get credit for reducing American military casualties.\n\n\n\nHowever, as the \u0093Pied Piper\u0094 keeps thundering towards the cliffs of oblivion carrying his loyal supporters into that chasm, we wonder where are the Republican men of substance demonstrating \u0093testicular fortitude\u0094 will stand and condemn this dangerous foray into extremely vile and divisive rhetoric.\n\n\n\nAs the old adage holds \u0093when the enemy begins to self-destruct, stay quiet,\u0094 so President Obama remains mum. Some Republicans now realize the danger, including even Dick Chaney. Others sounding warning of what Trump and his like have unleashed include: Speaker Paul Ryan; Jeb Bush; Nikki Haley; and even Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley.\n\n\n\nAs a result of Donald Trump\u0092s insensitivities many project a possible Clinton occupancy of the White House again.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, America\u0092s enemies have been handed tremendous propaganda ammunition and after he is \"fired\u0094 apprentice Trump will have to explain his anti-Muslim statements to Middle Eastern Arabs and Muslim partners and business associates.\n\n\n\nA CNN anchor recently hosted a focus group and a two-term New Hampshire representative, a trump supporter, went on ad nausea that President Obama is a \u0093liar\u0094 and \u0093when he spoke last Sunday he was lying to the nation.\u0094 Turns out this woman was an active \u0093Birther\u0094 advocate allied with Donald Trump\u0092s fool\u0092s errand.\n\n\n\nNow, like a spoiled child, Donald Trump is threatening to run as an independent candidate.\n\n\n\nTrump's action will make the next president\u0092s job more difficult; Mr. Trump himself will go on to make more money in his business ventures.\n\n\n\nThanks to Mr. Trump the voters may throw out the Republican bums at the next election. Say what anyone will, President Obama\u0092s legacy as per Paul Krugman\u0092s \u0093greatest president ever\u0094 assessment may further materialize because there is still much more to come.\n\n\n\nObama continues to build up accomplishments despite the actions of the GOP a.k.a. the \u0093Party of No.\u0094\n\n\n\nHave we learned any lessons from the hate that allowed Trump to thrive?\n\n\n\nRecall once more Selassie's words as unchallenged hate hovered over Ethiopia: \u0093Today for me, tomorrow for You.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dc": {"title": "Trumpism:  The Hate That Hate Begat, Or Chickens Coming Home To Roost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Keen observers notice how statesmanlike President Obama appeared to be at the recent Global Climate Change conference in Paris.\nAs the old adage holds \u0093when the enemy begins to self-destruct, stay quiet,\u0094 so President Obama remains mum.\nSay what anyone will, President Obama\u0092s legacy as per Paul Krugman\u0092s \u0093greatest president ever\u0094 assessment may further materialize because there is still much more to come.\nNow, like a spoiled child, Donald Trump is threatening to run as an independent candidate.\nTrump's action will make the next president\u0092s job more difficult; Mr. Trump himself will go on to make more money in his business ventures."}
