Shampoo hasn't touched her red locks in more than three years.\n\nInstead, every 10 days, Aitken Read pours vinegar on her hair or cracks an egg over her head.\n\n\"If you can't eat it, don't wash your hair with it. If you can eat it, then you should jolly well try and see what it does for your hair! It might be amazing!\" Aitken Read says in a video on her blog.\n\nOn her blog, Lulastic and the Hippyshake, Aitken Read wrote her hair is actually shinier and grows faster than it did when she used shampoo.\n\nThe Huffington Post reports Aitken Read stopped using shampoo after she learned it could contain potentially harmful chemicals: \"I always thought I'd used organic, healthy shampoo, but when I went upstairs and grabbed the bottle I was using I realized the ingredients were full of synthetic chemicals I'd never heard of.\"\n\nSo what are some other alternatives to shampoo besides eggs and vinegar?\n\nA writer for Mother Earth Living suggests massaging baking soda into wet hair, saying it \"removes styling product buildup.\"\n\nAnd The Hippy Homemaker blog gives a few other options, such as using herbal infused tea, clay and honey in place of shampoo.\n\nFor healthier hair, Aitken Read also suggests washing your hair less often each week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lucy Aitken Read stopped using shampoo after she read it might have potentially harmful chemicals.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Lucy Aitken Read stopped using shampoo after she read it might have potentially harmful chemicals.", "title": "Woman Hasn't Used Shampoo In More Than 3 Years", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/woman-hasn-t-used-shampoo-in-more-than-3-years/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1438088870.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lucy Aitken Read stopped using shampoo after she read it might have potentially harmful chemicals.", "title": "Woman Hasn't Used Shampoo In More Than 3 Years", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/woman-hasn-t-used-shampoo-in-more-than-3-years/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1438088870.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=IxaHBqdjqp46fdjpek6yw-ejed3doROA&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://49538", "iphone": "newsy://49538", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://49538", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "lucy aitkin read,lucy aikin read shampoo,woman doesn't use shampoo,woman hasn't used shampoo in 3 years,no shampoo,shampoo alternatives,aol,newsy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1438088870.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Lucy Aitken Read stopped using shampoo after she read it might have potentially harmful chemicals.\nOn her blog, Lulastic and the Hippyshake, Aitken Read wrote her hair is actually shinier and grows faster than it did when she used shampoo.\nFor healthier hair, Aitken Read also suggests washing your hair less often each week.\nAitken Read says in a video on her blog.\nWell, meet Lucy Aitken Read."}
