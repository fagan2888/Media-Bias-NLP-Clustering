So, why Gawker? Why now?\n\nGABRIEL ARANA, HUFFINGTON POST: So, when you talk to workers, the purported reason for organizing wasn\u2019t because they were upset with management. They weren\u2019t unhappy.\n\nIt was because they wanted more transparency in the way things like salaries are decided, things like bonuses are decided.\n\nRight now, those things are subject to individual negotiations, and nobody sort of knows what the rules are for everybody.\n\nAnd so, the goal was to bring more transparency to that process. And then, also, as the industry is maturing, people want security.\n\nPeople want protection into the future. And Gawker might be a great place to work now, but nobody knows what future holds, what sort of economic challenges, structural changes the company will go through.\n\nSo, it\u2019s really, for the future, for transparency, and then for stability.\n\nALISON STEWART: I\u2019m wondering about how the idea of unions will mesh with the sort of free-wheeling spirit of the Internet.\n\nGABRIEL ARANA: I think that unions are going to have to do more of the learning, because tech workers, high-skill workers, millennials \u2014 of which I am one \u2014 we didn\u2019t grow up in a union environment and \u2014 I mean, which is one of the things that makes the effort really exciting for the labor movement.\n\nThere have been many efforts to organize the tech sector, to organize software engineers that have been largely unsuccessful, but here you have a really young workforce voting to unionize and in a nascent and thriving industry and especially as the unionization rates have declined over the last few decades. This is a sign of life.\n\nALISON STEWART: Is this going to be one of those moments they look to back in history and were like, that was a turning point in the Internet culture?\n\nGABRIEL ARANA: I think so. I think this is the beginning of a trend, and as the industry matures, as it grows, you\u2019re going to see many more organizing efforts at similar digital media companies.\n\nALISON STEWART: Placing like Huffington Post or Vox Media. This is going to become the new normal, perhaps?\n\nGABRIEL ARANA: I\u2019d say there are a few things that were unusual about the Gawker union vote that you might not \u2014 that might not be the case for other companies.\n\nALISON STEWART: What were they?\n\nGABRIEL ARANA: So, the entire vote at Gawker was actually really easy.\n\nUsually when workers announce an effort to organize, there is a concerted campaign on the part of management to convince workers not to organize.\n\nBut you really saw none of that in this case.\n\nManagement took a relatively hands-off approach, and sort of in keeping with Gawker\u2019s culture, with their commitment to radical transparency, employees debated openly about the benefits and downside of organizing on Gawker\u2019s own site in public view \u2014 not to say there haven\u2019t been any problems.\n\nThere are some complaints that communication between organizers and the staff could have been better.\n\nSo, it wasn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s really remarkable for management\u2019s relatively hands-off approach.\n\nLabor leaders might hope that that will be the case everywhere. I think that the history of American labor cautions you to be careful.\n\nALISON STEWART: Gabriel Arana from Huffington Post, thanks so much.\n\nGABRIEL ARANA: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the first time ever, workers at a major online media outlet, Gawker Media, voted earlier this week in a landslide to unionize.
