Still, Acela only averages 80 miles per hour and can reach up to 150 mph for just 10 minutes compared to the average top speed of high-speed trains in Europe that can reach 220 mph. According to The Times, it would cost upwards of $150 billion and 26 more years for the Acela to ever reach that.\n\nRelated: Obamanomics 101: A Reckless Risk on High Speed Rail\n\nMany think the only hope for now high-speed rail rests with California. For the past year, the state\u2019s proposed project was embroiled in legal drama after a Sacramento Superior Court sided with farmers and residents who filed a suit to stop the bullet train. But just last week, the 3rd District Court of Appeals in California struck down that ruling, paving the way for California to move forward with the project and sell $8.6 billion in bonds to pay for the high-speed rail, The San Jose Mercury News reported.\n\n\u201cOnce something gets built, then we\u2019re going to see more projects get going,\u201d Obama\u2019s first transportation secretary, Ray LaHood told The Times, adding that it took the Interstate System of highways decades to be completed.\n\nRelated: Fix Infrastructure Now, or Apologize for It Forever\n\nStill, it\u2019s unclear whether other states will follow suit\u2014especially in Republican states like Wisconsin, where Gov. Scott Walker has routinely blasted Obama\u2019s plan as expensive and pointless.\n\n\u201cTypically the reason people take mass transit is because it saves them time and/or money. This did neither,\u201d Walker told The Washington Post after he rejected $823 million in federal funding for the project last year. Those funds were transferred to California\u2019s project\u2014which has received one-third of the total allocated to all states so far.\n\nEven if California\u2019s project does take off successfully, it\u2019s hardly the vision President Obama had initially talked about when making his push for high-speed rail during his first term in office.\n\n\u201cWithin 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail,\u201d Obama said in his 2011 State of the Union address.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Obama administration has spent almost $11 billion to build a high-speed rail syste", "title": "Obama\u2019s $11 Billion High Speed Rail to Nowhere", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/07/Obama-s-11-Million-High-Speed-Rail-Nowhere", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07172013_High_Speed_Train_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/07/Obama-s-11-Million-High-Speed-Rail-Nowhere", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07172013_High_Speed_Train_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Obama administration has spent almost $11 billion to build a high-speed rail syste", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Obamanomics 101: A Reckless Risk on High Speed RailMany think the only hope for now high-speed rail rests with California.\nThe Obama administration has spent almost $11 billion to build a high-speed rail system that doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere.\n\u201cWithin 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail,\u201d Obama said in his 2011 State of the Union address.\nRelated: Government Blatantly Wastes $30 Billion This YearJust last month, Congress rejected the administration\u2019s request for an additional $10 billion for high-speed rail and last year, three governors canceled their federal funding for the projects\u2014deeming them too expensive and unnecessary.\nAccording to The Times, it would cost upwards of $150 billion and 26 more years for the Acela to ever reach that."}
