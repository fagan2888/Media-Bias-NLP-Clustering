We don\u2019t mind working hard. But we want the system to be equitable,\u201d Blackwood said. \u201cHow can we make this work so that we\u2019re able to maintain our house?\u201d\n\nVideo by Brian Myers, Media Arts Center San Diego\n\nHere\u2019s Blackwood\u2019s question:\n\n\u201cMy spouse is a hard-working woman that makes $18,000 to $20,000 a year. Her health care costs are $2,400 a year through her company. Is there a subsidy available to help her?\u201d\n\nThe Takeaway: You\u2019ll get subsidies if coverage through your work is unaffordable, but you and the government could disagree on how much is too much.\n\nAnyone can shop on the Covered California insurance exchange, but not everyone is going to qualify for subsidies. If you have an affordable option through your job, you won\u2019t get financial assistance.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act says a plan is affordable if the premiums cost within 9.5 percent of your income and the insurer pays at least 60 percent toward covered health services.\n\nBlackwood\u2019s wife will get a subsidy because the $2,280 she pays annually for benefits through her employer surpasses that 9.5 percent threshold. The subsidy could bring her monthly payment down to a dollar.\n\nBut this case is unique. Though Blackwood calls her his wife, they\u2019re not married and don\u2019t file taxes together. If they did, Covered California would use the entire household income. Together, they make about $45,000 and pay $320 in combined premiums, which is affordable by the government\u2019s standards.\n\nThe Orders: Appeal Covered California\u2019s decision.\n\nBecause Blackwood\u2019s wife has already completed the application process, she\u2019ll need to send an appeal request through the exchange\u2019s website or call 1-800-300-1506.\n\nFor folks just starting the process, remember that the information you tell the exchange should match what you tell the IRS each year. If you file taxes with someone else, use your household income. If you file as an individual, use only your income.\n\nThis article relates to: City Heights, Community, Health Care, News, Share\n\nWritten by Megan Burks Megan Burks is a reporter for Speak City Heights, a media project of Voice of San Diego, KPBS, Media Arts Center and The AjA Project.
