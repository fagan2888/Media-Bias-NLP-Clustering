Don\u2019t fret, late bookers. With a little flexibility and the help of a few travel websites, you could still be on your way to your dream destination.\n\nThe bad news is that airfare has already gone through the roof. If you\u2019re planning to travel during the peak weeks of March 16 and March 23, expect to pay a 35 percent premium on your ticket, according to travel site Hopper.com.\n\nRelated: 17 Great Travel Apps for Your Vacation\n\nMost of today\u2019s planes are flying at or near capacity, thanks to recent airline consolidation. \u201cAt the beginning of the year, fares for spring break didn\u2019t look nearly as bad as they were for Christmas and Thanksgiving, but now they\u2019re high,\u201d says Jeff Klee, chief executive of CheapAir.com, which helps track how prices rise and fall over time.\n\nHere\u2019s how to get find the best possible deal on spring break travel:\n\nChoose your destination wisely. For later bookers, some destinations may be cheaper to fly to than others. These include Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers and Orlando in Florida; Myrtle Beach in South Carolina; and Las Vegas and Phoenix.\n\nFor the third year in a row, South Florida is the number one spring break destination, followed by Orlando, and Phoenix, according to Travelocity.\n\nRelated: 7 Secrets to Scoring Cheap Airline Tickets While domestic fares have increased ahead of spring break, most international travel prices are flat, although it depends on your destination. \u201cGuadalajara is a bit cheaper during spring break this year, but St. Thomas is one of the cities with the highest premium,\u201d Klee says.\n\nAnother way to save is to ditch the warm weather and head to a big city instead. Flights to New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, or even London or Paris don\u2019t fluctuate as much during this time.\n\nBe flexible with travel times. The more flexible you are, the sweeter the deal. It\u2019s usually cheaper to fly between Monday through Wednesday, rather than Thursday through Saturday. A Friday departure on average will add 22 percent to a ticket price, while a Saturday departure adds 18 percent, according to Hopper.com.\n\nLooking for airports that may be a little further from your home or your destination could net you a better price. Average airfare at Long Beach Airport, for example, is less than half the cost of airfare at Los Angeles International; and average airfare in White Plains, N.Y., is about half than at John F. Kennedy Airport, according to Cheapflights.com.\n\nRelated: 5 Tips for Booking Cheap Off-Season Travel\n\nYou\u2019ll also likely find better fares in the early morning and on red-eye flights. Flying from or to a small airport or on a connecting flight also usually costs less. You might also save money by buying two one-way tickets as opposed to a round trip, although that typically applies only to North America destinations. Use the booking tools Kayak.com and Google Flights to compare prices on one-way versus roundtrip tickets.\n\nLook for a package deal. Bundling your flight and hotel can typically save you money, from several hundred dollars for a four-day trip to as much as $1,000 for a week. You may be able to save even more by looking for an all-inclusive package. \u201cIt might be a bigger upfront cost, but at least you\u2019re more aware of your total cost for the trip,\u201d says Mattias Larsson of DefinitiveDeals.com, a website for online coupons and deals.\n\nA recent deal at Cheapcarribean.com offered an all-inclusive package for four nights in Los Cabos with airfare for $599, a trip that would normally cost up to $1,500. \u201cSuch second-tier websites have some really good deals and aren\u2019t that well known,\u201d says Larsson[mm1] . \u201cSome are more focused and specialized and have closer connections to hotels on the ground.\u201d But such deals sell out very quickly.\n\nSkip the hotel. Another way to save money is by renting a condo or home through a site like VRBO.com. You won\u2019t get all the amenities of a hotel \u2013 but you can cook your meals instead of going to pricey restaurants and typically get much more space. You can also lodge groups of five or six people (or more) in a condo rather than splitting into three hotel rooms.\n\nPlan ahead for next year. For those who would like to get a head start on next year\u2019s spring break travel, it\u2019s best to start planning in early January. But there is such a thing as booking too early. More than three months in advance may be too soon, according to travel experts.\n\nBeing knowledgeable about flight costs is key. \u201cThe most important thing is to be an informed shopper,\u201d says Patrick Surry, chief data scientist at Hopper.com. \u201cKnow ahead of time what price to expect and what prices other people got in different weeks.\u201d\n\nEach year Travelocity publishes a \u201cprice to beat\u201d as a benchmark for measuring busy travel times. This year, its price to beat for domestic airfare is $442. For international airfare, the price to beat is $806.\n\nSeveral websites can help you keep an eye on fares. Tools like Bing Price Predictor, Airfarewatchdog.com, and farecompare.com alert you to deals as they arise. Yapta.com does all of that, too, and, for certain airlines, if the price drops below what you paid, it will also detail how you can get a refund for the difference. Many airlines also have their own deal-alert tools, so those are worth a look as well.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Still looking for the ultimate Spring Break experience but no plane ticket or hotel reservation in hand yet?
