Ramsey high school alumni will take to the ice against alumni from Mahwah in the inaugural Tim McGill Memorial Cup ice hockey game this Friday, Nov. 29 at 6:00 pm at the Ice Vault in Wayne.





Staff Sergeant Tim McGill, who was a highly decorated member of the elite Special Forces Unit otherwise known as the Green Berets, was killed in action in Afghanistan on September 21, 2013.

The Ramsey native was 30 years old.

Tim grew up in Ramsey and participated in the school's ice hockey program as well as a roller hockey program with Mahwah D.A.R.E. which was started by his dad, Ray, a former Captain of the Mahwah police department.

With close ties to both communities, the two organizations will come together and honor Tim’s memory.

There will be a $5 donation at the door with all proceeds donated in Tim McGill’s memory to the Wounded Warriors Fund.
