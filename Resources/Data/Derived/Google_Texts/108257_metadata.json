It\u2019s called America,\u201d Shapiro told Mizzou students. \u201cLearn to appreciate it or get out.\u201d\n\nA safe space, set up by protesters who call for more diversity, restricts those who may hold a different perspective. Microaggression is a term some use to mean an act of unintended discrimination.\n\nStudents at Mizzou \u201cwanted to create a blacks-only safe space,\u201d Shapiro told The Daily Signal.\n\nIn recent weeks, students at college campuses around the country have broken out in protest, with demands such as hiring more faculty of color and eliminating perceived threats such as bulletproof vests worn by campus police.\n\nAt Mizzou, Shapiro said:\n\nIf you can\u2019t show systemic racism at Mizzou, you instead rely on stupid garbage like white privilege and microaggressions to help you create a safe space. Grow up, gang. You\u2019re not doing yourselves, the school, or the country any good at all with this sort of nonsense. You\u2019re making actual racism and aggression more common.\n\nBoth the president of the University of Missouri system and the chancellor of the flagship campus resigned after racial uproar broke out.\n\n\u201cWhite privilege is a way of shutting down debate,\u201d Shapiro said to The Daily Signal. \u201cIt\u2019s a way just to make people shut up based on the color of their skin.\u201d\n\nShapiro told the Mizzou crowd:\n\nYou\u2019re basically saying to white people, that aren\u2019t racist and you can\u2019t find any proof of their racism, that they must be racist because they\u2019re white. That is called racism.\n\nShapiro said microaggressions also shut down debate. For instance, it\u2019s an excuse used to call the cops if feelings get hurt.\n\nAt Mizzou, protesters tried to keep reporters out of a safe space zone and threatened to call police.\n\nShapiro called the Mizzou administration \u201ccowards\u201d for giving in to \u201cracial radicals\u201d on campus. He said:\n\nIt\u2019s really quite despicable that the administration has incentivized rabble-rousing at the cost of higher education everywhere from Princeton to Mizzou. There are a tiny number of people who are making a lot of trouble. There weren\u2019t that many people who were upset about anything that was going on at the administration level on campus.\n\nShapiro said more people probably came to his lecture, around 375, than belonged to the Concerned Student 1950 group, who pushed for Mizzou\u2019s president, Tim Wolfe, to resign.\n\nA \u201chuge number of kids\u201d want to \u201cstudy, get their degree, hang out with the other students, and \u2026 are not interested in this kind of rabble-rousing,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other hand, protesters allied with Concerned Student 1950 (named for the year the university admitted its first black student) want the university to hire more black faculty and increase funding for social justice centers on campus, among other demands.\n\n\u201cContinue to be in solidarity by challenging anti-black racism, capitalistic oppression, & all forms of violence in your institutions!\u201d Concerned Student 1950 tweeted during the time slated for Shapiro\u2019s speech.\n\nEmily Jashinsky, spokeswoman for Young America\u2019s Foundation, told The Daily Signal:\n\nIn our opinion, the hundreds of conservative students who showed up to hear Shapiro at Mizzou should be a wake-up call that there\u2019s a huge silent majority on college campuses, desperate for somebody to stand up to the leftists.\n\nShapiro said event staffers told him that members of Concerned Students 1950 were present outside the back of the lecture room but began to \u201cabandon ship as the event went on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was really hoping that some of the folks on the other side would show up and at least try to debate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the wake of racial justice student protesters at the University of Missouri, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro crashed the \"safe space\" zone.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In the wake of racial justice student protesters at the University of Missouri, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro crashed the \"safe space\" zone.", "title": "Conservative Commentator Crashes Mizzou Safe Space", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151120_YAFMizzou_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-23T20:46:14+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1HdAD6M"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In the wake of racial justice student protesters at the University of Missouri, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro crashed the \"safe space\" zone.", "title": "Conservative Commentator Crashes Mizzou Safe Space", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151120_YAFMizzou_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "higher education,individual freedom", "published_time": "2015-11-23T19:43:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-23T20:46:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ben Shapiro, Young America\u2019s Foundation, Mizzou, safe space, white privilege"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2546\"", "article_summary": "Students at Mizzou \u201cwanted to create a blacks-only safe space,\u201d Shapiro told The Daily Signal.\nAt Mizzou, Shapiro said:If you can\u2019t show systemic racism at Mizzou, you instead rely on stupid garbage like white privilege and microaggressions to help you create a safe space.\nIt\u2019s called America,\u201d Shapiro told Mizzou students.\nAt Mizzou, protesters tried to keep reporters out of a safe space zone and threatened to call police.\n\u201cLearn to appreciate it or get out.\u201dA safe space, set up by protesters who call for more diversity, restricts those who may hold a different perspective."}
