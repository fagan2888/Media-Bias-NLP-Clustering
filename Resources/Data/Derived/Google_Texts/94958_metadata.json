You\u2019ll have to search next to their headlines on Kim Kardashian, says the Huffington Post. In a mocking note about the billionaire businessman Friday morning, the liberal site announced it would be treating the Donald\u2019s White House run as \u201cEntertainment.\u201d\n\nAfter watching and listening to Donald Trump since he announced his candidacy for president, we have decided we won't report on Trump's campaign as part of The Huffington Post's political coverage. Instead, we will cover his campaign as part of our Entertainment section. Our reason is simple: Trump's campaign is a sideshow. We won't take the bait. If you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you'll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette.\n\nAmerican voters seem to find him so \u201centertaining,\u201d that he is currently the frontrunner in new national election polls.\n\nTrump is indeed a polarizing figure, one that has unexpectedly shaken up the 2016 field. His uncensored and inarticulate comments, however controversial, seem to be striking a chord with the public in a way that stale, political talking points never could.\n\nHow long will his momentum last? Hard to tell. For now, enjoy Round Ten of Trump v. the Media.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"...You'll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette.\".05/26/2016 4:34:18AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"...You'll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette.\"", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - HuffPo Treats Trump\u2019s Campaign as \u2018Entertainment\u2019", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/07/17/huffpo-treats-trumps-campaign-as-entertainment-n2026849", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/196/6b32183a-7245-42bb-b500-475d31921108.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"...You'll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette.\"", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - HuffPo Treats Trump\u2019s Campaign as \u2018Entertainment\u2019", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/07/17/huffpo-treats-trumps-campaign-as-entertainment-n2026849", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/196/6b32183a-7245-42bb-b500-475d31921108.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "HuffPo Treats Trump\u2019s Campaign as \u2018Entertainment\u2019, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf928\"", "article_summary": "Want updates on Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign?\nOur reason is simple: Trump's campaign is a sideshow.\nInstead, we will cover his campaign as part of our Entertainment section.\nYou\u2019ll have to search next to their headlines on Kim Kardashian, says the Huffington Post.\nAmerican voters seem to find him so \u201centertaining,\u201d that he is currently the frontrunner in new national election polls."}
