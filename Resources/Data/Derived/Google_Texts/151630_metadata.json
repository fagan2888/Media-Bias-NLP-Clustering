William Barber and North Carolina Christian writer Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove recently authored the following essay on the close connection between modern \u201creligious freedom\u201d proposals and the dark history of racial discrimination in the U.S. We\u2019re delighted to publish it here.\n\nExtremists also remember Selma:\n\nThe ugly history behind \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws\n\nBy Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II and Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove\n\nFrom Ava Duvernay\u2019s award-winning film to President Obama\u2019s speech at the Edmond Pettus Bridge, to the thousands we crossed the Bridge with and the millions that joined by TV, America has remembered Selma this year. We have honored grassroots leaders who organized for years, acknowledged the sacrifices of civil rights workers, and celebrated the great achievement of the Voting Rights Act. At the same time, we have recalled the hatred and fear of white supremacy in 1960\u2019s Alabama. But we may not have looked closely enough at this ugly history. Even as we celebrate one of America\u2019s great strides toward freedom, the ugliest ghosts of our past haunt us in today\u2019s \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws.\n\nMany able commentators have pointed out the problem with laws which purport to protect a First Amendment right to religious freedom by creating an opportunity to violate another\u2019s 14th Amendment right to equal protection under the law. But little attention has been paid to the struggle out of which the 14th Amendment was born\u2014a struggle which continued to play out in Selma 50 years ago and is very much alive in America\u2019s state houses today. We cannot understand the new \u201creligious freedom\u201d law in Indiana and others like it apart from the highly sexualized backlash against America\u2019s first two Reconstructions.\n\nThe 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was part and parcel of America\u2019s first Reconstruction, guaranteeing for the first time that people who had been legally codified as three-fifths persons would enjoy equal protection under the law in this country. The very notion of equal protection for black Americans was so offensive that it inspired an immediate backlash. Two features of resistance to America\u2019s first Reconstruction are essential to note.\n\nFirst, it was deeply religious. White preachers led the charge, calling themselves \u201cRedeemers\u201d and framing equal justice for black Americans as a moral danger. At the same time, the threat was explicitly sexualized. Black men were portrayed in respectable newspapers as \u201cravishing beasts,\u201d eager to rape white women.\n\nHere in our native North Carolina, white vigilantes were armed and encouraged to defend their women, leading to the \u201cWilmington Race Riot\u201d of 1898. Violent demonstrations of white men\u2019s sexual fear led to lynchings throughout the South and Midwest in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ida B. Wells, the courageous African-American journalist from Memphis, did the dangerous investigative work to show that the great majority of these lynchings were not about sex but political power.\n\nWhen the Civil Rights Movement\u2014a Second Reconstruction\u2014was finally able to draw national attention to the vicious patterns of Jim Crow in the 1960\u2019s, the challenge to white power was again conflated with sexual fear. As Danielle McGuire has chronicled in her book \u201cThe Dark End of the Street,\u201d civil rights workers were consistently accused of wanting interracial sex and/or having homosexual tendencies.\n\nWe remember Dr. King\u2019s \u201cHow Long, Not Long?\u201d speech from the Alabama state capitol at the end of the Selma to Montgomery March. But we often forget that the members of the Alabama state legislature responded with Act 159, citing evidence of \u201cmuch fornication\u201d among marchers and claiming that \u201cyoung women are returning to their respective states apparently as unwed expectant mothers.\u201d When Sherriff Jim Clark of Selma published his popular memoir the next year, he pointedly titled it \u201cThe Raping of Selma.\u201d\n\nThe pattern is clear: whenever established power brokers have felt threatened in America\u2019s history, they have responded by stirring up sexual fears. The widespread acceptance of interracial relationships makes \u201cmongrelization\u201d a moot point in 21st century America. But we who know this history can see that public expressions of concern about the \u201cgay lifestyle\u201d are not about religious freedom. They are about dividing an increasingly diverse electorate that has twice elected a black president. Fear of gay rights has proven to be the most effective strategy for extremists determined take over America\u2019s state houses.\n\nAs Southern preachers engaged in moral, fusion organizing, we say to our fellow ministers: religious freedom laws are an immoral ploy to stir up old fears. As people of faith, we must oppose them.\n\nBut in light of this ugly history, we also say to our progressive sisters and brothers: it\u2019s not enough to simply stand with the LGBT community. We who are concerned about LGBTQ sisters and brothers must also see that the attack against them is also an attack on voting rights. While it is heartening to see business leaders and even the NCAA challenge Indiana\u2019s law, we need the same forces to stand together against ALEC-backed ID laws, voter suppression bills and redistricting plans aimed at restricting voting rights.\n\nRight here in North Carolina, the proposed \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill goes so far as to say that government employees could choose not to carry out their duties because of a religious objection. While conservatives\u2019 concern today may be a religious objection to issuing a marriage license to gay couples, we remember well the religious reasons our neighbors in the South gave for segregation, the subjugation of women, and race-based slavery. Freedom of religion, a bedrock of American democracy, cannot mean a license to condemn others.\n\nFifty years ago, thousands marched in Selma as part of a faith-rooted, moral campaign to secure an expansion of voting rights. Extremists who couldn\u2019t deny their cause sought to distract and divide the country by using moral and religious language to stir up old sexual fears. The mystery money and secretive organizing behind today\u2019s \u201creligious freedom\u201d bills seek to do the same.\n\nWe who preach the good news of \u201cfreedom to captives\u201d in this Easter season must make clear as Dr. King did that religion serves the common good when it cries out against injustice, not when it fuels culture wars by dictating personal morality. Extremists in our state houses are echoing George Wallace and Jim Clark of Selma when they pretend to talk about morality in order to hold onto power. We would do well to pay attention to the moral witness of those who most now agree were on the right side of history.\n\nRev. Dr. William J.
