Courtesy of CCFA\n\nIt is likely someone you know suffers from Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, debilitating digestive diseases also known as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These diseases affect 1.6 million Americans, including 80,000 children.\n\nOne such child is Josh Berendt, 11, of Palatine, who was diagnosed at age 9 with indeterminate colitis.\n\nJosh will be recognized as the Honored Hero on Sunday, May 31, when the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America holds a Take Steps for Crohn's and Colitis walk in Naperville. Take Steps is CCFA's largest fundraising event, having touched more than 240,000 people and raised nearly $60 million to help further the foundation's mission.\n\n\"The Honored Hero is someone we recognize at each walk as someone who has the disease but also a participant of the walk,\" said Heidi Merritt, walk director for CCFA.\n\nAnother participant in this year's walk is Adina Walters of Cary. Walters struggled with pain for years before an insightful doctor diagnosed her with Crohn's disease.\n\nAdina and Josh share their stories win the hopes of raising awareness about IBD and inspiring readers to participate in the Take Steps walks or donate to CCFA.\n\nAbout Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis\n\n\u2022 There are nearly 1 in 200 Americans living with IBD.\n\n\u2022 70,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.\n\n\u2022 150,000 (about 10 percent) of people with IBD are children younger than 18.\n\n\u2022 Most people develop the diseases between ages 15 and 35.\n\n\u2022 Children younger than 18 are the fastest-growing patient population and are often the most severely impacted by the diseases.\n\n\u2022 163 genes associated with IBD have been discovered, but their functions are still unknown.\n\n\u2022 Symptoms may include abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, fever, weight loss and fatigue.\n\n\u2022 Many patients have complications affecting other body parts -- anemia from blood loss, inflammation of the eyes, joint pain, and more.\n\n\u2022 The average patient is misdiagnosed twice.\n\n\u2022 The number of Crohn's and colitis cases has increased 20 times since World War II.\n\n\u2022 Approximately 20 percent of patients have another family member with Crohn's or colitis.\n\nSource: Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America", "article_metadata": {"description": "Josh Berendt, 11, of Palatine, was diagnosed at age 9 with indeterminate colitis.
