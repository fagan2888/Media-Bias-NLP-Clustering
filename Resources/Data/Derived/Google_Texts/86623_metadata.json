While the identity of the CBO director may seem like an insignificant detail to most Americans, the prospect of a change at the top of the agency is causing a lot of heartburn among the community of budget specialists in Washington.\n\nThe worry is that, in an increasingly partisan Washington, Republicans might appoint an ideologue rather than someone who can be relied on to deliver objective analysis. The concern was voiced most prominently by former CBO Director Peter Orszag in an article published by Bloomberg Tuesday, in which he warned that a \u201cparty hack\u201d would ruin the agency.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Could Be a Danger to the CBO -- Orszag\n\nWhile Orszag, who himself left the CBO to become President Obama\u2019s Director of the Office of Management and Budget, may appear to some to be motivated by partisan concerns of his own, conversations with multiple budget specialists in Washington in recent days suggest the worry is actually widespread.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern,\u201d said Stan Collender, a former House and Senate Budget Committee staffer who is now executive vice president and national director of financial communications for public affairs firm Qorvis MSLGROUP. Collender said in speaking to colleagues recently about the Republican takeover of Congress, \u201cThe discussion almost invariably went to \u2018What does it mean to CBO?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there is a lot of nervousness. Doug [Elmendorf] has been an excellent CBO director, in a long line of CBO directors,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cThis is an incredibly important and respected institution. If you break an institution like that it cannot be repaired.\u201d\n\nIncoming Senate Budget Committee Chair Jeff Sessions (R-AL) said Wednesday that the issue of a new CBO director would be taken up in January. \u201cI like Director Elmendorf and I have a lot of respect for him, but obviously I think his tenure is up in January, so it will be something that will need to be discussed,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Sen. Ron Johnson Wants to Cut the Federal Workforce\n\nThe concern has been heightened by press reports naming potential successors to Elmendorf. Both The Wall Street Journal and the Capitol Hill news service CQ Roll Call have published lists of possible candidates, some from academia, some from the government and, some associated with advocacy groups or think tanks with strongly partisan reputations.\n\nIt\u2019s the latter that has the budget community particularly concerned.\n\n\u201cSome names [are] of people who are highly qualified,\u201d said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and an 18-year veteran of CBO. But others, he said, \u201clack academic credentials.\u201d\n\nVan de Water said that fretting about the identity of a new CBO director isn\u2019t always justified.\n\nRelated: The New Senate Power Grid \u2013 Here\u2019s Who Has the Juice\n\n\u201cI worked at CBO for every director from [founding Director] Alice Rivlin through Dan Crippen, and all of those people, whether they were appointed by Republicans or Democrats, wound up dissatisfying both sides of the aisle from time to time.\n\n\u201cMaybe the concern this time will turn out to have been misplaced,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is always better to be concerned \u2014 and to remind Congress of the importance of having a strong CBO.\u201d\n\nMacGuineas, of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, agreed that people named to the CBO post have all been able to \u201crise to the occasion.\u201d\n\nThis is in part, she said, a factor of the informal club made up of former CBO directors. It is a small and relatively close-knit group, all of its members bound by the common experience of enduring the fury of lawmakers and presidents unhappy with their findings.\n\nRelated: Why America Voted Against Obama\u2019s Economy\n\nFor example, on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, former CBO Director June O\u2019Neill joined a panel discussion with a group that included her immediate predecessor, former Director Robert Reischauer. During the discussion, O\u2019Neill produced a small stuffed animal \u2014 a skunk \u2014 that Reischauer had given her when she took over in 1995. The point of the gift was to remind O\u2019Neill that it was the CBO director\u2019s job to be \u201cthe skunk at the garden party.\u201d\n\nIf Elmendorf is replaced, MacGuineas predicted, the former directors are likely to be a significant influence on his successor. \u201cI have seen the community of former CBO directors embrace the new directors,\u201d she said, in an effort to maintain the agency\u2019s continuity and reputation.\n\nAnd that\u2019s no small thing, she said.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want Alice Rivlin looking over my shoulder and thinking I broke this incredible thing she built,\u201d MacGuineas said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The close-knit community of former CBO directors and federal budget specialists is buzzing with concern that the new Republican Congress will move to replace current Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf with a new, more ideological candidate.", "title": "Why Budget Experts Are Worried About the Next CBO Chief", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/13/Why-Budget-Experts-Are-Worried-About-Next-CBO-Chief", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03042014_Budget_Books.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/13/Why-Budget-Experts-Are-Worried-About-Next-CBO-Chief", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03042014_Budget_Books.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The close-knit community of former CBO directors and federal budget specialists is buzzing with concern that the new Republican Congress will move to replace current Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf with a new, more ideological candidate.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd03ff\"", "article_summary": "Doug [Elmendorf] has been an excellent CBO director, in a long line of CBO directors,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nBut others, he said, \u201clack academic credentials.\u201dVan de Water said that fretting about the identity of a new CBO director isn\u2019t always justified.\n\u201cI have seen the community of former CBO directors embrace the new directors,\u201d she said, in an effort to maintain the agency\u2019s continuity and reputation.\nIf you break an institution like that it cannot be repaired.\u201dIncoming Senate Budget Committee Chair Jeff Sessions (R-AL) said Wednesday that the issue of a new CBO director would be taken up in January.\nThe concern was voiced most prominently by former CBO Director Peter Orszag in an article published by Bloomberg Tuesday, in which he warned that a \u201cparty hack\u201d would ruin the agency."}
