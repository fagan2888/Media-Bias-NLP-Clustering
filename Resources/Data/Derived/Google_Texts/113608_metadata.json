His first successful selection was an adult book published in 1985, but he moved on to children's books full time by 1993.\n\nOn Friday, Gutman discussed the writing process with the Birches students. He explained how he received 10 rejection letters for Honus and Me, his first baseball card adventure book, over a two-year period before finally getting Harper-Collins to accept his draft. Gutman keeps a portfolio of the more than 100 rejection letters he has received over his career.\n\n\"But did I ever quit? No way,\" Gutman said.\n\nHe also showed the students slides about how he is able to come up with story ideas, and some photos of what his characters look like in his own mind. At the end of the program, Gutman took questions from students and staff alike up until the end of each class period.\n\nFor more information about Dan Gutman, check out his website at www.dangutman.com.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "washington-township-gloucester-county", "title": "Washington Township school news: Author visits Birches Elementary", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Washington Township school news: Author visits Birches Elementary\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/washington-township-times/index.ssf/2014/05/author_dan_gutman_visits_birch.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/washington-township-times/photo/14959201-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12937417\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-05-18T00:07:30Z\", \"author\": \"Kristina Pritchett | South Jersey Times\", \"tags\": [\"@gloucester-county\",\"@south\",\"washington-township-gloucester-county\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/washington-township-times/photo/14959201-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@Kristina_Pritch", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Children's book author Dan Gutman spoke to students at Birches Elementary School on Friday about his books, story ideas and answered questions."}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, May 17, 2014,  8:07 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/washington-township-times/photo/5gutmanjpg-35d26028fb82a3c9.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"kpritchett\", \"author_nickname\": \"Kristina Pritchett | South Jersey Times\", \"author_id\": \"10722382\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Washington Township Times\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/washington-township-times/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Children's book author Dan Gutman spoke to students at Birches Elementary School on Friday about his books, story ideas and answered questions.", "title": "Washington Township school news: Author visits Birches Elementary", "url": "http://www.nj.com/washington-township-times/index.ssf/2014/05/author_dan_gutman_visits_birch.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, May 17, 2014,  8:00 PM", "article_author": "Kristina Pritchett | South Jersey Times", "Description": "Children's book author Dan Gutman spoke to students at Birches Elementary School on Friday about his books, story ideas and answered questions."}, "article_summary": "Children's book author visits Birches Elementary SchoolRenowned children's book author Dan Gutman brought a high-energy, information-packed presentation to the Birches Elementary School instruction media center on Friday, May 16.\nGutman is the author of more than 100 published children's books, including the notable \"My Weird School,\" \"Genius Files\" and Baseball Card Adventure series.\nHis first successful selection was an adult book published in 1985, but he moved on to children's books full time by 1993.\nOn Friday, Gutman discussed the writing process with the Birches students.\nGutman went through different programs with each grade, focused on their reading and interest levels, during a visit made possible through a Washington Township Education Foundation mini-grant."}
