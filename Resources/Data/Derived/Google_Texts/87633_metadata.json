Those who make 7-figures with substantial wage and investment income.\n\nHouseholds with incomes over $1 million could pay about $170,000 more on average than they did in tax year 2012, according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center.\n\nThose making between $500,000 and $1 million would likely pay an average of $15,000 more.\n\nPlenty of taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $500,000 also could be affected by some of the changes.\n\nHere's where the increases will come from:\n\n1. Higher top income tax rate\n\nFor those with taxable income over $400,000 ($450,000 if married), their top income tax rate is now 39.6%, up from 35% previously.\n\n2. Higher capital gains and dividend tax rates\n\nFor those making over $400,000 ($450,000 if married), their rate on dividends and long-term capital gains is now 20%, up from 15% previously.\n\n3. Higher Medicare taxes\n\nFor those making over $200,000 ($250,000 if married), their Medicare taxes will go up on their wages and, for the first time, their investment income will be subject to a Medicare tax as well.\n\nOn wages: They will pay another 0.9 percentage points of Medicare tax on wage income over $200,000 ($250,000 if married). That's on top of the 1.45% Medicare tax that they must pay on all their wages (or 2.9% if they're self-employed).\n\nSo, for example, a single bank executive making $500,000 in wages - which is $300,000 above the applicable threshold - would have to pay an additional $2,700 in Medicare taxes (0.9% x $300,000)\n\nRelated: Obama wants to curb retirement tax breaks for the rich\n\nOn investments: Some or all of their taxable capital gains, dividends, interest, rental income and annuities will be subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax. But just how much will be subject to tax will take some figuring. Good thing they can afford an accountant.\n\nHere's how it would work: The 3.8% tax applies to whichever is less -- their taxable investment income or the amount that their modified adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds the $200,000/$250,000 threshold.\n\nSay a married couple has a modified AGI of $350,000 - which exceeds the applicable threshold by $100,000 - and investment income of $150,000. They'd owe the 3.8% surtax on the lesser of those two. So their additional tax would be $3,800 (3.8% x $100,000).\n\nIt will come as a relief to many that capital gains from a home sale up to $250,000 for an individual and $500,000 for a married couple remain tax free.\n\n4. Limits on deductions\n\nFor those whose AGI is over $250,000 ($300,000 if married) they could see the value of their personal exemptions and certain itemized deductions reduced because Congress reinstated the so-called PEP and Pease limitations.\n\nPersonal exemptions are reduced by 2% for each $2,500 that one's AGI tops the $250,000/$300,000 threshold.\n\nThe value of certain itemized deductions is reduced by 3% of the amount that one's AGI tops the income threshold. But the total reduction may not exceed 80% of the deductions' value.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "rich, high income , taxes, medicare tax, capital gains tax, dividend tax, tax season, itemized deductions, personal exemptions, income tax rate, adjusted gross income, AGI, PEP, Pease, wages , investments, dividends, capital gains, medicare", "title": "4 ways the rich will pay more this tax season", "og": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/20/pf/taxes/rich-taxes/index.html", "site_name": "CNNMoney", "type": "article", "description": "The 2013 taxes of households that have six- and seven-figure incomes will be notably larger in most cases than they were in 2012, thanks to changes that raised their income, investment and Medicare taxes, while also reducing the value of key tax breaks.", "title": "4 ways the rich will pay more this tax season"}, "section": "pf", "author": "Jeanne Sahadi", "vr": {"category": "taxes", "type": "Article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-20T07:21:05", "keywords": "rich, high income , taxes, medicare tax, capital gains tax, dividend tax, tax season, itemized deductions, personal exemptions, income tax rate, adjusted gross income, AGI, PEP, Pease, wages , investments, dividends, capital gains, medicare", "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "subsection": "taxes", "date": "2014-02-20 07:21:05", "twitter": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/20/pf/taxes/rich-taxes/index.html", "site": "@CNNMoney", "description": "The 2013 taxes of households that have six- and seven-figure incomes will be notably larger in most cases than they were in 2012, thanks to changes that raised their income, investment and Medicare taxes, while also reducing the value of key tax breaks.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "4 ways the rich will pay more this tax season"}, "viewport": "width=1140", "description": "The 2013 taxes of households that have six- and seven-figure incomes will be notably larger in most cases than they were in 2012, thanks to changes that raised their income, investment and Medicare taxes, while also reducing the value of key tax breaks."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0eb3\"", "article_summary": "Higher top income tax rateFor those with taxable income over $400,000 ($450,000 if married), their top income tax rate is now 39.6%, up from 35% previously.\nOn wages: They will pay another 0.9 percentage points of Medicare tax on wage income over $200,000 ($250,000 if married).\nThat's on top of the 1.45% Medicare tax that they must pay on all their wages (or 2.9% if they're self-employed).\nThat's because those laws included four key tax measures that went into effect for tax year 2013.Who'll be hit hardest?\nHouseholds with incomes over $1 million could pay about $170,000 more on average than they did in tax year 2012, according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center."}
