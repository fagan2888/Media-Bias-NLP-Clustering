(WHNT) - A vote of no confidence! The state's department of public health tells a Madison County healthcare facility administrator to stop treating patients. Patients at Regency Manor are forced to go elsewhere.\n\nA four-page court order from the Alabama Department of Public Health outlines allegations against Regency Manor such as neglect and abuse.\n\nState officials started looking into the dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s healthcare facility last month. The facility administrator's license is now suspended.\n\nAlabama's Health Officer has a strong opinion about Regency Manor.\n\n\u201cWe do not have confidence in the present owner operator to provide this service as a licensed healthcare facility,\u201d said ADPH Spokesman Dr. Tom Geary.\n\nThe spokesman confirmed patients of the Gurley-based specialized healthcare facility must find assistance elsewhere. The facility must stop operating by Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere were complaints regarding abuse and neglect of residents. Some of these were substantiated,\u201d added Dr. Geary.\n\nWHNT NEWS 19 made a call to the person in charge of the facility.\n\n\u201cOne of our workers made up all of the accusations and turned us in,\u201d said Facility Administrator Monique Okezie.\n\nWHNT NEWS 19 wanted to know more, so took a ride to Gurley to talk in person. Okezie did not want to discuss the issue on camera before meeting with her lawyer.\n\nInvestigators told WHNT NEWS 19 they witnessed several problems inside the 16-bed facility.\n\nSome of those include employees not making a care plan, orders not being followed and a lack of adequate staff.\n\n\u201cEveryone agreed that the best option would be to have the Alabama Health Officer order an emergency closure/suspension of their license,\u201d added Dr, Geary.\n\nThe facility administrator told WHNT NEWS 19 her license is not revoked and she plans to clarify the problems next month.\n\nThe state confirmed they will talk with Okezie next month and she, along with her current staff, will not have anything to do with the facility.\n\nOkezie told WHNT NEWS 19 the families of all 12 patients treated at the facility are aware of the problems and are working to find another place for their family member.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GURLEY, Ala.
