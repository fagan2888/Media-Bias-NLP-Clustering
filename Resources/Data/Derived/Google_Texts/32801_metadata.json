A group of cyclists heading eastbound entered the roadway and all avoided the car. However, Stetina lost control trying to maneuver away.\n\n\u201cHe swerved and braked so hard he went over the handlebars,\u201d Cpl. Heather Cobler of the Colorado State Patrol was quoted as saying.\n\nHe was airlifted to Boulder Community Hospital\u2019s intensive care unit where he is being treated for head injuries, according to Cmdr. Heidi Prentup of the Boulder County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThe driver, whose name was not released, was not given a citation but may once an investigation is concluded, Cobler said.\n\nAccording to the Boulder-based cycling website, VeloNews, American racer Steven Tilford posted on his website that Stetina\u2019s injuries are \u201cvery serious.\u201d\n\nTilford printed an email from an unnamed Stetina friend reading: \u201cDale did not hit the car, but hit the pavement, landing face first, suffering significant facial and ocular damage, and loss of responsiveness. EMTs were on the scene rapidly, he received good care \u2026The CatScan diagnosis revealed brain stem injuries. The neurosurgeon describes the injuries as very serious. Dale is in tough shape. The future of Dale\u2019s recovery is not known at this time, the doctors have offered no predictions. His vital signs are stable given the trauma he encountered. We are all hopeful.\u201d\n\nStetina, 57, won more than 200 domestic and international bike races during a career from 1965-83. He held the Mt. Washington Hill Climb record for 20 years until it was beaten by Jonathan Vaughters, CEO of Peter Stetina\u2019s former Boulder-based team, Garmin-Sharp.\n\nPeter Stetina, 26, was one of Garmin-Sharp\u2019s bright young stars. In 2012 he won stages at the Tour of Utah and Giro d\u2019Italia and was third in the Best Young Rider in the 2011 Giro. He won the 2009 national Under-23 time trial championship.\n\nLast month he announced he had signed with BMC Racing for 2014.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Boulder,Cycling,Dale Stetina,Head Injuries,Jonathan Vaughters", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "Dale Stetina in critical condition with head injuries after bike accident in Lefthand Canyon.
