Now that we\u2019ve bought up all those gas guzzlers, V-8s and all the cars that would not sell, watch what happens next. You\u2019ll probably have to have a hundred dollars or more to fill up the tank once.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got something a lot more dangerous to our country than ISIS. It\u2019s the enemies from within. It\u2019s the GOP that will not represent America no matter what they swore in their oath. They just say \u2018no\u2019 to everything. If Hillary does win, they will take bad sportsmanship to the next level.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw how toddlers are using guns to hurt other people or shoot themselves. What kind of parent leaves a gun out where a toddler can get it? That is the most irresponsible thing a parent can do, and I do not understand that.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of instituting a hiring freeze and cutting jobs, programs and services that benefit the students at Mizzou, I would love to see the highly paid administrators and perhaps the tenured faculty members take a voluntary pay cut. Leadership starts at the top.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you get too many people going around carrying guns, you increase the chances that some ignorant person is going to be jealous over somebody or somebody\u2019s going to get drunk, and this could be a bad situation for somebody that\u2019s got a gun in their hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the person who said we need more job killers like Obamacare \u2014 what they don\u2019t realize is people like me cannot afford Obamacare. I cannot afford the $700 a month for the premium. So what\u2019s Obama going to do about this? Obamacare is ridiculous. I should be able to pay a monthly premium based on what I want covered and what I can afford, not what the government tells me I can get.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the city council wants to put a roundabout at Green Meadows. This town has gone roundabout-crazy. There\u2019s just too many of them. They\u2019re stupid. People won\u2019t go around, and they cut you off. This town is going to be known as the town of roundabouts instead of the University of Missouri at Columbia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mailed a first-class letter on March 20 from the Columbia post office drive-through. On April 25, I got confirmation that the letter arrived at its Denver destination \u2014 36 days after mailing. Something is bad wrong with the postal system.\u201d\n\n\u201cJim Robertson, I see that somebody had called in about Bruce Springsteen canceling his tour, and then you supported it by saying opinions are one thing but laws are another and that cancellations are his way of expressing his opinion. So I\u2019m taking it that you endorse Bruce Springsteen doing so because he is of such outstanding moral fiber.\u201d\n\nRobertson replies: I endorse expressions of opinion.\n\n\u201cOne of the major problems we have in society is the large number of unfit parents who either will not or cannot take care of their children and raise them to be productive, law-abiding citizens. Republican politicians want the government to force women to bring even more unwanted children into the world. That is a recipe for social disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn looking for a new system president, the UM curators might do well to wait until the November election is over and the political climate of the state and nation has been determined. A quality person is more likely to serve if he or she knows someone has their back.\u201d\n\n\u201cJim, I just want to respond again to the fact that our legislators in the state of Missouri are wasting so much of our money trying to go after Planned Parenthood. It\u2019s quite a joke. I would like to leave this quote from Sister Joan Chittister: \u2018I do not believe that just because you are opposed to abortion that makes you pro-life. In fact in many cases your morality is deeply lacking if all you want is a child born but not a child fed, not a child housed, not a child educated. And why would I think that you don\u2019t? Because you don\u2019t want your tax money to go there. That\u2019s not pro-life. That\u2019s pro-birth. We need a much deeper conversation on what the morality of pro-life is.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"title": "Trib Talk", "description": "\u201cPeople got lured into a feeling of utopia with the gas prices we\u2019ve had for the last months.\"", "card": "summary", "site": "@columbiatribune"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "og": {"url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/opinion/trib_talk/trib-talk/article_388cd99b-b444-5323-a094-7e085cfc7bf4.html", "site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cPeople got lured into a feeling of utopia with the gas prices we\u2019ve had for the last months.\"", "title": "Trib Talk"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "trib talk", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "\u201cPeople got lured into a feeling of utopia with the gas prices we\u2019ve had for the last months.\""}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s not pro-life.\n\u201cPeople got lured into a feeling of utopia with the gas prices we\u2019ve had for the last months.\nNow that we\u2019ve bought up all those gas guzzlers, V-8s and all the cars that would not sell, watch what happens next.\nThis town is going to be known as the town of roundabouts instead of the University of Missouri at Columbia.\u201d\u201cI mailed a first-class letter on March 20 from the Columbia post office drive-through.\nWe need a much deeper conversation on what the morality of pro-life is.\u2019\u201d"}
