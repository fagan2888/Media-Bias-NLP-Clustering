This marks the highest percentage ever recorded in the 14-year history of the survey question.\n\nDespite President Obama's dream of providing affordable health care coverage for all, fewer and fewer Americans are able to get the coverage they need.\n\n\u201cLast year, many hoped that the opening of the government healthcare exchanges and the resulting increase in the number of Americans with health insurance would enable more people to seek medical treatment. But, despite a drop in the uninsured rate, a slightly higher percentage of Americans than in previous years report having put off medical treatment, suggesting that the Affordable Care Act has not immediately affected this measure.\u201d\n\nEven Upper-class Americans (those making more than $75K) were deterred by health care costs. Between 2013 and this year, there was an 11 percent increase in treatment delay among wealthier Americans.\n\nWhat's more, the costs are not merely discouraging people from running to the Doctor for every little sneeze and cough. The survey found that Americans are becoming increasingly more likely (22 percent) to put off treatment for a \"very\" or \"somewhat serious\" condition or illness. Twice the number recorded (11 percent) for non-serious conditions.\n\nEven as time continues to reveal Obamacare's negative impact on Americans, the Obama Administration continues to relentlessly promote its product as being what's best for the American people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks Obama .05/26/2016 19:18:36PM EST.", "author": "Sarah Jean Seman", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Thanks Obama", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - Medical Costs Drive Record High Number of Americans to Delay Treatment", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2014/11/29/medical-costs-drive-record-high-number-of-americans-to-delay-treatment-n1925200", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/318/a401edf3-9c26-4e53-9db2-ba7556bb6cdb.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Thanks Obama", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - Medical Costs Drive Record High Number of Americans to Delay Treatment", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2014/11/29/medical-costs-drive-record-high-number-of-americans-to-delay-treatment-n1925200", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/318/a401edf3-9c26-4e53-9db2-ba7556bb6cdb.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Medical Costs Drive Record High Number of Americans to Delay Treatment, Sarah Jean Seman, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "One in three Americans has delayed seeking medical treatment due to its high cost, according to a recent Gallup poll.\nDespite President Obama's dream of providing affordable health care coverage for all, fewer and fewer Americans are able to get the coverage they need.\nTwice the number recorded (11 percent) for non-serious conditions.\nBetween 2013 and this year, there was an 11 percent increase in treatment delay among wealthier Americans.\n\u201cLast year, many hoped that the opening of the government healthcare exchanges and the resulting increase in the number of Americans with health insurance would enable more people to seek medical treatment."}
