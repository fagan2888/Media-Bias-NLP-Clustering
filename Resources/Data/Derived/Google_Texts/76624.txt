“Nightly Show” host Larry Wilmore led last night’s show with his take on “the alleged non-murder of Antonin Scalia.”

To Mitch McConnell (“the guy who looks like if an elderly turtle mated with the white pillow that killed Antonin Scalia”), Wilmore said, “You said you’d block Obama on February 13th, only hours after Scalia’s homicide. … You made your intentions of blocking the president very clear.”

“One of the Republicans’ bullshit lines is that they’re concerned that a conservative justice as great as Scalia will be replaced by a liberal judge,” Wilmore continued. “But they weren’t so concerned when Thurgood Marshall, a liberal justice who was a major voice of the civil rights movement, was replaced by Clarence Thomas, a conservative justice who doesn’t even fucking talk.”
