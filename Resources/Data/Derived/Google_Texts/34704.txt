A baby was delivered at a local hospital Saturday after its mother, a North Charleston woman, was fatally stabbed by her boyfriend, according to police.

Malakia Lasha Frazier, 26, was found about 11:30 p.m. with multiple stab wounds on the ground near Railroad Avenue and Graham Street. She died just before midnight at Medical University Hospital, according to Charleston County Deputy Coroner Dottie Lindsay.

Hospital staff performed an emergency procedure to deliver the baby, who remains in intensive care, police said.

Ricky Short, 26, whose address was not released, is charged with murder, attempted murder of an unborn child and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. He was identified by police as Frazierâ€™s boyfriend.

Lt. Angela Johnson of the North Charleston Police Department said Short and Frazier were arguing before the stabbing. They did not live together. No other information was released.
