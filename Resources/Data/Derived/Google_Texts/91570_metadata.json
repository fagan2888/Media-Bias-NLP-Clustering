At about 14,800 deaths in 2008, prescription painkiller overdoses caused more deaths than cocaine and heroin combined. More discouraging is the new study finding that despite an increase in opioid perscriptions, doctors haven't gotten any better at identifying and treating pain.\n\n\u201cThere is an epidemic of prescription opioid addiction and abuse in the United States,\u201d said Dr. G. Caleb Alexander, associate professor of epidemiology and medicine and co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness, according to HealthDay. \u201cWe felt it was important to examine whether or not this epidemic has coincided with improved identification and treatment of pain.\u201d\n\nLooking at government data on the number of doctors\u2019 office visits from 2000 to 2010, the researchers found no change throughout the 10-year span in the number of visits for pain that resulted in treatment with pain relievers. However, while treatment for pain with non-opioid painkillers, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (Tylenol) stayed about the same throughout \u2014 between 26 and 29 percent of all visits \u2014 the ratio of opioid prescriptions jumped from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 19.6 percent in 2010.\n\nAn analysis of doctors\u2019 visits for new-onset musculoskeletal pain, which don't necessarily require opioid treatment, found that non-opioid prescriptions dropped from 38 percent to 29 percent of visits between 2000 and 2010, while opioid prescriptions rose.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that efforts to improve the identification and treatment of pain may have backfired, due to an over-reliance on prescription opioids that have caused incredible morbidity and mortality among patients young and old alike,\u201d Dr. Alexander said, according to MedicalXpress.\n\nOpioids come from the opium poppy, and include the medications Vicodin, OxyContin, morphine, methadone, and codeine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced that it would be changing safety label and post-market study requirements for some opioids in an effort to prevent misuse, addiction, and death resulting from the drugs. The changes are intended to curb illegal opioid drug use.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "opioid, pain killers, prescription drug abuse, morphine, pain relief", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Despite the fact that pain-killing opioid prescription drug overdoses account for more deaths than overdoses cocaine and heroine combined, doctors haven't done a better job addressing patients' pain treatment.", "title": "After 10 Years Of Rising Prescription Opioid Use, No Improvements On Pain Treatment", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/after-10-years-rising-prescription-opioid-use-no-improvements-pain-treatment-257535", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/21/morphine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite the fact that pain-killing opioid prescription drug overdoses account for more deaths than overdoses cocaine and heroine combined, doctors haven't done a better job addressing patients' pain treatment.", "title": "After 10 Years Of Rising Prescription Opioid Use, No Improvements On Pain Treatment", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/after-10-years-rising-prescription-opioid-use-no-improvements-pain-treatment-257535", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/21/morphine.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/21/morphine.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2013-09-21T17:45:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-21T17:46:59-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Despite the fact that pain-killing opioid prescription drug overdoses account for more deaths than overdoses cocaine and heroine combined, doctors haven't done a better job addressing patients' pain treatment."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a19\"", "article_summary": "An analysis of doctors\u2019 visits for new-onset musculoskeletal pain, which don't necessarily require opioid treatment, found that non-opioid prescriptions dropped from 38 percent to 29 percent of visits between 2000 and 2010, while opioid prescriptions rose.\nThe changes are intended to curb illegal opioid drug use.\nMore discouraging is the new study finding that despite an increase in opioid perscriptions, doctors haven't gotten any better at identifying and treating pain.\nAt about 14,800 deaths in 2008, prescription painkiller overdoses caused more deaths than cocaine and heroin combined.\nPrescription painkillers cause almost 75 percent of drug overdose deaths."}
