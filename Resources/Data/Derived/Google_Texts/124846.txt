Mixed-martial arts star Ronda Rousey celebrated her 2015 ESPY award for Best Fighter by taking a shot at Floyd Mayweather’s history of domestic abuse allegations.

“I wonder how Floyd feels being beat by a woman for once,” she said Wednesday night. “I’d like to see him pretend to not know who I am now.”

Mayweather had previously claimed that he did not know who Rousey was when he was asked how he’d fare in a fight with her.

The boxer has been accused of domestic abuse five times over the course of his career and spent two months in jail after a 2010 incident with the mother of his three children.

Mayweather won his welterweight title bout with Manny Pacquiao May 3 in Las Vegas, sealing his place in boxing history as one of the greatest fighters of all time. He has not lost once in 48 professional bouts.
