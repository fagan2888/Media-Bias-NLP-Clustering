Oklahomans weighed in on President Obama’s plan for tighter gun control.

The biggest changes would require background checks on all gun sales and change a federal privacy rule to help keep people with mental health restrictions from possessing guns.

Betty Smith agreed with the executive action involving background checks.

“I think it's great, I think everyone should have to get a background check,” Smith said.

The law requires dealers with a Federal Firearms License, or an FFL license, to perform background checks on gun buyers, but not for individuals selling to individuals, like private collections at gun shows for instance.

This is often referred to as the "gun show loophole."

The President wants to require background checks no matter where a gun is sold so everyone plays by the same rules.

“I don't think it's really changing anything, I don't think it's a problem,” said Brad Carroll, Wilshire Gun Range general manager. “For us, we do it every single person that comes and buys one has to do the background check."

Carroll said the bigger question is enforcement.

“It's going to add a lot more burden to the already burdened system of running those, are they prepared for the influx of that,” he asked.

Tyler Miller questioned how that would affect private sales posted all the time on Facebook or elsewhere online.

“We have private commerce, we have private commerce as a foundation of this country,” Miller said. “What they are saying is this private commerce is good for everything except for guns."

Everyone wondered if it would have the intended outcome of cutting down on gun violence and mass shootings.

“Because your criminals are always going to get a gun, no matter, I mean if they want one, they'll get one,” Smith said.

The President also wants to hire more ATF and FBI agents, as well as spend $500 million more on mental health treatment.
