That\u2019s considered a more accurate barometer of wholesale price trends.\n\nExcluding trade margins and the volatile categories of food and energy, core wholesale prices inched up 0.1% in November. Core price have risen a scant 0.3% over the past year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is preparing to raise interest rates next week for the first time since rates bottomed out in 2009.\n\nSome experts think the U.S. central bank is acting prematurely, seeing no evidence inflation is a danger to the economy.\n\nContinuing recent trends, the gain in inflation in November came entirely from the service sector.
