The uninsured may also pay sticker prices for tests that insured patients receive for a discount.\u201cWhen I was in training, our attendings would ask a standard quiz question: \u201cWhat is the biggest driver of healthcare costs in the hospital?\u201d Answer: the physician's pen,\u201d Bettigole wrote. \u201cA mouse or a keyboard, rather than a pen, now drives the spending, but we physicians are responsible for ordering these unnecessary tests and hence responsible for the huge bills our patients are receiving.\u201dThe costs, she stressed, are not merely financial. \u201cThe risk it poses, though\u2014the one I face when a patient calls about a crippling bill\u2014is that more and more women may choose not to undergo screening, afraid of the financial consequences.\u201dLaboratories market multiple tests that can be ordered simultaneously from a single specimen, she said. Meanwhile, electronic health records allow doctors to order a bundle of tests with the ease of clicking a mouse. \u201cNothing at any point along the way alerts either the clinician or the patient to the high costs of these tests or to the fact that there is little medical evidence to suggest that they are useful for most patients.\u201dShe called for changes to empower and inform patients and doctors.Patients need timely price information that can help them make decisions, she said. Physicians need more training to recognize the potential costs of ordering.\u201cAs healthcare costs grow and laboratories develop savvy marketing tactics resembling those deployed by pharmaceutical companies, it is becoming increasingly clear that physicians have an obligation to be good stewards of limited resources and to understand the financial effects that the orders we write have on our patients,\u201d she said.The Affordable Care Act may help reduce patients' laboratory costs. Those previously uninsured who gain coverage under the expansion of Medicaid (when possible) or through subsidized private health plans will receive free Pap smears. That's because the 2010 healthcare reform law eliminated out-of-pocket costs from preventive care, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute. But that may not protect patients from bills for additional tests bundled with the preventive screening, she said.Follow Melanie Evans on Twitter: @MHmevans", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Doctors can order multiple laboratory tests with increasing ease, thanks to savvy marketing and electronic medical records, but with that ease comes consequences that are costly and potentially harmful, a physician wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine.
