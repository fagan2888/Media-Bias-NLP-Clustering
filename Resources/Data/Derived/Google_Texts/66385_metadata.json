Scott Walker: Still wrong on Medicaid, says the Editorial Board. Credit: Associated Press\n\nGov. Scott Walker likes to brag about how much he has saved Wisconsin taxpayers during his first term in office, but here's something those taxpayers should know: Walker has cost them millions of dollars by refusing to fully expand the state's primary health care program for the poor under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWisconsin would have saved $206 million over two years if the Walker administration had chosen to accept a full expansion of federal funding for BadgerCare, according to a new nonpartisan report. The state could have saved more than $500 million over 31/2 years, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates, and about 87,000 more adults a month would have been served under BadgerCare Plus.\n\nIn the interest of both taxpayers and the poor, Walker and the state Legislature should correct this mistake.\n\nThe savings arise from a provision in Obamacare that requires the federal government to pay for the full cost of new enrollees in Medicaid programs such as BadgerCare who earn up to 133% of the federal poverty level. In the past, the federal government paid about 60% of the cost and the state about 40%. Under Obamacare, the federal government is on the hook for all costs for the first few years of the program and 90% of the costs in 2020 and beyond.\n\nDriven by ideology and Republican politics, Walker chose a partial expansion. The administration dropped about 63,000 people from BadgerCare and added 97,500 others. Members of families above the federal poverty line were tossed from the program and left with the option of signing up for subsidized private health insurance through the Obamacare online marketplaces. Many haven't done so. Those added to the rolls were adults living in poverty who don't have dependent children.\n\nIn reality, Walker left the state worse off with his decision to keep Obamacare at arm's length in Wisconsin. He argues that the expanded funding isn't reliable because of large federal budget deficits, and other Republicans complain that framing a full expansion as \"savings\" is misleading because the funding for the program still comes from taxpayers \u2014 federal taxpayers in this case. \"We believe confidently going forward this federal government is likely to renege from its promises on Medicaid to the states. And we won't be exposed to that,\" Walker has said.\n\nIt's a phantom argument.\n\nFirst, the federal government's commitment to the expansion is rock solid under President Barack Obama and likely will remain so as more people are insured under the program that carries his name. Even if that commitment wavers, though, Wisconsin can opt out of the program, according to a state Legislative Council memo published in July, and any change in funding would have to be agreed upon by both the president and Congress.\n\nSecond, Walker's decision may contribute to cost-shifting by hospitals. Coverage of the state's poor is expensive, but it has to be done and somebody has to pay for it. There is no escaping those facts. As a commentary by three Wisconsin physicians published at JSOnline noted last week, hospitals will see a decline in the Federal Disproportionate Share compensation payments they receive for serving Medicaid and uninsured patients. The expectation has been that an increase in paying Medicaid patients would offset the cut, but if the payments decline and the increase in Medicaid patients doesn't materialize, hospitals will have to make up the difference. That could mean higher costs for the rest of us.\n\nWalker's decision to reject the additional federal money and forswear a state-run Obamacare exchange (another mistake) came as Republicans pressed their case against the Affordable Care Act nationwide. It was another example of this governor's penchant for sacrificing good policy on the altar of expedient politics. To their credit, other Republican governors made different choices.\n\nWalker was wrong about Obamacare then, and he's wrong to defend his actions now. Look no further than this latest Legislative Fiscal Bureau report for the proof.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Gov.
