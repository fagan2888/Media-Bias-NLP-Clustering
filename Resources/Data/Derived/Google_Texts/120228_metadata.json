One petition, on Change.org asks Hawaii Governor David Ige to halt all TMT-related construction on Mauna Kea, it asks that no other Mauna Kea protectors are arrested, and it asks him to protect the mountain.\n\nThe petition says that \u201cTruly respecting the host culture of this land means respecting the sacred places that that culture has held in reverence for millennia. Doing so lays a good foundation for genuine healing of the longstanding historic wrongs that continue to affect the well-being of everyone in Hawai\u02bbi.\u201d\n\nThe other petition, hosted by MoveOn.org, is to be delivered to a number of various parties involved in the construction of the telescope, and is meant to also protect Mauna Kea.\n\n\u201cThe State of Hawai\u2018i\u2019s Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) is planning to issue the University of Hawai\u2018i (UH) new leases for another 65 years, that\u2019s right, BLNR is planning to give Mauna Kea to UH for another 65 years. The new leases would end in the year 2078\u2014how old will you be in 2078? The current BLNR lease is scheduled to end in the year 2033, but this date is not good enough for UH and the other national and international observatories because they want the power to continue to build newer and bigger telescopes,\u201d points out the MoveOn petition.\n\nDonate\n\nThose on the ground, the protectors of Mauna Kea, need supplies like food and water, and sometimes even bail money. To help them keep protesting and protecting the sacred mountain, you can contribute to the Mauna Kea \u2018Ohana on GoFundMe.\n\nContact\n\nHere\u2019s a list of people you can write a letter to, send an email to, put a call in to, and let them know you are against what is happening at Mauna Kea.\n\nU.S. State Department\n\nHon.
