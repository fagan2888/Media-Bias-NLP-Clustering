To celebrate its release, international subscriptions are $25 off, and limited prints of our Easter 1916 cover are available.\n\nI\u2019ve written before about how the Hillary Democrats are running against hope, and how the Sanders campaign have outed them as frank corporate shills and enemies of even mild social democracy. But now even nominal liberals, or progressives, or whatever we\u2019re calling them these days, have gotten in on the act.\n\nNot content with merely saying \u201cNo!\u201d to new programs like single-payer health insurance and free college, they\u2019re highlighting the worst aspects of the New Deal in an effort to . . . well, what exactly? Promote Hillary? Fight Trump? It\u2019s hard to tell.\n\nA few days ago, Jamelle Bouie, chief political correspondent for Slate Magazine and a political analyst for CBS News, tweeted this remarkable observation (since deleted):\n\nActually, that working-class movement had a lot to do with the Communist Party, which was an antiracist organization with a large black membership. Not only did it organize autoworkers in Flint, it organized black farmers in the South and black urbanites in Harlem. But saying nice things about the CPUSA is not the way to keep a job with CBS News.\n\nNot long after Bouie\u2019s ridiculous tweet came a longer instance of 1930s-bashing from Bryce Covert, economic policy editor at ThinkProgress and a contributor to the Nation. Covert identifies Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cmake America great again\u201d as appealing to whites, especially men, longing for the days before the Civil Rights Movement and feminism ruined things for them.\n\nThat\u2019s not a controversial point; it may be incomplete, but it\u2019s not untrue. Covert\u2019s innovation is to locate much of that appeal in New Deal programs like Social Security and unemployment insurance, and postwar successors like the G.I. Bill.\n\nThis is rather odd, given the holy place that the New Deal once had in Democratic discourse. Covert\u2019s beef is that to get the votes of racist Southern congressmen, FDR had to craft his programs to exclude black workers. This is both true and awful, though it\u2019s not clear how they would have gotten through Congress otherwise.\n\nBut instead of saying that the New Deal was a good partial model, something that should be built upon \u2014 probably the only period in American history when a sense of the collective, and not competitive individualism, dominated our political thought \u2014 she emphasizes only the exclusions, and identifies them as the source of the nostalgias that Donald Trump, not previously known as a friend of social programs, has been basing his campaign on.\n\nNeither Bouie\u2019s tweet nor Covert\u2019s op-ed makes any sense unless they\u2019re trying to discredit an ambitious social agenda. That is precisely what the Hillary Democrats are doing to fight off the persistent Sanders threat that just won\u2019t go away. (That despite the fact that, as Gallup recently reported, a majority of Americans support a single-payer system. The least popular option is Hillary\u2019s position, keeping Obamacare largely as is.)\n\nBut how is this going to play once she wins the nomination? At first it seemed like the rightward, anti-social-democratic tilt was intended to lure moderate suburban voters who might have voted for a sane Republican (not that there was one among the initial Gang of Seventeen) but can\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump. Bernie\u2019s voters were expected either to shut up and fall in line or just go to hell.\n\nBut that strategy might not pan out. As Dave Weigel reports in the Washington Post, Trump is winning over a lot of those suburbanites that Democratic strategists were, just a few weeks ago, hoping to harvest in November. As former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell put it less than two months ago:\n\nFor every one of those blue-collar Democrats [Trump] picks up, he will lose to Hillary two socially moderate Republicans and independents in suburban Cleveland, suburban Columbus, suburban Cincinnati, suburban Philadelphia, suburban Pittsburgh, places like that.\n\nNow it looks like that might not happen. But that\u2019s no cause for worry. The endlessly creative Rendell revealed a new strategy to Weigel:\n\nWill [Trump] have some appeal to working-class Dems in Levittown or Bristol? Sure . . . For every one he\u2019ll lose 1\u00bd , two Republican women. Trump\u2019s comments like \u201cYou can\u2019t be a 10 if you\u2019re flat-chested,\u201d that\u2019ll come back to haunt him. There are probably more ugly women in America than attractive women. People take that stuff personally.\n\nRendell and the centrist Democrats do deserve a moment of sympathy. When you have nothing positive to sell voters, you have to get creative. Trolling for votes by calling your potential supporters \u201cugly\u201d is seriously creative.\n\nThe new issue of Jacobin is out now.
