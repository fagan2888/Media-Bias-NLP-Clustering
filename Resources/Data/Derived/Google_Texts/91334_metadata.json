(RNS) Security is tough at the State Department.\n\nBefore we could get inside to meet with Dan Nadel, the acting director of the Office of International Religious Freedom, we had to pass through a metal detector, open our bags, get them scanned, show our passports, register our names and get a badge with the words \u201cESCORT REQUIRED\u201d emblazoned in red.\n\nWe were then told no photos were allowed as we were escorted through a rabbit warren of institutionally bland halls before finally being herded \u2014 and I use that word intentionally \u2014 into a conference room with a big table.\n\nNadel gave us an overview of what the office does \u2014 monitors freedom of religion and speech around the world and works with nine \u201ccountries of particular concern\u201d to bring about more freedom there. But when asked about Raif Badawi, the Saudi Arabian atheist blogger imprisoned for blasphemy and sentenced to lashing, he had a boilerplate answer.\n\n\u201cIn Saudi Arabia (a major U.S. ally) we have found the government engaged in ongoing and systematic violations of the freedom of religion,\u201d he said to the 17 international reporters on this fellowship with me. \u201cWe are frank with them. The Badawi case is one we have been following closely. So we continue to press that there is justice in this case.\u201d\n\nI am sure that will be great comfort to Raif.\n\nThen we split into smaller groups to have off-the-record briefings about different regions where Islam is the dominant religion. I picked the South Asian briefing and about six of us were taken to meet with Eileen O\u2019Connor, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for the region.\n\nThe session was off-the-record, so I can\u2019t tell you what we discussed. But I can tell you this lovely, very human thing that happened. After we gave up our cellphones and were personally walked to the bathroom \u2014 I was starting to feel like a kindergartener \u2014 our escort, Ajay Rao, the \u201cPakistan Desk Officer,\u201d said, \u201cWould anyone like some cookies?\u201d\n\nCookies??? Oh, heck yeah!\n\nThen, as O\u2019Connor began her briefing \u2014 on terrorism, on blasphemy, on assassinations, on the Taliban \u2014 Rao placed two heaping plates of cookies on the table. There were chocolate chip, shortbread, oatmeal, peanut butter (is there a secret Pillsbury bakery deep in the bowels of the State Department?). And all of these suited, accomplished, well-educated and well-heeled folks with a bit of an adversarial relationship took a napkin \u2014 emblazoned with the U.S. seal \u2014 and nibbled on cookies together.\n\nI didn\u2019t mind being treated like a kindergartner. It was a reminder that under all these huge, unsolvable issues we are all human, all doing the best we can. We might be skeptical of each others\u2019 motives, unsure if we\u2019re being told the \u201ctruth\u201d \u2014 whatever that means to governments and to each of us \u2014 but we can all share a sweet together.\n\nFrom there we departed for Masjid Muhammad, the first mosque in the U.S. to be built by the descendants of slaves. More about that later.\n\nANOTHER VIEW: Kim Lawton\u2019s fellowship blog at Religion & Ethics Newsweekly\n\nTRAVEL ALONG: Day 1\u2013 A wake-up call in Washington", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, blasphemy, East-West Travelblog, islam, Raif Badawi, Saudi Arabia, State Department", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C.
