Not only is Dave Loebsack supporting a failing law, but now he let the law\u2019s subsidies go to waste. From the failed website, to the Medicare cuts, and now this new investigation, it is clear ObamaCare is riddled with waste, fraud, and abuse. He should be ashamed and apologize to Iowa voters for this reckless and irresponsible vote.\n\n\u201cWith his vote last year, Dave Loebsack ensured Stan Dupp, Sid Down, and the rest of their fake-named friends can get ObamaCare subsidies,\u201d said NRCC Communications Director Andrea Bozek. \u201cMeanwhile real people in Iowa are clearly suffering because of his disgraceful vote.\u201d\n\nFederal Investigators Were Able To Sign Up Fake Applicants Onto ObamaCare And Receive Subsidies. \u201cIn undercover tests of the new federal health insurance marketplace, government investigators have been able to procure health plans and federal subsidies for fake applicants with fictitious documents, according to findings that will be disclosed to lawmakers Wednesday.\u201d (Amy Goldstein, Federal Undercover Investigation Signs Up Fake Applicants For ACA Coverage, Subsidies, The Washington Post, 7/22/14)\n\nLast Year, Dave Loebsack Voted Against A Bill Requiring Income Verification For ObamaCare Subsidies.
