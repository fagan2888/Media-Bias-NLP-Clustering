They also run Do Unto Others (DUO), where youth volunteers and handymen do minor, but critical, home repairs for seniors and people living with disabilities in Davis County. \u201cAnd we do that in an effort to keep them in their homes living independently as long as they can.\u201d Fluette says.\n\nThe organization's reach also extends to local schools, where they get kids to do service projects through The Good Deeds Challenge. \u201cA child might think that doing something for a couple hours isn't making that big of a difference,\u201d Fluette says, \u201cbut when you're in a school of 500 kids and they each choose something that takes them three hours, that's 1,500 hours of service to the community.\u201d\n\nWe chatted with Fluette to find out more about the organization and its goals:\n\nHow did all of this get started?\n\n\u201cOur parent company that started this is Rocky Mountain Care. It was started by brothers Lee and Dee Bangerter in 1999, and at that time, they started the foundation as well, just wanting to give back to the community. The foundation became its own entity and received its 501 c3 designation in 2006, and we operate very separately from Rocky Mountain Care.\u201d\n\nWill anything be changing for the foundation with the Affordable Care Act?\n\n\u201cIt's really going to depend on Utah's interpretation of the law and how they decide to meet the law. If they do have full Medicaid expansion, that's really going to help us a lot, because people are suddenly going to have health insurance coverage. But what a lot of people don't know is a lot of what we cover isn't covered by insurance\u2014eyeglasses, dental care, hearing aids, dentures, things like that.\"\n\nWhat's going on with your elementary school work this year?\n\n\u201cThis year, we've got four or five schools on board already. We'll take any schools that are interested. It's not a prime strain on us, because really, they're doing all the work; we just kind of help celebrate it. We go in and give every kid a ribbon and a little certificate thanking them for their work. We'll take as many schools that are interested.\u201d\n\nWhat's your fundraising goal right now?\n\n\u201cWe're trying to hit $100,000 in private donations this year. We're currently at $80,000, so we really hope to get that and we really hope to get a lot of sustainable supporters who will give to us monthly.\u201d\n\nIn what areas do you need more volunteers?\n\n\u201cWe'll always take on more handymen. I know a lot of our guys work outside of their volunteer work, so they're fitting in these repairs in their spare time. So, we'll always take more of those\u2014we don't want to overwhelm any of our guys.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "rocky mountain care foundation, utah, healthcare, affordable care act, service projects, volunteer opportunity, Bountiful, SLMag, Salt Lake Magazine", "google-site-verification": "fmCJGMLx2Cl9RNw258OpmH_cGvtLYO0u3H29UfpDAyk", "description": "Our chat with Rocky Mountain Care Foundation's Dede Fluette about caring for vulnerable Utahns.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "p": {"domain_verify": "a2f60a76f54b2045f56e657ebb11c34b"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc98bd\"", "article_summary": "Executive Director of Rocky Mountain Care Foundation Dede Fluette, Chairman of the Board LaMar BangerterRocky Mountain Care Foundation is helping Utahns take care of themselves.\n\u201cIt's really going to depend on Utah's interpretation of the law and how they decide to meet the law.\n\u201cOur parent company that started this is Rocky Mountain Care.\nIf they do have full Medicaid expansion, that's really going to help us a lot, because people are suddenly going to have health insurance coverage.\n\u201cAnd we do that in an effort to keep them in their homes living independently as long as they can.\u201d Fluette says."}
