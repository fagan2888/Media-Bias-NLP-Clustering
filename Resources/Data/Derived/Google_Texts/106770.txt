Getting a driver’s license is one of the greatest joys in a person’s life, but the first year behind the wheel can be one of the most dangerous.

Batavia High School students will be reminding all drivers to keep “2 Hands on the Road and 2 Eyes on the Wheel.” Students will be celebrating the privilege of driving through the State Farm Celebrate My Drive campaign Oct. 18 – 26.

Business Professionals of America (BPA) Fundraising Coordinator Bailey Schultz said, “Communities can help Batavia High School by committing to be safe drivers once daily between Oct. 18 and Oct. 26 at www.celebratemydrive.com. The top 100 high schools with the most commitments (votes) will be awarded grants ranging from $25,000 to $100,000.” The top two schools will also win a private concert by Kelly Clarkson.

“We are not trying to scare anyone with scary facts and figures, we just want to provide a positive message and remind students that driving is a privilege and not a right,” said advisor Angie Kovacs. Events planned include a tailgate party to kick-off the event before the homecoming game on October 18th, a seat belt check after school, and a pep rally.

Assistant principal Camey Eberhard said, “Even if we do not win, if the event has a positive effect on even one student it will be worth it.”
