It was the pivotal moment of the race, a glance that crowned the winner.\n\nRohan Dennis was standing up on his pedals Thursday as he pushed through the thick crowd on the final couple hundred meters of Breckenridge\u2019s steep Moonstone Road. After more than 125 miles of high-altitude racing, he was pulling his teammate, yellow-jerseyed Brent Bookwalter. It was time to make a move.\n\nDennis peeked over his shoulder, prepping Bookwalter for the pending lactic crush. Bookwalter wasn\u2019t there, and Dennis decided \u2014 three days before the finish \u2014 he would win the Pro Challenge.\n\n\u201cBasically, it was just a spur of the moment. I had the legs and went over the top as hard as I possibly could. I was working for Brent until he actually dropped the wheel up that climb,\u201d said Dennis, who Sunday became the first non-American to win the Pro Challenge in downtown Denver. \u201cThat was sort of the moment where you could say it changed.\u201d\n\nDennis didn\u2019t show up in Colorado aiming for a win. He was looking down the road at next year\u2019s biggest races. He has been a professional for only five years. Coming to Colorado, his highest-profile win was the first-stage time trial of this year\u2019s Tour de France. The Pro Challenge was his high-altitude training ground.\n\nPHOTOS: USA Pro Challenge 2015, Stage 7\n\nBut as the seven-stage race unfolded, Colorado became his training for podiums.\n\nHis punishing ascents \u2014 including that crusher up Moonstone Road \u2014 and an extraordinary time-trial performance in Breckenridge cemented the biggest win of his career. After a climactic sprint down Broadway on Sunday, which featured Dennis prominently fueling teammate Taylor Phinney\u2019s dash for second place in the final stage, he claimed the Pro Challenge title.\n\nDennis arrived in Park City, Utah, only two weeks ago. He wasn\u2019t adjusted to the altitude like his BMC teammates, who had just finished a second-place showing at the Tour of Utah.\n\nThe team went for a training pedal up the winding Guardsman Pass above Park City. There was no pressure. No talk about Colorado. No pushing Dennis into racing for the win the next week. Eyes were on long-term goals, said BMC Racing Team sport director Jackson Stewart.\n\nThe initial plan for Colorado was for Dennis to support Bookwalter\u2019s bid for the overall win.\n\n\u201cBut we saw very clearly that Rohan was in incredible form and everyone on the team knew he could win this race, but he didn\u2019t want to focus on that. His focus was down the road,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cHis efforts going up Guardsman that day, it was just a whole other level.\u201d\n\nEven if Dennis wasn\u2019t into the win in Colorado, Bookwalter was more than ready to take charge, Stewart said.\n\nBut up on Moonstone Road above Breckenridge, Dennis decided he wanted the win. The next day, he cemented his position as the race leader with a dominating time trial victory. By Stage 6, it was his race to lose.\n\nDennis set blistering paces that not only thwarted many potential attacks on the steepest sections of the race but drove his team to near collapse. There were times when even his workhorse teammates \u2014 such as Phinney, Damian Caruso, Killian Frankiny and Michael Schar \u2014 were struggling to keep up with the rider who wasn\u2019t supposedly racing for victory.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just one of those guys with natural talent,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cEarlier in the race, the guys had already said, \u2018Hey, look, Rohan, we know you don\u2019t want to go for the win, but could you not kill us at the same time?\u2019 He\u2019s just that good.\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasonblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rohan Dennis becomes 1st non-American to win USA Pro Challenge", "title": "Rohan Dennis becomes 1st non-American to win USA Pro Challenge", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/23/rohan-dennis-becomes-1st-non-american-to-win-usa-pro-challenge/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150823_035616_rohan-dennis.jpg", "height": 452}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150823_035616_rohan-dennis.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-23T15:54:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T06:12:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "USA Pro Challenge"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a5e\"", "article_summary": "Bookwalter wasn\u2019t there, and Dennis decided \u2014 three days before the finish \u2014 he would win the Pro Challenge.\nCall it \u201cthe look\u201d of the 2015 USA Pro Challenge.\nI was working for Brent until he actually dropped the wheel up that climb,\u201d said Dennis, who Sunday became the first non-American to win the Pro Challenge in downtown Denver.\nPHOTOS: USA Pro Challenge 2015, Stage 7But as the seven-stage race unfolded, Colorado became his training for podiums.\nThe Pro Challenge was his high-altitude training ground."}
