Representatives at the call center are answering questions about the exchange handling California\u2019s version of the federally mandated health insurance.\n\n\u201cHere in Sacramento you have four [plans] to choose from,\u201d said Covered California director Peter Lee.\n\nBut Choosing between insurance plans, how to enroll, coverage rates and even getting someone on the phone, had some frustrated right away.\n\n\u201cFirst impressions are the most important. And when I call and get a 30-minute wait it\u2019s very discouraging,\u201d said the woman who did not want to be identified.\n\nShe said she couldn\u2019t get through over the phone just 30 minutes after the lines opened, so she decided to come to the call center. Although the center does not accept face-to-face applicants, she said still had a hard time finding someone who could tell her where to go.\n\n\u201cThere is this big building \u2014 cameras everywhere and people in suits \u2014 yet no one can tell me, someone that this program is designed for, where to go,\u201d she said.\n\nLike most first-to-market products, there will be kinks to work out and changes to make along the way. According to a consumer advocate, jammed lines and a rush for information is a good sign.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there are a ton of calls at 8 a.m. on a Tuesday shows how big there demand is,\u201d said Anthony Wright, the director of Health Access Consumer Group.\n\nAbout 300 employees are taking calls at center. Another office opened Tuesday in Concord, with a third slated to open in Fresno in November. Call center hours are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday through Friday. It is also open on Saturday, but for fewer hours.\n\nRelated stories\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act kicked off in California on Tuesday, and almost immediately a call center set up to handle questions was inundated with calls.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2013/10/01/local-covered-california-call-center-opens-to-high-number-of-calls/", "image": {"width": 640, "secure_url": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/call-center-guys.jpg?w=640", "identifier": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/call-center-guys.jpg?w=640", "height": 360}, "type": "article", "description": "The Affordable Care Act kicked off in California on Tuesday, and almost immediately a call center set up to handle questions was inundated with calls.", "title": "Local Covered California Call Center Opens To High Number Of Calls"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/call-center-guys.jpg?w=640", "description": "The Affordable Care Act kicked off in California on Tuesday, and almost immediately a call center set up to handle questions was inundated with calls.", "site": "/social/", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Local Covered California Call Center Opens To High Number Of Calls"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Sacramento", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Sacramento", "article": {"publisher": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/social/", "author": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/social/"}, "keywords": "affordable care act news, local, news, seen on, syndicated local, uncategorized, aca, covered california, health care reform, rancho cordova", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e592dab1a834e9f02fdb648f19487a6?s=16", "news_keywords": "aca, covered california, health care reform, rancho cordova"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1943\"", "article_summary": "The first of three federally funded call centers in California opened their phone lines just before 8 a.m. And as expected, the phone lines were soon jammed.\nCovered California representatives put the call center online just before 8 a.m., and by 8:05 the first call came in.\n\u201cHere in Sacramento you have four [plans] to choose from,\u201d said Covered California director Peter Lee.\nRepresentatives at the call center are answering questions about the exchange handling California\u2019s version of the federally mandated health insurance.\nShe said she couldn\u2019t get through over the phone just 30 minutes after the lines opened, so she decided to come to the call center."}
