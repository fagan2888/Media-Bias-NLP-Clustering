I especially don\u2019t like criticizing Republican candidates running for office in the final month of the campaign. As I sat down to write this article at 9:15 p.m. last night, I had no clue what I was going to be writing about. I thought perhaps I\u2019d write about the Des Moines Register\u2019s latest Iowa Poll that shows Governor Terry Branstad leading his Democrat opponent by 15 points.\n\nExamining another poll showing Branstad with yet another significant lead isn\u2019t all that exciting, but we are at the point where we can begin to talk about what it means to the other candidates on ballot with him. But how can I write about Branstad\u2019s strong poll numbers when I\u2019m greeted with David Young\u2019s comments about Obamacare being \u201chere to stay,\u201d when I powered up my laptop?\n\nHere to stay?\n\nWhat the hell, David?\n\nYoung made the comment at a healthcare forum at Des Moines University on Monday. The Des Moines Register noted that Young \u201cagrees with the sentiment\u201d of those who want to repeal the law, but went out to say it would be more productive to fix the law than repeal it.\n\nLook, I understand that Young was attempting to communicate that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is unlikely, but waving the white flag of surrender on Obamacare in the final days of a congressional campaign is ridiculously stupid. I guess Young was lying when he said that President Obama had \u201cripped apart our healthcare system\u201d in a primary TV ad. I mean, if you think that Obamacare ripped apart our healthcare system, how on earth can you say, \u201cWell it\u2019s here to stay, so maybe we can tweak it to be a little better\u201d?\n\nIronically, despite Young\u2019s \u201cjust deal-with-it\u201d view on Obamacare, his campaign is currently running an ad beating up his Democrat opponent, Staci Appel, for voting against a bill that would have protected Iowans\u2019 right to chose their healthcare. The ad then says, \u201cAppel stands side by side with President Obama supporting Obamacare, legislation that cuts $700 billion from Medicare.\u201d The ad then shows Appel saying in a recent debate, \u201cWhat we shouldn\u2019t be doing is repealing it.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, Young is about as far off message as a candidate can ever get. Heck, writing this article confuses me; I can\u2019t imagine what a typical voters thinks of Young\u2019s schizophrenic campaign. Besides admitting that Obamacare is here to stay, Young has also expressed positions on issues in recent debates that were already giving Republicans heartburn.\n\nYoung supports increasing the gas tax. Furthermore, he advocated adding a new tax on vehicles powered by natural gas. Young also supports a pathway to citizenship for the eleven million or so illegal immigrants who are currently in America. Young also supports means testing for Social Security, and raising the minimum wage to $10.10.\n\nHere is what I find the most frustrating about David Young.\n\nHad Young taken the stage at the District nominating convention back in June and said, \u201cHi, I\u2019m David Young, and I support raising the minimum wage, means testing social security, a pathway to citizenship, new gas taxes, and oh yeah, we all just need to deal with Obamacare,\u201d he would have been booed off the stage. Seriously, it would have been a nasty sight.\n\nYet, the David Young who asked for the Republican nomination never said those things until he secured the Third District Congressional nomination. To say that voters, and especially convention delegates, feel a little misled is an understatement.\n\nElection Day is three weeks away, and lets be honest. David Young is running a campaign like you would expect from a candidate who came in last place in the primary. After watching Young in the debate and seeing his recent comments, I must admit that there is little that he says that I can agree with. Worse yet, as the election draws nears, I\u2019m more confused about David Young\u2019s positions on the critical issues facing this county than I was back in June.\n\nHow disappointing.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Yet, the David Young who asked for the Republican nomination never said those things until he secured the Third District Congressional nomination.\nDavid Young is running a campaign like you would expect from a candidate who came in last place in the primary.\nWorse yet, as the election draws nears, I\u2019m more confused about David Young\u2019s positions on the critical issues facing this county than I was back in June.\nHeck, writing this article confuses me; I can\u2019t imagine what a typical voters thinks of Young\u2019s schizophrenic campaign.\nHere is what I find the most frustrating about David Young."}
