Matt was involved in a horrendous motorcycle accident that left him with several broken bones and a traumatic brain injury. Doctors told Danielle the best course of action would be to take Matt of life support, after giving him a 10 percent chance of survival. But Danielle wasn\u2019t so quick to give up on her new husband.\n\n\u201cIn July of 2011, my husband Matt Davis, was in a motorcycle accident that left him with several broken bones and a Severe Traumatic Brain Injury,\u201d Danielle said on Matt\u2019s GoFundMe page. \u201cHe was 22 and we'd only been married for 7 months. Doctors suggested we remove him from life support and let him go, he would never wake up. I wanted to give him more time to see if he improved. We didn't really have a chance to start our life together, I wasn't going to give up.\u201d\n\nWife ignores doctor's recommendation to pull husband off life support. GoFundMe\n\nIgnoring the advice of Matt\u2019s doctors, Danielle took her husband home to begin her own rehabilitation therapy. She started off by mirroring some of the therapeutic techniques his doctors had used. She also tended to his every need, including using a \u201cfeeding tube, adult \u2018briefs,\u2019 sponge baths, over 20 medications, physical therapy, turning him every 2 hrs to prevent bed sores, etc.\u201d Then, three months after leaving the hospital, something miraculous happened: Matt woke up from his coma.\n\nWhile the joy of having her husband wake up from a coma was indescribable, she had yet another hiccup to deal with: Her husband had no idea who she was. Danielle and Matt started dating two months before they decided to tie the knot. Due to severe long-term memory loss caused by the accident, Matt had no recollection of the past three years.\n\nFollowing the emotional roller coaster that was the past couple of months, Danielle was more than ready to continue to fight for her husband, but she encountered yet another obstacle.\n\nWife ignores doctor's recommendation to pull husband off life support. GoFundMe\n\n\u201cInsurance will no longer pay for therapy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPeople with Traumatic Brain Injury need a lot of rehab. People continue to make improvements even 10 years after their injury. Insurance doesn't pay for the amount of therapy they need so oftentimes that person doesn't reach their full potential.\u201d\n\nDonate to Matt\u2019s GoFundMe account here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "wife, ignores, doctors, recommendation, pull, comatose, husband, life, support, rehabilitates", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "When doctors told Michelle Davis that her husband Matt had a 10 percent chance of ever waking up from his coma, she decided to take matters into her own hands.", "title": "Woman Ignoring Doctor's Advice Saves Comatose Husband's Life [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/wife-ignores-doctors-recommendation-pull-comatose-husband-life-support-rehabilitates-328342", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/04/07/danielle-and-matthew-davis.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When doctors told Michelle Davis that her husband Matt had a 10 percent chance of ever waking up from his coma, she decided to take matters into her own hands.", "title": "Woman Ignoring Doctor's Advice Saves Comatose Husband's Life [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/wife-ignores-doctors-recommendation-pull-comatose-husband-life-support-rehabilitates-328342", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/04/07/danielle-and-matthew-davis.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/07/danielle-and-matthew-davis.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-07T15:04:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-07T15:04:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "When doctors told Michelle Davis that her husband Matt had a 10 percent chance of ever waking up from his coma, she decided to take matters into her own hands."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca053\"", "article_summary": "We didn't really have a chance to start our life together, I wasn't going to give up.\u201dWife ignores doctor's recommendation to pull husband off life support.\nWife ignores doctor's recommendation to pull husband off life support.\nDoctors suggested we remove him from life support and let him go, he would never wake up.\nDoctors told Danielle the best course of action would be to take Matt of life support, after giving him a 10 percent chance of survival.\nGoFundMeIgnoring the advice of Matt\u2019s doctors, Danielle took her husband home to begin her own rehabilitation therapy."}
