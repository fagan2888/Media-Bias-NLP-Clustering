British soul singer Sam Smith seems to have a knack for putting a twist on songs from the 1980s. Earlier this summer, the 22 year old singer took Whitney Houston’s “How Will I Know” and slowed the tempo to create a haunting cover, and now Smith is putting his imprint on Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car.”

BBC Radio 1‘s Live Lounge shared a video of the singer performing the tune alongside a live band, including a cellist. The result is Smith’s own unique take on an intense tune about an effort to escape generational poverty.

“When I was in primary [elementary] school, I was in Year 6, so I was like, 10 years old, and I went to this award thing with my head teacher—I don’t know why—and I remember being in the car and she was playing Tracy Chapman, and I’d started singing along to ‘Fast Car’ and that was the reason why I sang in the first-ever school show I ever sang in, because she heard me. So, I’ve always loved Tracy Chapman since that moment.”

The song, which earned Chapman a Grammy, has been covered by Swimming with Dolphins, Wayne Wonder and David Usher. In 2010, Rolling Stone named the tune one of the 500 greatest songs of all time.

Smith debut album “In the Lonely Hour” became a chart-topper in the U.K. in after claiming the number one spot after outselling Coldplay by 20,000 copies.
