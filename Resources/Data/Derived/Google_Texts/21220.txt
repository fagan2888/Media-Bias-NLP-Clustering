With falling oil prices and low inflation in general, the need to purchase gold as an inflation hedge is simply not there, which is pushing its price down. Bloomberg reported that after rebounding about 4 percent from a four-year low in early November, prices will average $1,175 next quarter, while Société Générale expects $950 in 2015’s fourth quarter.
