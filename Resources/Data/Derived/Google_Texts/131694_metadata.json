These same patients were also less likely to be treated in NCI-designated facilities.\n\nWhile young adults and adolescents without insurance were more likely to be male, the effect of a lack of insurance was seen more often among females.\n\nAccording to the report,uninsured males were 1.51 times more likely to be diagnosed with an advanced stage of cancer when compared to those with insurance, but uninsured females were 1.86 times more likely to be diagnosed in an advanced disease stage when compared to other females with insurance.\n\nWhile the results are as can be expected\u2013individuals without insurance are less likely to visit the doctor and therefore less likely to be diagnosed in a timely manner\u2013experts feel the data can be used to eventually prove the benefits of programs like the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe findings suggest that policies such as the Affordable Care Act that increase the number of people in America with health coverage will result in fewer late-stage cancer diagnoses and save lives,\u201d wrote study authors.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this observation holds the promise of improved cancer control efforts in the AYA population, after decades in which AYA patients have experienced far less victory in the War on Cancer than their younger and older counterparts,\u201d the authors concluded.\n\n\u201cHowever, the success of these efforts may be directly tied to the fate of the Medicaid expansion component of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which, at the time of this writing, remains quite unclear.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Strange Causes Of Cancer Strange Causes Of Cancer\n\n1 of 12 Nerves Nervy individuals may be more at risk of aggressive cancer, new research suggests. Scientists found that anxious mice were worse affected by skin tumours than less fearful animals. Stressed and worried humans could be susceptible in the same way, they believe.
