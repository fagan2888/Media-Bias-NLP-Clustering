On the campaign trail in late October, Trump said, \u201cPeople\u2019s premiums... are going up 35, 45, 55 percent. Their deductibles are so high nobody\u2019s ever going to get to use it. So ... Obamacare is turning out to be a bigger disaster than anybody thought.\u201d While the numbers used there are cherry-picked for effect (and rated \u201chalf true\u201d by\n\nOver the next few weeks, we\u2019ll take a high-level look at the positions of the leading nominees for President when it comes to political issues potentially impacting physicians.A year ago at this time, it would have seemed absurd to think that any article outlining the overall health care policies of the leading Republican candidates for President might lead with the views of Donald J. Trump. But here we are. Despite a recent dip in the polls, he is still considered the front-runner by many, and he is now well past the point of running a candidacy as a public relations move, as many initially suspected.Trump is anything but a cookie-cutter conservative, so his views on health care aren\u2019t easily categorized. They also appear to be somewhat fluid.Trump has repeatedly said he would like to repeal the Politifact ), the sentiment is clear: Trump wants the ACA to be repealed.What might that something better be? No one is quite sure. Initially espousing single-payer systems in Canada and Scotland, Trump has since back-tracked from saying he would prefer a single-payer system in the United States -- a decidedly \u201cun-Republican\u201d notion. Trump has more recently spoken vaguely about a private system. He has also espoused increasing competition between managed care organizations, particularly across state lines. There are few other specifics about his policy ideas.When Trump was considering a Presidential run with the Reform Party in 1999, he described himself as \u201cpro-choice with reservations.\u201d This time around, his views seem to have evolved to being pro-life, although the pro-life community is a bit skeptical about his commitment to the cause. He has stood mainly on the sidelines while his fellow GOP candidates have taken a hard stance on funding for Planned Parenthood. And Trump has supported exemptions to abortion bans in the cases of rape, incest, and danger to the life the mother. Trump has stated on several occasions that his views on abortion haven\u2019t necessarily changed, just that they weren\u2019t fully articulated previously. He will likely have many more chances to articulate them.Trump has maintained on several occasions that he believes there is a link between vaccination and autism, a notion that has been definitively disputed by the scientific and medical communities.Photo credit: Gage Skidmore", "article_metadata": {"description": "Part of an ongoing series that takes a high-level look at the positions of the leading nominees for President when it comes to political issues potentially impacting physicians, this installment focuses on Donald Trump.", "og": {"site_name": "MD Magazine", "description": "Part of an ongoing series that takes a high-level look at the positions of the leading nominees for President when it comes to political issues potentially impacting physicians, this installment focuses on Donald Trump.", "title": "Presidential Candidates on Health Care Issues: Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.hcplive.com/medical-news/presidential-candidates-on-health-care-issues-donald-trump", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v1_media/_upload_image/_thumbnails/Donald_J_Trump.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v2_media/_core/favi/ms-icon-144x144.png", "keywords": "public health, election 2016, Donald Trump, health care reform, cardiology, internal medicine, family medicine, neurology, gastroenterology, psychiatry, endocrinology, pediatrics, rheumatology, pain management, pulmonology, infectious disease, hospital medicine, surgery, dermatology", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "Presidential Candidates on Health Care Issues: Donald TrumpAffordable Care Act and replace it with something better.\nInitially espousing single-payer systems in Canada and Scotland, Trump has since back-tracked from saying he would prefer a single-payer system in the United States -- a decidedly \u201cun-Republican\u201d notion.\nHe has stood mainly on the sidelines while his fellow GOP candidates have taken a hard stance on funding for Planned Parenthood.\nTrump has stated on several occasions that his views on abortion haven\u2019t necessarily changed, just that they weren\u2019t fully articulated previously.\nOn the campaign trail in late October, Trump said, \u201cPeople\u2019s premiums... are going up 35, 45, 55 percent."}
