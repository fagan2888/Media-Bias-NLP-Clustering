The right-wing \u201creligious liberty\u201d crowd\u2014whose law firm, the Becket Fund, represented the inmate\u2014crowed that this was another victory, in line with last year\u2019s Hobby Lobby case.\n\nBut this case has nothing to do with Hobby Lobby. On the contrary, it highlights the distinction between real religious liberty as a shield against government action, and \u201creligious liberty\u201d as a sword to use against others.\n\nThe facts of the case, Holt v. Hobbs, are straightforward. Gregory Holt converted to Islam while in prison, and sought to grow a beard in accordance with his new religion. The Arkansas Department of Correction refused to allow him to do so, citing various security concerns that justify its policy against inmates growing beards. Thus was occasioned a classic religious liberty case. Which takes precedence: the government\u2019s interest in safety, or the individual\u2019s right to freely exercise one\u2019s religion?\n\nThe fact that Holt was a unanimous decision in favor of the prisoner speaks volumes. This was not really a close case, especially after Arkansas\u2019s lawyer had a disastrous run at oral argument. The only reason it was at the Supreme Court in the first place, most likely, is that it involves a prisoner, and courts give extra deference to prisons\u2019 need to maintain order.\n\nThe statute in Holt is, indeed, very similar to the one in Hobby Lobby. Both require that (1) if a government action \u201csubstantially burdens\u201d an individual\u2019s exercise of religion, then the government must have (2) provided a compelling state interest in doing so, and (3) chosen the least restrictive means to do so.\n\nUncredited\n\nThe first and second prongs were slam-dunks. First, everyone knows that growing a beard is a requirement for pious Muslim men (as is its usual practice, the court did not question Holt\u2019s sincerity), and that forbidding them from doing so is a substantial burden on their religious freedom. Second, everyone also knows that prisons have to be kept safe, and all kinds of regulations are necessary to do so.\n\n\n\nBut the third prong\u2014whether banning beards, without exception, is the least restrictive means to maintain safety\u2014is where Arkansas looked silly. The state argued that beards could be used to conceal contraband, and because an inmate might quickly shave to conceal his identity. Writing for the court, Justice Samuel Alito quickly dispatched with these justifications. Most state prison systems allow inmates to grow beards, he noted, and contraband could much more easily be hidden elsewhere (clothes, orifices, etc). Holt had even offered to keep his at just a half-inch long as a compromise\u2014not much room to hide anything there. Justice Alito called this argument \u201chard to swallow.\u201d\n\nAnd as for the concealed-identity piece, the prison could just snap a picture of Holt clean-shaven if its guards were so easily fooled\u2014which, in fact, it already did. Done and done\u2014nine to none.\n\nIncidentally, although not a subject covered in any of the official court documents, one wonders why Arkansas even had these requirements in the first place, and chose to enforce them here. Maybe it\u2019s just a way of maintaining uniformity and discipline. Maybe the Department thinks Holt is blowing smoke. Maybe it\u2019s Islamophobia. Or maybe there\u2019s a deeper security issue: in his court filing, Holt wrote: \u201cI intend to wage jihad against any court personnel, detectives, [and] adverse witnesses\u201d and praised Osama Bin Laden. You can imagine why the Department of Correction wasn\u2019t inclined to help him out.\n\nAnticipating the glee on the Religious Right, Justice Ginsberg appended a seven-line concurrence explicitly distinguishing Holt from Hobby Lobby. Unlike in Hobby Lobby, \u201caccommodating petitioner\u2019s religious belief in this case would not detrimentally affect others who do not share petitioner\u2019s belief.\u201d\n\nExactly. Holt is completely different from Hobby Lobby, because Holt\u2019s beard causes harm to no one. Hobby Lobby\u2019s refusal to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives (coverage it had provided, in blissful ignorance, for years\u2014until the Religious Right made it an issue) harms hundreds, perhaps thousands of women.\n\nThis distinction was ignored in right-wing media\u2019s coverage of the case.\n\nThe Becket Fund\u2019s Eric Rassbach told The Volokh Conspiracy that the recent spurt of religious liberty cases was a result not of millions of dollars of right-wing philanthropic funding, but \u201cthe trend of government expansion\u201d leading to more infringements upon religion. (Right, because the Arkansas Department of Correction is all about Obamacare Socialism. In fairness, Rassbach also noted the rise in \u201cadditional religious minorities.\u201d)\n\nA writer in the National Review reassures us that \u201cwe should all be glad a Muslim man just won his religious-liberty case\u201d (presumably, something a National Review reader might not be glad about) because it is a strike back against \u201cgovernment intolerance.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Here\u2019s an individual with unpopular religious views, not being allowed to practice his religion because of a needless government regulation. Holt is a lot like the 1983 case of Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, in which the town of Hialeah, Fla., suddenly became very interested in animal welfare when a Santeria-like church wanted to perform animal sacrifices. Once again: no harm to other human beings, unpopular minority religion, needless (or even suspicious) government suppression.\n\nThat is why Holt was 9-0, and why everyone from the Christian Post to the New York Times is praising the outcome. Not only is Holt unlike Hobby Lobby\u2014it reminds us all what real religious liberty is all about, and why Hobby Lobby, \u201cTurn the Gays Away\u201d bills, and the \u201cReligious Freedom Restoration Acts\u201d being proposed across the country are so far from it.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "jaymichaelson"}, "keywords": "Religious Freedom, u.s. poli, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.", "publicationDate": 201501251145, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Religious Freedom, US Politics, Hobby Lobby Stores Inc", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Right Wing #Fail on 'Jihadi Hobby Lobby'", "tags": "religious_freedom,topic:politics,entity:company/hobby_lobby_stores_inc", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Conservative activists are cheering the court\u2019s unanimous decision supporting a prisoner\u2019s religious liberty\u2014but the case actually shows how far we\u2019ve wandered from the term\u2019s true meaning.", "title": "Right Wing #Fail on 'Jihadi Hobby Lobby'", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/25/right-wing-fail-on-jihadi-hobby-lobby.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/25/right-wing-fail-on-jihadi-hobby-lobby/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1422186313303.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "Conservative activists are cheering the court\u2019s unanimous decision supporting a prisoner\u2019s religious liberty\u2014but the case actually shows how far we\u2019ve wandered from the term\u2019s true meaning.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jay Michaelson", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-01-25T11:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jay-michaelsonhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/25/right-wing-fail-on-jihadi-hobby-lobby", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Right Wing #Fail on \\\\u0027Jihadi Hobby Lobby\\\\u0027\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/25/right-wing-fail-on-jihadi-hobby-lobby.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/25/right-wing-fail-on-jihadi-hobby-lobby/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47406210.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/25/right-wing-fail-on-jihadi-hobby-lobby\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-25T11:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Jay Michaelson\",\"tags\":[\"religious_freedom\",\"politics\",\"hobby_lobby_stores_inc\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jay-michaelson", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "On the contrary, it highlights the distinction between real religious liberty as a shield against government action, and \u201creligious liberty\u201d as a sword to use against others.\nAnticipating the glee on the Religious Right, Justice Ginsberg appended a seven-line concurrence explicitly distinguishing Holt from Hobby Lobby.\nThe right-wing \u201creligious liberty\u201d crowd\u2014whose law firm, the Becket Fund, represented the inmate\u2014crowed that this was another victory, in line with last year\u2019s Hobby Lobby case.\nThe statute in Holt is, indeed, very similar to the one in Hobby Lobby.\nThus was occasioned a classic religious liberty case."}
