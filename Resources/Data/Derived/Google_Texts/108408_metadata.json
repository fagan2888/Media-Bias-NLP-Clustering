And now, both of these cities are poised to decide what to do about it.\n\nOpinions range all the way from enforcing existing bans against short-term rentals in residential areas (which are rentals of fewer than 30 days) to throwing open the doors and letting them prosper without limit, with a range of options in between.\n\nIf these cities are smart, they\u2019ll loosen regulations to legalize short-term rentals, while ensuring they pay taxes. But the regulatory questions involving short-term rentals extend far beyond whether they stay or go.\n\nDenver\u2019s Inter-Neighborhood Cooperation group, known simply as INC, released an analysis last month of the \u201cimpact to Denver\u2019s neighborhoods regarding short-term rentals,\u201d and it amounts to page after page of unrelenting alarm. Short-term rentals, the document suggests, could jeopardize the \u201cpeaceful and quiet enjoyment of one\u2019s home and property,\u201d \u201cchange the nature of a neighborhood,\u201d \u201cdecrease \u2026 property values,\u201d create burdens on city services and available parking, provide a \u201cMecca for out-of-state visitors for recreational drug use,\u201d reduce the availability of affordable housing, and boost housing costs.\n\nAnd those are just the highlights!\n\nMargie Valdez, who helped prepare the gloomy analysis, assured me that \u201cwe were just trying to spot the issues for Denver, so we didn\u2019t go into possible remedies.\u201d And as negative as the analysis might be, INC has not taken an official position on short-term rentals, she added, but will discuss them at its February meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, Denver Councilwoman Mary Beth Susman, who has chaired a task force of interested council members to examine the issue, says, \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you which way we\u2019re going to go at the moment.\u201d Susman estimates 1,000 Airbnb hosts exist in Denver \u2014 \u201cnot very many out of 300,000 households.\u201d But the number has almost certainly been surging in the past year or two, as home sharing grows in popularity.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Airbnb, she reminded me. \u201cThere are five or six of these sites\u201d that coordinate short-term rentals, such as HomeAway and VRBO (the familiar \u201cvacation rentals by owner,\u201d which has been around for years).\n\nMeanwhile, Boulder Mayor Matt Appelbaum estimates the number of VRBOs in his city at 250, most of them in or near downtown. Some are run as businesses, he says, while others are booked infrequently. As for Airbnb, he thinks 500 to 1,000 homes may have signed up, although city staff is still trying to get a handle on the number.\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do about it? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he told me. \u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s really hard to imagine us saying, \u2018You can\u2019t do this\u2019 \u2014 although of course right now it is illegal. But we\u2019ve got old codes and, like Denver, this happened really fast, and nobody can update their code on the spur of the moment.\u201d\n\nAppelbaum notes that Boulder licenses and inspects rental properties, and \u201cwe\u2019re really serious about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the question is,\u201d he added, \u201cif rental properties have to be licensed and inspected, why is Airbnb different? Should it be different?\u201d\n\nNot long ago, Boulder sent cease-and-desist notices to 20 property owners who were renting space through Airbnb or VRBO, but rescinded them almost immediately when council members got wind of it. The council plans to take up the issue of short-term rentals next month, and didn\u2019t want its efforts pre-empted.\n\nBoth Appelbaum in Boulder and Susman in Denver worry about the impact on rents and affordable housing of investors buying up rental property for exclusive use as short-term rentals. \u201cThat kind of business, in my opinion, threatens our diversity of homes and also affordable homes,\u201d says Susman. Appelbaum believes this is more of an issue for VRBOs than Airbnb, but that \u201ceven if it\u2019s only 300 VRBOs, it\u2019s still 300 units that aren\u2019t being rented out but are being used by visitors.\u201d\n\nDenver Councilwoman Jeanne Faatz takes a harder line. \u201cThis really offends me to have people buying up homes in residential areas to use for this purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we going to try to maintain residential areas or just throw that to the wind?\u201d\n\nWhen she asked her constituents by questionnaire whether they favored allowing short-term rentals in southwest Denver, she said, 80 percent said no.\n\nBut how many homes could ever actually be used exclusively for short-term rentals, with absent owners treating them as investment property? There is a limit to the potential demand for home-sharing, just as there has been a limit to the demand for motels and hotels. And many neighborhoods, mine in southeast Denver included, would hardly be highly sought centers for visiting tourists.\n\nBut if officials are worried, they could require a short-term rental property remain the owner\u2019s primary residence. For every would-be investor champing at the bit of short-term rentals, there must be numerous homeowners who simply wish to supplement their income \u2014 and have no more wish to undermine their neighborhood than anyone else.\n\nEven that strategy is not without risk. When San Francisco imposed strict residency rules on short-term rentals in October, the city was promptly sued by HomeAway, which operates both HomeAway.com and VRBO.com, for discriminating against its business model.\n\nThe concerns of short-term rental critics are not to be dismissed, since most of us move into a community expecting reasonably stable neighbors, not a stream of visitors next door. But why anticipate the worst from the outset, as some critics seem to do? As these services evolve, maybe we\u2019ll discover they have indeed created unintended problems that need addressing. Meanwhile, keep regulations on the light side.\n\nSusman has asked city staff to draft a \u201cstraw-man ordinance\u201d that includes licensing of short-term rentals and mandates that hosts pay a lodger\u2019s tax, use the property as their primary residence and limit rentals to a \u201ccertain number of times a year.\u201d She expects to have it in hand by the end of the month.\n\nIn other cities, Airbnb has agreed (or acquiesced) to regulation involving taxes and primary residence, among other things, but it has hotly contested some proposed restrictions.\n\nAnd so have its hosts. Portland\u2019s complex regulations may be a lesson for both Denver and Boulder. Six months after Portland legalized short-term rental operations in July, fewer than 10 percent of Airbnb hosts had volunteered for the permitting and inspection mandate.\n\nIf Front Range cities aren\u2019t careful, they could end up passing laws their residents simply ignore, too.\n\nE-mail Vincent Carroll at vcarroll@denverpost.com.
