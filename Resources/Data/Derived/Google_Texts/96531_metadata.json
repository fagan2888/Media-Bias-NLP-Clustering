The report predicts that portion will grow to 44 percent by 2088.\n\nIn 1967, by comparison, about 6 percent of the average Social Security check was needed to pay for Medicare premiums. Since then Medicare has expanded by adding benefits like prescription drug coverage which accounts for some of the increased cost to retirees.\n\n\"This is an untold story,\" said Rosemary Gibson, a national expert on patient safety and health care, and a senior advisor at the Hastings Centers, a bioethics research institute in Garrison, N.Y. \"While many people on Medicare have other sources of income, older Americans will see Medicare consume a growing share of their Social Security check.\"\n\nMedicare is financed by a portion of the payroll taxes paid by workers and their employers. Medicare also is financed by monthly premiums deducted from Social Security checks.\n\nSocial Security is the major source of income for most of the elderly. The average monthly Social Security check received by retirees is $1,294. Among elderly Social Security beneficiaries, more than half of married couples and three-quarters of unmarried people get 50 percent or more of their income from Social Security, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nGibson said the elderly are paying more because Medicare spending is out of control. In her book, \"Medicare Meltown,\" she pins much of the blame on drug companies, hospitals, medical device makers, doctors, Wall Street investment banks and other businesses that rely on the more than $600 billion that Medicare spends annually.\n\n\"There is a provider sense of entitlement to Medicare's money,\" she said.\n\nThe trustees' report says the fund covering the Medicare program's hospital costs will remain solvent until 2030, four years later than expected a year ago. The report warned that the portion of Social Security that pays benefits to people with disabilities could run short of money by 2016.\n\nThe report shows the rate of growth in Medicare spending has slowed down in the last few years. Some experts attribute that to the recent economic downturn. Others credit the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which provides financial incentives to hospitals that avoid costly patient readmissions.\n\nThe report warned the growing wave of aging baby boomers combined with rising health care costs could wipe out the Medicare trust fund in 2030, forcing the Medicare program to cut benefits.\n\nYou can contact health writer James T.
