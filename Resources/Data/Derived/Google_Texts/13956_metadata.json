Rand Paul says President Obama must come to Congress to start a war and that he acted against the Islamic State without \u201ctrue constitutional authority\u201d since the country was not under attack at the time.\n\n\u201cBut in either case, this war is now illegal,\u201d the Kentucky Republican and likely 2016 presidential contender wrote in the Daily Beast. \u201cIt must be declared and made valid, or it must be ended.\u201d\n\nMr. Paul also asks where Democrats who stood up to Republican presidents over war are now \u2014 and said conservatives need to stand up against Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions more broadly even on issues where they may agree, such as the campaign against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201c[C]onservatives can\u2019t simply be angry at the president\u2019s lawlessness when they disagree with his policies,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey should end their conspicuous silence about the president\u2019s usurpation of Congress\u2018 sole authority to declare war\u2014even if (especially if) they support going after ISIS, as I do.\u201d\n\nMr. Paul has to a certain extent tried to shirk the label of \u201cisolationist\u201d some have tried to foist upon him, but said questions of the law cannot be a matter of convenience, regardless of the issue.\n\n\u201cThis is important,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe can\u2019t be for the rule of law at our own convenience. It matters how we act both when we agree and when we disagree with the president.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama said last week that he\u2019s going to seek a new authorization of force from Congress to battle the Islamic State. The air campaign against the group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has thus far been based on authorizations passed in 2001 and 2002.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for conservatives to say enough is enough,\u201d Mr. Paul concluded. \u201cObama\u2019s commandeering of Congress\u2019s powers\u2014from making war, to remaking our health-care system\u2014has to stop. There needs to be an across-the-board, consistent defense of the constitutional separation of powers. Nothing less will win the day. That should include this current battle in the Middle East. Taking military action against ISIS is justified. The president acting without Congress is not.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a new opinion piece, Sen.
