But a close look at the survey offers plenty of reasons for concern\u2014chiefly, that trigger warnings are being used to enshrine religious sensitivity in the classroom.\n\nThe National Coalition Against Censorship released the results of its survey on Tuesday; the group interviewed some 800 members of the Modern Language Association and College Art Association about the use of trigger warnings on their campuses. The survey is not scientific.\n\nAnalyzing the survey for The Huffington Post, education reporter Tyler Kingkade wrote an article titled \u201cThe Prevailing Narrative on Trigger Warnings Is Just Plain Wrong\u201d:\n\nDespite the media scare stories, trigger warnings are not widely used by college professors across the country, according to a survey released in full on Tuesday. They're not even widely demanded by students. And when they are used, the warnings address both liberal and conservative concerns. The nonscientific survey, conducted by the National Coalition Against Censorship, is the first of its kind to gather data on the actual use of trigger warnings in college classes. The conclusion: While professors are fretting about the possibility, there is \"no crisis.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that there\u2019s currently no crisis. As Kingkade points out, practically no professors said they had been forced to use trigger warnings, and only a minority of respondents had even been asked to do so by students.\n\nBut there\u2019s still ample cause for worry. As the survey itself warns:\n\nThe demand for warnings, even though pressed by only a minority of students, may nonetheless affect the educational environment for a great many more students if instructors--many understandably nervous about job security--change how or what they teach as a result, if students themselves feel constrained about discussing topics that might be \"triggering\" to others, or if warnings operate to \"shut down dialogue and shame participants in such a way that those participants actually leave the conversation.\"\n\nRemember that the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights increasingly requires universities to safeguard their students from subjective harassment, and the easiest way for administrators to avoid liability is to embrace broad restrictions on speech and conduct that could get the school in trouble. (Remember Laura Kipnis?)\n\nSo while it likely is the case\u2014and may continue to be the case\u2014that very few students want to be protected from offensive ideas, the playing field is titled in their direction.\n\nThis is a bad thing, and liberals ought to recognize it as such. Indeed, the survey spells out the problem: trigger warnings are explicitly being requested as a means to shield religious people from in-class criticism. From the survey:\n\nIn fact, many respondents commented about warnings to address religious sensitivities. A respondent who teaches and holds an administrative post reports receiving \"many complaints, some with parental involvement. These have mostly been religious objections.\u201d Others note specific \"religious objections to nude models in studio courses\" and to \"homoerotic content in art history.\" Another explained that \"the trigger warnings that I place in my general education Humanities course syllabus have to do with religious and moral content that might be offensive to persons who are zealous about their particular faith.\" Yet another observed that \"the Bible \u2026 is a topic that can offend both fundamentalists and those who are not comfortable with religion.\" There was even a \"Rastafarian student [who] was very offended at my comparison of Akhenaten\u2019s Great Hymn to Psalm 104.\"\n\nIs this not cause for some concern? I don\u2019t particularly think students in an art history class should be exempted from studying \u201chomoerotic art,\u201d whatever their religious objections might be. And I certainly don\u2019t think professors should have to cater to their offendedness.\n\nKingkade (and others) are absolutely right that assaults on free speech and academic freedom at university campuses do not come solely from the left, and left-leaning attempts to stifle free speech may have gotten a disproportionate share of attention lately, when right-leaning attempts are often just as blatant. Indeed, there\u2019s something stridently conservative underlying all efforts to restrict expression.\n\nBut that\u2019s all the more reason for liberals to join cultural libertarians in opposing efforts to enshrine feelings-protection on campuses\u2014and to do so now, before we lose any more ground.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Survey says: Not an epidemic, still cause for concern.", "title": "How Trigger Warnings Protect Religious Dogma in the Classroom", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/12/01/how-trigger-warnings-protect-religious-s", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14490076131484.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Survey says: Not an epidemic, still cause for concern.", "title": "How Trigger Warnings Protect Religious Dogma in the Classroom", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14490076131484.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-12-01T22:18:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "But a close look at the survey offers plenty of reasons for concern\u2014chiefly, that trigger warnings are being used to enshrine religious sensitivity in the classroom.\nIndeed, the survey spells out the problem: trigger warnings are explicitly being requested as a means to shield religious people from in-class criticism.\nA new survey of university professor\u2019s attitudes toward trigger warnings is being touted as proof that media panic over campus censorship is overblown.\nThe nonscientific survey, conducted by the National Coalition Against Censorship, is the first of its kind to gather data on the actual use of trigger warnings in college classes.\nAnother explained that \"the trigger warnings that I place in my general education Humanities course syllabus have to do with religious and moral content that might be offensive to persons who are zealous about their particular faith.\""}
