How, for instance, did Noah keep the ark from capsizing? How did he keep his wardrobe fresh? And how, during all that rain, did he and the animals avoid getting seasonal affective disorder?\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nKen Ham believes he has the answers to all these questions and more\u2014and he needs only $73 million to teach them to the world. As president of Answers in Genesis, Ham has already gifted us with a bizarre series of children\u2019s books and an unforgettable creationist museum. The next stage of his quest to convert America to young-Earth creationism is Ark Encounter, a massive creationist amusement park centered around an alleged life-size reconstruction of Noah\u2019s Ark.\n\nLike most of Ham\u2019s projects, Ark Encounter promises to be a heady combination of hands-on fun, perverse indoctrination, and apocalyptic terror. According to Ham\u2019s fundraising newsletters, the ark itself will contain three levels of \u201cedu-tainment\u201d about Noah\u2019s menagerie\u2014which, as noted in his magnum opus Dinosaurs of Eden, included every species of dinosaur, even T. Rex. (How did they fit? As always, Ham has an answer: \u201cWhen it came to the very few dinosaur kinds that grew to a very large size, God probably sent \u2018teenagers,\u2019 NOT \u2018fully grown adults\u2019 on the Ark.\u201d) The ark\u2019s exhibits will likely follow the lead of the Creation Museum, intertwining spectacularly weird animatronics, comically idiotic sophism, and menacing warnings of cultural decay.\n\nFrom the Answers in Genesis newsletter; photo by Mark Stern\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFamilies who tire of such cerebral activities can frolic in Ark Encounter\u2019s other offerings, an ambitious collection of \u201chistorically authentic\u201d attractions. These will include \u201ca tower of Babel with a 5D [sic] theater, a ride through the plagues of Egypt, a First Century village, drama theaters, a pre-flood village, [and an] amphitheater.\u201d Budding zoologists can visit the petting zoo, a walk-through aviary, or live animal programs. (We\u2019re a little too late for a live dinosaur show, though\u2014in Ham\u2019s world, humans hunted them to extinction literally hundreds of years ago, \u201cfor food or skins.\u201d)\n\nIt won\u2019t be all fun and games at Ark Encounter. The ark, to Ham, is a symbol of end times, of the divine punishment humans face when we challenge God\u2019s authority. The ark, Ham claims on the Answers in Genesis website, \u201cwas also a visual warning of the condemnation that was coming\u2014a judgment of those who had rebelled and would not turn their hearts to God.\u201d\n\nSound familiar? It does to Ham:\n\nWhy is the time right to build another Ark? Well, today there is great rebellion against God and His Word in the land. With increasing homosexual behavior and a growing acceptance of abortion, God\u2019s hand of judgment is being seen as He withdraws the restraining influence of His Holy Spirits. [...] There is no doubt God is judging America. And one major recent sign of God\u2019s judgment is that homosexual behavior is permeating the culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe ark must \u201cstand as a warning of coming judgment\u2014to condemn those who reject God\u2019s clear Word.\u201d Gays, scientists, and liberals: Consider yourselves on notice. According to Ham, our current era of sin may soon be flooded by another cataclysm of divine punishment. When it arrives, those who \u201cencounter ... God\u2019s Word\u201d (young-earth creationists, as long as they aren\u2019t gay) will travel through the \u201cdoor of the \u2018Ark\u2019 \u201d to \u201cthe Lord Jesus.\u201d Those who don\u2019t will go to Hell\u2014a doomsday rapture Ham feverishly anticipates.\n\nFrom the Answers in Genesis newsletter; photo by Mark Stern\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem. Before Ham can usher in a new era of mass destruction \u201cto separate and to purify those who believe in Him from those who don\u2019t,\u201d as he wrote in his newsletter to supporters, he\u2019ll need to actually build his ark\u2014and three years after first announcing the project, he hasn\u2019t even broken ground. The project\u2019s first phase will require $73 million in total, and $24 million just to commence construction. (The state of Kentucky generously offered to toss in $37.5 million worth of tax breaks, though those will expire in 2014.) The next phases will require $52.6 million. Thus far, Answers in Genesis has raised $13.6 million\u2014just 10 percent of an optimistic estimate of the total cost. For a while, Ham maintained public silence on the delay. Then, this fall, he explained the delay in a letter to Answers in Genesis donors and supporters:\n\nIn large part because of AiG\u2019s [Answers in Genesis\u2019] strong biblical stand against the Obamacare legislation\u2019s mandated coverage of abortion-causing drugs, AiG pursued a change in the Ark Encounter funding structure that now includes a bond investment opportunity for you to consider. Actually, God has used this legislation for good! ... [O]ur stand has created an exciting opportunity for you. Now you will be able to invest in what I believe to be to be one of the most thrilling outreaches to challenge church and culture in the USA and worldwide concerning the authority of the Word of God and the saving gospel.\n\nI asked Answers in Genesis\u2019 CCO, Mark Looy, exactly how the Affordable Care Act hindered the group\u2019s fundraising abilities. He explained that \u201cwe originally planned to raise the remaining funding from a private placement equity offering for Christians who met SEC required accredited investor standards.\u201d Those who contributed would then \u201cparticipate as limited equity members in an LLC, with AiG as the controlling/operating member.\u201d But after Obamacare was upheld, the group\u2019s lawyers believed that \u201cArk Encounter would be required ... to provide abortifaciants (i.e., abortion-causing drugs) under its health coverage to its employees.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPresumably, Ham and Looy are referring to the ACA\u2019s mandated coverage for Plan B\u2014which, in fact, is not an abortifaciant. Regardless, the mere possibility of providing contraceptive services was, Looy says, \u201cnot acceptable to us.\u201d\n\nThe solution? \u201cA private bond offering through a 501(c)(3) that will allow us to claim the exemption to supply abortifaciants.\u201d Under its previous financing scheme, Ark Encounter was just another LLC. Now it\u2019s transformed itself into an official religious nonprofit, one eligible to seize the perks that come with the title.\n\nIn an executive summary sent to its supporters, Answers in Genesis makes the bonds sound like a decent investment. The group is offering bonds with 7-, 11-, and 15-year maturities, at yields between 5 and 6 percent. A 7-year bond starts at $250,000, while an 11-year bond begins at $50,000.\n\nTempting as those rates may seem, there\u2019s a small catch. As Answers in Genesis readily admits, the bonds \u201care not expected to have any substantial secondary market\u201d and are \u201cnot an obligation of AiG.\u201d Somewhat alarmingly, the bonds are unrated, an indication that they\u2019re extremely risky\u2014and almost impossible to resell. High risk, higher yield: These, in essence, are creationist junk bonds.\n\nFrom Dinosaurs of Eden, by Ken Ham; photo by Mark Stern\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nI asked Jie Yang, a professor of finance at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business, for his opinions of the bonds.\n\n\u201cI would agree that these bonds are very high risk,\u201d he told me. In addition to their lack of rating and a secondary market, the bonds are callable, meaning Answers in Genesis can collect on the bond at any point before it has matured. (The buyer has no such privilege.) Moreover, the bonds are secured only by the revenues and assets of the Ark Encounter project, not by Answers in Genesis itself.\n\n\u201cShould the project be unsuccessful,\u201d Yang notes, \u201cAiG holds no responsibility in meeting the interest payments of these bonds and the bonds may default.\u201d If the project falls through, in other words, investors won\u2019t just lose their interest payments: They\u2019ll lose their entire investment.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Ark Encounter, a creationist theme park, is selling junk bonds.", "fb-share": "The Sketchy Finances of the Noah\u2019s Ark Theme Park", "sailthru.author": "Mark Joseph Stern", "description": "Building a full-scale wooden replica of Noah\u2019s Ark forces one to confront a number of conceptual challenges.
