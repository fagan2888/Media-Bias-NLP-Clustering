Mike Enzi, Syria, Wyoming Senate race, Entertainment News, News, Politics News\n\nA sneering Liz Cheney, looking to unseat Wyoming GOP Sen. Mike Enzi, told a Tea Party town hall in Jackson Hole Tuesday night that she would not support a congressional resolution to back President Obama\u2019s planned Syria strike, deriding him for \u201can amateurish approach to national security and foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe daughter of the man responsible for fabricating the case for the Iraq war, the man who famously insisted \u201cwe will, in fact, be treated as liberators\u201d and who had no plan for when that predictably turned out not to be the case \u2013 the daughter of that man is upset that Obama doesn\u2019t seem to have a clear plan for Syria. This news comes on the heels of disgraced former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Cheney\u2019s partner in war crime, blasting Obama\u2019s plan as \u201cfeckless\u201d and deriding him as the \u201cso-called commander in chief.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s recap: The team responsible for one of the worst decisions in American foreign policy history is kneecapping the president in a time of crisis. Of course, Dick Cheney has been attacking Obama from the beginning, insisting before he was inaugurated that he was making America less safe by promising to end torture and close Guant\u00e1namo. But now his daughter is taking her Obama contempt so far that she\u2019s bucking her dad\u2019s neocon friends and resisting the president\u2019s Syria plans.\n\nCheney\u2019s turnaround is pretty striking. She was a co-founder of the neocon group Keep America Safe, along with always-wrong war-lover William Kristol. TNR\u2019s Marc Tracy has detailed Cheney\u2019s long list of statements backing action against Assad going back to 2007. As an assistant secretary of state she tried to use funds for regime change in Syria and Iran. Just last month, the Washington Post\u2019s Jennifer Rubin (who\u2019s in the running to share Kristol\u2019s title of \u201calways wrong\u201d) listed Cheney as among the rising Republican stars who would buck \u201cthe isolationist trend in our party and in the country itself.\u201d But now, running in a state that\u2019s skeptical of more foreign interventions, she\u2019s siding with the isolationists.\n\nCheney downplays the extent to which she\u2019s split from former GOP allies. \u201cThe press will try to portray this Syria debate as a battle between wings of the Republican Party,\u201d she told the friendly right-wing audience. \u201cDon\u2019t believe them.\u201d But in fact there is a split in the GOP, and Cheney is putting herself on Team Rand Paul.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liz Cheney bashes Obama\u2019s \u201camateurish\u201d Syria plan, while Rummy calls him \u201cfeckless.\u201d Their opinions are meaningless", "title": "No one cares what Rumsfelds or Cheneys think about Syria!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Liz Cheney bashes Obama\u2019s \u201camateurish\u201d Syria plan, while Rummy calls him \u201cfeckless.\u201d Their opinions are meaningless", "title": "No one cares what Rumsfelds or Cheneys think about Syria!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/04/no_one_cares_what_rumsfelds_or_cheneys_think_about_syria/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/rumsfeld_liz_cheney.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Liz Cheney bashes Obama\u2019s \u201camateurish\u201d Syria plan, while Rummy calls him \u201cfeckless.\u201d Their opinions are meaningless", "title": "No one cares what Rumsfelds or Cheneys think about Syria!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/rumsfeld_liz_cheney.jpg", "creator": "@joanwalsh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joan Walsh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, Barack Obama, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Liz Cheney, President Barack Obama, Sen.
