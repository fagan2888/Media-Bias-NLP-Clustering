That is according to Owen Perkins, director of communications for Colorado Cares YES.\n\nPerkins was the guest speaker at a Logan County League of Women Voters (LWV) meeting Sunday afternoon at Faith United Methodist Church. Perkins said Colorado Care found a way to reduce the cost to $25 billion and cover every resident in Colorado.\n\nPerkins said the Affordable Care Act (ACA) made a significant impact on health insurance in Colorado. Prior to the law\u2019s enactment, Colorado had about 800,000 residents uninsured, according to Perkins.\n\nHe said the number of uninsured still hovers at between 350,000 and 400,000. He says there are also about $750 billion wasted annually and a \u201chuge\u201d growth in administration.\n\n\u201cThe bureaucracy has grown out of control,\u201d he said.\n\nPerkins said 20% of client premiums go to administrative costs. Medicare, meanwhile, is only about 4% administration, Perkins said.\n\nHe said in Colorado there is about $4.5 billion in waste associated with medical costs, nearly the same amount Colorado Cares says can be saved under the new program.\n\nPerkins said in addition to the number of residents uninsured, the number of underinsured is also increasing. He defines underinsured as people who buy policies with premiums but with deductibles too high for the client\u2019s budget. He said 62% of bankruptcies are medical expenses.\n\nAmendment 69, the proposed change to medical services in Colorado, includes a new tax structure and will have to be explained in relation to the TABOR Amendment.\n\n\u201cIt is a tax,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cIt will be on the ballot as a tax.\u201d\n\nHe said Amendment 69 will eliminate health insurance premiums. It will also address preventive and primary care coverage. There will be no deductibles or co-pays.\n\n\u201cAll that is replaced by a payroll deduction,\u201d he said.\n\nPerkins said employees will pay a 3.33% income tax, and employers will pay a 6.67% payroll tax to provide for platinum level coverage.\n\nEmployers can choose to pay for more coverage, but they will not be able to offer less. Perkins said one of the clauses of the ACA is a state can only replace it if it offers a service the same or better than the ACA.\n\nHe said all businesses will be required to participate with no minimum staffing requirements. Self-employed workers will have to pay the full 10%.\n\nPerkins said as an example under Amendment 69 a worker making $50,000 annually would pay $139 a month for health insurance and the employer would pay $278.\n\nPerkins referred to it as a \u201cnonprofit cooperative.\u201d He said everyone is a member and the rates only go up if voters approve a rate increase. He added membership is residence-based, not citizenship-based.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not citizenship. It\u2019s residency,\u201d he said.\n\nPerkins said another issue discovered in researching for Amendment 69 is the disparity between regions in Colorado. He said healthcare costs vary greatly across the state.\n\n\u201cThat will go away. The state will be the same across the board,\u201d he said.\n\nPerkins said Amendment 69 will also save counties and municipalities costs as well. He estimated the program would save the City of Sterling about $1.25 million annually.\n\nThe coloradocares.co/amendment69 website defines ColoradoCares as a \u201cresident-owned, non-governmental health care financing system designed to ensure comprehensive, quality, accessible, lifetime health care for every Colorado resident. ColoradoCare also replaced the medical portion of Worker\u2019s Compensation, according to the website.\n\nBeneficiaries temporarily living or traveling in another state will also receive coverage.\n\nPerkins did say it is not a true single-pay system. There are exceptions including veterans, Tri Care and Native Americans.\n\nThe proposed taxes that would replace health insurance premiums will not take affect until 2019, according to Perkins. However, there will be a \u201csmall tax implemented\u201d to finance the start-up costs.\n\nHe said private insurance companies will be able to continue.\n\nAmendment 69 was first proposed by Democratic District 32 State Sen.
