The disability and absence management landscape continues to undergo significant change. Most of the changes are driven by legal and regulatory requirements, which have increased in scale and scope over the past few years.

One of the more significant changes, of course, is the Affordable Care Act. We are only now beginning to see the disability management impacts driven by an increased emphasis on wellness, prevention and obesity. Disability and absence management professionals are learning a great deal more about these topics. The same is true of the issues surrounding the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
