Self-loathing is. But between self-loathing and narcissism is a vast spectrum comprising infinitely various degrees of self-regard. Neither extreme is good. If only we could just reach medium.\n\nIn 1986, California state assembly member John Vasconcellos proposed the State Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem. This ignited a new movement: Based on the notion that low self-esteem caused every kind of social woe from teenage pregnancy to low test scores and high dropout rates, school curricula and parenting techniques were radically transformed, their main objective now being to cultivate high self-esteem among the young, which activists proclaimed would cure those social woes and make America a safer, happier, and better place. A multibillion-dollar industry surged around self-esteem. Kids were taught to make \u201cme\u201d flags of their putative \u201cme\u201d nations, to view history and fiction through the filter of their feelings, and to start schooldays with affirmations such as I always make good choices and Everyone is happy to see me.\n\nThe aftermath has not worked out as planned. Since 1986, self-esteem among young people has increased. Studies show that students hold themselves in higher regard than students in decades past. But to the shock and horror of the self-esteem movement\u2019s boosters, soaring self-esteem has done nothing to stem crime, addiction and those other ills the boosters claimed high self-esteem would stem. In fact, ambient sky-high self-esteem might present new problems of its own: One long-term study found that college students are now twice as narcissistic as college students were in 1982; other studies link high self-esteem with high rates of aggression, territorialism, elitism, racism, and other negative qualities.\n\nAnd other studies show that the so-called Millennial Generation \u2013 young adults born after the self-esteem movement began \u2014 are demonstrably less likely than Baby Boomers and Generation Xers to care about social problems, current events or energy conservation. Millennials are also less likely to have jobs whose main purpose is to help other people. In one study, three times as many Millennials as Boomers said they made no personal effort to help the environment.\n\n\u201cCertain forms of high self-esteem seem to increase one\u2019s proneness to violence,\u201d reads one report published in the journal of the American Psychological Association. \u201cAn uncritical endorsement of the cultural value of high self-esteem may therefore be counterproductive and even dangerous. The societal pursuit of high self-esteem for everyone may literally end up doing considerable harm.\u201d\n\nNoting that there are \u201calmost no findings showing that [high] self-esteem causes anything [beneficial] at all,\u201d University of Pennsylvania psychology professor Martin Seligman laments:\n\n\u201cSomething striking has happened to the self-esteem of American children during the era of raising our children to feel good. They have never been more depressed.\u201d\n\nThis is no doubt partly because, raised to believe that they are special and perfect and entitled to all good things, they face terrible comedowns in the real world.\n\nIf (as often happens nowadays) every student in a class gets an A grade or every player in a tournament gets a trophy not because they all deserved these things, but rather in order to boost their self-esteem, then A becomes commonplace and meaningless, an average grade of no particular pride-inducing significance, just as C was a few decades ago. And the notion of \u201cvictory\u201d is blurred. If everyone is special, then no one is special. Q.E.D.\n\nSuch revelations might shock the self-esteem boosters, who envisioned high self-esteem as an all-powerful magic potion, but will probably not shock us. Researchers have found that high self-esteem does not guarantee happiness and is often linked with depression because those whose self-esteem is elevated on false or flimsy pretexts \u2013 e.g., being told that everyone adores you or being told you\u2019re perfect just for existing \u2013 are highly susceptible to all perceived slights. So-called beneficiaries of the self-esteem boom have been brainwashed to believe they deserve the best grades, the best treatment, the best of everything. Thus they are very easily offended, angered, disappointed, and crushed by even the faintest criticism. Psychologists call that kind of sky-high but baseless self-esteem \u201cfragile self-esteem.\u201d Its healthy opposite is achievement-based \u201csecure self-esteem\u201d \u2013 otherwise known as earned self-respect \u2013 which is not necessarily sky-high, but less likely to leave its possessors sulking and raging when the real world delivers its usual harsh doses of reality.\n\nPeople with high self-esteem often seem like aliens to us, and icky aliens at that. We blame ourselves for everything. They take no blame. We\u2019re always sorry. They never are. We fear punishment. They don\u2019t. Often, they do the punishing. Our flaws obsess us. They think they have none.\n\n\u201cOne has only to go into a prison,\u201d writes former jail doctor Theodore Dalrymple, \u201cto see the most revoltingly high self-esteem among a group of people (the young thugs) who had brought nothing but misery to those around them, largely because they conceived of themselves as so important that they could do no wrong. For them, their whim was law, which was precisely as it should be considering who they were in their own estimate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The self-esteem movement has worked: We like ourselves more than ever.
