Republicans reached out to Latino voters at the Cinco de Mayo festival in Denver this weekend, and the outreach will continue Tuesday when RNC Chairman Reince Priebus comes to Denver.

As part of Cinco de Mayo, Preibus will have lunch with the Colorado Hispanic Advisory Council; Steve House, the chairman of the Colorado Republican Party and Congressman Mike Coffman of Aurora.

“The RNC is deeply committed to engaging the Hispanic community. That means not just showing up in an election year but making the effort year round to listen to their concerns and fight for the issues they care about,” said RNC spokesman Fred Brown.

At the Civic Center Park Saturday, Coffman talked to visitors in their own language. He has been taking Spanish lessons since his district was redrawn from a safe, mostly white district to one that is evenly divided among political affiliations and features a melting pot of constituents. The RNC in April held Coffman up as a model as what Republicans need to do woo Latino voters.

Coffman was joined by Republican state legislators and other elected officials. Republicans, including Secretary of State Wayne Williams, also were the festival on Sunday.

“The Colorado GOP has been working hard to reach and engage each of the state’s diverse communities,” House said. “Festivals like Cinco de Mayo provide the perfect opportunity to discuss our shared vision for a more prosperous country where everyone can succeed and provide for their families.”
