First comes the baby, then, we\u2019ll see. For people who don\u2019t have a college degree, having a child in wedlock has become the exception, not the rule. According to a new analysis presented at the Population Association of America, among parents aged 26 to 31 who didn\u2019t graduate from college, 74 percent of the mothers and 70 percent of the fathers had at least one child outside of marriage. Even among mothers who had high school degrees or some college but no B.A., the majority of births occur among moms who are either single or cohabiting. For the study, researchers examined the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which interviewed 9,000 young people born between 1981 and 1998 annually from 1997 to 2011. They found that the more education a mother has, the less likely she is to have a baby out of wedlock: Of mothers with no high school diploma, 87 percent had at least one baby while unmarried. Births among women who didn't finish high school Of mothers with a high school diploma, 71 percent had at least one baby while unmarried. Births among women who finished high school Of mothers with one to three years of college, 67 percent had at least one baby while unmarried. Births among women with some college Of mothers with four or more years of college, 32 percent had at least one baby while unmarried. Births among women who completed college The less-educated mothers also tended to have their children younger. Women with B.A.s were most likely to have children at age 29 or 30, while those with high-school degrees had them at 22.\n\n\u201cThe clear line is whether you have a four-year college degree,\u201d the study's lead author, Johns Hopkins sociologist Andrew Cherlin, told me. \u201cThere are two clear paths through adulthood\u2014one for people who have a bachelor's degree and one for people who don't.\" There are several things going on here: First, the cornerstone theory of marriage no longer applies. Culturally, young adults of all social classes and income levels are less likely to think of marriage as the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of their lives\u2014that is, the first thing they do as adults. Instead, people now think of it as a \u201ccapstone\u201d\u2014 sort of a trophy for having earned a B.A., obtained a job, and generally learned to live on their own for a while. The national marriage age has gradually ticked up as a result. For people who don\u2019t have all the stones leading up to the capstone, though, the entire order of operations gets messed up. Second, marriage is increasingly something only educated people do. As my former colleague Jordan Weissmann wrote, the less a man earns these days, the less likely he is to have ever been hitched. College-educated people are increasingly only marrying other college-educated people, and they\u2019re more likely to get married overall. One reason less-educated women are having children out of wedlock is that college-educated men are not interested in marrying them. \u201cThe college-educated young adults can see a good future, where they're likely to find a good partner, pool two incomes, and they're willing to wait to have kids till they can do that,\u201d Cherlin said. Meanwhile, the less-educated women \u201cdon't see the possibility of finding partners with good incomes. And many are unwilling to give up the opportunity to have a kid by waiting.\u201d Related Story Sorry, Marriage Is a 'Luxury Good' Women without college degrees see a dearth of husband options around them.
