And some of its candidates aren\u2019t very happy about it.\n\nThe DNC said that beginning in October it would sanction one debate per month until primaries begin, for a total of six. The GOP, by contrast, has 11 debates on the schedule (12 if you count tonight\u2019s early meeting between the candidates who didn\u2019t qualify to be on the big stage.)\n\nRelated: A GOP Debate in Two Acts, with a Cast Looking for a New Star\n\n\u201cThis debate schedule will provide multiple opportunities for our candidates to engage in a rigorous discussion, not only with each other, but also to show the American people where Democrats stand,\u201d said DNC Chair and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in an announcement posted on Medium.\n\nBoth parties are paring back the number of debates. The last time the Democrats didn\u2019t run an incumbent, 2008, the party scheduled 16. In 2012 the Republicans hosted an unwieldy 20 of them, down from 23 in 2008.\n\nThe drop into single digits, though, is raising protest from candidates like former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, neither of whom enjoys the sort of total name recognition that frontrunner Hillary Clinton does.\n\nRelated: Sanders Continues to Cut Clinton\u2019s Lead in New Hampshire\n\nO\u2019Malley went on the attack on Twitter, going after the DNC directly. However, his assertion that the DNC is \u201cnot in charge\u201d of organizing the Democratic debate schedule is probably open to question.\n\nHey @TheDemocrats: hands off our debates! You're not in charge. They should be set by the voters, not folks in DC. #WeNeedDebate \u2014 Martin O'Malley (@MartinOMalley) August 6, 2015\n\nIn a news release, O\u2019Malley groused that the schedule \u201cseems geared toward limiting debate and facilitating a coronation.\u201d\n\nSanders said he was also unhappy with the plan, and would press for more debates. \u201cAt a time when many Americans are demoralized about politics and have given up on the political process, I think it\u2019s imperative that we have as many debates as possible \u2013 certainly more than six. I look forward to working with the DNC to see if we can significantly expand the proposed debate schedule.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With the first Republican debate of the 2016 presidential election cycle only hours away, the Democratic National Committee announced the slate of debates it plans to sponsor during the coming months.
