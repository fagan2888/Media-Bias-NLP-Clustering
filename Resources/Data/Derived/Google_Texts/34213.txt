SAMs Club in Meridian had a day of fun and games, food and cotton candy.

The event was put on to raise money for Blair E Batson's children's hospital. Saturdayâ€™s activities included several different games kids could play including throwing water balloons at manager Jason Collie. He says their goal is to raise $15,000.

"If you think about the children in the hospital it supports, a lot of the community uses Batson hospital. We want to make sure we do our part in supporting them," SAMs Club manager Jason Collie says.

If you would like to donate to the Children's Hospital you can do so until June 15. Sam's Club also have a rummage sale in their parking lot on May 30 for more information you can contact Sam's Club.
