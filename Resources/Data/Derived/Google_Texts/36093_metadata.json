Jeff Zients \u2014 the guy President Obama tasked with managing the Healthcare.gov cleanup job \u2014 told reporters on a conference call Friday that Obamacare\u2019s federally facilitated insurance marketplaces should be working well by the end of November.\n\nThe Healthcare.gov rollout has been so bad and the threat to the integrity of the law is so real, it stands to reason this isn\u2019t just spin or wishful thinking. It could turn out to be wrong. But at this point the administration gains nothing by sugarcoating things. Quieting criticism for a month won\u2019t have any demonstrable benefits if by the end of November the system\u2019s still broken. They\u2019ll have just compounded the damage they\u2019ve done to their credibility and people\u2019s faith in the project.\n\nSo I\u2019m optimistic that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on here.\n\nBut in the unlikely event that the whole thing crashes, I want to circle back to a long post Ross Douthat wrote this week, which essentially posits that if Obamacare fails, the conservative and liberal visions of where to go next don\u2019t overlap at all.\n\nI agree with Ross\u2019 broad assessment even if there are a few things I\u2019d quibble with at the margin of his description of the liberal health care ideal. I also don\u2019t really think a total healthcare.gov failure will put the country\u2019s health care system at the center of a struggle between more liberal and more conservative reforms.\n\nBut here\u2019s where I think Ross\u2019 analysis of the left-right health care divide veers wildly off course.\n\n[C]onservatives and libertarians (and a few liberals) \u2026 look at the European/Canadian model and say, Surely there\u2019s a better way than that. Yes, we concede, the strictly socialized systems do seem to save money relative to our mixed, kludge-y, public-private mess. But we also think that Americans really do get something for all the extra money that we spend: Specifically, a system that appears to drive a leonine share of global health care innovation, creating the drugs and procedures and life-extending technologies that then ripple outward, improving health and life expectancy in the developed and developing world alike. And the great fear on the right is that if we, too, end up controlling costs from the top down the way other countries do, then we won\u2019t just squeeze waste out of the system, we\u2019ll squeeze out innovation and drive out talent as well \u2026 and worse, we won\u2019t even know it, because we\u2019ll just assume that the innovations that we get are the only ones there could have been.\n\nI think the culprit here is a false syllogism: I am a conservative; I worry about the innovation loss that might accompany a single-payer health care system; ergo the core of conservative opposition to single-payer is a profound concern for medical research.\n\nThat just doesn\u2019t comport with reality at all. In Ross\u2019 view, the right\u2019s approach to a post-Obamacare world \u2014 \u201cthe beau ideal for right-of-center health policy types\u201d \u2014 would combine universal catastrophic coverage with tax advantaged health savings accounts, reflecting an approach that, in his telling, has worked out okay in Singapore. But there are two big problems here. First is that in a scenario where the right is handed the opportunity to remake the country\u2019s health care system, this isn\u2019t the system they would make. Conservative health policy wonks just don\u2019t have the same kind of juice with conservative lawmakers that liberal wonks do with Democrats.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A prominent New York Times columnist doesn't understand GOP opposition to Obamacare is part of its war on the poor", "title": "Ross Douthat\u2019s right-wing fairy tale: What the New York Times columnist misses about Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A prominent New York Times columnist doesn't understand GOP opposition to Obamacare is part of its war on the poor", "title": "Ross Douthat\u2019s right-wing fairy tale: What the New York Times columnist misses about Obamacare", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/26/ross_douthats_right_wing_fairy_tale_what_the_new_york_times_columnist_misses_about_obamacare/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/ross_douthat.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A prominent New York Times columnist doesn't understand GOP opposition to Obamacare is part of its war on the poor", "title": "Ross Douthat\u2019s right-wing fairy tale: What the New York Times columnist misses about Obamacare", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/ross_douthat.jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Beutler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Medicare, Obamacare, Ross Douthat, single payer", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda9db\"", "article_summary": "First is that in a scenario where the right is handed the opportunity to remake the country\u2019s health care system, this isn\u2019t the system they would make.\nBut here\u2019s where I think Ross\u2019 analysis of the left-right health care divide veers wildly off course.\nConservative health policy wonks just don\u2019t have the same kind of juice with conservative lawmakers that liberal wonks do with Democrats.\nI agree with Ross\u2019 broad assessment even if there are a few things I\u2019d quibble with at the margin of his description of the liberal health care ideal.\nTopics: Editor's Picks, Medicare, Obamacare, Ross Douthat, single payer, Politics NewsHere\u2019s some good news."}
