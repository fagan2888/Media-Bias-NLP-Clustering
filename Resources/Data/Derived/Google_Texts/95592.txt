Poet Crystal Valentine has perfectly summed up the absurdity of the so-called "race card."

The Bronx-born slam poet performed a poem titled "Questions for Fox News Regarding the Race Card," in October at the Individual World Poetry Slam. She had some poignant things to ask of the network that often accuses black people of "playing the race card."

"If in the event that I am stopped and frisked, can I pull out my race card? Will this race card increase my chances of survival?"

In a video of the performance, posted by Button Poetry earlier this month, Valentine goes on to emphasize the ways in which "pulling the race card" (i.e. calling attention to racism and oppression) often does nothing to actually help black people.

“Will this race card give me health benefits?" continues. "How about Obamacare? Will it reimburse me for my cousin’s casket? Will it unbury his body? Will it remove his name from a tombstone?”

Powerful stuff. Listen to the entire poem above.
