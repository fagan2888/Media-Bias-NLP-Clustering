The First Amendment protects my right to discriminate against gay people! Neither the Constitution nor the Bible contains the word \"Obamacare\"!\n\nBut Republican politicians have a few glaring blind spots when it comes to the Constitution. One of those is the 14th Amendment, a pillar of our inclusive democracy, a key component of which Republican presidential candidates are now asking us to ignore or change.\n\nIn its infamous Dred Scott decision in 1857, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the descendants of enslaved people were disqualified from U.S. citizenship. After we fought a civil war, the U.S. ratified the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868, which overturned Dred Scott in its opening lines, declaring, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\n\nDuring the congressional debate over the 14th Amendment, both its supporters and detractors recognized that this birthright citizenship clause would apply to everyone born on U.S. soil, not just the descendants of slaves. In 1898, the Supreme Court ruled that even after the passage of the discriminatory Chinese Exclusion Act, the U.S. could not deny citizenship to Wong Kim Ark, a California-born son of Chinese immigrants, because the 14th Amendment guaranteed him citizenship.\n\nYet, anti-immigrant activists and their allies in the GOP are now fighting against this most American of constitutional principles.\n\nJeb Bush has been getting unearned credit for acknowledging that birthright citizenship is a \"constitutional right\" that we shouldn't \"take away\" -- just a few days after implying that if he had a \"magic wand\" to change the Constitution he would use it to do just that. Similarly, John Kasich has renounced his previous support for repealing birthright citizenship, but now says he doesn't want to \"dwell on it.\" Carly Fiorina's and Rick Perry's passionate defense of the 14th Amendment is that it would take too much work to change it. This is what now passes for moderation. What ever happened to defending basic constitutional rights?\n\nThe Republican presidential contenders' rush to badmouth a basic constitutional right -- in an apparent attempt to appeal to their supposedly Constitution-loving far-right base -- speaks volumes about what they really mean when they talk about constitutionalism. They use their pocket Constitutions for the parts that come in handy. The rest of it? Not so much.\n\nFollow Michael Keegan on Twitter: www.twitter.com/peoplefor", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you are running for office as a Republican today, you have to mention your reverence for the Constitution at least as much as you mention your love fo...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-08-21 09:06:58 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "If you are running for office as a Republican today, you have to mention your reverence for the Constitution at least as much as you mention your love fo...", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-b-keegan/the-constitution-the-repu_b_8012120.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3323584/images/o-TED-CRUZ-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3323584/images/o-TED-CRUZ-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "peoplefor", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "If you are running for office as a Republican today, you have to mention your reverence for the Constitution at least as much as you mention your love fo..."}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-20 09:06:58 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=8012120", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "immigration,birthright citizenship,2016 election", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "immigration,birthright citizenship,2016 election", "published_time": "2015-08-20 09:06:58 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-08-20 10:59:02 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe78\"", "article_summary": "Carly Fiorina's and Rick Perry's passionate defense of the 14th Amendment is that it would take too much work to change it.\nSimilarly, John Kasich has renounced his previous support for repealing birthright citizenship, but now says he doesn't want to \"dwell on it.\"\nBut Republican politicians have a few glaring blind spots when it comes to the Constitution.\nNeither the Constitution nor the Bible contains the word \"Obamacare\"!\nOne of those is the 14th Amendment, a pillar of our inclusive democracy, a key component of which Republican presidential candidates are now asking us to ignore or change."}
