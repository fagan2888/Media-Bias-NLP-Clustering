Whether the inquiry chalks up the blunder to human error, or something more sinister like deliberate espionage, a security error of this magnitude could cause an uproar within the GOP and beyond.\n\nWith few exceptions, Republicans have adamantly resisted Obama\u2019s effort to thaw relations between the two former Cold War adversaries.\n\nFor example, even though the administration restored diplomatic relations and re-opened the U.S. embassy in Havana last summer, the longstanding 1960 trade embargo between the U.S. and Cuba remains in place.\n\nRelated: Trump Goes \u2018Birther\u2019 on Cruz -- and the White House Loves It\n\nDespite pressure from the business community to take action, only Congress could reverse the embargo, which the GOP is loath to do and, thereby handing the president a foreign policy victory.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a GOP presidential contender, in particular has been a harsh critic of Obama\u2019s policy, arguing that it only benefits the repressive government of Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro, which has a bad track record on human rights and open democracy.\n\nAnd sure enough, the Cuban-American member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was the first chime in, sending a letter to the senior State Department official in charge of Cuba relations demanding answers.\n\n\u201cPreventing the proliferation of sensitive U.S. technology is one of the most important duties carried out by the State Department. While your bureau is not the primary entity within the State Department handling these issues, you oversee U.S. policy toward Cuba and interactions with Cuban officials,\u201d Rubio said in a missive to Roberta Jackson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs. \u201cThus, the fact that members of Congress are reading about Cuba's possession of a U.S. missile in the newspaper rather than from you or other State Department officials is astounding and inexcusable.\u201d\n\nRelated: Insider or Outsider? Rubio Tries to Have It Both Ways\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, jabbed back at Rubio. \"My guess is he gets most of his news about what's happening in Congress from the newspaper,\u201d press secretary Josh Earnest said during a press briefing, a nod to Rubio\u2019 poor attendance rate in the Senate.\n\nObama has indicated he would like to visit Cuba before leaving office in 2017 and urged his critics to have patience with his policy, saying that change will come about on the island gradually.\n\nBut patience hasn\u2019t exactly been the watchword in the hotly contested Republican primary.\n\nBesides Rubio, it\u2019s possible that Cuban-American Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who leads the primary polls in Iowa, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, will weigh in on the incident, especially as the entire primary is now focused on who is strongest on national security.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "An unarmed U.S. Hellfire missile winding up in Cuba could give congressional Republicans and presidential candidates a new weapon to bludgeon President Obama\u2019s legacy-building push to normalize relations between the two countries.", "title": "A New \u2018Cuban Missile Crisis\u2019 Could Shuffle the GOP\u2019s Presidential Cards", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/08/New-Cuban-Missile-Crisis-Could-Shuffle-GOP-s-Presidential-Cards", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Hellfire-Missile.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/08/New-Cuban-Missile-Crisis-Could-Shuffle-GOP-s-Presidential-Cards", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Hellfire-Missile.JPG", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "An unarmed U.S. Hellfire missile winding up in Cuba could give congressional Republicans and presidential candidates a new weapon to bludgeon President Obama\u2019s legacy-building push to normalize relations between the two countries.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPreventing the proliferation of sensitive U.S. technology is one of the most important duties carried out by the State Department.\n\u201cThus, the fact that members of Congress are reading about Cuba's possession of a U.S. missile in the newspaper rather than from you or other State Department officials is astounding and inexcusable.\u201dRelated: Insider or Outsider?\nAn unarmed U.S. Hellfire missile winding up in Cuba could give congressional Republicans and GOP presidential candidates a new weapon to bludgeon President Obama\u2019s legacy-building push to normalize relations between the two countries.\nAnd sure enough, the Cuban-American member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was the first chime in, sending a letter to the senior State Department official in charge of Cuba relations demanding answers.\nWith few exceptions, Republicans have adamantly resisted Obama\u2019s effort to thaw relations between the two former Cold War adversaries."}
