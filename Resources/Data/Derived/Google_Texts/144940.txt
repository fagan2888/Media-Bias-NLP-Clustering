Every year, various publications wish their readership a happy and healthy Thanksgiving. Some go further. They provide their readership with advice about how to navigate political conversations around the Thanksgiving table.

Many of those columns focus on maintaining a serene path into the holiday season, while others focus on the best pithy ways to evangelize. Or, failing that, to “shame/destroy/eviscerate” those at the table with whom they disagree.

If they don’t, you can always change the topic to something everybody agrees upon:

From everybody at the R Street Institute, we wish you and your friends and family a happy Thanksgiving.
