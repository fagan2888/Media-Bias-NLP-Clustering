New research presented at the European Society of Cardiology\u2019s annual congress in Amsterdam indicates that your favorite tunes may boost heart health and accelerate recovery times following cardiovascular disease. The study showed that as little as 30 minutes of listening corresponded with a 19 percent increase in cardiac function and exercise capacity.\n\nAlthough the mechanism of action remains obscure, the study authors believe the recorded health benefits originate in hormonal changes. Music enjoys a well-documented influence on our emotional life, and exposure often induces the release of key chemicals within our brain. These hormones may subsequently promote cardiovascular health.\n\n\"When we listen to music we like then endorphins are released from the brain and this improves our vascular health,\u201d said lead investigator Delijanin Ilic, speaking to The Telegraph.\n\nFor the study, Ilic and her colleagues enrolled cardiac disease patients in an experiment, in which subjects exercised, listened to music, or did both for a period of three weeks. At the end of the trial, the researchers found that the combination group had increased their exercise capacity and cardiac health by 39 percent \u2013\u2013 10 percentage points more than the group that only exercised. What\u2019s more, the group that only listened to music showed comparable improvement of 19 percent.\n\n\u201cThe combination of music and exercise training led to the most improvement in [heart] function. Improvements in [heart] function were associated with significant improvements in exercise capacity,\u201d Ilic told the Daily Mail. \u201cListening to favorite music alone and in addition to regular exercise training improves [heart] function and therefore may be an adjunct method in the rehabilitation of patients with CAD [coronary artery disease].\u201d\n\nThe researchers added that while the benefits appear to be independent of genre, harmonious arrangements like opera or classical music are likely to yield better results than heavy metal. Similarly, instrumental tracks may isolate the positive effect by precluding verbal influence. That said, your own brain is the ultimate judge, as the hormonal release is largely subjective.\n\n\u201cThere is no 'ideal' music for everybody,\u201d Ilic explained. \u201cPatients should choose music which increases positive emotions and makes them happy or relaxed.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "music health benefits, music heart, music cardiovascular, music exercise", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Listening to your favorite music for 30 minutes day may yield results comparable to aerobic exercise, a new study concludes.", "title": "How Music Strengthens The Heart", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-music-strengthens-heart-30-minutes-day-improves-cardiovascular-function-exercise-capacity-19", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/02/heart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Listening to your favorite music for 30 minutes day may yield results comparable to aerobic exercise, a new study concludes.", "title": "How Music Strengthens The Heart", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-music-strengthens-heart-30-minutes-day-improves-cardiovascular-function-exercise-capacity-19", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/02/heart.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/02/heart.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-02T13:20:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-02T13:20:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Listening to your favorite music for 30 minutes day may yield results comparable to aerobic exercise, a new study concludes."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd17d\"", "article_summary": "The study showed that as little as 30 minutes of listening corresponded with a 19 percent increase in cardiac function and exercise capacity.\nImprovements in [heart] function were associated with significant improvements in exercise capacity,\u201d Ilic told the Daily Mail.\nNew research presented at the European Society of Cardiology\u2019s annual congress in Amsterdam indicates that your favorite tunes may boost heart health and accelerate recovery times following cardiovascular disease.\n\u201cThe combination of music and exercise training led to the most improvement in [heart] function.\nAlthough the mechanism of action remains obscure, the study authors believe the recorded health benefits originate in hormonal changes."}
