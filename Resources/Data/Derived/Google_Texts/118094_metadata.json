See below the story for more details. \u2014 Ed\n\nBelva Day knew she was in trouble the instant she heard the loud pop and felt the blinding jolt of pain in her lower leg. Her first thought was for her little sister, and how to land without hurting her, too. With that accomplished, she next had to devise a one-legged route off of the trampoline and to the emergency room. Less immediate concerns, like who would pay for the health care to which she is entitled, had to wait.\n\nThere is a common misconception that Native Americans receive free, comprehensive health care. They do not. Despite treaty assurances to the contrary, the services Day receives as an enrolled member of the Eastern Shoshone tribe are no more complete than her damaged left knee.\n\nX-rays and manual stability tests of that knee point to a torn ACL. Her Indian Health Service physician can\u2019t be sure, though, without money for an MRI or orthopedist\u2019s consultation. Further tests would be moot, though. Funding for reparative surgery is out of the question. For treatment beyond painkillers and a walking brace, the otherwise fit and healthy 20-year-old Day is on her own. Just as she is with the $2,400 bill that came with her ER visit. So, for now, she limps.\n\nDay\u2019s experience is typical of the estimated 1.9 million American Indians and Native Alaskans who rely on the Indian Health Service for their health care. IHS is, by any measure, chronically underfunded, a circumstance that contributes to long waits, difficulty in getting appointments, and denied or delayed care. One popular yardstick places IHS budgets at 45 percent of need. As a result, the agency is forced to ration services severely.\n\nNothing free about Indian health care\n\nAlice Moore, CEO of the IHS Wind River Service Unit, is the person responsible for translating limited resources into maximum health care on the Wind River Indian Reservation. An enrolled Northern Arapaho who left the reservation for a Torrington orphanage at age six, Moore emerged from the foster care system determined to improve the lives of native people.\n\nEquipped with a wealth of first-hand experience, and a master\u2019s degree from the University of California Berkeley, she served Indian communities in California and Arizona as a clinical social worker, before returning with her husband \u2014 a third generation traditional Lakota healer \u2014 to her Wyoming roots. She\u2019s writing her PhD thesis on the effects of trauma. It\u2019s hard to imagine a personal or professional background better suited to the challenges faced by her community. But that doesn\u2019t make the job easy.\n\nShe and her colleagues wrestle with an ongoing lack of investment grown in part from garden-variety federal budget politics. Like most federal agencies IHS\u2019s mandate is rarely matched by the funding it receives. \u201cThere is a difference between authorizing legislation and appropriating legislation,\u201d as Moore\u2019s predecessor Richard Brannan points out.\n\nAt heart, though, the gap between needs and funding that IHS must straddle is created by fundamental disagreement over one primary question. Who is responsible for providing health care for Native Americans?\n\nThe Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone tribes assert that, based on commitments made in the Fort Laramie and Fort Bridger treaties, along with a broader \u201ctrust responsibility\u201d born from the unique legal relationship between tribes and the United States, the federal government should get the bill. As Northern Arapaho healthcare consultant Glen Fowler explains the position, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about free, here. There\u2019s nothing free about Indian health care. We\u2019ve already sacrificed plenty in holding up our end of the deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs health care a right of citizenship or a privilege of wealth?\u201d Wyoming Department of Health Director Tom Forslund asked during a health policy discussion at the Wind River Health Equity Summit in June.\n\nBut that question in the well-worn debate over the role of government is, in the case of Native American health care, beside the point. Tribal claims to service aren\u2019t born of political philosophy. Rather, they\u2019re rooted in historical agreements, made between sovereign nations, under threat of continued violence. Promises were made. At issue is the nature of those promises and whether or not they will be honored by the nation that made them.\n\nThe United States, for its part, acknowledges that there is a binding federal obligation to provide health care for native populations, thus the existence of IHS. But the extent of that obligation isn\u2019t clearly defined by policy or regulation, and the cumulative case law is equally grey.\n\nThe result, in practice, is an agency with a split personality. IHS is set up as the primary provider of health care for Wyoming\u2019s Native Americans, and it is partially funded to perform as such. But in carrying out its duties, IHS behaves, much like a private clinic does, as the payer of last resort.\n\nThe agency provides a host of in-clinic services at its Fort Washakie and Arapahoe clinics, including primary care, pharmacy, pediatrics, obstetrics, gynecology, behavioral health services, physical therapy, podiatry, basic dentistry and ophthalmology. Then, whenever possible, it bills Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration or private insurance for any services provided.\n\nIf, as in Day\u2019s case, a diagnosis warrants treatment or testing that can\u2019t be provided at an IHS clinic \u2014 surgery, advanced radiology or consultation with a specialist for example \u2014 then the patient is referred elsewhere. The necessary expertise can often be found in Lander or Riverton. Referrals to Casper, Denver, Billings and Salt Lake City are also common. Referrals and actual treatment, though, are not the same thing. IHS only has the resources to pay for referred care in the most dire cases, those where loss of life, limb or eyesight is expected within the next 72 hours. By the end of some fiscal years, IHS offices are forced to choose between these \u201cPriority 1\u201d cases.\n\n\u201cMedicaid is the lifeblood of IHS,\u201d said Richard Brannan, former CEO of the Wind River Service Unit. \u201cThey depend on people being so poor that they qualify for assistance.\u201d\n\nIn 2014 the federal government contributed nearly $14.9 million to the Wind River Service Unit\u2019s baseline budget. In the same year, third party billing brought in $11.4 million, most of it from Medicaid. Without those external revenues, IHS\u2019s difficult financial realities would quickly become unworkable. Even with them, a lot of health care needs remain unmet.\n\nDay was enrolled in Medicaid as a minor, but as a single, childless, young adult with a full-time job, she no longer qualifies, putting her within the \u201cMedicaid gap.\u201d As a Native American, she is exempted from the insurance mandate of the Affordable Care Act, so she\u2019s not required to purchase insurance \u2014 in theory, she can rely on IHS services. Without third party coverage, though, those services, she\u2019s learned, are limited.\n\n\u201cYou may wait and wait to get an appointment to be seen, then finally get in and learn that you have a severe illness, a dangerous disease, but that there aren\u2019t any funds available for treatment,\u201d said Gary Collins, former Wyoming Tribal Liaison for the Northern Arapaho, expressing a common frustration. \u201cFolks have grown used to getting help in October [the start of the federal fiscal year, when IHS has the most funding available] and sucking it up the rest of the year.\u201d\n\nUnderstaffed and overburdened\n\nIn addition to being resource-strapped, IHS bears the burden of being part of the federal bureaucracy. The glacial pace and cumbersome administrative overhead of government systems are particularly ill-suited to the dynamic and rapidly evolving healthcare field. The only other federal agency providing direct care to American civilians, the Veteran\u2019s Administration, famously struggles with the same challenges. Yet a 4-hour drive to the VA hospital in Sheridan remains a popular alternative to IHS among Native American veterans on the Wind River Indian Reservation.\n\n\u201cI probably spent 60 percent of my time [as the Wind River Service Unit CEO] navigating and responding to the bureaucracy,\u201d explained Brannan. \u201cImagine if that time and attention could go instead into planning for and providing patient care.\u201d\n\nCompounding the challenges further, IHS is regularly understaffed, even by the standards of its meager budget. The same hiring difficulties that face rural American providers everywhere make it difficult to find and attract qualified medical professionals to work on the Wind River Indian Reservation as well. The IHS website currently lists 21 job openings for its Fort Washakie and Arapahoe locations. Some positions, like a pediatric dentistry specialist, have gone unfilled for more than a year.\n\nCritics of the agency are quick to point out that their frustrations are directed at the institution, not the individuals who comprise it. In much the same way that the majority of Americans disapprove of the job done by Congress, but support their individual congressman, patients listing complaints about the care they receive often use the next breath to express appreciation for the doctors and nurses who provided it.\n\n\u201cI love my doctor,\u201d said Day. \u201cShe really cares, and she knows how to get things done. But she can only do so much with what she has to work with.\u201d\n\nThe Wind River Service Unit is often singled out for exemplary achievement. Defenders from inside and outside of the unit describe it as the least-funded service unit in the region, per capita, but also the highest-performing by federal metrics. The WRSU was the first in the IHS system to fully integrate electronic medical records, and continues to make systemic improvements and incremental gains in efficiency.\n\n\u201cI left IHS because I saw it for the slowly sinking ship that it is,\u201d said Brannan. \u201cBut I\u2019m still proud to tell people I worked for the Wind River Service Unit. I know how hard the professional and highly-trained people there work. They know what they\u2019re doing, and they do the very best they can for their patients.\u201d\n\nFor Day, the best they can do is suggest that she not hold her breath waiting for IHS to meet the federal government\u2019s treaty obligations. She\u2019s young and healthy. Delaying curative treatment any longer is medically inadvisable. Perhaps, her well-meaning advisors tell her, she should bite the bullet, enroll in a private insurance plan and take her now preexisting condition elsewhere.\n\nDay is resigned to doing just that. As Obamacare\u2019s healthcare marketplace enrollment window opens in November, she\u2019ll consider her options, their related costs and the family budget to figure out what she can afford to sacrifice. Then she\u2019ll make some difficult decisions, not unlike those made and paid for by her ancestors nearly 150 years ago.\n\nRead the entire Generation of Hope series:\n\nGeneration of Hope: Future of Native health depends on kids, Oct. 20, 2015\n\nPure Poverty: \u2018If you don\u2019t have money, you don\u2019t have health care,\u2019 Oct. 27, 2015\n\nBroken Promises: Despite treaty assurances, health care remains underfunded, Nov. 3, 2015\n\nWith low expectations, many Natives go without health care, Nov. 10, 2015\n\nLeaders confident Native community can reorder status quo, Nov. 17, 2015\n\n\n\n\u2014 Generation of Hope is a special project of WyoFile, focusing on childhood health on the Wind River Indian Reservation.
