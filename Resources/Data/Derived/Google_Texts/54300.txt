UNDATED (WHTC)-The Affordable Care Act and fewer tax agents may make tax season interesting. Federal budget cuts created fewer tax agents for audits and tax help. Under the Affordable Care Act this is the first year taxpayers will have to provide information about their health care coverage.

Most taxpayers who receive their coverage through work or government programs simply need to check a box on their tax form. Those who receive government subsidies as well as state and federal employees are required to provide additional paperwork. The IRS encourages everyone to file electronically, with most getting their tax refund within 3 weeks.
