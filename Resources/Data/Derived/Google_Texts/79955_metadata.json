Instead, his appeal has only grown.\n\nTwo polls out this week showed Carson leading the pack in Iowa, surging ahead of Trump by nine points in the most recent survey, from the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg News.\n\nHe raised the most of any candidate in the GOP field in the third quarter, and the most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found him to be the most popular candidate in the 2016 field.\n\n\"There's something about him that when things like that are said, I guess I take it with a grain of salt.\"\n\nAnd though his tendency toward rhetorical bomb-throwing rivals Trump's, he thus far hasn't had to contend with the same level of hand-wringing and calls to exit the race from party elders. Charlie Black, who served as John McCain's campaign chairman in 2008, said that's because his personal style overshadows his words.\n\n\"Dr. Carson's personality and likeability causes people to cut him some slack,\" he said, when asked why Carson's gotten away with saying things that might have felled a more traditional politician.\n\n\"He comes from outside the political world, where what you say and your observations are more like someone in the public sphere,\" Black said.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Carson Reacts to Poll Showing Lead Over Trump in Iowa 0:35 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nCarson's affable disposition acts as both a defense against attacks from other candidates, who seem wary of taking on the nicest guy in the field, and a defense against himself, when he blunders into another jaw-dropping gaffe.\n\nAnd, at times, it can seem like Carson's supporters have seen an entirely different candidate from the one presented in the media.\n\n\"I think Dr. Carson has a lot of really refreshing new ideas, and the way he proposes things is with a great deal of finesse and a great deal of professionalism, without putting down other candidates,\" Amanda Sobel, a grad student at the University of New Hampshire said after his town hall there last week.\n\nShe said the way he addressed issues was \"very refreshing, very inspiring \u2014 even his stances on race in this country, that we need to be getting people to work together and love their neighbors.\"\n\nRelated: Ben Carson Does Not Believe a Muslim Should Be President\n\nNo matter that Carson had joked during that town hall about running from cops \"back in the day, before they would shoot you.\" Or that the day before he said progressives are \"racist\" because \"they don't believe that if you are black you have the ability you be an independent thinker.\"\n\nAsked about the cop comment, Sobel dismissed the controversy as America being \"too overly sensitive about everything that comes out of people's mouths.\"\n\nIndeed, many of his supporters say they appreciate his willingness to stand up to what he calls the \"PC police,\" which Carson's warned could send America down the path to tyranny.\n\nRebecca Sykes, a 36-year-old mother of five, brought her family to Berean Baptist Church in North Carolina to see the man she and her children learn about during their homeschooling sessions. They've read his books, she said, and \"Dr. Ben Carson is a hero for us.\"\n\n\"I appreciate that he loves the Lord,\" she added, and \"that he stands against the political incorrectness of our world. I want my young men to see a man who stands for what he believes in.\"\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Ben Carson: The Full Meet the Press Interview 9:27 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nCarson's earned their trust because of the way he acts on the stump, but also because of the way he's lived. He tells it on every stump: The inspiring up-from-nothing tale of a troubled inner-city boy who, through a focus on education and God, became a world-reknowned, decorated pediatric neurosurgeon.\n\nHe founded a successful educational charity, and quite literally saved tens of thousands of infants' lives. There's evidence, too, that his personal story could expand the GOP tent.\n\nSharon Craver, the executive assistant to the CEO of Victory Junction, a camp for kids with special health needs in North Carolina that Carson toured, said she's a registered Democrat and has never voted for a Republican before.\n\nBut Carson, she said, was a Republican \"I could potentially see myself voting for,\" because he \"sounds very smart and has helped children.\" \"Anybody that takes care of kids and has a heart for kids is somebody to have a serious thought for president,\" she said.\n\nAnd a man who's seen so much success at something so complex must be, as Carson's supporters said at nearly every event, smart.\n\nHe occasionally peppers his speeches with complicated medical terms, but they never confuse; Carson is adept at explaining complex subjects in simple terms.\n\nSomeone that smart, they seem to say, must know what he's talking about when he warns of an \"electromagnetic pulse from the sun\" knocking out our electrical grid; or when he says being gay is a choice because people go into prison straight and come out gay.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson waves to supporters after addressing the National Press Club Newsmakers Luncheon October 9, 2015 in Washington, D.C.

He believes that God made it so that evolution is part of God's plan for a beautiful world.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's great that a man of science can also believe in God, that he can reconcile two opposing viewpoints and bring them together into something that's understandable and believable for everyone.\"\n\nCarson's advisers know his personality is one of the candidate's main assets. Communications Director Doug Watts said that in early focus groups, they found that voters knew a remarkable amount about Carson's life and story, and everything they felt about him was positive.\n\n\"It's great that a man of science can also believe in God.\"\n\nWatts said that a few intangibles \u2014 that he's \"authentic, unguarded, soft-spoken, disarmingly honest\" \u2014 come across when Carson's on the stump or in a television studio and help him overcome some of his perhaps poorly-chosen words.\n\n\"People tend to find the positive and the informative and the substantive message of what he's saying, and overlook some of the mistakes or some of the more garbled expressions because they're feeling an affinity for him,\" Watts said.\n\nBut his advisers also know that Carson may not enjoy that advantage forever.\n\nWatts acknowledged \"of course we are\" concerned about how Carson's comments could impact his viability. \"They do have an accrual effect on the personality of a candidate.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson has said some controversial things but his supporters see more to his candidacy than words.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson has said some controversial things but his supporters see more to his candidacy than words.", "title": "Ben Carson's Supporters See Through His Gaffes", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/ben-carsons-supporters-see-through-his-gaffes-n450626", "image": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_42/1264401/151015-carson_surveymokey-1900_70af3b83bf2976370fe5bca97d736ca2.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson has said some controversial things but his supporters see more to his candidacy than words.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_42/1264401/151015-carson_surveymokey-1900_70af3b83bf2976370fe5bca97d736ca2.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Ben Carson's Supporters See Through His Gaffes - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-24", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/ben-carsons-supporters-see-through-his-gaffes-n450626", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Politics,2016 Election,2016 Election"}, "article_summary": "And, at times, it can seem like Carson's supporters have seen an entirely different candidate from the one presented in the media.\nAnd a man who's seen so much success at something so complex must be, as Carson's supporters said at nearly every event, smart.\nThey've read his books, she said, and \"Dr. Ben Carson is a hero for us.\"\nPlay FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusEmbed Ben Carson pushes past Donald Trump in Iowa poll 2:50 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blogAs a Republican presidential candidate, Ben Carson has said that:The likelihood of the Holocaust \"would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed\" in Nazi Germany.\nDuring his three-state tour across America earlier this month, everywhere he went, Carson was met with cheering crowds full of ardent supporters who were quick to dismiss the controversies and criticism because, simply, they like Dr. Ben Carson."}
