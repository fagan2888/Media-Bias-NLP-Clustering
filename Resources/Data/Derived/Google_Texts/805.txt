Gov. Scott Walker was in New Hampshire Wednesday afternoon, hosting a town hall.

He talked about three themes that he will highlight in his campaign: reform, growth and safety.

Walker also says he won't let anyone try to intimidate him when it comes to standing for what, he says, is right.

"I'm not intimidated by anything, I'm not intimidated by protesters, I'm not intimidated by big government union bosses, I'm not intimidated by Democrats, and a lot of people know this, but I'm not intimidated by my own party's establishment because before I took all the rest of them on, I took on the establishment of my own party, I'll take on them in Washington, and anybody else who stands in the way of defending the American people," said Walker.

Gov. Walker also continued to call for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
