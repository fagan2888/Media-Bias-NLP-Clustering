One of the largest and most popular winter food festivals is in Sandestin this weekend.

Event organizers said the 25th annual Sandestin Gumbo Festival was sold out this year. The festival kicked off Friday at the village of Baytowne Wharf and wrapped up a few hours ago at 4.

Eighteen restaurant vendors participated in today's gumbo-cook-off - judged by a panel of well-known public figures, including Newschannel 7's Scott Rossman.

Guests enjoyed live Zydeco music from Dikki Du and the Zydeco Krewe. Festival guests were also invited to join a raffle and vote for several gumbo awards.

All proceeds are going to the Sandestin Foundation for kids. It benefits a variety of youth charities in the area.
