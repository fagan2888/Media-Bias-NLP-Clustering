Attorney General/ \u201cRepublican\u201d Party chairman currently running for lieutenant governor of the Palmetto State.\n\nSeriously \u2026 he\u2019s Foghorn Leghorn (only without the feathers). Oh, there are also gardening implements in your tool shed or garage with higher intelligence quotients.\n\n\u201cI-say-I-say-I-say \u2026\u201d\n\nRather than try to be something he\u2019s not, though, McMaster is embracing his kinship with the common man in his most recent television commercials \u2013 with a little help from his Bulldog, \u201cBoots.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our family watchdog,\u201d McMaster says of the dog, \u201cand I\u2019m proud of my record as South Carolina\u2019s watchdog.\u201d\n\nCheesy? Absolutely. Unbearably so, even.\n\nEffective? Take a look for yourself \u2026\n\n(Click to play)\n\nNice growl from the dog, huh?\n\nMcMaster\u2019s \u201cBulldog\u201d ad is ridiculous and brilliant \u2013 delivering gimmicky, largely substance-free fun for the whole (voting age) family. And while professional political cynics like us dip into our inkwells to mock the spot (or figure out a way to get a canine on the ballot), most South Carolina \u201cRepublican\u201d voters are lapping up the pablum \u2026 and most importantly, remembering McMaster\u2019s message.\n\nThe spot is a helluva lot better than the poorly conceived, poorly delivered pitch offered by Nikki Haley\u2019s lieutenant gubernatorial candidate, Pat McKinney \u2013 the wealthy Lowcountry developer who has emerged as McMaster\u2019s main rival for this largely ceremonial office.\n\nThat ad was forgettably bad \u2026\n\nWe don\u2019t really give a Bulldog\u2019s backside who wins the GOP lieutenant gubernatorial nomination (frankly we\u2019ve been most impressed by the Democratic nominee, S.C. Rep. Bakari Sellers), but McMaster\u2019s ad certainly makes an impression.\n\nAnd before you criticize the impression it makes, remember \u2026 this is South Carolina.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2014/05/19/henry-mcmaster-bulldog/", "type": "article", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mcmaster-bulldog-625x359.png", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "title": "Henry McMaster Has A Bulldog"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "robots": "noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a30\"", "article_summary": "2\u201d RACEThis website has had plenty of fun at the expense of Henry McMaster \u2013 the former S.C.
