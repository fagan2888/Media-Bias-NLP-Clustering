The answer is not much. \u201cJames knows he only has five years,\u201d or so of peak earning potential, Krueger said, and so he will work to make as much as he can during that time.\n\nWhen asked about the study in a Huffington Post online video, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman agreed with the conclusion wholeheartedly:\n\nWhat you really should want to do is to soak the rich as much as possible \u2026 So the top tax rates should be whatever it is that collects the most revenue, and now the question is, how high is that?\n\nHowever, when asked by the interviewer about LeBron James, Krugman dismissed the example -- referring to James\u2019 salary as a piker\u2019s income. Yet, James and Bill Gates were the two personalities that Krueger pointed to in explaining how the high tax rates should work.\n\nThat made me curious. So I decided to delve more deeply.\n\nIn 2013, you were in the top 1% of households if your income exceeded $525,000. You were in the top tenth of 1% if your income exceeded $1,600,000. How much does LeBron James make? Almost $22 million a year. So whenever Krugman insults, ridicules or castigates the top 1% or the top tenth of 1% \u2013 which he does almost every other week \u2013 LeBron James is way up there with lots of other rich people.\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t Krugman want to admit that, by his own criteria, LeBron would be taxed to the hilt? I was perplexed.\n\nThen I realized something that I\u2019m sure every basketball fan already knows. LeBron James is black. What Paul Krugman wants to do to James today uncomfortably resembles what slave owners did to his ancestors more than a century and a half ago.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not accusing Krugman of advocating slavery. But when it comes to confiscating the product of someone else\u2019s labor, the parallel is unmistakable.\n\nMost movies about slavery tend to focus on cruelty and violence \u2013 because that\u2019s what attracts movie goers. But as Robert William Fogel and Stanley Engelmann explained in their landmark study, Time on the Cross, slave owners of yesteryear treated their slaves much as modern farmers treat their livestock and their farm equipment: they were careful to maximize the value of their assets. As summarized at Wikipedia, the two economic historians found that:\n\nmany slaves were encouraged to marry and maintain households, they were given garden plots, the dehumanizing practice of \"slave breeding\" was virtually non-existent, the quality of their daily diets and medical care were comparable to the white population, and many trusted slaves were given great responsibility in managing plantations.\n\nThe slave owners spent a lot to preserve the value of their slaves. But, not surprisingly, there is no evidence that they over-paid. Just as Paul Krugman wants to do to today\u2019s rich, the plantations sought to get the most possible net income from their chattel.\n\nHere is the final irony. According to Fogel and Engelmann, when you add in the value of food, clothing housing, etc., the slaves got to keep about 90 percent of what they produced. In other words, the profit maximizing amount of income confiscation for the slave owners was roughly the same as Art Laffer\u2019s flat tax!\n\nBack to Krugman and James. How much of LeBron\u2019s income does Paul want to seize? As much as he can. But suppose LeBron loves basketball so much he is willing to play for free. Would Paul take all of his income?\n\nIt would seem so.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What tax rate should rich people pay?.05/27/2016 0:51:23AM EST.", "author": "John C.
