UPDATE:

We have an update on the lost, unique looking bull found in Sumner county Tuesday.

A lost, unique looking bull is now back with his owner.

The long-haired, white bull was found wandering in the middle of the road in Sumner county early yesterday morning.

The Sumner county sheriff turned to KAKE news after they couldn't find anyone who recognized the animal.

The sheriff tells us shortly after our story aired Tuesday night, the owner contacted the sheriff's office and they were able to get the bull back home.

The sheriff says the bull is a Scottish Highland named Fergus. The owner lives in Wichita but Fergus stays on property in Sedgwick county, several miles away from where the bull was found.

The Sumner County Sheriff's Office is asking for help tracking down the owner of a bull found wandering on the road in Sumner County.

The long-haired bull was first spotted about midnight at the Kansas Star Casino exit on the Turnpike. Sumner County Sheriff Darren Chambers said he responded to the call and found the bull about a mile away near 140th and Hydraulic, walking in the middle of the road.

Sheriff Chambers said they have the bull in a pasture now but they have not been able to track down its owner. Deputies called farmers and went door to door but have not found anyone who recognizes the bull.

Sheriff Chambers believes the animal is most likely a pet because it is very calm and friendly around people. If you have any information about the bull or its owner, you're asked to call the Sumner County Sheriff's Office at (620) 326-8941.
