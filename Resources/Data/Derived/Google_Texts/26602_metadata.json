The military-inspired uniforms replete with patriotic symbols will be worn again for home games on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\n\u201cThey got into us defensively and made it tough for us,\u201d Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. \u201cTheir aggression in the third quarter changed the game.\u201d\n\nJonas Valanciunas scored 17 for Toronto, which got 16 from DeMar DeRozan and 15 from Kyle Lowry. The Raptors lost for the 11th time in their last 12 trips to Miami.\n\n\u201cWe turned the ball over a little too much and that got them out in transition,\u201d DeRozan said.\n\nBosh has appeared against his former team for the 12th time. The Heat are 12-0 in those games, and Bosh lauded the play again of Miami\u2019s second unit - a clear strength for the Heat so far this season.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re scrapping,\u201d Bosh said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what it\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nRaptors: Toronto finished its four-game road trip 2-2. \u2026 Casey had a chance to get his Toronto record over the .500 mark. Instead, he\u2019s now 159-160 with the club. \u2026 Lowry struggled with his shot again, going 4 for 16 and shooting under 40 percent for the third consecutive game. \u2026 Delon Wright, the younger brother of former Heat F Dorell Wright, got into the game late in the fourth.\n\nHeat: SG Gerald Green (undisclosed illness) remained away from the team, and the Heat said it had no comment about any aspect of his situation. Green was briefly hospitalized last week and has not been with the team since. \u2026 Tuesday could be Kobe Bryant\u2019s 16th and final time playing at Miami, when the Lakers visit. He\u2019s averaged 23.8 points in his 15 games at Miami, the Lakers going 4-11 in those contests.\n\nWADE PASSES PIPPEN\n\nWade\u2019s 3-pointer with 6:32 left in the third quarter gave him 10 points on the night and 18,942 in his career. He passed Scottie Pippen (18,940) for 51st place on the NBA\u2019s scoring list.\n\nWade should be in the top 50 before long; Dale Ellis is next on the list with 19,004 points. Only five other players in NBA history - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, John Havlicek and Larry Bird - have at least as many points, rebounds, assists and championship rings as Wade.\n\nCARROLL SITS\n\nToronto was without SF DeMarre Carroll, who sat to rest a sore right heel. Carroll played in each of Toronto\u2019s first six games, but was shooting only 34 percent - 12 percent worse than his career norm.\n\n\u201cIt has affected his play, his jump shot and his defensive movement,\u201d Casey said. \u201cGetting him rest right now is the most important thing.\u201d\n\nJames Johnson started in Carroll\u2019s place. It was the first change Casey had made to his starters this season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRaptors: Host New York on Tuesday.\n\nHeat: Host the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The jerseys that the Miami Heat are wearing this week have a military theme and say \"Home Strong\" on the chest, a nod to the name of the program the team founded to honor soldiers at every game.", "Author": "TIM REYNOLDS", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The jerseys that the Miami Heat are wearing this week have a military theme and say \u201cHome Strong\u201d on the chest, a nod to the name of the program the team founded to honor soldiers at every game.", "title": "Heat run away in 2nd half, top Raptors 96-76", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/8/heat-run-away-in-2nd-half-top-raptors-96-76/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/08/b23142555f473032870f6a706700ee09.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/08/b23142555f473032870f6a706700ee09.jpg", "title": "Heat run away in 2nd half, top Raptors 96-76", "description": "The jerseys that the Miami Heat are wearing this week have a military theme and say \"Home Strong\" on the chest, a nod to the name of the program the team founded to honor soldiers at every game.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "Starting a seven-game homestand in style, the Heat got 23 points from Chris Bosh, 20 points and 11 rebounds from Hassan Whiteside and pulled away after halftime to beat the Toronto Raptors 96-76 on Sunday night.\n\u201cThat was really inspiring basketball in the second half,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.\nHeat: SG Gerald Green (undisclosed illness) remained away from the team, and the Heat said it had no comment about any aspect of his situation.\n\u201cThey got into us defensively and made it tough for us,\u201d Raptors coach Dwane Casey said.\nThe Heat are 12-0 in those games, and Bosh lauded the play again of Miami\u2019s second unit - a clear strength for the Heat so far this season."}
