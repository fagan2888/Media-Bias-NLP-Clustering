The survey\n\nalso showed that many employers do not understand that insurance products are available to help protect against new and evolving PPACA-related risks, including fiduciary liability coverage, directors and officers (D&O) liability coverage and employment practices liability coverage.\n\n\u201cOur survey results indicate that many companies are unaware of the management liability exposures created by the PPACA,\u201d said Jeffrey Klenk, Senior Vice President, Management Liability, Travelers Bond & Financial Products. \u201cThese are new risks that companies of all sizes now need to manage. Delivering new coverages demonstrates our commitment to helping businesses prepare for the new health insurance mandates.\u201d\n\nTravelers\u2019 new Fiduciary Liability Coverage endorsements provides additional protection against specific risks that may arise from non-compliance with the PPACA. Specifically, the Healthcare Exchange endorsement provides coverage to policyholders for the advice they offer their employees about insurance plans sold on a healthcare exchange. The PPACA Civil Money Penalties endorsement offers protection to businesses against certain PPACA penalties that may be imposed on employers who do not meet specific compliance and reporting obligations.\n\nTo accompany these and other management and professional liability coverages, Travelers is offering a set of tools and resources to help businesses better navigate the healthcare landscape. This includes access to a risk management portal for Travelers agents and customers. The portal offers details about the new PPACA requirements and the management liability exposures employers face. Resources available include model notices and educational materials addressing the PPACA\u2019s requirements and related management liability exposures.
