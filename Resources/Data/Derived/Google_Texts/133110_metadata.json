DeBruin had been battling cancer.\n\n\u201cLynn truly was an exceptional journalist, a tough competitor in the Broncos\u2019 locker room and the press box and on the golf course; and a real friend and a gentle woman,\u201d Denver Post columnist Woody Paige said. \u201cShe missed the newspaper war in Denver, and the newspaper business in Denver sincerely misses her.\u201d\n\nHer professional career included coverage of the World Series, six Super Bowls and golf\u2019s majors. She spent 10 years as an NFL beat writer, first in Arizona then with the Broncos for John Elway\u2019s final Super Bowl. She had been in Utah since 2010 working for The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThe Broncos were ground zero during the newspaper war, and the competition was intense,\u201d said Patrick Saunders, who covered the Broncos for The Denver Post from 1998-2004 and currently covers the Rockies. \u201cBut Lynn and I became good friends.\n\n\u201cMy wife, Nancy, and I had Lynn over for dinner earlier this summer. It was obvious she was very sick, but she was so brave and talked about her life and her golf game. She was a wonderful lady and I will miss her.\u201d\n\nLuther-Veno said DeBruin\u2019s other passions included travel and photography. She was also an avid golfer.\n\nJohn Temple, former editor, publisher and president of the Rocky Mountain News, said: \u201cLynn was a person of courage and determination who never let her health challenges stand in her way. She was a terrific reporter and a human being with deep compassion. This is a very sad day.\u201d\n\nBarry Forbis, former Rocky Mountain News sports editor, hired DeBruin to cover the Broncos.\n\n\u201cLynn was a fighter. It\u2019s what I admired most about her,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was heartbreaking to learn this morning that she had lost her fight with cancer. Lynn was a special person, and we\u2019ll miss her greatly.\u201d\n\nMemorial services will be held in Denver at 2 p.m. Wednesday at Horan & McConaty Funeral Home, 1091 S. Colorado Blvd.; and in Pennsylvania on a date to be determined.\n\nAlong with Luther-Veno, DeBruin is survived by her mother, Mary Luther, and a brother, Stephen Luther.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lynn DeBruin, covered Broncos for Rocky Mountain News, dies at 51", "title": "Lynn DeBruin, covered Broncos for Rocky Mountain News, dies at 51", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/07/lynn-debruin-covered-broncos-for-rocky-mountain-news-dies-at-51/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130907_050254_lynn-debruin-1.jpg", "height": 419}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130907_050254_lynn-debruin-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-07T11:05:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:14:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Lynn DeBruin, who previously worked for the Rocky Mountain News covering the Broncos, died early Saturday at age 51.\nThis is a very sad day.\u201dBarry Forbis, former Rocky Mountain News sports editor, hired DeBruin to cover the Broncos.\n\u201cThe Broncos were ground zero during the newspaper war, and the competition was intense,\u201d said Patrick Saunders, who covered the Broncos for The Denver Post from 1998-2004 and currently covers the Rockies.\n\u201cShe missed the newspaper war in Denver, and the newspaper business in Denver sincerely misses her.\u201dHer professional career included coverage of the World Series, six Super Bowls and golf\u2019s majors.\nJohn Temple, former editor, publisher and president of the Rocky Mountain News, said: \u201cLynn was a person of courage and determination who never let her health challenges stand in her way."}
