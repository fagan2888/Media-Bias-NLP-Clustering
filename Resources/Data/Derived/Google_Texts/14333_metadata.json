The move came less than two weeks after they passed a different bill that would designate the unconventional drilling method as an \u201cultrahazardous and abnormally dangerous activity\u201d and hold frackers financially liable for any health or environmental consequences \u2014 a de facto ban, in the minds of some.\n\nYet environmentalists are disappointed, because the Senate was initially considering an 8-year moratorium, and because its latest action is less aggressive than a bill the House of Delegates passed at the end of March, which would hold off prospective frackers for three years and require the creation of a panel of 10 independent health, science and engineering experts to determine whether fracking can be done without jeopardizing the environment or public health.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Maryland hasn\u2019t actually allowed any fracking within its borders, as of yet. Former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, a Democrat, put a hold on all drilling until the state could fully study its potential impacts: his administration concluded that fracking is definitely risky, but that it \u201ccan be managed to an acceptable level.\u201d Before leaving office, O\u2019Malley came out with a set of stringent rules \u2014 governing air, water and noise pollution \u2014 that he called the \u201cgold standard\u201d for letting in the industry while managing the risks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state House and Senate both passed bills calling for a moratorium on natural gas drilling", "title": "\u201cUltrahazardous and abnormally dangerous\u201d: Maryland\u2019s fighting to keep out the frackers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The state House and Senate both passed bills calling for a moratorium on natural gas drilling", "title": "\u201cUltrahazardous and abnormally dangerous\u201d: Maryland\u2019s fighting to keep out the frackers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/07/ultrahazardous_and_abnormally_dangerous_marylands_fighting_to_keep_out_the_frackers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_159181088-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The state House and Senate both passed bills calling for a moratorium on natural gas drilling", "title": "\u201cUltrahazardous and abnormally dangerous\u201d: Maryland\u2019s fighting to keep out the frackers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_159181088-1.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, anti-fracking, fracking, Maryland, Oil and Gas", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca05d\"", "article_summary": "The state Senate voted 45-2 Monday evening to impose a two and a half-year moratorium on any fracking activity.\nThe move came less than two weeks after they passed a different bill that would designate the unconventional drilling method as an \u201cultrahazardous and abnormally dangerous activity\u201d and hold frackers financially liable for any health or environmental consequences \u2014 a de facto ban, in the minds of some.\nIt\u2019s important to note that Maryland hasn\u2019t actually allowed any fracking within its borders, as of yet.\nTopics: anti-fracking, fracking, Maryland, Oil and Gas, Sustainability News, NewsMaryland legislators are in the middle of a fierce debate over just just how hard they want to make it for frackers to operate within the state \u2014 and may just end up keeping them out altogether.\nFormer Gov."}
