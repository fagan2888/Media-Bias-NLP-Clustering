Bush Library in Dallas, Texas.\n\nUnder the umbrella of the Institute for Economic Empowerment of Women (IEEW), Peace Through Business has trained over 500 women from Afghanistan and Rwanda in growing their leadership and entrepreneurial skills since the program was founded in 2007.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAfter a day of awards, workshops, and roundtable discussions, the women graduating the Peace Through Business program were among the 150 audience members on hand for Fiorina\u2019s remarks, including the program\u2019s American mentors, sponsors, volunteers, and other women business owners.\n\nAt approximately 7:45 p.m., Fiorina took to the stage and opened her remarks by thanking Dr. Terry Neese, the CEO and founder of IEEW. After discussing the celebratory reason for gathering, Fiorina delved into the purpose of her speech: \u201cWomen can change the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne woman can change the world,\u201d said Fiorina, \u201cand each of you have changed your worlds.\u201d She compared the impact women can have on the world to dropping a small pebble in still water, where the initial impact might be small and quiet, but the ripples reach \u201cfar and wide.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuman potential is the only limitless resource in this world,\u201d began Fiorina, continuing her statement further by saying it was the only resource needed for change. She clarified that she did not mean that women were better than men, but that half of all the human potential in the world was women. Fiorina said that she believes everyone to have God-given gifts, and that means that everyone has the power to change his or her life.\n\nHalfway through her speech, Fiorina spoke of her own past experiences. Beginning as a secretary for a nine-person real estate firm and climbing up the corporate ladder to become CEO of Hewlett-Packard, Fiorina identified herself as the kind of person who sees possibilities.\n\n\u201cThere are people who see limitations,\u201d said Fiorina, \u201cAnd then there are those who see possibilities.\u201d Fiorina elaborated, saying those who see limitations are only able to envision what can\u2019t happen, and those who see the opportunity for success ask the kinds of questions that start with \u201cWhat if,\u201d \u201cWhy not,\u201d and \u201cWho says it can\u2019t be done?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen people in all kinds of circumstances,\u201d she continued, but \u201cEveryone has the potential to change.\u201d The critical issue, according to Fiorina, was whether they had the opportunities, motivation, and courage to take action. This is why she has such high praise for entrepreneurs, like the graduates of the program. Entrepreneurs \u201csee possibilities,\u201d said Fiorina, \u201cSomething that wasn\u2019t there before.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to have courage to challenge the status quo,\u201d said Fiorina, adding that there will sometimes be enemies who try to prevent or block you from moving forward. It is impossible to get innovation without also accepting risks and tolerating mistakes, she explained, and this is a direct challenge to those who are benefiting from the status quo, whether that is in Rwanda, Afghanistan, or even a bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn closing her speech, Fiorina came full circle and said, \u201cWomen make a better world,\u201d and no matter the problem, \u201cIf you get women involved, the problem gets better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen change the world,\u201d said Fiorina. \u201cWe count on your leadership.\u201d\n\nFollow Cassi Pollock on Twitter @cassi_pollock.
