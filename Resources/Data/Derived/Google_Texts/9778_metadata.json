Hal Rogers, R-Ky., who pointed out that Congress had \"increased funding specifically for taxpayer services\" in 2014 and 2016.\n\nKoskinen said it didn't matter where Congress intended the money to go, explaining the agency had pulled funding for customer service and cybersecurity in order to ensure compliance with the ACA.\n\n\"As I said two years ago, at the continued level of underfunding, the things that were going to suffer were going to be enforcement, taxpayer service, and ultimately \u2026 information technology,\" Koskinen said.\n\nMore than eight million phone calls to the agency's customer service line went unanswered in the last filing season. Koskinen added that the agency hasn't fully funded customer service for the last \"three or four years,\" and that about $900 million had been pulled from cybersecurity.\n\nThe agency has been hit with at least two successful cyberattacks in the past year. A cyberattack last year resulted in the theft of data on 330,000 taxpayers from the agency's \"Get Transcript\" database, while an attack last week resulted in the loss of special personal identification numbers associated with 101,000.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/02/irs_chief_obamacare_to_blame_for_poor_customer_service_and_data_hacks.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: IRS chief: Obamacare to blame for poor customer service and data hacks"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "More than eight million phone calls to the agency's customer service line went unanswered in the last filing season.\nKoskinen said it didn't matter where Congress intended the money to go, explaining the agency had pulled funding for customer service and cybersecurity in order to ensure compliance with the ACA.\nKoskinen added that the agency hasn't fully funded customer service for the last \"three or four years,\" and that about $900 million had been pulled from cybersecurity.\n\"As I said two years ago, at the continued level of underfunding, the things that were going to suffer were going to be enforcement, taxpayer service, and ultimately \u2026 information technology,\" Koskinen said.\nWashington Examiner:\"Congress, as I noted in my testimony, has underfunded \u2026 the Affordable Care Act,\" IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told a panel of the House Appropriations Committee."}
