The Broncos’ free-agency exodus started on defense but has since toppled its offense.

The offensive line, a unit that expected to undergo changes, welcomed the addition of tackle Donald Stephenson and said farewell to guard Louis Vasquez, who was waived.

Evan Mathis, another guard, is on the open market with tackle Ryan Harris.

Harris, who returned to the Broncos last year and switched from right to left tackle because of injuries, will visit with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday.

Harris signed a one-year contract with the Broncos last May after tackle Ryan Clady was placed on injured reserve because of a knee injury.

Harris made 16 regular-season starts last year and played 90.7 percent of the team’s offensive snaps, trailing only center Matt Paradis. Harris also played 15.6 percent of the special-teams snaps.

Block party. Brandon Marshall was honored Saturday at the 38th Ed Block Courage Awards. Marshall and fellow inside linebacker Danny Trevathan were named the Broncos’ co-recipients of the 2015 award for their “commitment to sportsmanship and courage.”

Marshall and Trevathan returned last season from injuries that required surgery. Trevathan, who had his left knee reconstructed in January 2015, led the Denver defense with 110 tackles in the regular season and tied a Super Bowl record with two fumble recoveries. Trevathan signed a four-year contract with the Bears last week.

Marshall, who played with two screws in his foot (one and a half have since been removed), finished second on the Denver defense with 101 tackles.

Unrein back with Bears. Former Broncos defensive tackle Mitch Unrein signed a two-year contract to return to the Bears.

Unrein, an Eaton native, played four seasons with the Broncos (2011-14) after joining their practice squad in 2010.

He signed with the Bears last September after he was waived by the Chargers.
