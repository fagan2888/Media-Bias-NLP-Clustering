Oral arguments are next month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to push,\u201d Clinton told a Reno crowd on Monday, \u201cbecause some of the decisions in the court awaiting final review have to do with the very restrictive regulations put on Planned Parenthood and access to safe and legal abortion in Texas.\"\n\nWELCOME TO WEDNESDAY PULSE \u2014 And the only debate tonight is which Republican town hall to watch: CNN has Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson, while MSNBC snagged Donald Trump.

But CMS notified Indiana officials in the fall that it will conduct its own analysis of the state's expansion model \u2014 which charges premiums to some at the risk of disenrollment, among other novel requirements.\n\nCMS and former Obama administration officials say they need to make sure Indiana isn't hindering access to care, especially as Republicans in other states look to replicate elements of its program.

Paul's story for Pros.\n\nMERCATUS: MEDICAID PROVIDER TAXES ARE EXPENSIVE 'GIMMICK' \u2014 A new study from George Mason's Mercatus Center contends that taxes on health care providers \u2014 which 49 states use to partially fund Medicaid \u2014 are driving up health costs.\n\n\"Provider taxes shift costs from states to the federal government, but they also raise overall spending by lowering the relative price of Medicaid expenditures to states,\" author Brian Blase argues in an accompanying Forbes op-ed. Blase concludes that moving Medicaid toward a defined contribution model would reduce the incentive to deploy provider taxes and ultimately improve cost control.\n\nFIRST IN PULSE: SURVEY OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS FINDS PERSISTENT OBAMACARE FEARS \u2014 According to a new TriNet survey of more than 1,000 small business owners, 55 percent of respondents say the Affordable Care Act has hurt their business rather than helped it.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
