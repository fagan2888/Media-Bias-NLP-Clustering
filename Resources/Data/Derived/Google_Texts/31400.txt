NEW YORK (MainStreet) —Missing the December 15 deadline to enroll for health insurance does not mean you are out of options to have your coverage start next month.

Before you start panicking that you will have a minor gap in your health insurance coverage, check to see if there is a deadline extension available to you. While December 15 was the deadline to enroll if you wanted your new individual or family health insurance plan to start by January 1, there are several exceptions.

Many health insurance companies throughout the U.S. are accepting applications through this month for coverage to start January 1. for non-subsidized coverage outside of government exchanges.

“eHealth has identified 37 states with at least one health insurance company accepting health insurance applications for January 1,” said Carrie McLean, director of customer care at eHealth.com, an online health insurance exchange based in Mountain View, Calif. “In some cases, insurers are accepting applications as late as December 31.”

There are more exceptions to the rule. Some government exchanges in states not served by healthcare.gov have opted to accept applications for coverage to start January 1 coverage beyond the December 15 deadline.

To learn more about your options, work with a licensed health insurance agent in your area or contact your state’s government-run health insurance exchange, she said.

It’s too early to start fretting, because open enrollment isn’t over yet and you still have until February 15. If you wanted coverage under your new health insurance plan to start January 1, December 15 was an important deadline. If you missed it, however, that doesn’t mean you’ll now need to go uninsured for 2015.
