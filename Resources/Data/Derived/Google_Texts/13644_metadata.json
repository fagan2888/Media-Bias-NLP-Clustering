If you haven\u2019t pulled your documents together or made real progress on your tax return yet, filing for an extension by April 15 sounds like a pretty good idea. That\u2019s what about 12 million people do each year, according to the IRS.\n\nGetting more time isn\u2019t as simple as it sounds. Here are seven things you should know if you can\u2019t make the deadline.\n\n1. You still have to act by April 15. Anyone can file for an automatic extension, but the paperwork is still due on April 15. Filling out Form 4868 will give you another six months to finish, though you can file your taxes any time before October 15. You can file for an extension for free through IRS Free File. Check with your state to see if you need to file a separate application for an extension.\n\n2. If you owe money, you have to pay up. Just because you\u2019re getting an extension, you don\u2019t get more time to pay your taxes. You\u2019ll need to fill out enough of your tax return to come up with a rough estimate of what you owe. Use a tax estimator like the one the IRS provides. Fail to pay, and you\u2019ll be hit with a penalty of 0.5% to 1% of what you owe for each month or part of a month your bill is outstanding.\n\n3. Failing to file is worse than failing to pay. If you simply ignore tax day and don\u2019t file or apply for an extension\u2014and you owe taxes\u2014you\u2019ll be hit with a failure-to-file penalty, which is usually 5% of the unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month your return is late, up to 25% of your bill.\n\n4. Your bank may be kinder than Uncle Sam. You may want to pay your taxes with a credit card if you don\u2019t have the cash on hand. The interest and fees you\u2019ll pay with plastic (roughly 2% of your tax bill) may be less than the interest and penalties you\u2019d face on a late tax payment.\n\n5. You may not need an extension. If you\u2019re asking for an extension just because can\u2019t come up with the money (not because you don\u2019t have your paperwork in order), you\u2019re better of filing your return and paying what you can. You can request a short extension of 60 to 120 days to pay. You will still pay penalties and interest, but at a lower rate.\n\nThe IRS also offers installment agreements when you can\u2019t pay your taxes on time. You\u2019ll have to pay a fee to set up the plan\u2014use Form 9465-FS\u2014and you\u2019ll be billed monthly. The IRS must approve the plan, and you can\u2019t stretch out the payments for more than three years.\n\n6. If you are owed a refund, you won\u2019t be penalized for not filing. Of course, you won\u2019t get your refund until you file your return. So why let Uncle Sam hold on to your money any longer than necessary?\n\n7. If you\u2019re a chronic procrastinator, the IRS won\u2019t issue your refund. If you don\u2019t do your taxes three years running, even if you\u2019re owed a refund, the IRS will keep your money.\n\nRelated: Watch for the Obamacare tax scam targeting last-minute filers", "article_metadata": {"description": "The April 15 tax-filing deadline is here.
