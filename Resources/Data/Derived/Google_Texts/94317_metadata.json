So the county is considering buying O'Connor Hospital in San Jose and Saint Louise Regional Hospital in Gilroy.\n\nThe two hospitals are part of the nonprofit Daughters of Charity Health System, which in January announced it is selling all six of its California hospitals, including Seton Hospital in Daly City and Seton Coastside in Moss Beach.\n\nThis raises the question of whether the space for the Women and Children's Center would be needed for the coming boom in Medi-Cal patients if the deal with Daughters of Charity falls through.\n\nBut Smith, the county executive, insisted the new VMC proposal is \"not related to that deal.\"\n\nDuring a news conference Tuesday outside the hospital, the VMC Foundation introduced a handful of individuals and groups that already have committed nearly $6 million to the new center.\n\nThey include: FIRST 5 Santa Clara County, which has promised $4 million; John and Ann Rademakers, founders of An-Jan Feed & Pet Supply, who have pledged $1 million; the business-software company SAP and the Sharks Foundation, which have jointly offered $750,000.\n\nChris Wilder, the foundation's executive director, said the campaign is seeking a single $15 million \"title sponsor,\" which would receive naming rights to the main hospital building. The new center is tentatively set to open in 2016.\n\nPaul Lorenz, CEO of VMC, said the hospital also will contribute $15 million to $17 million in operating revenue on top of the $25 million in private donations.\n\nHospital consultants said Tuesday they weren't surprised by the move.\n\n\"Public hospitals are going after the same patients as private hospitals,'' said Mike Williams, president of the Abaris Group in Martinez. \"They realize that these are insured patients that previously were uninsured and thus will help improve'' their finances.\n\nContact Tracy Seipel at 408-920-5343.
