He was 85.\n\nKnown as \u201cArik\u201d by generations of Israelis, Sharon rose to power as a military leader who led Israeli troops against Arab armies in every war from independence in 1948 until his stroke 58 years later. He was defense minister in 1982, when Israel attacked Lebanon in an attempt to oust the Palestinian Liberation Organization and reduce Syria\u2019s stranglehold over Lebanon.\n\nSharon was forced to resign after Lebanese Christian militias sent into the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps to weed out the PLO murdered hundreds of Palestinian civilians. IDF forces stood by and watched as the massacre took place.\n\nSharon then rebuilt hard-right leader rebuilt a controversial political career in the 1990s by championing the settlement issue. Critics labeled the hard-right leader \u201cthe Bulldozer\u201d for his brutal clearing of Palestinian homes to make way for Jewish settlers.\n\nSharon\u2019s controversial visit to the Temple Mount in east Jerusalem\u2019s Old City on September 28, 2000 sparked the second Palestinian uprising, or Intifada \u2013 and catapulted him into the Prime Minister position a year later.\n\nIn his first term in office, Sharon spent much of his time trying to crush the second Intifada. He forged a close working relationship with U.S. President George W. Bush, who called Sharon a \u201cman of peace\u201d in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, Sharon began building a controversial security fence separating Israel and the West Bank. Supporters credit the fence with ending suicide bombers and other terrorists making their way into Israel. Critics, particularly the Palestinians, condemned it as an \u201cApartheid Wall\u201d that unilaterally seized Palestinian land and violated their rights.\n\nSharon had a sudden change of heart in 2005 when he forced the very same Israel settlers he championed out of Gaza, ending 38 years of Jewish rule there and forming the basis of a Palestinian state.\n\nSharon\u2019s \u201cHitnatkut,\u201d or disengagement plan, was sharply condemned by both the Israeli right and left. The right saw Sharon as betraying the Israeli settlers and the Jewish state itself, while the left believed the policy was a shell game that emotionally sacrificed Gaza while quietly increasing Israeli control of the West Bank.\n\nThis dispute over Gaza prompted Sharon to dramatically leave the conservative Likud party a short time later to form the more centrist Kadima party. He was then hit with a small stroke in December 2005 that prompted doctors to put him on blood thinners. Sharon then had a massive brain hemorrhage on January 4, 2006 that put him into a coma for the last eight years.\n\nAfter his stroke, Sharon was succeeded as prime minister by Ehud Olmert, who was also his successor as leader of the Kadima party. Pundits who predicted Kadima would reshape the Israeli political landscape were proven wrong as Olmert\u2019s lackluster leadership gave way to the return of Benjamin Netanyahu. Kadima won only two parliamentary seats in last January\u2019s election.\n\nHope that Sharon might eventually recover came last year, when doctors reported he showed \u201csignificant\u201d brain activity in response to pictures of his family and audio recordings of his son\u2019s voice. Those hopes diminished over the new year, when Sharon suffered multiple organ failure. Sharon\u2019s family was at his bedside when he died.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Israel Prime Minister Ariel Sharon passed away Saturday, eight years after a massive stroke put him into a coma.
