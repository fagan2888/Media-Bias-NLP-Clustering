Quality Improvement Wars: Them's Fightin' Words

Two sets of researchers find that hospitals spending gobs of money to enroll in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program don't have better patient outcomes than non-participants in the NSQIP program.

War broke out this week in the world of surgical quality.

Two groups of researchers used large data sets to undress NSQIP, the American College of Surgeon's 600-hospital improvement collaborative. They said, in a nutshell, in separate JAMA reports, that participation in the program doesn't improve outcomes over non-NSQIP hospitals over time.

That's because all hospitals—prompted by numerous financial penalties, incentives, and special hospital networks funded by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act—have shown improvements in surgical outcomes all by themselves in recent years.

"NSQIP, (the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program) officials have made statements, based on their own data over a two-year span of time, that hospitals that engaged in NSQIP showed a measureable improvement in outcomes," says lead author of one of the two JAMA papers, David Etzioni, MD, a colon and rectal surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix.

"But if you thump your chest about it, saying that your hospitals are improving because of something you did, you have to at least consider what other hospitals are doing," Etzioni says. "My response is to ask, what exactly will the hospitals be doing differently the day after reading their reports" that reflect poorer outcomes? "NSQIP may be a tool to quality, but it isn't necessarily a straight line to quality."

As they said in the old shoot-em ups, them's fightin' words, especially considering the large number of patients in each study.
