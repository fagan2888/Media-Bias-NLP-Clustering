And the same with people even on these exchanges if they don't get subsidies.\"\n\nThe \u201cCadillac tax\u201d was originally intended to take effect sooner, but unions and other groups convinced officials to delay it until 2018, reducing the anticipated income from $137 billion to $80 billion over ten years. But many analysts predict it will be far less than that.\n\nHenry Aaron of the Brookings Institution said, \"before then, it's expected that most of the businesses that offer that form of insurance will back off and make the insurance less generous, so the tax won't bite.\"\n\nRobert Laszewski of Health Policy and Strategy Associates said he doubted many will end up paying the tax.\n\n\"What we're finding is almost no employers are going to be hit by this \u2018Cadillac tax.\u2019 You'd be stupid to get hit by this \u2018Cadillac tax,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey're all cutting their benefits right now.\"\n\nOne analyst noted the tax had less to do with health care than it did with revenue.\n\n\"The \u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 is not about health care, it's about the money.It's about getting the money,\" said Dan Mendelson of Avalere Health.\n\nBut if employers are able to avoid it and less than expected is collected, ObamaCare could fall tens of billions short in paying for itself as promised.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration has sent letters to 310,000 people signed up for the exchanges threatening to cut off their insurance if they don't submit missing verification of their citizenship by September 5.\n\nAt the same time, Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services Wednesday noting that its own Inspector General had found \"1.2 million applicants have unresolved inconsistencies related to income verification.\"\n\nShe pointedly asked if there was an action plan or a deadline to deal with them, noting $17 billion will be paid in subsidies this year alone.\n\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
