MEDIA, Pa. (CBS) – Authorities in Delaware County, Pa. have filed charges against a South Jersey man who allegedly offered himself up as an attorney but wasn’t licensed to practice.

Leaford Cameron, 60, of Burlington, NJ, is facing two misdemeanor counts stemming from a civil suit following a 2010 car accident.

“The victim in this case knew this particular individual through church, that held himself out as an attorney,” Delaware County DA Jack Whelan said.

The Aldan, Pa. woman retained him for a time but then got suspicious, got a new attorney, and then discovered that Cameron was not licensed to practice law — although he claimed to have gotten his degree from Cambridge University in London.

He was convicted 20 years ago on similar misrepresentation charges in Bucks County, and Whelan fears there may be other people who may have been duped by Cameron. Possible victims are asked to contact the Delaware County DA’s office in Media, Pa.
