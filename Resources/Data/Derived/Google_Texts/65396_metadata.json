Those mistakes, Maketa said, allowed the fire to grow, ultimately killing two residents and destroying 509 homes.\n\nRetired Greenwood Village Police Cmdr. Dave Fisher directed the inquiry. After interviewing fire experts and other authorities, Fisher concluded,\u201dnothing could have been done to stop this fire.\u201d\n\nFisher hinted his full report may also show the origin and cause of the blaze, but he would not elaborate. The summary merely said the fire was a \u201cperfect storm.\u201d\n\nFisher said he did not know how much the investigation cost.\n\nThe fire board blasted Maketa for his comments, and the media for reporting them, in what the board called a \u201cmisadventure.\u201d\n\nThe board\u2019s statement complained about \u201cagencies or elected officials trying to impose their own will\u201d and called for a new culture of working together.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday night, the sheriff\u2019s office said the protection district\u2019s probe was vague and lacked facts to reinforce its findings.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that this report contains many opinions and general information not based on facts that can be substantiated by actual evidence such as radio transmissions and recorded phone calls,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office is conducting the official investigation into the cause and origin of the Black Forest fire. According to the statement, that report will be made public once \u201call scientific analysis of items of evidence is complete.\u201d\n\nMaketa did not attend the news conference.\n\nHarvey said the public spat between the heads of the two agencies would not interfere with how crews did their jobs when they worked together in the future.\n\n\u201cOperationally, I think we have a great relationship,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nThe report summary urged all agencies and personnel to maintain a professional relationship regardless of personal feelings.\n\nResidents who attended the meeting said they were not impressed with the lack of information and specifics about what mistakes, if any, on the part of Harvey were revealed in the probe.\n\n\u201cThis was a whitewash to save (Harvey\u2019s) job,\u201d said Black Forest resident Kevin Clark. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to answer our questions, he wants to save his job.\u201d\n\nArea homeowner Lisa Brant said authorities were just as frustrated as residents with the mishandling of the fire.\n\n\u201cFiremen and police officers were the ones who first started complaining,\u201d said Brant said.\n\nBoth Clark and Brant said hoped the sheriff\u2019s final report on the fire will provide the information residents sought.\n\nRyan Parker: 303-954-2409, rparker@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ryanparkerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcecbc\"", "article_summary": "BLACK FOREST \u2014 An internal probe of the Black Forest Fire/Rescue Protection District and its chief exonerates the department of accusations of mishandling last summer\u2019s devastating fire, investigators said Wednesday.\nThe sheriff\u2019s office is conducting the official investigation into the cause and origin of the Black Forest fire.\n\u201cThis was a whitewash to save (Harvey\u2019s) job,\u201d said Black Forest resident Kevin Clark.\nIn a statement released Wednesday night, the sheriff\u2019s office said the protection district\u2019s probe was vague and lacked facts to reinforce its findings.\nBoth Clark and Brant said hoped the sheriff\u2019s final report on the fire will provide the information residents sought."}
