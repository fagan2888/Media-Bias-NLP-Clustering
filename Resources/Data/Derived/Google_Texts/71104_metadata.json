After coming close to armed confrontation over the aid-laden convoy Russia sent into Ukraine\u2019s eastern region last week, the encounter in the Belarus capital Tuesday suddenly and unexpectedly presents the two sides with the their best chance yet to reach a diplomatic and political agreement settling the nine-month crisis over Ukraine\u2019s future status and direction.\n\nWho would have guessed? When Moscow unilaterally dispatched its 270-truck caravan across Ukraine\u2019s border to Luhansk last Friday, Kiev denounced the move as an invasion, the Pentagon demanded the vehicles\u2019 immediate withdrawal, and NATO reported that Russian artillery had advanced into Ukrainian territory and fired on government troops. Nightmares of East and West once more at war seemed on the brink of coming true.\n\nRelated: 12 Things You Don\u2019t Know About Ukraine\n\nThen Putin pulled one of his periodic surprises. On Saturday the caravan finished unloading relief supplies and swiftly withdrew across the border, along with the Russian military units allegedly on Ukrainian soil. \u201cPutin has not done the big thing that he seemed to be threatening, which was to make his troops, his men, his trucks a shield for the separatists in eastern Ukraine,\u201d Steve Sestanovich, a Council on Foreign Relations fellow in Washington, said on PBS Weekend Newshour.\n\nIn an instant, the Russian leader effectively transformed the outlook for the Minsk meeting, at which several former Soviet republics will convene with the European Union to discuss customs ties, trade, energy security, and the Ukraine crisis. It\u2019s knife\u2019s edge now: Putin and Poroshenko will either craft a deal defusing tensions, or agree on a framework for one - or they will do neither. And \u201cneither\u201d will be dire in that the first serious attempt to settle up politically will have failed.\n\nA lot went into the making of this moment, not all of which is immediately apparent. This column argued six weeks ago that the relationship between Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel provided the best route to peace and stability in Ukraine, and the oddly sympathetic ties between these two leaders now seem about to come good.\n\nThere is a caveat, however. The success of back-channel contacts between Moscow and Berlin over the past several months now hangs on Poroshenko, and Kiev\u2019s less-than-brilliant record for good judgment and reliability since he was elected in May is a primary source of worry in Berlin diplomatic circles, according to my contacts there. \u201cWe never know what they will say, what they will do, what they will say they will do, but what we do know is that they very seldom do what they say they will do,\u201d a well-placed source said in an e-mail note just before the weekend.\n\nRelated: Putin Wants Eastern Ukraine\u2014Let Him Have It\n\nWell, with this in mind let\u2019s look on the bright side.\n\nThe Independent reported in late July that Merkel and Putin \u201chave been working on a secret plan to broker a peaceful solution to end international tensions over Ukraine.\u201d The London daily elaborated in an exclusive that the proposed settlement \u201chinges on two main ambitions: stabilizing the borders of Ukraine and providing the financially troubled country with a strong economic boost, particularly a new energy agreement ensuring security of gas supplies.\u201d\n\nThere are some heavy-going clauses on the table. The international community would have to accept Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea last spring. Gulp. Kiev would also devolve some political and administrative powers to the eastern region. No gulp here: It is imperative that Kiev recognize the legitimacy of the Russian-majority east\u2019s desire for greater autonomy.\n\nThe give-backs: Russia would cease its involvement in eastern Ukraine, whatever it may be, and pay $1 billion to compensate for the rent it paid for stationing its fleets in the Crimea until the region voted for independence.\n\nNext. Poroshenko would agree not to join NATO. The trade-off here would be Russia\u2019s commitment to accept Kiev\u2019s new relations with the E.U. as agreed in a pact signed after Poroshenko took office. Ukraine would also get a new long-term agreement with Russia\u2019s Gazprom covering future gas supplies and pricing - critical if Ukraine is to sustain any kind of economic recovery.\n\nRelated: EU Agrees to Russian Sanctions, US Could Arm Ukraine\n\nThe Independent characterized this deal as \u201cland for gas.\u201d It\u2019s good headline copy but it\u2019s reductionist. While there is almost certainly more to the talks, what we know of them suggests an attentive effort to discover interests that can be balanced enough to produce an enduring pact.\n\nOver the weekend Merkel paid her first visit to Kiev since the coup that toppled Viktor Yanukovich in February. As advertised it was \u201cto show support,\u201d but it is almost certain the chancellor, arriving three days before the Minsk meeting, was either coaching or coaxing or shoving Poroshenko toward accepting at least the key points in the terms the Berlin-Moscow talks have now reached.\n\nWhile Merkel was in Kiev, her vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, said this back in Berlin: \u201cThe territorial integrity of Ukraine can be maintained only if an offer is made to the areas with a Russian majority. A clever concept of federalization seems to be the only practicable way.\u201d\n\nKiev went nearly into conniptions at the mention of a federalist solution: It is Moscow\u2019s preference, and Kiev suspects it would weaken Ukraine in its international dealings.\n\nFor my money Gabriel\u2019s made his gaffe accidentally on purpose. Merkel, standing by Poroshenko\u2019s side, instantly took the occasion to profess a four-square stance against independence for the east\u2014one of Kiev\u2019s consuming paranoias. \u201cWhat we call federalism is decentralization,\u201d she said, and that is the term and the point she appeared determined to drive home.\n\nWere I one of Merkel\u2019s diplomats I would be reluctant indeed to rest my months of work on Poroshenko\u2019s shoulders. But if there is to be a settlement of the Ukraine crisis off the battlefield, as all sides claim to want, the chance rests with Poroshenko\u2019s decisions Tuesday and may not come again for some time if it is lost.\n\nFootnote: In a busy week of e-mail messages, this from an entrepreneur I have known for decades and with interests in Ukraine: \u201cWe have a small team on the ground in Ukraine - four very experienced business people - and they tell us that the current regime in Kiev is at least as corrupt as all of the others in Kiev since the country was created two decades ago.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "All eyes will focus this week on Minsk where Russian President", "title": "What a Deal Between Ukraine and Russia Could Look Like", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/08/25/What-Deal-Between-Ukraine-and-Russia-Could-Look", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03022014_Ukraine_Russians.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/08/25/What-Deal-Between-Ukraine-and-Russia-Could-Look", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03022014_Ukraine_Russians.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@psmith7600"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "All eyes will focus this week on Minsk where Russian President", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda79\"", "article_summary": "The give-backs: Russia would cease its involvement in eastern Ukraine, whatever it may be, and pay $1 billion to compensate for the rent it paid for stationing its fleets in the Crimea until the region voted for independence.\nRelated: Putin Wants Eastern Ukraine\u2014Let Him Have ItWell, with this in mind let\u2019s look on the bright side.\nAll eyes will focus this week on Minsk where Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Petro Poroshenko.\nIt\u2019s knife\u2019s edge now: Putin and Poroshenko will either craft a deal defusing tensions, or agree on a framework for one - or they will do neither.\nUkraine would also get a new long-term agreement with Russia\u2019s Gazprom covering future gas supplies and pricing - critical if Ukraine is to sustain any kind of economic recovery."}
