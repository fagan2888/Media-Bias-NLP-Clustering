The trend is by no means new. It began gradually after Chief Justice Earl Warren's retirement in 1969. He had guided the court to a greater recognition of civil rights against state and federal infringements. Warren had presided over cases that led to desegregation and voting reform throughout the country. With President Richard Nixon's appointment of Warren E. Burger as chief justice, the rightward shift began taking shape. Since 1986, when William Rehnquist was appointed chief justice, and then after his death in 2005, when John Roberts took over the position, the court has often limited Warren Court opinions by favoring states' rights claims and business deregulation.\n\nThis piece first ran in Printers Row Journal, delivered to Printers Row members with the Sunday Chicago Tribune and by digital edition via email.

He believes President Ronald Reagan appointed Scalia in hopes of gaining a voice capable of unifying the conservative wing of the Court. Scalia has, however, failed to live up to this expectation. Instead he has been a divisive figure, tending to alienate and even deride other conservatives like Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy, whose reasoning Scalia often derided. His caustic approach on occasion cost Scalia votes. However, Murphy's fairly singular focus on Scalia's divisiveness could have been better tempered with greater elaboration on instances when he wrote controversial majority opinions, such as those limiting the ability of parties to bring antitrust lawsuits against monopolies or to certify a class of plaintiffs with a common interest against employers, for which Scalia garnered four additional conservative votes. This could have provided a more nuanced picture of Scalia as firmly entrenched in conservative politics but tending to be to the right of similarly inclined justices.\n\nMurphy's second major premise, which he demonstrates less effectively than the first, is that Scalia's Roman Catholic background has influenced his judicial opinion-making, especially in abortion rights cases. This claim is thought-provoking but not entirely convincing. While a tangible claim, to prove its validity Murphy would have had to show that specific Catholic doctrines are mimicked or closely followed not only in Scalia's conclusions but also in his analyses of relevant cases. And such a proof is wanting; Murphy's proffered proofs are fascinating and at times compelling, but ultimately inconclusive.\n\nScalia has also aired conservative views off the bench, in lectures delivered around the country. He has even made partisan statements about the political arena, as when he chose not to attend President Barack Obama's State of the Union address in 2013 because he considered it be to be a \"silly affair\" and a \"childish spectacle.\" These sentiments could be dismissed as offhand remarks, if they merely reflected a personal preference. But Scalia's consistent conservativism on the bench and in his extrajudicial statements puts in doubt his claim to judicial objectivity. Murphy, who previously published critical accounts of liberal Justices Abe Fortas and William O. Douglas, believes the level of Scalia's politicization of his office surpasses that of any previous justices.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n\"Scalia\" begins with a biographical sketch, including several laudatory vignettes about the future justice's family and details about his education. Throughout his life Scalia took to conservative causes, enthusiastically debating with those of different leanings. His classmates in Georgetown University and Harvard Law School remember him fondly as an exceptional student and an adept public speaker. Scalia also proved himself a capable lawyer, especially in administrative cases, working at a prestigious Cleveland law firm. Scalia then joined the University of Virginia School of Law faculty. Politics drew him into executive branch bureaucracy, first with the Office of Telecommunications Policy and then as the chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States.\n\nAn even bigger break for Scalia was appointment as the assistant attorney general to the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel during President Gerald Ford's administration. In this capacity, Murphy recounts Scalia's stonewalling methods in seeking to thwart passage of the Freedom of Information Act. Even after Congress overrode Ford's veto of the law, Scalia continued to advance legal memoranda and congressional committee testimony to help the administration deny information requests.\n\nAfter Jimmy Carter's presidential victory, Scalia, like many other conservatives, left the executive branch. Murphy describes how, for a time, Scalia used a newly won faculty appointment at the University of Chicago Law School as a staging ground for his bid to gain a seat on a federal court. While at the U. of C., Scalia helped found the Federalist Society, which became an intellectual juggernaut from which the Reagan administration drew legal appointees and then the Bush administration picked judicial candidates. As Scalia's star rose in Republican circles, he gained ample enough national recognition to be appointed in 1982 to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and then, in 1986, to the Supreme Court.\n\nJust before joining the Court, Scalia adopted what became the touchstone of his judicial philosophy: the original meaning school of thought, which claims contemporary cases can be resolved by elucidating constitutional text through the popular meaning of words at the time of the Constitution's ratification. His gloss was an important modification to Judge Robert Bork's original intent approach, but Scalia has remained a fair weather originalist, trotting out the theory when it suits him and ignoring it when it does not. Murphy does a fine job illustrating that at first Scalia was textual in his opinions, sometimes even quoting from dictionaries, at least one of them inexplicably postdating by several decades the drafting of the Constitution. Over the years, Scalia has expanded his search for public meaning to diaries, newspapers and letters; this has provided a fuller picture of original meaning but hasn't won a majority of other justices to his interpretive approach.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Reviews: 'Scalia' by Bruce Allen Murphy, 'Uncertain Justice' by Laurence Tribe and Joshua Matz", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "In recent years, the Supreme Court of the United States has taken a markedly conservative turn.
