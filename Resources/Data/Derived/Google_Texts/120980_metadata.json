But in the world of healthcare deals, particularly digital health, there\u2019s good reason for caution. Cue the acquisition announced this week of physicians\u2019 social network QuantiaMD.\n\nHere\u2019s what Physicians Interactive Chairman and CEO Donato Tramuto said of the deal. \u201cBy bringing Physicians Interactive and Quantia together, we continue to develop new ways to provide our customers, including health systems and life sciences companies, with the leading digital and mobile engagement platforms to help improve the quality and value of healthcare delivery.\u201d\n\nQuantiaMD, like some other social networks for physicians, provides a way for pharmaceutical companies to reach this target audience through its mobile and Web-based physician relationship management platform since the Affordable Care Act made direct access to physicians through hospitals and practices more onerous.\n\nSeems like a decent investment opportunity, no? That\u2019s what Safeguard Scientifics figured. With a 42.3 percent stake in the business, it was the lead investor in the company. It had invested a total of $12.5 million in business, and had also funded a $1.7 million bridge loan to the company, according to Safeguard\u2019s first quarter earnings report. Most notably, it led a $10 million Series B round in the digital health company two years ago and gained two board seats in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut following the deal, in Safeguard\u2019s second quarter earnings report, the investment firm noted that it had incurred a $2.9 million impairment charge related to QuantiaMD.\n\nThe exit happened too fast for the value of the company to increase significantly. There\u2019s also pharma\u2019s pace of change to consider. Despite the interest in digital advertising and the opportunity to market to a social network of physicians, pharmaceutical companies are slow to change and continue to depend far more on TV, radio and other offline vehicles than online ones.\n\nThis is just one of what have been and will be several examples of why investing in digital health can be fraught with pitfalls. But while this investment failed to meet expectations, consider this. Safeguard is also an investor in Propeller Health, a digital health company that developed an FDA cleared remote monitoring platform to track adherence and other data for asthma and COPD patients through inhalers. It has a 24.6 percent stake in that business.\n\nThis week, the FDA greenlighted its platform for GlaxoSmithKline and Boehringer-Ingelheim inhalers. The goal is to improve adherence but also to help physicians spot medication problems earlier and avoid needless emergency room visits to reduce healthcare costs. That\u2019s pretty good news for its investors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With a 42.3 percent stake in QuantiaMD, Safeguard Scientifics was the lead investor in the company.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "With a 42.3 percent stake in QuantiaMD, Safeguard Scientifics was the lead investor in the company.", "title": "Physicians Interactive snaps up physician social network QuantiaMD, but not everyone\u2019s a winner", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/meh-face.jpg", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/07/physicians-interactive-snaps-up-physician-social-network-quantiamd-but-not-everyones-a-winner/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/meh-face.jpg", "description": "With a 42.3 percent stake in QuantiaMD, Safeguard Scientifics was the lead investor in the company.", "card": "summary", "title": "Physicians Interactive snaps up physician social network QuantiaMD, but not everyone's a winner - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,dealflow, digital health, doctors, Physicians Interactive, QuantiaMD, Safeguard Scientifics, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Safeguard Scientifics", "published_time": "2015-07-24T17:59:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Cue the acquisition announced this week of physicians\u2019 social network QuantiaMD.\nThis is just one of what have been and will be several examples of why investing in digital health can be fraught with pitfalls.\nBut in the world of healthcare deals, particularly digital health, there\u2019s good reason for caution.\nMost notably, it led a $10 million Series B round in the digital health company two years ago and gained two board seats in the process.\nSafeguard is also an investor in Propeller Health, a digital health company that developed an FDA cleared remote monitoring platform to track adherence and other data for asthma and COPD patients through inhalers."}
