It was three shots higher than the 82 he shot in the second round of the Phoenix Open in January, which led to him taking a two-month break from competition until he could get his game in order.\n\nWoods ended his front nine with back-to-back double bogeys for a 42. Needing a par on the 18th hole to avoid his worst score, he hooked his tee shot into the water, flubbed two chips from short of the green and took a quadruple-bogey 8.\n\nIt was his third round in the 80s as a pro.\n\nWoods, who had to make a 6-foot par putt on the final hole Friday just to make the cut, declined interview requests, walking out the door to sign a few autographs. About 20 minutes later, his coach and caddie were sitting at a curb waiting for a van to come by to get them.\n\nHe was in last place, meaning he would play as a single Sunday for the first time in his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not only surprised, I feel very bad for him,\u201d tournament host Jack Nicklaus said. \u201cHe\u2019s struggled health-wise. He struggled with his short game earlier in the year. He feels like he\u2019s coming back and then he does this. I don\u2019t have an answer for it, an explanation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that he probably doesn\u2019t, either.\u201d\n\nThe broader question is where this leaves him with a full summer of majors ahead.\n\nWoods showed remarkable improvement when he returned from his break at the Masters with a tie for 17th, though he was never seriously in contention. And while he had to make putts on his final hole just to survive the cut in his last two tournaments, it still was the first time in more than a year that he made the cut in three straight starts.\n\nAnd now this.\n\nHe missed a 4-foot par putt at the par-3 fourth that was above the hole. He three-putted for bogey on the par-5 fifth with another 4-foot putt above the hole that he barely tapped. His round unraveled on the par-3 eighth when he caught a tough lie in the bunker, hit it thin over the green into another bunker and made double bogey. And then he made another double bogey when his approach to a front pin came short and into the water.\n\nWorse than the score was that Woods was rarely in position to make birdie \u2014 he had only one in his round of 85.\n\nHe shot a 70 on Friday in the second round, with two late bogeys, though his putter atoned for mediocrity. He made two putts from the 30-foot range, another from 20 feet and two others from about 15 feet.\n\nOn Saturday, he missed three putts from the 5-foot range on the front nine alone. And in the end, all that mattered was how big the number was going to be.\n\nAnd it was big.\n\nWoods had only one round in the 80s over the first 14 years of his PGA Tour career \u2014 the 81 at Muirfield when he was caught in a Saturday gale at the British Open. He now has two scores in the 80s in his last 12 rounds.\n\nIt spoiled a big day for Zac Blair, the baby-faced rookie from Utah who was so fired up about his first pairing with Woods that his father flew in overnight to watch. Dad is James Blair, who played on the PGA Tour in 1984 and now is a golf director in Ogden.\n\nThe elder Blair played the PGA Championship at Valhalla in 2000, and 10-year-old Zac came along. All he cared about was getting Woods\u2019 autograph, which he did.\n\nBlair was standing on the first tee as Woods was finishing up on the putting green, and the kid smiled and stuck out his hand to greet his idol. Then he hit driver down the opening fairway \u2014 Woods hit 3-wood right of the bunkers \u2014 and played a nice round of 70.\n\nHe always dreamed of playing with Woods. He never dreamed he would shoot 70 and beat Woods by 15 shots.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously still great to play with him,\u201d Blair said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best players to ever play. It was nice to meet him. I enjoyed playing well. It would have been nice to see him play a little bit better, but he\u2019s working through some things. He\u2019ll get back playing good.\u201d\n\nEven as Woods was headed toward the worst score of his career, Blair said he was \u201csuper nice, super friendly, was always willing to talk.\u201d\n\nAfter the round, Blair posted a note to Woods on Twitter: \u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m sure we will tee it up again!\u201d He ended with the hashtag \u201cgoat\u201d \u2014 greatest of all time.\n\nWoods was at his absolute best when Blair was a 10-year-old kid at the Valhalla clubhouse trying to get his autograph. Woods went on to win that PGA in a playoff on his way to becoming the only player to sweep the four professional majors.\n\nWoods hasn\u2019t won a major since his 14th at Torrey Pines in the 2008 U.S. Open. He hasn\u2019t won a tournament in his last 20 events dating to August 2013.\n\nThe road back looks longer than ever.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tiger Woods shoots worst round of career, 85, at Memorial", "title": "Tiger Woods shoots worst round of career, 85, at Memorial", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/06/tiger-woods-shoots-worst-round-of-career-85-at-memorial/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150606_110818_tiger-woods.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150606_110818_tiger-woods.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T11:14:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T22:23:49+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "DUBLIN, Ohio \u2014 Tiger Woods hit a new low with a career high.\nThen he hit driver down the opening fairway \u2014 Woods hit 3-wood right of the bunkers \u2014 and played a nice round of 70.\nWorse than the score was that Woods was rarely in position to make birdie \u2014 he had only one in his round of 85.\nRight when it looked as though Woods was slowly making some semblance of progress, he posted an 85 on Saturday at the Memorial for the worst score of his career.\nHe was in last place, meaning he would play as a single Sunday for the first time in his career."}
