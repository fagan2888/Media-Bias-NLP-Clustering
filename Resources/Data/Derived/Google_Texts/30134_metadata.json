As Colorado is a world leader in wind energy production, it is not only fitting to tout our success, but to encourage its further production.\n\nColorado\u2019s installed capacity of 1,530 turbines produces 2,332 megawatts of electricity, or 13.8 percent of the state\u2019s electricity, and powers the equivalent of more than 870,000 average Colorado homes. But according to the American Wind Energy Association, the state has the 13th best wind resource in the nation, and this wind power has the potential of meeting more than 24 times the state\u2019s current electricity needs.\n\nWith 19 manufacturing facilities, Colorado\u2019s wind industry provides employment for about 5,000 workers. This is set to increase when NextEra Energy Resources completes its wind farm 28 miles east of Colorado Springs. That facility is scheduled to come on line by late 2015.\n\nWhat\u2019s holding Colorado back from developing this renewable energy resource to its full potential? At least two things: the untruth that only renewables are subsidized; and that damages incurred to the natural environment in energy production are borne by society \u2014 not the energy producers and its consumers.\n\nThe Production Tax Credit for wind farms expired at the end of 2013, and Colorado Sens. Mark Udall and Michael Bennet are asking for a 10-year extension of the program. A bill that would have provided about $13 billion for wind energy stalled in the Senate on May 15, amid cries of \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d from its opponents.\n\nNick Loris with the conservative Heritage Foundation told the Washington Free Beacon that \u201ctaxpayers shouldn\u2019t be footing the bill to help it [wind energy] remain economically viable.\u201d He said the subsidy is equal to \u201cshifting labor and capital around to \u2018politically preferred sectors of the economy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHowever, the Free Beacon avoided anymention of the $4 billion in annual tax breaks \u2014 otherwise known as subsidies \u2014 to the fossil fuel industry. Nor did it include reports on the cumulative dollar amounts, over the lifetimes of their respective subsidies, at about $630 billion in the U.S. for oil, coal, gas and nuclear industries, while the renewable energy sector (wind, solar and biofuels) received roughly $70 billion.\n\nIn other words, let\u2019s end that $4 billion in annual subsidies for the fossil fuel sector. After all, if the sector\u2019s viable, it can stand alone.\n\nHowever, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reports that even without the subsidy, the cost of wind energy has declined by 42 percent over the past four years as technology has improved.\n\nOur society doesn\u2019t put a price on our water supplies or our clean air. Nuclear and fossil fuel producers pollute and consume these resources to nonsustainable levels, and then these damages are externalized and borne by society at large.\n\nThermoelectric power plants fueled by coal, natural gas, oil and nuclear fission all boil water to produce steam, which then turns a turbine that generates the electricity. This water comes from our streams, lakes and rivers, with the power plants also drawing in and killing millions of fish per year. After the water passes through the turbine, more water is needed to cool the steam back into water for reuse. Nationwide, electricity production is the largest user of water.\n\nColoradans deserve an honest discussion of the state\u2019s wind power potential as well as its benefits to society and to our natural environment. Let\u2019s not be hijacked by those with vested interests in the fossil fuel industry.\n\nMary Coday Edwards is a former newspaper editor and member of the 2014 Colorado Voices panel.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb81a\"", "article_summary": "June 15 is Global Wind Energy Day.\nAs Colorado is a world leader in wind energy production, it is not only fitting to tout our success, but to encourage its further production.\nHowever, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reports that even without the subsidy, the cost of wind energy has declined by 42 percent over the past four years as technology has improved.\nBut according to the American Wind Energy Association, the state has the 13th best wind resource in the nation, and this wind power has the potential of meeting more than 24 times the state\u2019s current electricity needs.\nA bill that would have provided about $13 billion for wind energy stalled in the Senate on May 15, amid cries of \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d from its opponents."}
