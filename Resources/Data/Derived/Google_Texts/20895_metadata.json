These decisions can be complicated and many individuals turn to investment professionals for help.\n\nMost people assume that financial professionals provide investment advice based on the best interests of the person they are advising. But that is often not the case. Unless an advisor has a \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d \u2013 that is, a legal requirement to act in the consumer\u2019s best interest \u2013 he or she could be providing advice that is more designed to improve their own financial prospects than the consumer\u2019s. This conflicted advice can have a significant negative impact on millions of Americans whose retirement security depends on their ability to save and invest successfully through workplace-based retirement plans.\n\n\u201cThe stunning results in our study show that the average American wants to see required what they already often mistakenly believe, that the advice they receive from their financial advisor needs to be in their best interest, and not in the best interest of the advisor,\u201d said Cristina Martin Firvida, AARP\u2019s Director of Financial Security and Consumer Affairs. \u201cWe urge Congress to allow DOL to move forward on updating the rule to provide a consistent high standard of protection for American workers and their families.\u201d\n\nMartin Firvida noted that under current rules governing 401(k) type retirement plans, providers offering advice to individual participants may earn money based on the individual\u2019s investment selections.\n\nThe survey was conducted May 24 to May 31 for AARP by GFK Custom Research and involved individuals 25 and older who had money saved in either a 401(k) or 403(b) plan. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 percent.\n\nAmong the other highlights:\n\n1. More than three in four (77 percent) respondents indicated that they are either \u201cvery concerned\u201d or \u201csomewhat concerned\u201d by the fact that, currently, investment advice from 40l(k) or 403(b) providers is not required to be in the best interest of participants.\n\n2. A solid majority (62 percent) described themselves as either very or somewhat concerned by the fact that their plan provider can give advice and make money from the investments plan participants select.\n\n3. After having read a statement explaining that advice from plan providers is not currently required to be in the best interest of participants, half of respondents (50 percent) said that that information makes them \u201cless likely\u201d to trust their provider for advice. Slightly over one third (37 percent) indicated that that disclosure has \u201cno impact\u201d on their level of trust.\n\nHere is a link to the AARP study.\n\nhttp://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/info-07-2013/fiduciary-duty-and-investment-advice---attitudes-of-401-k--and-4.html.\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of more than 37 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
