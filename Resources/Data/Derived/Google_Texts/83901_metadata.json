But a new analysis of state data shows that low-level marijuana arrests during the de Blasio administration have continued at roughly the same level as under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. That\u2019s not what the voters signed up for.\n\nSince 1977, state law has barred arrests for possession of trivial amounts of the drug unless it is being smoked or displayed in public. In 1990, there were fewer than 1,000 such arrests in New York City. Yet in 2011, that number had shot up to an astonishing 50,000.\n\nBy then it was clear that police officers were illegally charging people with \u201cpublic possession\u201d by tricking them into removing the drug from their pockets during constitutionally questionable searches. Arrests for this misdemeanor dropped to 28,600 last year \u2014 still more than any city in the world \u2014 after Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly ordered officers to follow the law.\n\nDefense lawyers, however, say that defendants who have noncriminal amounts of marijuana are still being cuffed and taken to jail by officers who purposely seek out concealed amounts of marijuana. This week, for example, Jim Dwyer of The Times reviewed a case in which the occupants of a car were taken to jail for a marijuana pipe \u2014 containing only residue \u2014 that was allegedly in \u201cpublic view\u201d when cops riffled through the car and found it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe new analysis of state arrest data on people caught with tiny amounts of the drug, by the Marijuana Arrest Research Project and the Drug Policy Alliance, shows that between March and August this year, during the de Blasio administration, officers made 15,324 misdemeanor arrests under the statute that contains the \u201cpublic view\u201d provision \u2014 or about 500 more than in the comparable period in 2013, during the Bloomberg administration.\n\nDespite the common argument that such arrests take criminals off the streets, three-quarters of those arrested had no prior criminal conviction. The report notes that the people arrested for marijuana possession \u201care not criminals; they are ordinary high school and college students and young workers\u201d who will be saddled with arrest records that colleges, employers, landlords, creditors and occupational licensing boards can easily find online.\n\nRace drives arrests, with black neighborhoods having arrest rates many times those of white neighborhoods with residents of the same class and income levels. Moreover, 86 percent of people arrested were black or Latino, despite data showing that whites and minorities use marijuana at similar rates. The report attributes the racial imbalance in arrests to the fact that police officers patrolling white neighborhoods typically do not search the vehicles and pockets of white citizens, thus allowing them to go about their lives without fear of arrest and incarceration.\n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s team has produced contrived numbers in an unpersuasive attempt to prove that the arrest picture is somewhat improved. But there\u2019s no hiding the fact that New York City is still administering unfair police practices that disproportionately penalize communities of color and damage the lives of the overwhelmingly young people who are targeted. Public anger around this issue will continue to grow until Mr. de Blasio changes the very ugly status quo.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20141024215117, "twitter": {"description": "The de Blasio administration needs to really do something about the targeting of young black and Latino men.", "title": "No Progress on Marijuana Arrests", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/opinion/no-progress-on-marijuana-arrests.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003196961"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/opinion/no-progress-on-marijuana-arrests.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003196961", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/opinion/no-progress-on-marijuana-arrests.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 24, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-10-30", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "New York City", "published": "2014-10-24", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "de Blasio  Bill,Marijuana,Police Department (NYC),Editorials,Hispanic-Americans,Blacks,Racial Profiling,Search and Seizure,Minorities,New York City", "description": "The de Blasio administration needs to really do something about the targeting of young black and Latino men.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "de Blasio, Bill", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The de Blasio administration needs to really do something about the targeting of young black and Latino men.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "news_keywords": "Marijuana Pot Weed,Editorial,Hispanic Americans,Blacks African-Americans,Minorities", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 24, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "org": "Police Department (NYC)", "geo": "New York City", "slug": "25sat1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141030102205, "hdl_p": "No Progress on Marijuana Arrests", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/opinion/no-progress-on-marijuana-arrests.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The de Blasio administration needs to really do something about the targeting of young black and Latino men.", "title": "No Progress on Marijuana Arrests"}, "pdate": 20141024, "des": "Minorities", "articleid": 100000003196961, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "No Progress on Marijuana Arrests", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5f4c\"", "article_summary": "But a new analysis of state data shows that low-level marijuana arrests during the de Blasio administration have continued at roughly the same level as under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\nDefense lawyers, however, say that defendants who have noncriminal amounts of marijuana are still being cuffed and taken to jail by officers who purposely seek out concealed amounts of marijuana.\nSince 1977, state law has barred arrests for possession of trivial amounts of the drug unless it is being smoked or displayed in public.\nDespite the common argument that such arrests take criminals off the streets, three-quarters of those arrested had no prior criminal conviction.\nRace drives arrests, with black neighborhoods having arrest rates many times those of white neighborhoods with residents of the same class and income levels."}
