Jeff Merkley up for Medicaid, a welfare health program for low-income Americans, The Oregonian reports.\n\nMerkley, the Democratic incumbent who\u2019s running for reelection in November against Republican challenger Monica Wehby, signed up for private coverage on the exchange several months ago, as required by the law \u2014 Republicans insisted that Congress members and their staffs be required by the law to purchase Obamacare coverage, in solidarity with their constituents.\n\nBut months later, Merkley received a letter from the beleaguered exchange notifying him that he\u2019d been accepted into the Oregon Health Plan, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid. As a senator, Merkley makes $174,000 a year, not to mention his wife\u2019s additional salary \u2014 much, much higher than the cut-off for Medicaid eligibility, which is 133 percent of the federal poverty level in Oregon.\n\n\u201cIt must have been about half a year after I was on [private insurance] we suddenly got a mailing that said \u2018Congratulations, you\u2019re enrolled!'\u201d Merkley said, according to The Oregonian. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018What? You\u2019re crazy.'\u201d\n\nMerkley reportedly did not have any problems with his private coverage, indicating that the exchange, Cover Oregon, must have enrolled him in two different plans at the same time. It\u2019s not clear how many other customers could have experienced the same issue. The exchange says it signed up 102,596 people for private coverage during the first open enrollment period, along with another 252,362 for Medicaid.\n\nAll of those customers, however, were signed up through a paper application. Oregon\u2019s Obamacare exchange faced the most serious technological failures in the country and the website never functioned properly for enrollment. The state is shifting to HealthCare.gov for the next open enrollment period.\n\nDespite Oregon\u2019s many problems, Merkley\u2019s not the first to report such a problem. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said earlier this year that his son was automatically enrolled in Medicaid on Kentucky\u2019s much more successful state-run exchange.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "'What?
