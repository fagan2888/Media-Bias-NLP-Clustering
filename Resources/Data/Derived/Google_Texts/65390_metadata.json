Bush-era executive order aimed at halting \u201cwasteful earmarks.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to White House Budget Director Shaun Donovan, the nonprofits Cause of Action and Demand Progress asked OMB to update and reissue 2008 Executive Order 13457, \u201cProtecting American Taxpayers from Government Spending on Wasteful Earmarks.\u201d\n\nThe letter dated Oct. 7 described an earmark as \u201ca provision associated with legislation that specifies certain congressional spending priorities or applies to a very limited number of individuals or entities.\u201d It\n\nnoted that the executive order would apply to earmarks in legislation, congressional committee reports or communications from or on behalf of members of Congress.\n\nCause of Action\u2019s study of federal discretionary spending through Freedom of Information Act records and federal databases since 2011 \u201crevealed that OMB\u2019s current efforts to ensure that discretionary grant decision-making is transparent and merit-based are ineffective,\u201d its statement said. \u201cAs a result, political appointees and others can use federal tax dollars to reward political allies and appease powerful interests.\u201d\n\nA check of agency website treatments of congressional earmarks found that only five of 17 agencies have a page dedicated to posting congressional communications and only one has been updated since 2009, the groups said.\n\nThe letter urged OMB to take five steps:\n\nConfirm that E.O. 13457 \u201cbinds discretionary spending;\u201d\n\nAffirm that allocation of discretionary funds outside a transparent, merit-based decision-making process is prohibited;\n\nRecognize that Congress and non-congressional \u201cindividuals such as executive branch officials, state and local politicians, registered lobbyists, and donors can and do exert pressure on discretionary spending decision-making on federal projects, programs, contracts, and grants\u201d;\n\nRequire executive departments and agencies to make available to the public, in searchable form on the Internet, records of all written and oral communications from any source that reference earmarks;\n\nDirect executive departments and agencies to make records of these communications publicly available through their respective websites within 30 days of receiving such communications, and include the practice in their Open Government Plans.\n\n\u201cCause of Action\u2019s research shows that for years, federal agencies have been ignoring a binding executive order designed to protect taxpayer dollars from being misused, \u201c said the group\u2019s executive director, Daniel Epstein. \u201cOur organizations believe that Washington has a duty to the public to ensure that federal discretionary spending decisions are transparent and merit-based.\u201d\n\nDemand Progress Policy Director Daniel Schuman said: \u201cThe administration must add a measure of transparency to earmark requests received by executive branch agencies. Federal spending decisions should be made on merit and in the sunshine. There already is an executive order on the books that addresses secret calls and letters by Congress and special pleaders. It is time to enforce it.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesmen did not respond to inquiries by publication time.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles S.
