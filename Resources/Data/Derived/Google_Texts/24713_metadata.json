Since assuming control of the state\u2019s highest office, Gov. Bruce Rauner has been pushing a conservative agenda that hasn\u2019t been present for a while in the typically blue state. He\u2019s a vocal supporter of the anti-labor union \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws, an issue which was covered extensively by the New York Times. In his latest attempt at reducing the state\u2019s budget, Rauner is taking aim at mental health and other social services.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Tribune, Rauner has proposed cuts to the Department of Human Services Division of Mental Health totaling $82 million. As the graphic below shows, $54.4 million would be saved through discontinued services, with an additional $27.6 million saved through reduced services. Among Rauner\u2019s targets are psychiatry funds, community services and housing for the homeless. A total of $13 million toward housing for the homeless would be lost.\n\nRauner claims that the services he would cut are covered by the federal Affordable Care Act, easing the burden on the state to pay for mental health. That\u2019s partially true, but Obamacare doesn\u2019t include any assistance for homeless individuals seeking housing. The National Coalition for the Homeless estimates Illinois\u2019 homeless population at 14,055. According to the same organization, mental illness is the third largest cause of homelessness for homeless adults. Rauner\u2019s cuts would be an unnecessary reduction in services to the segment of the state\u2019s population that needs the most help.\n\nSome estimate that Rauner\u2019s cuts will also actually lead to an increase in costs in other areas. If the community services are removed, more mentally ill individuals could end up in hospitals or in jail. The costs of treating them would still be there, but the benefit of preventative measures and support would be removed. \u201cIt is short-sighted, because you\u2019re just going to move people from one system that\u2019s relatively cost-effective and inexpensive into a more expensive system,\u201d said Eileen Durkin, president and CEO of Community Counseling Centers of Chicago.\n\nRauner ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility, and the state\u2019s progressives are now being subjected to his expected cuts in social services. According to Progressive Illinois, Rauner\u2019s $31.5 billion budget proposal is $4.1 billion less than the current budget. The site also reports that the state is facing a $6 billion budget deficit in the next fiscal year. \u201cThis budget is honest with the people of Illinois, and it presents an honest path forward. Now is the time to start on a responsible path after years of financial recklessness,\u201d Rauner said. He\u2019s correct that the state needs to get back on the right financial path, but there\u2019s nothing responsible about cutting funds to mental health and housing for the homeless.\n\nSources: The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, The National Coalition for the Homeless, Progressive Illinois", "article_metadata": {"theme-version": "1.2.4", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0", "description": "In last year\u2019s elections, Illinois elected a Republican governor for the first time since 1999.
