Now it\u2019s estimated by the president\u2019s own team that they\u2019ll increase by $2,900 over the next 10 years.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R), remarks on health-care proposals, Manchester, N.H., Oct. 13, 2015\n\nIt\u2019s always gratifying when politicians adjust \u2014 or even drop \u2014 faulty talking points in response to a fact check. But there are some talking points that simply won\u2019t die, no matter how often they have been fact checked.\n\nWhy? It is because politicians have concluded that the claim in some way motivates voters, and that fact far outweighs the consequences of repeating a false claim.\n\nWe also have often found that the more complex an issue, the more likely it will be subject to a false claim. That\u2019s certainly the case with health care, where both parties have played games with the numbers.\n\nThis statement by former Florida governor Jeb Bush is a particularly instructive example. It started with a misleading claim by then-Sen. Barack Obama, campaigning for the presidency in 2008. It then has morphed into a recurring GOP claim that has repeatedly been proved false by The Fact Checker, FactCheck.org, and PolitiFact. And yet here it is again.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to give up. Time for a refresher course!\n\nThe Facts\n\nLet\u2019s start with Obama\u2019s $2,500 promise. At least 19 times during the 2008 campaign, according to a video circulated by GOP lawmakers, Obama claimed that his health-care plan would reduce \u201cpremiums by as much as $2,500 per family.\u201d\n\nThe specifics were laid out in an Obama campaign memo, which called the $2,500 figure a \u201cbest-guess\u201d assumption.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s pledge came with a very large asterisk: He was not saying premiums would fall by $2,500, but that health-care costs per family would be that much lower than anticipated. In other words, if overall costs \u2014 not just premiums \u2014 were expected to rise by $5,000 by 2012, they would only rise by $2,500. We should note that Obama was not especially clear about that aspect of the estimate \u2014 and as shown in the video he frequently misstated it.\n\nWhen Obama made this claim in 2008, he was quickly called out by fact checkers. The Fact Checker awarded Obama Two Pinocchios for the pledge, saying that it was based on shaky assumptions (such as a Rand Corp. study that was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office) and that there was no guarantee any cost savings would be passed on to consumers.\n\nBut no one ever forgets these pledges, neither the Republicans nor the Obama White House.\n\nThe health-care plan that emerged from Congress was significantly different than Obama\u2019s campaign proposal. Yet the White House in 2011 offered a re-estimate that the plan would yield $2,000 in savings by 2019. In 2014, Obama even began to claim that \u201cthe average premium for family coverage today would be $1,800 higher\u201d if not for his health-care plan \u2014 a statement that also yielded Pinocchios. (It is very difficult, even at this date, to determine how much the slowdown in health-care costs is attributable to the Affordable Care Act. The Great Recession resulted in a general slowdown in health-care costs around the globe.)\n\nBut Bush, like previous Republicans who have tried to make this argument, stumbles because he is comparing Obama\u2019s pledge with something different \u2014 actual projected increases in premiums. As we noted, Obama\u2019s campaign pledged to reduce the rate of growth for health-care costs, not an actual cut in premiums.\n\nA Bush spokesman said he was relying on a recent projection from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that private insurance premiums will rise by nearly $2,900 per enrollee by 2024. That\u2019s also different than the Obama estimate, because that was per family. (Other Republicans, in making a similar claim, have been careful to cite increases in family premiums to date, so Bush is being especially sloppy here.)\n\nHealth costs have climbed every year and were always expected to increase; the question was whether the Affordable Care Act would slow the rate of growth in premiums. During Obama\u2019s presidency, the United States has experienced unusually low rates of growth in health-care premiums, about 5 percent per year, almost half the pre-recession rate.\n\nThe CMS analysis says that premiums per enrollee will increase 5.4 percent in 2014, in part because of the expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. (An unrelated factor is expensive new prescription-drug treatments for hepatitis C.) But the increase would drop to an annual rate of 4.1 percent in 2018 in part because of other Obamacare provisions. Eventually, more robust economic growth will help boost premiums by about 5.8 percent per year over the nine-year period studied in the report. But, the increases are still \u201cexpected to be substantially lower than the average rates that were observed in the three decades prior to the recession,\u201d the analysis said.\n\nTo put it in perspective, if the pre-recession growth rates were in place between 2014 and 2024, then per enrollee premiums would be at least $3,500 higher in 2024 than projected by CMS.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nLet us stipulate once again that Obama\u2019s 2008 pledge was a silly promise, often sloppily stated. But that does not excuse Republican efforts to mischaracterize the pledge \u2014 and then compare it to a misleading metric.\n\nBush in this instance does not even bother to use per-family premiums or even what has happened so far under the law, but chooses a projection far in the future. That makes the comparison even more misleading.\n\nGiven that health costs have grown at historically low rates during Obama\u2019s presidency, it\u2019s really time to retire this deceptive talking point. In the meantime, Bush earns Three Pinocchios.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush repeats a GOP talking point that has been repeatedly debunked by fact checkers.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Jeb Bush repeats a GOP talking point that has been repeatedly debunked by fact checkers.", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s incorrect claim about a silly Obama health-care promise", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/27/jeb-bushs-incorrect-claim-about-a-silly-obama-health-care-promise/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-10-13/Reuters/2015-10-13T144408Z_01_BKS02_RTRIDSP_3_USA-ELECTION-BUSH.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/27/jeb-bushs-incorrect-claim-about-a-silly-obama-health-care-promise/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "jeb bush; jeb 2016; jeb bush for president; obamacare; repeal obamacare; obama health care' health care premiums; glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "jeb bush; jeb 2016; jeb bush for president; obamacare; repeal obamacare; obama health care' health care premiums; glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker"}, "article_summary": "(It is very difficult, even at this date, to determine how much the slowdown in health-care costs is attributable to the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Great Recession resulted in a general slowdown in health-care costs around the globe.)\nThe FactsLet\u2019s start with Obama\u2019s $2,500 promise.\n(Brian Snyder/Reuters)\u201cPresident Obama promised health-care insurance premiums that they would fall by $2,500 per family.\nAs we noted, Obama\u2019s campaign pledged to reduce the rate of growth for health-care costs, not an actual cut in premiums."}
