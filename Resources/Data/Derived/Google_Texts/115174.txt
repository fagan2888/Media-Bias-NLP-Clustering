A Newton County man is in a Jackson hospital after being shot early Sunday morning.

The Newton County Sheriff's Department was called to the scene of a shooting in the 1100 block of Newton Bethel Road. That's where Sheriff Jackie Knight says Orlando Smith was shot once in the stomach. Sheriff Knight tells Newscenter 11 Smith was attempting to gain entry into his ex-girlfriend's house when she shot him with a 12-gauge shotgun. Smith was immediately flown to University Medical Center in Jackson where he is in intensive care.

The sheriff says this is not the first run-in his department has had with the ex-boyfriend and girlfriend. He tells us his deputies responded to a call at the home on Newton Bethel Road just a short time before the shooting. Knight says Smith ran into the woods that time. Then this past Friday, Sheriff Knight tells us Smith's ex-girlfriend filed an affidavit against him for kidnapping her this past week.

Once Smith gets out of the hospital, Knight says he will face kidnapping charges.
