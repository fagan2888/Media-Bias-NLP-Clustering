A group of locals are fighting to end world hunger one step at a time.

Saturday morning around 60 people participated in the 26th annual Crop Hunger Walk at McKenzie Park.

The event helps to feed the hungry here in the Florida panhandle and across the world.

Crop walkers raise money by getting pledges prior to the event and others also collected peanut butter jars to support area food banks.

Locals say 25 percent of the money raised will go to local charities and the other 75 percent will go to help the hungry across the country and abroad.
