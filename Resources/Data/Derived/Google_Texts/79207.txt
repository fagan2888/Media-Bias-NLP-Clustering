Littleton River District revitalization effort gets $500k grant for infrastructure improvements



LITTLETON — Already off to a great start, the effort to revitalize the downtown along the Ammonoosuc River recently received a $500,000 grant from the New Hampshire Community Development Finance Authority.

..

Taylor Caswell, who is the CDFA’s executive director and a Littleton native, on Nov. 12 presented a large ceremonial check to town officials during a brief gathering on the covered pedestrian bridge that spans the Ammonoosuc.

..

Caswell good naturedly and immediately dismissed any hometown favoritism, saying Littleton — through its River District Commission — has a proven track record of improving its part of the community, and has a solid plan for that to happen.

..

The CDFA grant will be used to pay for a new roadway, sidewalks and sewer lines on Mill Street, which, along with Saranac Street and Ammonoosuc Street, parallels both the Ammonoosuc and Main Street in the downtown.

..

The River District, according to the commission, is important to Littleton because it is key to enhancing the beauty of the town; creating new business opportunities; complementing existing Main Street businesses; preserving historic assets; extending pedestrian/cycling trails; and re-inventing Littleton as a tourist destination.

..

This year has seen the construction of Harmony Park on the Riverwalk, where visitors can play a variety of percussion instruments year round, and expansion of the Riverwalk to include more than two miles of walking trails. Plans are in the works to build a second bridge over the Ammonoosuc that would accommodate pedestrians as well as bicycles and small motor vehicles.

..

“This is a huge step” for improving the River District, said John Hennessey, the chairman of the River District Commission, of the CDFA grant. He added that the money will ultimately create jobs while stimulating economic activity.

..

State Sen. Jeff Woodburn, D-Dalton, welcomed Caswell back to Littleton and presented him a book about northern New Hampshire, telling Caswell that, “As long as you’re bringing money to the North Country, you’ll get a present to come.”

..

Later, Woodburn, while happy for Littleton, said he’d like to see the CDFA award more grants to North County municipalities.



In the current round of block grants, the CDFA disbursed a total of $1.8 million statewide.

..

Caswell said the CDFA’s decision to award a grant to Littleton was “fairly easy” to make given that the town, since 2012, has shown it is committed to improving the River District.
