When it comes to opposition to the Affordable Care Act, Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) isn’t taking any calls from President Barack Obama — literally — as the Senate hopeful explained in a new campaign ad.

In the spot, Kingston, an 11-term congressman running for the Senate, receives a phone call from President Obama, played by an impersonator. The Georgia Republican, though, opts to ignore the president’s call and lets it go straight to voicemail.

“Kingston, this is the president,” faux Obama says. “You’ve got to back off Obamacare. You voted 40 times to defund it. You demanded that I sign up, and you even want bureaucrats to give turn healthcare back to patients and doctors. Kingston, let me be clear: I do not want you in the Senate. Call me back, Kingston, please.”

After images of a desperate and tired Obama flash across the screen, Kingston makes an appearance with a message to voters.

“A call to stop fighting Obamacare is one call I’ll never answer,” he says.

Kingston is running in the seat currently held by Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), who is retiring. Democrats are hoping to win back the seat, which would bring them closer to maintaining power in the upper chamber.

However, several Republicans, including Rep. Paul Broun and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel are fighting to win the Republican nomination for the seat.

The Republican winner will likely face Michelle Nunn, the CEO of Points of Life, in the state’s Senate race.
