Either Mr. Obama repeatedly says things he knows are false, or he is completely unable to comprehend information to discern the truth. There is no third option.\n\nSEE ALSO: Texas officials: Quarantining family of Ebola patient justified\n\nTake his statement during the debate over the Affordable Care Act. He traveled the country for nearly a year, saying over and over and over, \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\u201d But that turned out to be completely false.\n\nIn fact, PolitiFact, a Pulitzer Prize-winning, independent fact-checking watchdog, deemed the campaign catch phrase its \u201cLie of the Year\u201d for 2013.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the thing: Either the president decided that he needed to lie \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 to get Obamacare through Congress, or he had no idea that the new law would, by definition, render millions of health care policies insufficient, thus ending them.\n\nSEE ALSO: Secret Service woes grow as director resigns\n\nThe latter option is the interesting one. Could the president, the highest elected official in the land, really not know what was in the bill he was pushing Congress to pass? Did no one ever tell him, \u201cUh, sir, it says right there on page 687 that all health care plans that fail to meet the new standards will be discontinued\u201d?\n\nBut that was three years ago. Let\u2019s skip ahead to now.\n\nThe president sends his White House spokesman out to say he has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the director of the Secret Service, even though the presidential protection squad let an armed intruder run through the White House and a gun-packing felon stand right next the president in an elevator.\n\nSeven hours later, she is gone, fired.\n\nAnother example: Mr. Obama says a group of terrorist stomping across Iraq and Syria, killing children, raping women, slaughtering \u201cinfidels,\u201d is nothing but a bunch of wannabes, little more than a \u201cJV\u201d team trying to play above their heads. Weeks later, the Islamic State extremists are beheading Americans and threatening to attack the United States, prompting a worldwide scramble to contain the threat.\n\nThen this month, the president says the chances of Ebola making its way from Africa to America are \u201cextremely low.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been taking the necessary precautions, including working with countries in West Africa to increase screening at airports so that someone with the virus doesn\u2019t get on a plane for the United States. In the unlikely event that someone with Ebola does reach our shores, we\u2019ve taken new measures so that we\u2019re prepared here at home,\u201d he said Sept. 16.\n\nWeeks later, a man flies into Dallas from Liberia. In the hospital, doctors misdiagnose him and, giving him antibiotics, send him home. Days later, the man tests positive for Ebola. And less than a week after that, hundreds are quarantined.\n\nWere all those lies? Did the president know he was about to fire his Secret Service director, that the Islamic State was a major threat, that Ebola would land in America within weeks, and lie? Or did he really have no clue \u2014 no clue how bad his Secret Service director was, no clue how dangerous Islamic State was, no clue how viral Ebola would be?\n\nAgain, the fascinating scenario is the latter one: He just didn\u2019t know. Mr. Obama went to Harvard (and Harvard grads will always let you know they went to Harvard). But the president often acts like a community college dropout, seems not to know what is so clearly coming down the pike: that the presidential protection head has got to be fired, that Islamic State is no \u201cJV\u201d club, that Ebola is a true pandemic threat.\n\nWhen candidate Obama was running for president in 2007, critics complained that he didn\u2019t have any real-life experience running \u2026 well, anything. Not a state, not a major company, not even a small business. His credentials for America\u2019s top job were slim: college professor, community organizer, state legislator, three years in the U.S. Senate.\n\nHis opponent in 2007, Hillary Rodham Clinton, warned that he simply wouldn\u2019t know what to do when that 3 a.m. emergency phone call came in, demanding that he make the right decision right away. And it turns out she was absolutely right.\n\nBut it\u2019s all much worse. On foreign policy, Mr. Obama campaigned that he would talk with the world\u2019s worst despots, boasted about a \u201creset\u201d with Russia, gave speeches with soaring rhetoric about how the world would be a better place if America took a back seat, let others be in charge for a while.\n\nWere those lies or just stupidity? Who knows. But here\u2019s what we know. Six years later, Iran is unchecked, Russia is again invading countries and seizing territory, the Middle East is exploding, northern Africa is in turmoil, and the United States is begging the United Nations to take over.\n\nSo it\u2019s not at all unreasonable to wonder whether the president is a pathological liar, or just truly incompetent. All signs point to incompetence.\n\nNow don\u2019t you wish he was just a liar?\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
