According to scientists, a link to Oetzi the Iceman has been found in 19 Tyrolean men alive today.

The Oetzi, also called Ötzi the Iceman, the Similaun Man, the Man from Hauslabjoch, Homo tyrolensis and the Hauslabjoch mummy is a well-preserved natural mummy of a man, who lived about 3,300 BC.

The mummy was found in September 1991 in the Ötztal Alps, hence Ötzi, near the Similaun mountain and Hauslabjoch on the border between Austria and Italy

He is Europe's oldest natural human mummy, and has offered an unprecedented view of Chalcolithic Europeans.

The scientists have established the relationship of the men and the Oetzi with the help of DNA test. Since the DNA tests were conducted from the blood of some blood donors in Tyrol, the men are unaware about their relationship with Oetzi.

According to the news reports, a genetic mutation was matched and the link was confirmed between the Oetzi and the men found in Tyrol.

Walther Parson from the Institute said that the same mutation might be found in the Swiss region of Engadine as well as in Italy's South Tyrol region.

He said, "We have already found Swiss and Italian partners so that we can pursue our research".
