Recent developments in Sweden are rather alarming. After years of embracing Muslim immigrants, Islam has quite literally taken parts of the nation over, and the Swedish government has ceded control to Muslims in some 50 areas of the country. Sweden learned too late that Islam never enters a country to assimilate. It comes to dominate.

In our country, if we drift further away from Christianity, if we continue to believe that all religions are the same, if we continue to look to the state to solve our problems, there will be an enormous void to fill. And Islam will be quite happy to fill it. Islam has proved it can simply over-run Western culture if there is no vibrant Christianity to stop it.
