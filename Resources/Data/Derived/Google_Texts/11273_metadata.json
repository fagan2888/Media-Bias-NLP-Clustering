But skiers have been disappointed to find that the usual thick blanket has become more of a threadbare throw.\n\nDue to California\u2019s infamous drought and climate change, Tahoe is experiencing record low snowpack which has drastically affected the ski experience. Both competitive and recreational skiers alike have noticed the negative impact.\u201cI\u2019ve been skiing Squaw my whole life, and I\u2019ve definitely noticed a decline in snow levels in recent years,\u201d said avid skier Andy Meislin. \u201cGrowing up, I remember having contests with my ski team friends over who could sit in the snow longer before needing to run back into the hot tub and jump in. The last few years, you couldn\u2019t have that contest if you tried due to lack of snow.\u201d\n\nJames Price, a former member of the Stanford Ski Team, didn\u2019t even join this year due to lack of snow.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t join because \u2026 the financial cost was just too big an investment if it wasn\u2019t going to snow enough to make the mountain really ridable,\u201d Price said. A season pass wasn\u2019t worth the price either. \u201cSkiing is an incredibly expensive sport so I didn\u2019t think buying a season pass in Tahoe would be worth it with such a meager amount of snowfall.\u201dOthers involved in the ski industry are suffering due to low snowpack levels. To compensate, ski resorts are closing for weeks at a time, opening later, and some are manufacturing artificial snow. Even these solutions might not be enough, however. Instead, resorts are looking to activities unrelated to snow such as zip-lining and mountain biking as a way to draw customers.\u201cWe have to get our heads out of the snow,\u201d Boreal\u2019s general manager, Amy Ohran, said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cA lot of discussions are about seasonal diversity, and expanding revenues in areas that are not dependent on snow. Our hearts are in skiing and snowboarding, and we want to see that succeed. But we have to cast a bigger net.\u201d Ohran could not be reached for comment.Undoubtedly, the changes in snowfall are the result of climate change, say those in the ski business.\u201cI don\u2019t know of anybody in the industry who is saying that climate change is not an issue for us,\u201d said Bob Roberts, president and chief executive of the California Ski Industry Association. \u201cIf you\u2019re below 6,000 feet, it\u2019s a real challenge.\u201dOne dry year might not be cause for concern. But over the past three years, snowfall has been on a steady decline in Tahoe. While most yearly snowfall totals have been in the high 100 inches or early 200s, snowfall was a mere 41.5 inches in 2013. Last year was no better, totaling 46 inches in 2014. And with the record-breaking drought, 2015 appears to be following suit.Snowfall totals have been declining over the last century, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\u201cThe past two winters have set new records for warmth in the Sierra Nevada and much of the 21st century has averaged temperatures higher than the period of record mean,\u201d said Michael Anderson, a state climatologist for the Department of Water Resources.\u201cExpectations are for this \u2026 to continue with more new records being set as climate change progresses.\u201dOver the course of the last 114 years, just six years \u2014 1924, 1934, 1947, 1976, 1987 and 1991 \u2014 had snowfall of less than 100 inches. Of those low years, the lowest level was 54.9 inches of snow, and each instance was at least 10 years apart. Until 2013 and 2014 that is.The lack of snow is notable, said Georgia Toal, captain of the Stanford Ski Team and a native Oregonian.\u201cEveryone talks about how great Tahoe is for skiing,\u201d Toal said. \u201cBut ever since I\u2019ve been in California, I can barely make it down the slopes without having to hop over a few rocks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Due to California\u2019s infamous drought and the effects of climate change, Tahoe is experiencing record low snowpack which has drastically affected the ski experience.", "title": "Decreasing snowpack continues to disappoint skiers in Tahoe City - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Tahoe_Snow_2011.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-31T10:36:39+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/03/26/decreasing-snowpack-tahoe-city/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Data Hub", "tag": "winter", "published_time": "2015-03-26T11:26:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-31T10:36:39+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Due to California\u2019s infamous drought and the effects of climate change, Tahoe is experiencing record low snowpack which has drastically affected the ski experience.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Tahoe_Snow_2011.jpg", "title": "Decreasing snowpack continues to disappoint skiers in Tahoe City - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Due to California\u2019s infamous drought and climate change, Tahoe is experiencing record low snowpack which has drastically affected the ski experience.\nOf those low years, the lowest level was 54.9 inches of snow, and each instance was at least 10 years apart.\nBut skiers have been disappointed to find that the usual thick blanket has become more of a threadbare throw.\n\u201cGrowing up, I remember having contests with my ski team friends over who could sit in the snow longer before needing to run back into the hot tub and jump in.\nWhile most yearly snowfall totals have been in the high 100 inches or early 200s, snowfall was a mere 41.5 inches in 2013."}
