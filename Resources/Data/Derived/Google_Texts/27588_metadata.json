(NASDAQ: ARTC), a leader in developing state-of-the-art, minimally invasive surgical products, announced its financial results for the quarter ended and year ended December 31, 2013.\n\nFOURTH QUARTER 2013 SUMMARY\n\nTotal revenue of $101.7 million.\n\nIncome from operations of $16.8 million or operating margin of 16.5%.\n\nAdjusted income from operations of $20.5 million, or adjusted operating margin of 20.1%\n\nNet income available to common stockholders of $10.4 million, or $0.30 per diluted share.\n\nFULL YEAR 2013 SUMMARY\n\nTotal revenue of $378.0 million.\n\nIncome from operations of $32.0 million, or operating margin of 8.5%.\n\nAdjusted income from operations of $69.0 million, or adjusted operating margin of 18.3%\n\nNet income available to common stockholders of $22.3 million, or $0.64 per diluted share.\n\nFOURTH QUARTER RESULTS\n\nRevenues\n\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $101.7 million, compared to $96.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, an increase of 4.9 percent. Product sales for the fourth quarter of 2013 were $96.6 million compared to $92.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, an increase of 4.7 percent.\n\nWorldwide sales of Sports Medicine products increased $3.8 million or 6.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2013 proprietary Sports Medicine product sales in the Americas increased $1.6 million, or 4.7 percent and International Sports Medicine product sales increased $1.3 million, or 5.8 percent as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Contract manufactured product sales increased by nearly $0.9 million, or 15.3 percent in the fourth quarter.\n\nWorldwide ENT product sales increased by $0.9 million or 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Americas ENT product sales increased $0.7 million or 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to the same quarter of 2012. International ENT product sales increased $0.2 million or 3.0 percent.\n\nIncome from Operations\n\nIncome from operations for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $16.8 million compared to $15.1 million for the same period in 2012.\n\nGross product margin as a percentage of product sales was 68.6 percent for the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 69.9 percent for the fourth quarter of 2012. The comparability of gross product margin between periods was impacted by the medical device excise tax imposed on US product sales by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which became effective in 2013.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $54.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to $54.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2013, as a result of the termination of the contract with one of the subtenants of our former Austin, Texas location, an additional $0.7 million was accrued for Exit Costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $2.8 million, to 32.2 percent of total revenues this quarter compared to 30.9 percent for the same quarter of 2012. These increases were partially offset by lower investigation and restatement related costs of $2.8 million.\n\nNet Income Available to Common Stockholders\n\nNet income applicable to common stockholders was $10.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, or $0.30 per diluted share in both periods.\n\nFULL YEAR RESULTS\n\nRevenues\n\nTotal revenue in 2013 was $378.0 million, compared to $368.5 million for 2012, an increase of 2.6 percent. Product sales in 2013 were $358.6 million compared to $350.7 million in 2012, an increase of 2.3 percent.\n\nWorldwide Sports Medicine product sales increased $8.2 million or 3.5 percent in 2013 compared to 2012. Sports Medicine product sales in the Americas increased $2.9 million in 2013 compared to 2012 as proprietary product sales increased $3.2 million or 2.5 percent in 2013. International Sports Medicine product sales increased $5.3 million or 6.6 percent in 2013 compared to 2012. Contract manufactured product sales decreased $0.3 million, or 1.4 percent in 2013.\n\nWorldwide ENT product sales increased $0.1 million or 0.1 percent in 2013 compared to 2012. ENT product sales in the Americas decreased $1.4 million or 1.7 percent in 2013 compared to the prior year. International ENT product sales increased $1.6 million or 6.9 percent in 2013 compared to 2012.\n\nWorldwide other product sales decreased $0.5 million in 2013 when compared to 2012 and represented less than 3 percent of total product sales in 2013.\n\nIncome from Operations\n\nFor the full year of 2013, income from operations was $32.0 million compared to $64.1 million in 2012.\n\nGross product margin as a percentage of product sales for the full year of 2013 was 67.6 percent compared to 69.2 percent in 2012.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $229.8 million in 2013 compared to $196.4 million in 2012. Investigation and restatement related costs increased $26.2 million in 2013 as a result of a charge of $20.2 million to increase the Company's accrued liabilities for the likely financial penalty it would be required to pay to resolve its ongoing DOJ investigation. As previously announced, on December 31, 2013, the Company entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (\"DPA\") with the DOJ which resolved the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. Pursuant to the DPA, the Company agreed to pay a $30 million fine to the DOJ which was consistent with the total liability accrued. The increase in investigation and restatement related expenses is also a result of additional legal costs related to our indemnification agreements with certain former officers. Increases in sales and marketing, research and development, and exist costs for the year were partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets.\n\nUnder the short-term incentive plan for 2013 approved by the Board of Directors, Adjusted Operating Margin is a key metric for purposes of evaluating business performance. Adjusted Operating Margin is Operating Margin adjusted for investigation and restatement related costs. Investigation and restatement related costs were 9.8 percent and 2.9 percent of total revenue for 2013 and 2012, respectively, and Adjusted Operating Margin was 18.3 percent and 20.3 percent, respectively, for these years. Adjusted Operating Margin is a non-GAAP measure of profitability and it should not be considered as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nNet Income Available to Common Stockholders\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net income applicable to common stockholders was $22.3 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to $42.8 million, or $1.25 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2012.\n\nBALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOWS\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $214.9 million as of December 31, 2013 compared to $218.8 million at December 31, 2012. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $72.4 million compared to cash provided by operations of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 which included the payment of $74 million required to settle the private securities class actions against the Company. Adjusted for this payment, cash flows provided by operating activities would have been $80.3 million for the year ended 2012. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $85.1 million which includes cash paid for the acquisitions of Eleven Blade Solutions, Inc. and ENTrigue Surgical, Inc. and to purchase an investment in OrthoSpace Ltd.\n\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nOn February 3, 2014, the Company announced the entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Smith & Nephew, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to which the Company agreed to be acquired by Smith & Nephew and become its wholly-owned subsidiary. The completion of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including approval by the Company\u2019s stockholders, the absence of any material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and receiving antitrust approvals, including under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.
