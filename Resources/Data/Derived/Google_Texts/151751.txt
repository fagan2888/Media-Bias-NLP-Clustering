Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have been talking quite a lot over the past 10 months.

The smarties over at FiveThirtyEight put together a list of the phrases the candidates used the most in the Democratic debates.

Some of those phrases are super vague, like Hillary’s top phrase, “to go after.”

Some are a little more specific, like Bernie’s eighth most-used phrase, “the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.”

But when life gives you a bunch of absurd, context-less political phrases, you have to make lemonade. So, here are some poems I made completely out of Bernie’s and Hillary’s most used phrases, with lines alternating between the two candidates.

“Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good State”

Let me just say this

I took on the

State of Vermont

And there

A political revolution

Spent a lot of time

“The Mountain Not Climbed”

We have to go

To the top

To do everything I can

I think that is

What we need to do

To figure out how

But at the end of the day

Barriers that stand in the way

All over this country

I think it's important

In the history of the

Comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship

“Because I Could Not Stop for Fossil Fuels”

I think we have got to

Build on

Income and wealth

And we need to

Transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficient and sustainable energy

To do more

Millions of people

Want us to

Not just a handful

“I Hear American Politicians Singing”

I want to make sure

As I understand it

That Senator Sanders

Make public colleges and universities tuition-free

Secretary Clinton is

How we're going to

Agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said

On the Affordable Care Act
