BEIJING (AP) — Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi who gained international fame for her role in “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” has accepted a marriage proposal delivered by drone.

Zhang, who turned 36 on Monday, was celebrating her upcoming birthday on Saturday when a white drone flew toward her at the party. Her boyfriend Wang Feng, a Chinese rock singer and composer, retrieved an engagement ring from inside the drone and then got down on one knee and popped the question.

“Witnessed by all, we have experienced happiness and sorrow. I hope Ziyi can always have the happiest time. If we both are old, I can still take care of you,” said Wang, according to Chinese media reports.

Zhang said “yes” before welling up, and the newly engaged couple kissed and embraced as the night sky lit up with fireworks, according to Chinese media reports.

Zhang’s manager, Ji Lingling, confirmed the engagement news in a text message to The Associated Press on Monday.
