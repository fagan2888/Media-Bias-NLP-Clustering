Does the tax break that fosters employer-sponsored health insurance for 155 million Americans need to be changed?

That’s the question Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee examined at a recent hearing.

“Hospitals, doctors and drug companies have a powerful incentive to charge high prices” because the exclusion from taxation an employer gets for insurance means patients don’t control their own health-care spending and they don’t hold health-care providers accountable for the prices they charge, Avik Roy, a senior fellow with the free-market oriented Manhattan Institute testified.

The tax break results in an estimated $250 billion less tax paid to the government for fiscal 2016. Fifty-seven percent of the U.S. population under the age of 65 receive coverage through an employer, but many economists have long argued that the third-party payer system has contributed to high health-care costs in this country.

In addition, the tax break is not enjoyed by many people who have to buy their own health insurance.

The Affordable Care Act “Cadillac tax” on plans deemed to be high-cost was intended to try to reign in high employer spending, but Joseph Antos, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, testified that ultimately all employer health plans will likely exceed the levels set by the ACA because health care costs have long risen faster than general inflation.

Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee argued against changes to the employer tax break for health insurance. Rep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.), ranking member of the committee, said that eliminating or limiting the tax exclusion would “disrupt” the system and likely result in many employers no longer offering health care to employees.
