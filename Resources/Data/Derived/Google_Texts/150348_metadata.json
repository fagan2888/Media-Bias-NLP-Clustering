Officials must make sure the site can support the traffic, and fix problems on the back end where the website transfers enrollment information to insurance companies.\n\n\"The website was always going to get fixed,\" said Republican strategist Scott Reed. \"But the looming problem are the thousands of people who have been dropped from their healthcare because of this government-run solution. That's what's starting to build up out there as a tidal wave.\"\n\n'NOT ALL FIXED YET'\n\nWhile senior White House aides are cautiously optimistic that improvements to the website are removing many of the glitches, they know the problems are far from over.\n\n\"Things are better because we're making that thing work,\" said a senior official. \"It's not all fixed yet.\"\n\nThe White House said on Saturday it was bringing back its former legislative director, Phil Schiliro, for a short-term appointment to \"help coordinate the policy implementation\" of the healthcare law.\n\n\"We are focused like a laser on reducing health care costs implementing the Affordable Care Act, and Phil will be vital to ensuring it is done right,\" Obama's chief of staff Denis McDonough said in a statement.\n\nObama's job approval rating remains low, taking a hit from the healthcare woes and the earlier budget battle with congressional Republicans that led to a government shutdown and a close brush with a debt default.\n\nThe latest Reuters/Ipsos poll put Obama's approval rating at 38 percent, against 55 percent who disapprove, among the lowest rankings of his presidency.\n\nIpsos pollster Julia Clark said a recent White House foreign policy achievement, an interim deal aimed at containing Iran's nuclear program, was not registering in the polls.\n\n\"It's not a great approval number and things like Iran don't resonate enough for the American people to fuel a recovery,\" she said.\n\nIn a sign he wants to show his agenda has not been stalled by healthcare, Obama has taken on a new tone. After frequent apologies for the website's woes, he no longer dwells on them in his public remarks, giving them only a brief mention before emphasizing the broader benefits of the law.\n\nHe cites the numbers of Americans being helped by gaining access to free mammograms or saving on prescription drugs.\n\n\"It is these numbers - not the ones in any poll - that will ultimately determine the fate of this law,\" he said in a speech on Wednesday that focused on income inequality and other items on his economic agenda.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, who have often felt slighted by the Obama White House, credit his team with extensive outreach over the healthcare law, but there are lingering strains.\n\nMany Democrats remain frustrated the administration was not more prepared when the website rolled out on October 1 and they worry about the \"back-end\" problems with the site.\n\nRepresentative Carol Shea-Porter, a New Hampshire Democrat, voiced her concerns at a Tuesday meeting on Capitol Hill where Obama administration officials updated lawmakers on the healthcare developments.\n\n\"They do understand that time is running out and people want to know exactly what it's going to look like on January 1. I know that they're speaking in good faith and that they're working very hard on it.\"\n\nRepresentative Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he believed Obama's job approval rating would rise once the HealthCare.gov site improves.\n\nDemocrats need that to happen to improve their prospects in congressional elections next November, when they will be seeking to keep control of the Senate and regain a majority in the House of Representatives.\n\n\"We've had a rough couple of weeks with the bad rollout of the Affordable Care Act,\" said McGovern. \"But I think things are changing on that.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton, Caren Bohan and Jeff Mason; Editing by Peter Cooney and Vicki Allen)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Steve Holland and Susan Cornwell", "Author": "Steve Holland and Susan Cornwell", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama, battered by weeks of turmoil over the malfunctioning HealthCare.Gov website, turned to a fresh item on his agenda on Saturday as he pressured Republicans in Congress to extend benefits for jobless Americans.", "title": "Obama takes up new agenda item after battering on healthcare", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20131207&t=2&i=818339350&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE9B60UZ900", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
