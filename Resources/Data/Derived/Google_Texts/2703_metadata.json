Sebelius. In Part One, I explained the background of the case and the central issue, namely, whether the IRS may extend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax subsidy to health plans purchased under a federally-run Exchange when the statute only says that the credit applies to an Exchange \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d As I noted last Friday, the IRS says that it may, and the challengers disagree.\n\nThe government\u2019s explanation during the rulemaking process was, as such explanations typically are, very general. Aside from asserting that the credit is consistent with statutory language, legislative history, and the overall scheme, the IRS did not explain the precise source of its authority on this issue at the time.\n\nThe government\u2019s challenge in this case is to convince the Court that the plain language of the statute means more than it says: that an exchange \u201cestablished by the State\u201d can also mean an exchange \u201cestablished by the federal government because a State declined to establish an exchange.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s lifeline to escape its obvious problems with the text is a case that has become a cornerstone of administrative law: Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. This case establishes a regime whereby government agencies are given deference in their interpretations of the statutes they administer.\n\nThe Chevron two-step process works like this. First, a court decides whether a statutory term is ambiguous: whether Congress has \u201cdirectly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d If the term has an unambiguous meaning \u2013 \u201cif the intent of Congress is clear\u201d \u2013 the court must give it effect. If not, the court will proceed to step two of the analysis and defer to a permissible agency interpretation of the statute.\n\nBefore the district court, the government suggested that the statutory language, taken the context of the entire ACA, was clear and required federally-run exchanges to be treated identically with the state exchanges they were \u201cstanding in the shoes of\u201d. The government went on to describe anomalies that would arise within the ACA from accepting the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cestablished by the State,\u201d invoking legislative history, the law\u2019s purpose, and the ACA\u2019s overall structure.\n\nWhat is so impressive about the government\u2019s position is that it declares that the case should be resolved at Chevron\u2019s first step \u2013 i.e. the government claims the statute is unambiguous. This is truly remarkable: the government says the unambiguous meaning of the statute is that the text shouldn\u2019t be read literally.\n\nThe district court (in the person of Judge Paul J. Friedman, a Clinton appointee) agreed, holding that Section 1321 of the ACA not only allows the federal government to create an Exchange, but also to take the further step of standing in the shoes of \u201can Exchange established by the State under Section 1311\u201d in all respects, thus allowing issuance of a tax subsidy.\n\nSeveral consequences flow from the district court\u2019s decision. First, the district court ensured that tax credits would flow to all health insurance purchasers buying their insurance from an Exchange, whether federal or state. This effectively means that the ACA gives no state any incentive to create an Exchange, a result at odds with the text and purpose of the ACA.\n\nSecond, by holding that the statute at issue is unambiguous, the district court comes to the head-scratching conclusion that the statute unambiguously means something contrary to its own text. It would be one thing to make such a holding where the context throughout shows the literal reading to be absurd. But the statutory context here actually provides good (if not unambiguous) support for the idea that Congress really meant to limit subsidies to State-created exchanges. For examples, elsewhere in the ACA, Congress explicitly referred to federally-created exchanges with some frequency, and didn\u2019t just lump them in with State-created exchanges. Treating the terms differently indicates that the omission of federal exchanges from the tax credit language was neither accident nor oversight. Liberal commentators have suggested that the language at issue here was \u201can obvious drafting error,\u201d but the tax subsidy provision has actually been amended several times since it was originally passed, and Congress never decided to \u201ccorrect\u201d its instructions.\n\nThird, the district court effectively amended the statute to say \u201cestablished by the State or by the federal government\u201d by accepting the IRS\u2019s rationale. But as I have noted before, the language of the statute that Congress actually passed, not the IRS\u2019s post hoc rationalization of what would work better, is the best way to understand how the ACA is supposed to work. And that holds true even when a statute, like the ACA, is sloppily drafted, internally inconsistent, or incapable of effecting its stated goals. As D.C. Circuit Judge Silberman noted recently, \u201c\u2019Emanations from the penumbra\u2019 may once have served to justify constitutional interpretation, but it hasn\u2019t caught on as legitimate statutory interpretation.\u201d Well said.\n\nThese are problematic results, and they are sufficient for the Court of Appeals to reverse the district court\u2019s holdings as a matter of law.
