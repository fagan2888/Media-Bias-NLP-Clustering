Investigators say the last time White was seen alive was when her friends left her alone around 11 p.m. Saturday night with Brundige.\n\nBob Graham, the landlord of 523 South Western Avenue, says White moved in less than two months ago. Graham says investigators have had control of the property since Monday.\n\n\"I haven't been in there yet. They said they would call me and release the keys to me so I could have it and they haven't called me yet,\" Graham said.\n\nPolice says White's friends brought Brundige over to White's apartment Saturday night. At 11 p.m. Saturday night the friends left - leaving Brundige and White alone.\n\n\"It is believed that there were drugs involved in this whole circumstance surrounding their meeting and ultimately her death,\" Sioux Falls Police Captain Greg VandeKamp said.\n\nInvestigators believe Brundige strangled White.\n\nBrundige is a registered sex offender who was convicted of sexual assault in Nebraska in 1989 and criminal sexual conduct in Minnesota in 1982.\n\nPolice arrested Brundige late Wednesday night after conducting interviews with him and several people who live in the neighborhood.\n\n\"The story that we have developed between the friends, and between the individual that was arrested, we were able to corroborate certain parts of that with the neighbors,\" VandeKamp said.\n\nAnd now a neighborhood is left in disbelief following a homicide that quietly happened in their own backyard.\n\n\"This area seems to be a pretty clean and quiet neighborhood and I was really surprised we had a homicide in the area,\" Graham said.\n\nBrundige was on probation after being convicted of failing to register as a sex offender.\n\nHe is scheduled to be in court on Monday.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "A homeless Sioux Falls sex offender has been arrested in connection with the city&#39;s fifth murder of the year.
