Businesses soon could be suffering a double whammy of a flu season, with many employees missing work not only because they need to take care of sick kids or parents, but also because they're ailing themselves.

The number of reported flu cases nationally began spiking in recent weeks, much like 2012-13's particularly bad flu season, in which workers lost an estimated $8.5 billion in wages, according to government and privately compiled data.

For the first time since the 2009 pandemic, the predominant flu strain is the H1N1 virus rather than one of the traditional forms of flu, which tend to hit children and the elderly the hardest.

"We are seeing an increase in H1N1," said Dr. Michael Jhung, medical epidemiologist at the federal Centers for Disease Control. "This virus in the past affected young and middle-age adults more than older adults. It stands to reason that many more of these people would be in the workforce."

Another worrisome sign for businesses is that the spike, which began in December, looks much more like last winter's monster flu season than the tame 2011-12 season.

A chart compiled by AthenaResearch, which tracks flu diagnoses at primary care physicians affiliated with Athenahealth's network, shows that this year's spike began just weeks after last winter.
