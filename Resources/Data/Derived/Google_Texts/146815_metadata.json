The hackerama wants to find out what will happen if they ask taxpayers to vote for income-tax hikes \u2014 but only on \u201cmillionaires,\u201d wink wink, nudge nudge.\n\nIt\u2019s a grift that can only end one way, with everyone paying through the roof. The endgame is so obvious that in five previous attempts the non-working classes have tried to foist the \u201cgrad tax\u201d on taxpayers, they\u2019ve been crushed \u2014 never by less than 64 percent of the votes.\n\nBut the hacks haven\u2019t gone to the well since 1994, and of late the wisdom of the electorate has been in a tailspin \u2014 Obama, Patrick, Warren, Markey, Frank, etc., etc.\n\n\u201cIs it finally time?\u201d the tax-fattened hyenas ask one another, \u201cHave we dumbed them ... just enough?\u201d At least one poll indicates that if the hacks give the voters the blade in 2018, they\u2019ll gladly slit their own throats.\n\nRight now the state constitution mandates a flat income tax rate \u2014 everyone pays at the same rate, just over 5 percent. The indolent have long dreamed of a \u201cprogressive rate,\u201d making people with more income pay their \u201cfair share.\u201d So now they promote a \u201csurcharge\u201d on so-called millionaires \u2014 4 percent on incomes of over $1 million per year.\n\nTo change the state\u2019s constitution, they need to prevail on the ballot in 2018. They took the first step last week, winning a vote in a joint session of the legislature, 135-57, to put this latest bait-and-switch before the voters.\n\nNot only do the hacks claim that they\u2019ll \u201conly\u201d hit millionaires, they also say the money will be \u201cearmarked\u201d for education and transportation. Yeah, right. The attempt itself may even be unconstitutional. But who cares, right?\n\nThe bigger problem is, soaking the rich never works. Look at New Jersey. The hacks in Trenton have been trying to jack up the top marginal rate from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent.\n\nC\u2019mon down, David Tepper, a 58-year-old money manager worth $10.6 billion. Last October, he legally shifted his residence from New Jersey to Miami Beach. Florida\u2019s income tax rate is ... zero!\n\nThen there was Maryland. They jacked up their top marginal rate and 31,000 \u201cmillionaires\u201d instantly vanished.\n\nThe same thing will happen here. The state will quickly realize that the supply of \u201cmillionaires\u201d has failed. In order to deal with the \u201cshortfall,\u201d the millionaire tax will have to be adjusted downward \u2014 temporarily, of course \u2014 so that everyone making more than, say, $30,000 a year will be now designated for tax purposes as a millionaire. Look on the bright side though, it\u2019s for the children.\n\nThe debate in the Legislature last week broke along the usual lines. These aren\u2019t higher taxes, they\u2019re \u201cinvestments in the future.\u201d \u201cDisparities\u201d must be addressed. Transportation is \u201cunderfunded,\u201d even though Republicans pointed out that we already spend four times what New Hampshire does to maintain our state highways \u2014 $685,000 per mile, compared to $145,000 in the Granite State.\n\nObviously these Republicans have no compassion for the greedy \u2014 er, I mean the needy.\n\nThe problem for the welfare-industrial complex is that no one believes anything they say. In 2000, the voters approved cutting the state income tax back to 5 percent in a 60-40 landslide \u2014 and the rate remains above 5 percent.\n\nRep. Jay Kaufman (D-Lexington) took umbrage to Republicans\u2019 pointing out that fact, saying, \u201cWe will be at 5 percent as the voters have asked within two years.\u201d\n\nIn other words, by Fiscal 2019. The Legislature will have given the voters what they demanded ... in 2000 ... and they\u2019re bragging about it.\n\n\u201cFollowing the will of the people,\u201d asked Rep. Jim Lyons (R-Andover), \u201cis waiting 18 years to reduce the rate to what they voted 18 years ago?\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s just one of their lies. How about Bill Clinton\u2019s promised middle-class tax cut in 1992? Or Deval Patrick\u2019s statewide property-tax cut in 2006? Obama\u2019s promise in 2009 of $2,500 annual savings on health insurance under Obamacare? How about the tollbooths on the Mass Pike? They were supposed to be torn down after the bonds sold to build I-90 were finally paid off \u2014 in 1988.\n\nRight? Right? Right? Right?\n\nOn the other hand, the voters were smart enough to vote down the automatic gas-tax increase in 2014, despite the fact that the hacks outspent the working people 30-1. And Boston 2024, another raid on the wallets of working people, went down in flames just last year.\n\nCan working people dodge another bullet? I hope so, but I\u2019m also relieved I already own property in Florida.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just how stupid have the voters of Massachusetts become?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "parsely-page": "{\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bostonherald.com\\/news\\/columnists\\/howie_carr\\/2016\\/05\\/carr_driving_out_the_rich\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"1065214708\",\"title\":\"Carr: Driving out the rich\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-05-22T04:00:00Z\",\"tags\":[\"millionaire\\u2019s tax\",\"section-News\"],\"authors\":[\"Howie Carr\"],\"section\":\"News\"}", "twitter": {"description": "Just how stupid have the voters of Massachusetts become?", "card": "summary", "title": "Carr: Driving out the rich"}, "og": {"image": "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/gallery/public/media/2014/09/04/statehouseradio.jpg?itok=rXh_W0B5", "description": "Just how stupid have the voters of Massachusetts become?That&rsquo;s the question being asked in a new two-year statewide clinical experiment now underway at the State House.
