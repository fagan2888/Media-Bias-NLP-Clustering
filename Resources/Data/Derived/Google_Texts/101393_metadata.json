It\u2019s Hoyer\u2019s job for now, but the real test for him will be how long he keeps it from Manziel.\n\nPettine met with his coaching staff Tuesday night and announced in a release Wednesday before practice that he\u2019ll go with Hoyer. The decision ends weeks of competition and analysis, and the Browns are hoping it will allow Hoyer, who started three games last season, to build some chemistry with Cleveland\u2019s struggling offense before they meet the dreaded Steelers, their long-time rivals.\n\nIn the end, Hoyer\u2019s experience \u2014 however limited \u2014 gave him the nod.\n\n\u201cHe was the clear leader from the beginning,\u201d Pettine said of Hoyer. \u201cWe\u2019ve maintained all along that if it was close, I would prefer to go with the more experienced player. Brian has done a great job in the meeting rooms and with his teammates on the practice field and in the locker room.\u201d\n\nPettine delayed his decision after both Hoyer and Manziel played poorly in a 24-23 exhibition loss at Washington on Monday. During that game, Manziel gave the finger to the Redskins sideline, an act Pettine said would be factored into the decision.\n\nHoyer didn\u2019t win the job over Manziel as much as he clung to it after beginning training camp as the No. 1 quarterback. Hoyer showed glimpses of being a quality starter in 2013 before sustaining a season-ending knee injury.\n\nHoyer only completed 2 of 6 passes for 16 yards in Monday\u2019s game and the Browns\u2019 first-team offense was out of sync with him on the field. However, Pettine said in looking at Hoyer\u2019s entire body of work that he deserved the starting gig.\n\n\u201cI think Brian\u2019s been very poised,\u201d Pettine said. \u201cI think he\u2019s handled the situation well. He\u2019s had a lot of things going on. Here\u2019s a guy coming off of a season-ending knee injury. Really, these are his first, essentially, 20-25 plays of live work back from it, and he\u2019s only going to get better.\u201d\n\nManziel\u2019s offseason behavior didn\u2019t help his cause. He was criticized for spending his weekends away from Cleveland\u2019s facility partying before training camp. Manziel has shown flashes of his Johnny Football form in practices, but he\u2019s still struggling with an offense that\u2019s much more complex than the one he ran at Texas A&M.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s certainly made great strides,\u201d Pettine said. \u201cWe are pleased with where he is, and he has shown that he has come a long way in his ability to pick up the playbook, be coachable and lead an offense. We are confident that Johnny is going to have a great future, but we just felt that Brian still had a decided edge on him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brian Hoyer gets Browns starting spot over rookie Johnny Manziel", "title": "Brian Hoyer gets Browns starting spot over rookie Johnny Manziel", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/20/brian-hoyer-gets-browns-starting-spot-over-rookie-johnny-manziel/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140820_082518_manziel-hoywer.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140820_082518_manziel-hoywer.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-20T08:24:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:22:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1935\"", "article_summary": "BEREA, Ohio \u2014 Brian Hoyer will open the season as Cleveland\u2019s starting quarterback, barely hanging on to his job by holding off hotshot rookie Johnny Manziel.\nIt\u2019s Hoyer\u2019s job for now, but the real test for him will be how long he keeps it from Manziel.\nBrowns coach Mike Pettine picked Hoyer over Manziel to start the Sept. 7 at Pittsburgh.\nHoyer didn\u2019t win the job over Manziel as much as he clung to it after beginning training camp as the No.\nWe are confident that Johnny is going to have a great future, but we just felt that Brian still had a decided edge on him.\u201d"}
