It\u2019s not something that\u2019s unusual in all construction or manufacturing.\u201d\n\nInvestigators don\u2019t know why the bolt fell \u2014 including whether opening the retractable roof caused the accident \u2014 and there is no estimate as to when the roof will be cleared to open.\n\nKlipsch said investigators discovered seven other loose bolts out of \u201cseveral dozen\u201d like the 7/8-inch bolt that fell during the first half of a Colts preseason game Sept. 3. The bolt, described as like a half-roll of quarters, caused only minor injuries, according to officials.\n\nBut Barney Levengood, executive director of the Capital Improvement Board, which operates the stadium, reiterated that the building is safe with the roof closed. Two high school games were scheduled for Friday night, with three more Saturday, plus the Colts\u2019 game Monday night.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making sure that people who do come understand that safety is first for us,\u201d Levengood said.\n\nThere are, however, lingering questions. Although Klipsch said problems with bolts are common in 7-year-old stadiums, he did not necessarily agree that officials should have inspected the roof for potential problems before the bolt fell.\n\n\u201cIt would be premature for me to guess whether we should or should not have been investigating bolts,\u201d Klipsch said. \u201cThere are lots of things on construction projects that are investigated and inspected while they\u2019re built. But you don\u2019t go back and look at them until they\u2019re broken. You don\u2019t go back and inspect a sidewalk every month to see if it has a crack in it. You notice there\u2019s a crack when you walk down it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain how much the retractable roof added to the cost of the $720 million stadium, at least $620 million of which came from taxpayers. In 2013, the St. Paul Pioneer-Press reported that the cost of a retractable roof for a stadium in Minneapolis would be $25 million to $40 million more than for a dome.\n\nKlipsch said he didn\u2019t know how much repairs would cost, but added \u201cwe\u2019re confident it\u2019s not a huge number. We\u2019re more focused on getting the project completed and making the building safe for our customers, and we\u2019re not going to let cost slow us down.\u201d\n\nKlipsch said the money for repairs could come from several sources, including insurance and reserves from the ISCBA and CIB. The CIB is funded almost completely by a variety of taxes.\n\n\u201cWhen we are sure the building is safe and it\u2019s operating properly and the costs come in, we will solve that problem,\u201d Klipsch said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to slow us down from making the building safe and operate properly.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more work to ensure we have a safe building. We can go up there and tighten up bolts. But we want to spend some time with (people who know) engineering science to be sure it\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\nContact Mark Alesia at (317) 444-6311 and follow him on Twitter: @markalesia.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1Kn7La9", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The person in charge of building Lucas Oil Stadium said a falling bolt that split into pieces, injuring three people, should not be considered an unusual problem for a 7-year-old stadium.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "The person in charge of building Lucas Oil Stadium said a falling bolt that split into pieces, injuring three people, should not be considered an unusual problem for a 7-year-old stadium.", "title": "Questions linger about Lucas Oil Stadium roof", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2015/09/19/questions-linger-lucas-oil-stadium-roof/72472278/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The person in charge of building Lucas Oil Stadium said a falling bolt that split into pieces, injuring three people, should not be considered an unusual problem for a 7-year-old stadium.", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9ae6299073aff7e6f5b4226eae229cf7f3034eb9/c=756-53-3615-2912&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/18/Indianapolis/B9318916127Z.1_20150918183344_000_G2QBVIM1U.1-0.jpg", "title": "Questions linger about Lucas Oil Stadium roof", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Indianapolis Colts", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Indianapolis Colts", "title": "Questions linger about Lucas Oil Stadium roof", "author": "Mark Alesia", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a78f98814492eea2e83bcf2f3abbe4d5612268d/c=1040-0-3184-2859/local/-/media/2015/09/18/Indianapolis/B9318916127Z.1_20150918183344_000_G2QBVIM1U.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e5face6a2714351083f65f8fc9deec32c166629/c=756-53-3615-2912/local/-/media/2015/09/18/Indianapolis/B9318916127Z.1_20150918183344_000_G2QBVIM1U.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a7177b4f62265fc608aba818db9292ea12281544/c=292-16-4144-2912/local/-/media/2015/09/18/Indianapolis/B9318916127Z.1_20150918183344_000_G2QBVIM1U.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/472fec3bfa93ee7af1d67eb7be792dd686417af2/c=0-148-4348-2605&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/09/18/Indianapolis/B9318916127Z.1_20150918183344_000_G2QBVIM1U.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-09-19T13:25:22.280000-04:00", "shorthed": "Questions linger about Lucas Oil Stadium roof", "articleid": 72472278, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/94c7c3263aa8db17e1a3076e2c2fbe079680d607/c=0-148-4348-2605/local/-/media/2015/09/18/Indianapolis/B9318916127Z.1_20150918183344_000_G2QBVIM1U.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/83a9e2cbfe8924dc28a02b7c7a759483c0c4e7fa/c=1265-3-2894-2912/local/-/media/2015/09/18/Indianapolis/B9318916127Z.1_20150918183344_000_G2QBVIM1U.1-0.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "lucas oil stadium, Indianapolis colts,"}, "article_summary": "Investigators don\u2019t know yet why a 7/8-inch bolt fell from the roof of 7-year-old Lucas Oil Stadium during an Indianapolis Colts preseason game Sept. 3, or whether opening the retractable roof caused the accident.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to slow us down from making the building safe and operate properly.\nYou notice there\u2019s a crack when you walk down it.\u201dIt\u2019s uncertain how much the retractable roof added to the cost of the $720 million stadium, at least $620 million of which came from taxpayers.\nBut Barney Levengood, executive director of the Capital Improvement Board, which operates the stadium, reiterated that the building is safe with the roof closed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge building,\u201d said John Klipsch, head of the Indiana Stadium and Convention Building Authority."}
