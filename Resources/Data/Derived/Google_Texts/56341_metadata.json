In adding the operational fixes, officials must first determine an estimated overall cost for the work, then how to squeeze it into the financially constrained plan.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some (surplus) money on the table (to address) any last-minute changes,\u201d said Srikanth Yamala, MPO director. \u201cI think we can come up with the money.\u201d\n\nThe Hall County area is expected to receive some $1.4 billion in revenues through 2040 from local, state and federal sources.\n\nThe estimated cost of projects in the plan can\u2019t exceed that amount. Another $2.42 billion in projects have been left off the list and have been dubbed as \u201caspirations.\u201d\n\nIdeally, officials would like to see Ga. 369 widened between McEver Road and Ga. 400 in Forsyth County, but that project appears unlikely any time soon.\n\nThe project has lost standing because Ga. 369\u2019s widening through Forsyth County, which falls in another MPO, the Atlanta Regional Commission, is not a priority.\n\nMatthew Fowler, a Georgia Department of Transportation assistant planning administrator, has said, \u201cWhen we widen a road, we have to have logical termini. We just can\u2019t stop it arbitrarily. The logical (stopping point) 40 years ago might have been the bridge at the lake, but nowadays, it has to go farther than that ... at least to Ga. 400.\u201d\n\nHowever, \u201cthe beauty of the federal (funding) process is it will look at what does that operational project do toward requiring other improvements,\u201d Fowler said Tuesday. \u201cIf it requires more lanes, then you have to go back and add more lanes.\u201d\n\nOfficials have said they expect the long-range plan to be updated by August.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/107783/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Straightening Ga. 369/Browns Bridge Road\u2019s curves may happen sooner than widening the busy West Hall road from two lanes to four, a project that\u2019s been kicked around for years by government officials.", "title": "Widening may be on back burner, but Browns Bridge Road could get other fixes"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Widening may be on back burner, but Browns Bridge Road could get other fixes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdec1\"", "article_summary": "Top area elected officials making up the Gainesville-Hall Metropolitan Planning Organization\u2019s decision-making policy committee voted Tuesday to add \u201coperational\u201d improvements to Browns Bridge Road, including straightening curves and adding turn lanes, to a long-range transportation plan that\u2019s under development.\nStraightening Ga. 369/Browns Bridge Road\u2019s curves may happen sooner than widening the busy West Hall road from two lanes to four, a project that\u2019s been kicked around for years by government officials.\nBefore the vote, the only improvement projects planned on the road were an $82 million widening from McEver Road to the Forsyth County line sometime between 2031 and 2040 and the 2015-2020 $16 million replacement of Browns Bridge at the Chattahoochee River.\nThe project has lost standing because Ga. 369\u2019s widening through Forsyth County, which falls in another MPO, the Atlanta Regional Commission, is not a priority.\nMatthew Fowler, a Georgia Department of Transportation assistant planning administrator, has said, \u201cWhen we widen a road, we have to have logical termini."}
