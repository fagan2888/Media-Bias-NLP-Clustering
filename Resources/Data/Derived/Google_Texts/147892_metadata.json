But in the past,health insurance premiums have increased virtually every year in the individual market.\n\nRepublican critics of the health law have predicted Obamacare rates would spike in 2015 as health plans try to make up for higher costs associated with mostly older and sicker people. But in the past,health insurance premiums have increased virtually every year in the individual market.\n\nFlorida Blue would not reveal its proposed 2015 rates, which were submitted to state regulators last month. State officials are expected to disclose the rates for the nearly dozen carriers in the marketplaceat the end of July. Open enrollment begins Nov. 15 and goes through Feb. 15.\n\nTo date, only two insurers have disclosed their 2015 rate proposals. Humana proposed an average 14.1 percent increase in two separate filings for its health maintenance organizations (HMOs), while its preferred provider organizations (PPO) have a 2.2 percent average rate increase. Molina has proposed an 11.6 percent average rate decrease for all its plans.\n\nFlorida Blue has been one of the nation\u2019s most fiscally stable health insurers. In 2012, the latest year for which data is available, Florida Blue achieved its 24th consecutive profitable year, as the company made $217 million net income on about $9 billion in revenue. It has about 4 million customers in Florida across all lines of health insurance.\n\nAbout 23 percent of those who bought exchange policies from Florida Blue this year were in the 18-to-34 age category, Geraghty said. That compares to 28 percent nationally. Initial federal projections were that 40 percent of enrollees nationally would be young adults.\n\nGeraghty said he knew the percentage of young adults signing up in Florida would be lower than the national average because of the state\u2019s older population. Still, 23 percent was lower than the company projected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a concern certainly, as any market would want lower-age healthier individuals \u2026 because it balances the risk pool,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was also harder to sign up younger adults in Florida, he said, because they faced higher rates under the law\u2019s requirement that the oldest person buying coverage pay no more than three times the rate paid by the youngest enrollee.\n\nAnother factor that could lead to higher premiums in 2015 is that demand for expensive health services exceeded the insurer\u2019s expectations, Geraghty said.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s decision earlier this year to allow people to stay in so-called \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans until October 2016 also added financial pressure, he said.\n\nAbout 300,000 Florida Blue customers were given that option and 90 percent kept the grandfathered plans, Geraghty said. Because they are healthier as a group than the broader market, the company underpriced its marketplace plans, he said.\n\nDespite these challenges, Geraghty said he was generally pleased with the results of the exchange\u2019s first year of enrollment. The company had about 50 percent of the individual state insurance market in 2014, and today has about a 40 percent share, including people buying on and off the exchange. While losing some market share, the company gained many new members.\n\nSabrina Corlette, senior research fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, said Florida Blue\u2019s assessment of its 2014 projection errors is telling. \u201cThey may be trying to prepare the public and the market for an increase in prices,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she was not surprised the insurer was below the national average for young adult enrollment, given the state\u2019s demographics. She said the company also may have struggled to get younger adults because the Blue Cross and Blue Shield brand tends to attract older people who trust it.\n\nGeraghty said he believes the law is here to stay.\n\n\u201cWith many people benefiting from new coverage and subsidies, it will be difficult to reverse the tide,\u201d he said. \u201cThe better path going forward is working on \u2026 how to improve the ACA so it works best for the largest number of our citizens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several factors could drive up rates next year \u2014 including a paucity of younger and healthy enrollees and a greater-than-expected surge in people seeking expensive health services, CEO Patrick Geraghty said in an interview.", "pubdate": 20140721, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Several factors could drive up rates next year \u2014 including a paucity of younger and healthy enrollees and a greater-than-expected surge in people seeking expensive health services, CEO Patrick Geraghty said in an interview.", "title": "Older, sicker enrollees will likely drive up rates at Florida's biggest health insurer", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/469197183.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/older-sicker-enrollees-drive-rates-floridas-biggest-health-insurer/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Several factors could drive up rates next year \u2014 including a paucity of younger and healthy enrollees and a greater-than-expected surge in people seeking expensive health services, CEO Patrick Geraghty said in an interview.", "creator": "@newshour", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/469197183.jpg", "title": "Older, sicker enrollees will likely drive up rates at Florida's biggest health insurer", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "kaiser health news"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "ACA, Barack Obama, florida, health care, kaiser health news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ba0\"", "article_summary": "Republican critics of the health law have predicted Obamacare rates would spike in 2015 as health plans try to make up for higher costs associated with mostly older and sicker people.\nAbout 300,000 Florida Blue customers were given that option and 90 percent kept the grandfathered plans, Geraghty said.\nFlorida Blue would not reveal its proposed 2015 rates, which were submitted to state regulators last month.\nAbout 23 percent of those who bought exchange policies from Florida Blue this year were in the 18-to-34 age category, Geraghty said.\nFlorida Blue has been one of the nation\u2019s most fiscally stable health insurers."}
