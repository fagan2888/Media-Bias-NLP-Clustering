This year he focused on the country\u2019s youngest children and their families\u2019 need for high-quality child care.\n\nThe President announced a plan that would triple the maximum child care and dependent tax credit to up to $3,000 per child for middle-class families with a household income of up to $120,000. This tax credit increase could be beneficial for many parents struggling to afford the cost of child care, which often tops the cost of public university tuition. (This is not that surprising, though, due to the small staff-to-child ratios needed and special attention required for caring for infants.) The President explained the need in last Tuesday\u2019s address stating, \u201cIn today\u2019s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high quality childcare more than ever.\u201d He also highlighted a point in our nation\u2019s history, between 1943 and 1946, where child care was universal, facilitating the growth of a robust economy.\n\nBut increasing the child care tax credit alone does nothing to improve families\u2019 access to \u201chigh-quality\u201d care. One possible way to help address this could be to tie the receipt of the tax credit to the quality of the center. In other words, to be eligible for the credit, families could be required to enroll their child in a child care facility that is rated as a high quality center by their state\u2019s quality rating and improvement system or at the very least be licensed by the state.\n\nBut the child care tax credit isn\u2019t all the President proposed. Last Wednesday, during his speech at the University of Kansas, he continued his call to address the needs of working families, stating that doing so is essential to growing the economy. The President announced two additional pieces of his three-part comprehensive child care plan with the goal of increasing the availability of affordable, high-quality child care. He would also significantly expand the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), a child care subsidy for low- and moderate-income families authorized under the Child Care Block Development Grant (CCDBG) Act. (CCDBG was reauthorized last year after 18 years.) By 2025, the proposed expansion would increase the reach of CCDF to an additional one million children, under four-years-old. Not only would this expansion aim to make child care more accessible, but it would also attempt to help raise the quality of care by requiring states to submit \u201csound\u201d plans for ensuring the quality of providers.\n\nIn Beyond Subprime Learning, we call for using the Pell Grant model to increase child care access. The President\u2019s proposal has the similar goal of increasing the federal investment to help ensure more low-and-moderate income families with infants and toddlers have a subsidy to help them afford child care.\n\nNot all child care provides high quality settings for children to learn and develop. In fact, many do not provide stimulating environments. So while it is absolutely true that working families need affordable child care options, they also need peace of mind that wherever they choose to leave their child is at the very least a safe and nurturing place. The newly reauthorized CCDBG does take important steps in this direction, but it\u2019s still a long way from \u201chigh quality\u201d for all children from low-income families.\n\nThe last part of the President\u2019s proposal, in typical Obama Administration-style, is a competitive grant that would promote innovation in the child care system. The proposed grants\u2013 totaling $100 million\u2013 would allow states to create pilot programs to determine the best ways to provide child care to vulnerable populations, including children with disabilities, parents who work non-traditional hours, and families who have difficulty finding high-quality child care. This, again, is sorely needed, but using the term \u201chigh-quality\u201d isn\u2019t enough. Investment at both the state and federal level is needed to help improve child care centers and the quality and capacity of the early education and care workforce.\n\nThe President\u2019s three-pronged child care proposal is one component of the Administration\u2019s broader early education agenda, which also includes:\n\nAddressing the rising cost of child care as an economic priority is politically expedient for both parties. Bipartisan support for child care was realized through the reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant in late 2014. Child care should continue to receive attention from both sides of the aisle as presidential hopefuls scramble to address the nation\u2019s growing income disparities and middle class economic burdens. And the child care tax credit is perhaps one of the only Presidential proposals the Republican-controlled Congress may consider. As always, the proof is in the pudding: we\u2019ll have to wait and see whether President Obama and Congress come to any consensus on their budget proposals.
