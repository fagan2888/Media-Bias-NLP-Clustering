But thanks to the health law, she expects that bill will be cut by more than half in January. Petersen is 57, and her husband, Mike, is 60. They have some pre-existing conditions. He has diabetes. She has a back injury. The HMO policy they\u2019ve carried since 1992 has risen over the years to $1,950 per month, just for the two of them. \u201cWhen you pay $1,950 for insurance you might as well forget retirement,\u201d says Petersen says. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way.\u201d Five years ago, she was planning on an early retirement, but she didn\u2019t anticipate health insurance costing as much as the rest of her bills combined. At the beginning of October she checked out Colorado\u2019s insurance exchange and found the exact same policy from the same insurer for only $832 a month. \u201cIt\u2019s dropping us down about $1,100 a month. We can retire. We can go fishing. We can actually see a future,\u201d says Petersen. Becoming part of an insurance pool helped Petersen reduce her cost. The federal law also forbids insurance companies from charging more for pre-existing conditions. That saved her a lot. And federal tax credits brought the cost down even further.\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure the Petersens have worked very hard throughout their lives and deserve a comfortable retirement, but let\u2019s examine what this story actually represents: Two people who can easily obtain insurance on the individual market, despite their preexisting conditions, have to pay a lot for the health care they consume, but an amount they can afford at their income levels \u2013 but not at their expected level of retirement income. Because Obamacare provides direct subsidies from the federal fisc, and indirect subsidies from the higher premiums paid by younger people and healthier people, their rates have dropped low enough that they can now close their small business and live off of their retirement savings \u2014 at the expense of others.\n\nLots of decisions we all make involve implicit tax subsidies and social costs. But early retirement, needless to say, doesn\u2019t really have much to do with the stated intent of Obamacare \u2014 expanding insurance to people who can\u2019t get it or can\u2019t afford it. The NPR story acknowledges that this is a rather odd side benefit of the law, and notes that we don\u2019t know just how widespread it will be yet: 53 percent of employees in one survey of American workers in 2012 said they stay in their jobs for more years than they want to ensure access to affordable health insurance. These are many people\u2019s highest-saving, highest-earning, and most productive years; enabling them to draw down their savings rather than work hampers economic growth. In a post-industrial society, is there any reason to provide a subsidy for retirement at age 59? Most Americans would presumably agree there is not, which is why almost no one is suggesting we lower the starting age for federal retirement programs. But that\u2019s in effect what Obamacare\u2019s elaborate system has accomplished \u2014 while also providing implicit subsidies to people who happen to have health-care problems, some of which, like diabetes, are influenced by their personal choices.\n\nObamacare\u2019s incentive for early retirement is just one aspect of an issue of great importance for the law overall: Does access to public health insurance cause people to drop out of the labor force? There\u2019s been some rigorous study of this question at the low end \u2014 providing free insurance to low-income households \u2014 but the evidence is inconclusive. Examinations of two great natural experiments \u2014 Oregon\u2019s random expansion of its Medicaid program and Tennessee\u2019s forced contraction of its program \u2014 came to opposite conclusions. In Tennessee, enough people joined the labor force after they lost access to a form of Medicaid that the study\u2019s authors think the ACA\u2019s national expansion of free and heavily subsidized insurance could cause almost 1 million people to leave the workforce. But in Oregon, a study didn\u2019t find reliable evidence that expanding Medicaid had an impact on employment or earnings. Now, cold economic logic would suggest that the Tennessee example is what we\u2019d expect generally \u2014 publicly available insurance reduces the incentive to work, so marginal workers should drop out of the workforce; but there are good empirical data going both ways.\n\nThe phenomenon that causes people to go to work for a reason like having access to health insurance is called \u201clabor lock\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s not an unalloyed good thing. It\u2019s good to have people participating in the workforce \u2014 both for them and for the economy (most of the time) \u2014 but if it means they won\u2019t leave a job with health insurance to start their own firm or to take a job that may suit them better that lacks it, then it\u2019s a bad thing. (Of course, the ACA, by setting minimum coverage requirements, killing catastrophic plans for most, raising premiums, etc., will make it harder for some people to find insurance in those latter two situations.) But when the question, which is going to be raised by Obamacare\u2019s generous implicit and explicit subsidies to middle-income people in their 50s and 60s, is between staying in the workforce or retiring, it\u2019s almost definitely not good to encourage them to leave.
