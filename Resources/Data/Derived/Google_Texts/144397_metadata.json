So I decided to try my hand at mini-versions, because we seem more inclined to go back for seconds (and thirds, and fourths) when the item is smaller. And l get offended at leftovers.\n\nThese mini frittatas \u2014 or crustless quiches \u2014 are satisfying for lunch, dinner or pre-curser to a large meal. With frittatas, you can add anything in and they\u2019d be delicious. I paired goat cheese with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes, saut\u00e9ing the spinach with some garlic first to enhance the umami of the dish. Simple ingredients that don\u2019t require much preparation.\n\nDisclaimer: I made 12 of these with the recipe provided below, but after careful consideration, I think you can make 24 by filling the muffin tins half full instead of two-thirds. Either way, you\u2019re going to end up with something deliciously satisfying.\n\nSun-dried Tomato, Spinach and Goat Cheese Mini Frittatas\n\nMakes 12\n\nGather These Up\n\n8 eggs\n\n1 cup of milk\n\n12 oz spinach\n\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n\n1 Tbsp. EVOO\n\n3 Tbsp. sun-dried tomatoes, chopped\n\n3 oz goat cheese, divided\n\nBaking spray, such as Pam\n\nSalt and pepper, to taste\n\nWhisk Them Together\n\nHeat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a muffin tin generously with the baking spray of your choice. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Season generously with salt and pepper. Divide the mixture evenly among the muffin tin cups. In a large skillet, heat a heavy-bottomed pan over medium hear with the olive oil. Add the chopped garlic and cook for three minutes. Add the spinach and toss, cooking until wilted \u2014 about 6 minutes. Drain the spinach once it\u2019s wilted, squeezing out any excess moisture. Divide the cooked spinach among the egg-filled muffin tin. You may have some leftover, which I encourage to snack on while these guys bake. Divide the chopped sun-dried tomatoes evenly among the cups. Divide the goat cheese in big crumbles among the cups. Bake at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before cutting around the edges to help release the frittatas. Serve, savor, sigh.\n\nTips and Variations", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://sandiegofreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/sdfpfbav.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Sun-dried Tomato, Spinach and Goat Cheese Mini FrittatasMakes 12Gather These Up8 eggs1 cup of milk12 oz spinach2 cloves garlic, minced1 Tbsp.\nI paired goat cheese with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes, saut\u00e9ing the spinach with some garlic first to enhance the umami of the dish.\nsun-dried tomatoes, chopped3 oz goat cheese, dividedBaking spray, such as PamSalt and pepper, to tasteWhisk Them TogetherHeat the oven to 350 degrees.\nDivide the goat cheese in big crumbles among the cups.\nSpray a muffin tin generously with the baking spray of your choice."}
