(AP) - The buzz in U.S. Olympic circles is about bringing the 2024 Games to Los Angeles.\n\nA more urgent matter: Bringing home the most medals from next year\u2019s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThat may not be a sure thing, especially considering the struggles of the U.S. swimming and track teams this summer.\n\nTrack and swimming combined for 53 percent of the country\u2019s 407 medals over the last four Olympics, each of which ended with the United States on top of the medals table. But at this year\u2019s world championships, swimmers took home 21 medals in Olympic events. That\u2019s four fewer than they did in 2011, the year before the London Games. The track team took home only 18, seven fewer than four years ago.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a level of anxiety,\u201d said Chuck Wielgus, the executive director of USA Swimming since 1997. \u201cI\u2019d say the level of anxiety is probably higher this time around than any time I\u2019ve been executive director. But there have never been more opportunities for people to step up and make an impact on the Olympic team.\u201d\n\nThere are reasons for optimism, starting with the fact that the United States traditionally brings the deepest pool of athletes to the Olympics in both these sports. Also, the swimming results came without the presence of 22-time Olympic medalist Michael Phelps, who was banned from worlds because of his arrest on drunken-driving charges. He competed the same week at U.S. nationals and posted three times that would have won gold at worlds.\n\nBut there were also some red flags waving at the meets in Russia (swimming) and China (track).\n\nMissy Franklin didn\u2019t win any individual gold medals at worlds, after taking three in 2013. It could be attributed to the grind of her recently completed college season, though she now has more competition in the 200 free with teammate Katie Ledecky, the star of the world championships, dropping down to that distance. Also, relay races that used to almost automatically go in the U.S. win column are now being more hotly contested by countries putting more resources into winning the team events.\n\nLarry Probst, the chairman of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said the board talked about the results at their quarterly meeting Friday.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it blaring alarm bells, but both organizations had higher expectations going into worlds,\u201d Probst said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s aware that there\u2019s work to be done between now and Rio. Everyone knows we have to improve results when we get to the Olympic Games in Rio.\u201d\n\nAt the track meet in Beijing, the United States led the medal count but brought home the lowest total since 2003, when it won 20. That number was reduced to 16 after a number of doping cases were resolved.\n\n\u201cNone of us are overjoyed with the performance we had at world championships,\u201d said USA Track and Field CEO Max Siegel.\n\nKenya and Jamaica - both powerhouses in their specific niches but nowhere near as deep as the U.S. - each won one more gold than the United States and finished only two shy of America\u2019s overall total. The U.S. had a few pleasant surprises at the Bird\u2019s Nest - Tianna Bartoletta\u2019s gold in long jump, for instance. But they were offset by a number of flame-outs, including in the men\u2019s 4x100 relay, where the long-time problem of passing the baton came up again and cost them a medal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stripping it all apart and looking at it, event by event,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the talent pool, ways to support the athletes more, ways to get prepared better for Rio.\u201d\n\nIn other sports, there have been some improvements that could help the medal count.\n\nThe U.S. wrestling team took home seven medals from worlds on home turf in Las Vegas - three more than at the 2011 worlds. The United States took home a surprise bronze medal in sprint canoeing (Michal Smolen) and has medal contenders in triathlon, starting with world champion Gwen Jorgensen.\n\nStill, over the last few Olympics cycles, the USOC has shifted some focus and money away from development and into sports and athletes who can deliver medals when the world is watching at the Olympics. Swimming and track are at the top of that list because of both the sheer number of medals available and the talent of the U.S. athletes.\n\nWill that strategy pay off?\n\nOnly if next year\u2019s numbers are better.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The buzz in U.S. Olympic circles is about bringing the 2024 Games to Los Angeles.", "Author": "EDDIE PELLS", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The buzz in U.S. Olympic circles is about bringing the 2024 Games to Los Angeles.", "title": "With Olympics coming, US swimming and track look for rebound", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/26/with-olympics-coming-us-swimming-and-track-look-fo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/fcec2e1b4b54142b830f6a706700f48f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/fcec2e1b4b54142b830f6a706700f48f.jpg", "title": "With Olympics coming, US swimming and track look for rebound", "description": "The buzz in U.S. Olympic circles is about bringing the 2024 Games to Los Angeles.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "That may not be a sure thing, especially considering the struggles of the U.S. swimming and track teams this summer.\nTrack and swimming combined for 53 percent of the country\u2019s 407 medals over the last four Olympics, each of which ended with the United States on top of the medals table.\nBut there were also some red flags waving at the meets in Russia (swimming) and China (track).\nSwimming and track are at the top of that list because of both the sheer number of medals available and the talent of the U.S. athletes.\nThe United States took home a surprise bronze medal in sprint canoeing (Michal Smolen) and has medal contenders in triathlon, starting with world champion Gwen Jorgensen."}
