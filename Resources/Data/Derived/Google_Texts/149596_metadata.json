And in the same context if you want to use it, yes, we are at war with ISIL in that sense. But I think it\u2019s a waste of time to focus on that. Frankly, let\u2019s consider what we have to do to degrade and defeat ISIL \u2014 and that\u2019s what I\u2019m frankly much more focused on.\n\nThe remarks by Kerry and McDonough came hours after ISIS released a video depicting the beheading of David Haines, 44, a British humanitarian aid worker who had been captured in Syria last year. In the video, his killer mocks both Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nHaines, who grew up in Scotland and married twice, had two daughters \u2014 one a teen-ager, the other 4. His family released a statement through a brother, Mike Haines, who summarized his sibling\u2019s life\u2019s work this way:\n\nDavid was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles. His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair.\n\nKerry told host Bob Schieffer that the Obama administration still isn\u2019t considering putting combat troops on the ground in Iraq or Syria.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of mobilization,\u201d he said.\n\nOn \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d McDonough, who previously served on the National Security Council, also addressed how the administration defines \u201csuccess\u201d in the mission against ISIS. He told host Chuck Todd:\n\nSuccess looks like an ISIL that no longer threatens our friends in the region, no longer threatens the United States. An ISIL that can\u2019t accumulate followers, or threaten Muslims in Syria, Iran, Iraq, or otherwise. And that\u2019s exactly what success looks like.\n\nSteven Bucci, who directs defense and foreign policy studies at The Heritage Foundation, was critical of administration attempts to downplay what is at stake.\n\n\u201cThis is war, and it may prove to be a bitter one.\u201d- @Heritage\u2019s @SBucci says of ISIS.\n\n\u201cEven considering the subsequent reversals, Kerry\u2019s statements are a purer indicator of the Obama team\u2019s heart, or lack of it, for this action,\u201d Bucci said, adding:\n\nNo one can condemn the righteousness of striking back at the evil that ISIS has shown itself to be, but the administration still insists on trying to minimize the entire enterprise. This is war, and it may prove to be a bitter one. Obama, and all of America, needs to realize and acknowledge that.\n\nHaines\u2019s videotaped murder by ISIS follows those of American journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley within the past four weeks.\n\nCameron called the on-camera slaying of Haines \u201can act of pure evil,\u201d adding in a statement that \u201cit must strengthen our resolve\u201d to fight the brutal terrorist network.\n\nThe murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude. \u2014 David Cameron (@David_Cameron) September 13, 2014\n\nWe will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes. \u2014 David Cameron (@David_Cameron) September 13, 2014\n\nPresident Obama referred to Haines\u2019s murder as \u201cbarbaric\u201d in a statement last night in which he pledged:\n\nWe will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.\n\nUltimately, McDonough said this morning, the U.S. will need the help of Congress and the nation\u2019s \u201ccommitted partners\u201d to \u201cdefeat and ultimately destroy\u201d ISIS.\n\nAlso appearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the administration is \u201cdelusional\u201d if it thinks it can crush \u201ca radical Islamic army\u201d without a major commitment of U.S. forces.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re intending to come here,\u201d Graham said, and Obama must \u201crise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a video surfaces showing the murder of a third Westerner by ISIS, Obama's chief of staff says America \u201cobviously\u201d is at war with the terrorists.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "After a video surfaces showing the murder of a third Westerner by ISIS, Obama's chief of staff says America \u201cobviously\u201d is at war with the terrorists.", "title": "'Obviously,' Obama Aide Says, America Is at War With ISIS", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/davidhaines.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-14T19:02:07+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1m3ZFuF"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "After a video surfaces showing the murder of a third Westerner by ISIS, Obama's chief of staff says America \u201cobviously\u201d is at war with the terrorists.", "title": "'Obviously,' Obama Aide Says, America Is at War With ISIS", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/davidhaines.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2014-09-14T14:23:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-14T19:02:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "isis beheading, david haines, ISIL beheading, Denis McDonough, David Haines, John Kerry, terrorism, fox news sunday, meet the press"}, "article_summary": "Kerry told host Bob Schieffer that the Obama administration still isn\u2019t considering putting combat troops on the ground in Iraq or Syria.\nKerry said:In terms of al-Qaeda, which we have used the word \u2018war\u2019 with, yeah\u2026we are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates.\nAnd in the same context if you want to use it, yes, we are at war with ISIL in that sense.\nAfter a video showing the murder of a third Westerner by the terrorist group ISIS hit the Internet last night, a top Obama administration official said this morning that America is \u201cobviously\u201d at war with the Islamist jihadists in Iraq and Syria.\nHaines\u2019s videotaped murder by ISIS follows those of American journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley within the past four weeks."}
