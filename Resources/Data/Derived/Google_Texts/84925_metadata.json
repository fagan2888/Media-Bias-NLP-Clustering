To make room on the 25-man roster, the Rockies optioned lefty starter Christian Friedrich to Triple-A Colorado Springs.\n\n* Left fielder Carlos Gonzalez felt only mild discomfort in his left hand during batting practice in the cage Thursday, and said he thinks he can be back in the Rockies\u2019 lineup before the all-star break.\n\n\u201cI think I can come back by then, and if not by then, then definitely I\u2019ll be ready after the all-star break,\u201d\n\nThe most realistic scenario would have CarGo take regular batting practice on Friday, then face live pitching this weekend. He would then go on a minor-league rehab assignment, and if all goes well he could be back for the Minnesota Twins series at Coors Field beginning a week from Friday.\n\nCarGo said that his long time on the disabled list has also helped ease the nagging tendinitis in his left knee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting treatment every day and running,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels good.\u201d\n\n* Expect lefty reliever Boone Logan to be back in the Rockies\u2019 bullpen on Friday night.\n\nAfter making his fourth rehab start for Triple-A Colorado Springs \u2014 a scoreless ninth inning with one strikeout on Wednesday \u2014 he\u2019s confident he\u2019s ready. He was not in the bullpen Friday because he had pitched back-to-back days.\n\nHe\u2019s been on the DL since June 5 because of left elbow inflammation, but said the time away did him good.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t felt this good in a really, really long time,\u201d Logan said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it holds up.\u201d\n\n* Right-hander Jhoulys Chacin could know by Friday whether of not he\u2019ll need surgery to repair his shoulder.\n\nThe Rockies announced Wednesday that an MRI conducted Monday that he has a right-rotator cuff strain and some fraying in his labrum. The injury is more serious now than it was when he was shut down during spring training.\n\n\u201cThese past two weeks have been pretty bad for me with my arm,\u201d Chacin said. \u201cSurgery is very possible.\u201d\n\nChacin said his shoulder never felt right this season.\n\n\u201cIt got a little better for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cI could throw the ball better, but then it got worse and worse. I couldn\u2019t throw hard, I couldn\u2019t finish my pitchers. It was tough when I tried to throw sliders of throw with sink.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Boone Logan,Jhoulys Chacin,Nolan Arenado", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Carlos Gonzalez</strong> felt only mild discomfort in his left hand during batting practice in the cage Thursday, and said he thinks he can be back in the Rockies' lineup before the all-star break.", "title": "Rockies Carlos Gonzalez hopes to be back before all-star break", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/07/03/rockies-carlos-gonzalez-hopes-back-star-break/18073/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Carlos Gonzalez</strong> felt only mild discomfort in his left hand during batting practice in the cage Thursday, and said he thinks he can be back in the Rockies' lineup before the all-star break.", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/07/03/rockies-carlos-gonzalez-hopes-back-star-break/18073/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Carlos Gonzalez hopes to be back before all-star break", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rockies outfield Carlos Gonzalez felt only mild discomfort in his left hand during batting practice and hopes he can return lineup before the All-Star Game."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebbf\"", "article_summary": "* Left fielder Carlos Gonzalez felt only mild discomfort in his left hand during batting practice in the cage Thursday, and said he thinks he can be back in the Rockies\u2019 lineup before the all-star break.\nTo make room on the 25-man roster, the Rockies optioned lefty starter Christian Friedrich to Triple-A Colorado Springs.\nA long laundry list of Rockies details on the Independence Day Eve:* Nolan Arenado is back in the Rockies\u2019 starting lineup for Friday\u2019s game vs. the Dodgers.\n\u201cIt feels good.\u201d* Expect lefty reliever Boone Logan to be back in the Rockies\u2019 bullpen on Friday night.\n\u201cI could throw the ball better, but then it got worse and worse."}
