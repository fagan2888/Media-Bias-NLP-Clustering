CC By 2.0\n\nOklahoma\u2019s attorney general says he\u2019s disappointed the state cannot immediately execute two death row inmates as European suppliers now refuse to sell drugs for the lethal injection.\n\nThe Oklahoma Court of Appeals ruled on Tuesday to delay two executions set for this month after finding the state would not be able to procure drugs for the lethal injections. Attorney General Scott Pruitt\u2019s \u201cattestations give this court no confidence that the state will be able to procure the necessary drugs before the scheduled executions are carried out,\u201d the court ruled.\n\nHowever, Pruitt said on Tuesday the state would eventually execute inmates Clayton Lockett and Charles Warner, whose deaths were set for April 22 and April 29, respectively.\n\n\"This delay is not about the facts of the case, nor does it seek to overturn the convictions of these two murderers. Instead, it's about outside forces employing threats, intimidation and coercion to keep the state of Oklahoma from imposing the punishment handed down for these heinous crimes,\" Pruitt said. \"It's not a matter of if these punishments will be carried out, but it is only a matter of when.\"\n\nLockett and Warner had both sued the state for a stay of execution, which the court found moot given the state\u2019s inability to procure the required drugs. \u201cWe were hoping for a stay until the district court can rule, but this effectively gives us that,\u201d Seth Day, a lawyer for the inmates, told the AP. \u201cThe district court will render their ruling before those dates.\u201d\n\nThe condemned prisoners hope to win reprieve from execution by arguing the drugs used in the lethal injections may be contaminated by unhealthful toxins, a violation of the constitution\u2019s protection against cruel and unusual punishment. Locket was initially scheduled to die on Thursday after a 1999 conviction in the shooting death of a 19-year-old woman. Warner was scheduled to die a week later for a 1997 conviction in the rape and murder of his girlfriend\u2019s 11-month-old daughter.\n\nNext week, Oklahoma County District Court will determine whether state executions should remain behind a \u201cveil of secrecy.\u201d\n\nPruitt says Oklahoma is searching worldwide to replenish supplies of the sedative pentobarbital and the muscle relaxant vecuronium bromide, which are used in conjunction with potassium chloride, which stops the heart. Although the death penalty is legal in 32 states, only Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, Ohio, and Arizona regularly execute prisoners.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "oklahoma death row, oklahoma executions, oklahoma and the death penalty, oklahoma stay of executions, oklahoma executions delayed", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Oklahoma has been forced to delay two executions of death row inmates as the state searches worldwide for suppliers of the drugs used in the lethal injection cocktail.", "title": "Oklahoma Delays 2 Executions With Lethal Injection Drugs In Short Supply", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/oklahoma-executions-delayed-european-lethal-injection-drug-suppliers-refuse-sell-us-prisons-271568", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/19/oklahoma-executions-delayed-state-searches-lethal-injection-drugs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Oklahoma has been forced to delay two executions of death row inmates as the state searches worldwide for suppliers of the drugs used in the lethal injection cocktail.", "title": "Oklahoma Delays 2 Executions With Lethal Injection Drugs In Short Supply", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/oklahoma-executions-delayed-european-lethal-injection-drug-suppliers-refuse-sell-us-prisons-271568", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/19/oklahoma-executions-delayed-state-searches-lethal-injection-drugs.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/19/oklahoma-executions-delayed-state-searches-lethal-injection-drugs.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-03-19T10:43:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-19T10:43:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Oklahoma has been forced to delay two executions of death row inmates as the state searches worldwide for suppliers of the drugs used in the lethal injection cocktail."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0ab\"", "article_summary": "The refusal of European drugmakers to supply the U.S. prison system with drugs for lethal injection has delayed two executions in Oklahoma.\nCC By 2.0Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general says he\u2019s disappointed the state cannot immediately execute two death row inmates as European suppliers now refuse to sell drugs for the lethal injection.\nThe Oklahoma Court of Appeals ruled on Tuesday to delay two executions set for this month after finding the state would not be able to procure drugs for the lethal injections.\nAlthough the death penalty is legal in 32 states, only Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, Ohio, and Arizona regularly execute prisoners.\nWarner was scheduled to die a week later for a 1997 conviction in the rape and murder of his girlfriend\u2019s 11-month-old daughter."}
