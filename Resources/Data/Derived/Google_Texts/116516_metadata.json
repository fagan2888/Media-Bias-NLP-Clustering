Republicans believe the health law will soon bring about the apocalypse. Democrats, on the other hand, think the law will bring peace to the earth and begin a utopian state of peace and tranquility for all.\n\nFor right now, though, the law \u2014 represented by the online marketplaces set up by governments across the land \u2014 is pretty terrible. Well, at least that\u2019s what a whole bunch of pundits and news outlets are saying.\n\nSure, the exchanges, powered by a central operated by the federal government, might make purchasing health insurance easier someday, but first they have to, you know, work.
