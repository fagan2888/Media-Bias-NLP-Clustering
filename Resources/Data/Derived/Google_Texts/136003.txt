WASHINGTON (AP) — Few relationships in Washington are as complex as that of president and vice president.

It’s a partnership forged out of political necessity — and one often defined by rivalry and competing self-interests.

And that’s no different for President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, who’ve had some trying times since taking office in 2009.

But the recent death of Biden’s son, Beau, has magnified a striking personal bond between Obama and Joe Biden — men from different generations and backgrounds.

Biden asked Obama to deliver the eulogy at his son’s funeral Saturday. Obama’s voice cracked throughout his remarks, a rare public display of emotion for a president with a typically cool demeanor.

Biden, on the other hand, can often overflow with emotion at even mundane White House events.
