Bernie Sanders in a manner that seemed intended to undermine his presidential campaign.\n\nMargaret Sullivan serves as the public editor for the Times. Her role, which is deliberately divorced from the paper\u2019s normal reporting and editorial functions, is to serve as an in-house critic and watchdog who answers questions from readers about the Times\u2019 coverage.\n\nSullivan gave her own paper a rather thorough dressing-down Thursday for its handling of an article published late Monday about Sanders\u2019 Senate career.\n\nThe original version of the story, titled \u201cBernie Sanders Scored Victories for Years via Legislative Side Doors,\u201d was quite favorable to Sanders, highlighting various ways he scored achievements in the Senate despite being a political independent on the ideological fringe.\n\nA few hours after the piece went live, editors began tweaking the article, without the Times giving any notice it was doing so. The title was changed to \u201cVia Legislative Side Doors, Bernie Sanders Won Modest Victories,\u201d which toned down the the strong positive vibe of the initial headline. The story also had two new paragraphs inserted, which seemed solely intended to denigrate Sanders\u2019 current presidential campaign:\n\nBut in his presidential campaign Mr. Sanders is trying to scale up those kinds of proposals as a national agenda, and there is little to draw from his small-ball legislative approach to suggest that he could succeed. Mr. Sanders is suddenly promising not just a few stars here and there, but the moon and a good part of the sun, from free college tuition paid for with giant tax hikes to a huge increase in government health care, which has made even liberal Democrats skeptical.\n\nThe changes were quickly noticed and criticized online, and they fueled accusations the Times was doing the bidding of the Clinton campaign, which the paper endorsed for the Democratic nomination in late January.\n\nTimes editors have defended themselves by claiming the edits were of a routine nature and simply served to add a little more context to the story, but Sullivan doesn\u2019t buy it.\n\n\u201cThe changes to this story were so substantive that a reader who saw the piece when it first went up might come away with a very different sense of Mr. Sanders\u2019s legislative accomplishments than one who saw it hours later,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven the level of revision, transparency with the readers required that they be given some kind of heads-up, and even an explanation.\u201d\n\nSanders disputed the Times\u2019 claims that it was just adding context to the article, saying the added paragraphs sounded more like \u201cplain-old opinion\u201d to her and many other readers.\n\nSullivan also noted that the Times\u2019 edits were particularly egregious because they weren\u2019t made to a breaking news story, but instead to a story that should have had ample time to be vetted beforehand.\n\n\u201cGiven its sensitivity and importance (it ended up on the front page on the morning of major primaries), why didn\u2019t senior editors vet the story and make all the editing changes before it went online?,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cDigital platforms, after all, are not a test run, and non-urgent stories don\u2019t need to be pushed out as quickly as this one apparently was.\u201d\n\nSullivan faulted the Times for rarely using editor\u2019s notes to explain story updates and alterations, and argued the paper should consider adopting a new system that would encourage their use.\n\nFollow Blake on Twitter\n\nSend tips to blake@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.\n\nClick here for reuse options!
