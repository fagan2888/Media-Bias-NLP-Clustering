"Guess what? @David Burtka and I got married over the weekend. In Italy. Yup we put the 'n' and 'd' in husband," Harris tweeted on Monday.

Fans immediately responded to Harris' tweet with congratulatory comments and support for the newlywed couple.

Last month, Harris put an end to the rumors claiming that he and Burtka's relationship was on the rocks.

The National Enquirer was the first to report that Harris had allegedly "walked out" on Burtka and the two had been living in separate homes.

"HARRIS has walked out on his longtime lover David Burtka and the two have been living apart amid claims both were seen flirting with younger guys," The NE article reads.

Despite the infidelity and separation claims, Harris took to Instagram to deny the rumors.

"I couldn't be more in love with my family. Any reports to be contrary are woefully mistaken. #grateful," he captioned a photo of Burtka and their children Gideon and Harper.

During an interview with Glamour last month, the Tony award winner explained how having children allowed him to see his then fianc√© in a different light.

"Having kids was one of those great moments for me. Watching David become another level of person, mastering this other domain, made me look at him with a whole other set of appreciative eyes. That sort of made me re-fall in love with him."
