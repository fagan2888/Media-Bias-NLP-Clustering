Airport workers discovered narcotics and an unregistered gun in Moon\u2019s luggage, according to Oklahoma and Nevada medical board records.\n\nMoon\u2019s attorney Jim Priest said at Wednesday\u2019s board meeting that the Clark County district attorney did not press charges after that arrest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about the Nevada incident, and frankly, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s within the province of this board to take any action on it,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThe Nevada board has taken action on it, but I think it\u2019s clear from the totality of the evidence...that was much ado about nothing...There\u2019s never been any suggestion or indication that he\u2019s selling pills or pushing pills or getting pills inappropriately.\u201d\n\nOriginally, the board\u2019s complaint against Moon included language from a Nevada anesthesiologist who reviewed seven of Moon\u2019s patient medical charts and concluded that Moon\u2019s Nevada clinic \u201cappeared to function as a Schedule II, III, and IV prescription writing facility and not as a bona-fide medical clinic, rehabilitation or pain center, as advertised.\u201d\n\nHowever, the board agreed with Moon\u2019s attorney to strike that language from its complaint.\n\nRecord-keeping issue\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Moon told the board about the stressful day that led up to his arrest at the airport.\n\nMoon operates clinics in Tulsa and Las Vegas and frequently travels. That day, he was almost late to the airport and hadn\u2019t had a chance to register the WWII antique gun in his luggage that belonged to his mother\u2019s late husband, he said.\n\nMoon said he had his family members\u2019 prescriptions in his bags because he usually carries them when traveling. He had former patients\u2019 prescriptions because Nevada had recently changed how physicians could dispose of the drugs, he said.\n\nThe board also asked questions about a 2008 prescription that Moon had with him for hydrocodone.\n\nA month after his arrest, Moon tested positive for the drug, board records show. Board investigators searched the state\u2019s prescription drug monitoring program and did not find a valid prescription for the drug, according to records.\n\nAdditionally, board members asked several questions about Moon\u2019s record keeping.\n\nAfter Moon\u2019s arrest, board investigators went to his Tulsa office and asked for 31 patient medical records to inspect.\n\n\u201cNone of the patient records inspected were complete, nor did any of them fully comply with Board rules for prescribing narcotics,\u201d according to the board\u2019s complaint.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. David Moon, a pain management doctor based in Tulsa and Las Vegas, was given three years probation and will be required, among other things, to complete a substance abuse assessment; check the state\u2019s prescription drug monitoring system on every patient who receives prescription for a scheduled drug; and complete educational courses on record keeping and also on prescribing narcotic painkillers and other scheduled drugs.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
