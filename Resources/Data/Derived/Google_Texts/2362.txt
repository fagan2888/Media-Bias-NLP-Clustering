Beef processed by a Missouri company and sent to Whole Foods stores throughout New England, along with a restaurant in New York City, is being recalled over a threat of mad cow disease, the USDA announced.

How did 4,000 pounds of beef end up tainted with the disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)? It probably didn’t: Someone at Fruitland American Meat appears not to have been keeping proper records. The rare but often fatal disease is spread when humans consume an infected animal’s brain, spinal cord or digestive tract; as a precaution, slaughterhouses are required to remove the dorsal root ganglia, part of the spine, on cows over the age of 30 months. Federal inspectors say that failed to happen in this case, but the company says the cows in question were actually only 28 months old.

The USDA’s Food Safety Inspection said the beef only poses a “remote” health hazard. While inspections before and after slaughter showed no sign of the disease, they’re recalling the meat anyway, out of an “abundance of caution.” A spokesperson for the company confirmed that the meat was off the shelves, but they’re not naming the restaurant in question because the meat’s probably been eaten already. No one’s reported any health problems.
