The launches are seen as a way of testing ballistic missile technology.\n\n\"There are multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions that require North Korea to suspend all activities related to their ballistic missile program and re-establish a moratorium on missile launches, stop conducting any launches using ballistic missile technology, and abandon its ballistic missile program in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner,\" State Department press secretary John Kirby said in a statement.\n\n\"Any satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would be a clear violation of those resolutions,\" he said.\n\nYongbyon was shut down in 2007 in a deal brokered through \u201csix party\u201d talks involving the United States, China, Russia, Japan and the two Koreas, but Pyongyang announced in 2013 that it would revamp and restart its nuclear reactor.\n\nEarlier this year, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he believed that \"North Korea has followed through on its announcement by expanding its Yongbyon enrichment facility and restarting the reactor.\n\nThe U.S. has called on North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program as a condition to future negotiations, but the country has dismissed the entreaties, demanding to be recognized as a nuclear power.\n\nThe announcements by North Korea could give fodder to Republican critics of the administration's nuclear deal with Iran, who argued during debate about the deal that Iran is another North Korea waiting to happen.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellPuerto Rico debt relief faces serious challenges in Senate Overnight Healthcare: Momentum on mental health? | Zika bills head to conference | Only 10 ObamaCare co-ops left Trump outlines \u2018America First\u2019 energy plan MORE (R-Ky.) has scheduled another vote Tuesday evening on a resolution to disapprove the deal, which would prevent it from being implemented.
