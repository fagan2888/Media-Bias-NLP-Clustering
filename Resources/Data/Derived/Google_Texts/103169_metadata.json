It won\u2019t affect consumer medical devices, pharmaceuticals or consumer businesses.\n\nJ&J has struggled to revive sales of medical devices, particularly brands like DePuy orthopedic implants and Ethicon surgical equipment. In October the company said device sales dropped 7.3 percent to $6.1 billion in the previous fiscal quarter. In the same month, J&J sold its Cordis heart devices unit, which previously accounted for about one-quarter of device sales.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Lawrence Biegelsen noted that medical devices have been \u201cone of the weaker performing businesses in recent years.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs such, we believe that the restructuring should be a positive step towards driving longer term growth of the business and enhance profitability over time,\u201d Biegelsen said in a note to investors.\n\nThe company\u2019s actions will lead to annual pre-tax savings of $800 million to $1 billion, much of which will be realized by the end of 2018. J&J said it will consider \u201cstrategic options\u201d for underperforming business units.\n\nJ&J will book a fourth-quarter charge of about $600 million in connection with the restructuring.\n\nLeerink Swann analyst Danielle Antalffy said Tuesday\u2019s announcement increases the likelihood of an acquisition to boost the company\u2019s medical device prospects. She notes J&J has roughly $37 billion in cash.\n\nCiting conversations with J&J executives, Antalffy states \u201cit\u2019s clear to us that it\u2019s a matter of when, not if J&J does a deal.\u201d\n\nJ&J shares rose 4 cents to $97.04 in trading Tuesday. Its shares have fallen more than 6 percent over the past year.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://wtop.com/wp-content/themes/wtop/assets/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wtop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Johnson-and-Johnson-Job-Cuts-150x150.jpeg", "og": {"site_name": "WTOP", "description": "Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday that it plans to cut about 3,000 jobs over the next two years as the health care conglomerate works to restructure its medical devices business.
