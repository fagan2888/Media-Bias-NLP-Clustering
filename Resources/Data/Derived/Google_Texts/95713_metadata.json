Until recently, the National Reform Facebook page displayed the same profile picture Mohammed Elhassan Mohammed\u2019s used for his personal Facebook profile picture. Mohammed\u2019s National Reform Party page continues to post the same pictures, videos and articles about Ahmed Mohammed, and the Clock saga, as does Mohammed ElHassan on his personal page.\n\nOn September 12th, 2015, his National Reform page shared a photo that featured the smoking World Trade Center towers above text in Arabic describing the events of September 11th as \u201can American media creation\u201d and calls them, \u201cterrorism American style.\u201d It also blames the U.S. for the events of the Arab Spring, calling it a U.S. plan to \u201cfoment reprehensible chaos.\u201d\n\nThe text describes the attack on 9/11 as a \u201cmiracle\u201d for the United States, because it provided justification for an attack, \u201cfirst an Islamic government, while the second was a mighty Arab state in the Middle East.\u201d The reference is clearly to the U.S. attack on Afghanistan (under the Taliban) and Iraq.\n\nWhile the text identified the author as one Asad al-Barari, it\u2019s not immediately clearly why Mohammed Elhassan and his National Reform Party chose to share this image and the post on September 12th, but the posting contains no text attempting to rebut or criticize the post for its statements about America.\n\nNor is this the only questionable post. As recently as September 28th, the National Reform Party page shared an English language video, with Arabic subtitles, which presents conspiracy theory arguments about the September 2001 attack.\n\nThe fifteen-minute video\u2014first posted in September 2013\u2014claims to prove explosives were used in bringing down the World Trade Center, attacks Penn & Teller\u2019s 2005 debunking of 9/11 \u2018truther\u2019 conspiracy theories and, finally, blames \u201cUS military officials, television executives and some Israeli and British government officials\u201d for the attacks.\n\nBelow is the full translation of the September 12, 2015 post from Facebook:", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the frenzy following his son Ahmeds bringing a suspicious-looking modified clock to high school, Texas-based Islamic political activist Mohammed Elhassan Mohammed finally succeeded in creating something hes sought for a long time: a national media event that can be used to shine the light on alleged crimes of the United States, from accusations of Islamophobia in Irving, Texas, to American complicity in the 9/11 attacks..05/27/2016 8:50:21AM EST.", "author": "Kyle Shideler", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "With the frenzy following his son Ahmeds bringing a suspicious-looking modified clock to high school, Texas-based Islamic political activist Mohammed Elhassan Mohammed finally succeeded in creating something hes sought for a long time: a national media event that can be used to shine the light on alleged crimes of the United States, from accusations of Islamophobia in Irving, Texas, to American complicity in the 9/11 attacks.", "title": "Ahmed\u2019s Dad Pushes 9/11 Conspiracy Posts, Videos on Arabic Facebook Page", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/kyleshideler/2015/10/06/ahmeds-dad-pushes-911-conspiracy-posts-videos-on-arabic-facebook-page-n2061903", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/10/6/5.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "With the frenzy following his son Ahmeds bringing a suspicious-looking modified clock to high school, Texas-based Islamic political activist Mohammed Elhassan Mohammed finally succeeded in creating something hes sought for a long time: a national media event that can be used to shine the light on alleged crimes of the United States, from accusations of Islamophobia in Irving, Texas, to American complicity in the 9/11 attacks.", "title": "Ahmed\u2019s Dad Pushes 9/11 Conspiracy Posts, Videos on Arabic Facebook Page", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/kyleshideler/2015/10/06/ahmeds-dad-pushes-911-conspiracy-posts-videos-on-arabic-facebook-page-n2061903", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/10/6/5.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Ahmed\u2019s Dad Pushes 9/11 Conspiracy Posts, Videos on Arabic Facebook Page, Kyle Shideler, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Until recently, the National Reform Facebook page displayed the same profile picture Mohammed Elhassan Mohammed\u2019s used for his personal Facebook profile picture.\nAs recently as September 28th, the National Reform Party page shared an English language video, with Arabic subtitles, which presents conspiracy theory arguments about the September 2001 attack.\nMohammed\u2019s National Reform Party page continues to post the same pictures, videos and articles about Ahmed Mohammed, and the Clock saga, as does Mohammed ElHassan on his personal page.\nBelow is the full translation of the September 12, 2015 post from Facebook:\nWhile still residing in his Dallas suburb, Mohammed has, nonetheless, repeatedly run for president of Sudan as a candidate identified with his own very small political party, \u201cal-Islah al-Watani,\u201d or National Reform."}
