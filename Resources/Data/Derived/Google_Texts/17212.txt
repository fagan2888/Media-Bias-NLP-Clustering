A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought against the ride-sharing service Uber by taxi and limousine companies in Connecticut.

The companies had wanted to see Uber subjected to the same regulations that cover taxi services. The suit accused Uber of engaging in deceptive practices and misrepresenting its services.

The complainants now have 30 days to file an amended suit.
