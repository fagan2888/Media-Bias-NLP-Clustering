One of the real issues and one of the problems has been the delay in implementation of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act employer mandate requiring employers with more than 50 workers to provide health insurance was supposed to take effect in 2015, but is being delayed by the Obama administration.\n\nRELATED: Revisions to MEWA shelved until the fall as lawmakers spar over mandates\n\n\n\nSmall businesses with 50 to 99 full-time equivalent employees have to start insuring workers, or pay penalties, by 2016. Those with 100 or more will need to start providing health benefits to at least 70 percent of their full-time employees by 2015 and 95 percent by 2016\n\n\n\nGaburo said the Obamacare delay caused the market for health coverage to change dramatically and \u201cat least from the standpoint of the owners of the hospital, the MEWA does not make a lot of sense right now. The idea is in the best case to make it (TruPlan) dormant and then reassess it in six months or a year and see if it makes sense\u201d to relaunch the MEWA.\n\n\n\nJohn Marshall, an actuary and TruPlan\u2019s administrator, said the MEWA has fewer than 400 members, mostly employees of the hospital, which along with its affiliated physicians is the primary provider of health care to the members.\n\n\n\nTruPlan got approval to begin operating from the state Department of Banking and Insurance in January 2013.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe problem is the lack of membership,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cThis is a self-funded organization and you need a certain critical mass to handle large claims. It became apparent we were not getting the membership that we were expecting.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said outside of Meadowlands, TruPlan\u2019s membership includes about 30 employers.\n\n\u201cThey are mostly small businesses in the Secaucus area, and most of them have just a handful of employees,\u201d Marshall said.\n\n\n\nThe employers who belong to TruPlan were sent notices in mid-October to inform them of the wind-down and that they will need to find alternative coverage starting in January, Marshall said.\n\n\n\nTruPlan continues to pay claims and does not expect to end the year in a deficit, Marshall said.\n\nClick here to subscribe to the NJBIZ morning, daily and industry email news blasts\n\n\n\nHe explained that Meadowlands Hospital does not file claims with the MEWA, but instead has been receiving a capitated portion of the premiums paid by members to TruPlan in exchange for providing medical care to the members. Claims are filed by non-Meadowlands providers who deliver care that Meadowlands does not provide, including \u201cinvasive cardiac surgery, transplants and out-of-area emergencies.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said all other care has been provided by the hospital, which has taken on financial risk in exchange for capitated payments to cover the medical care needed by TruPlan members.\n\n\n\nMarshall said Meadowlands was using an innovative and promising care delivery model.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe whole concept is very good: health care groups are going to take on more risk and I think we will see a lot of that with health care reform,\u201d Marshall said. In the case of TruPlan, \u201cIt did not work because basically we could not attract (sufficient) membership.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the problems at TruPlan, New Jersey\u2019s two other well-established MEWAs (multiple employer welfare arrangements) have succeeded in attracting employer groups and growing their membership base\n\n\n\nThe Association Master Trust, founded in 1945, has about 18,000 members. The employers who join AMT belong to 16 New Jersey trade associations, including those representing fuel merchants, electricians, plumbers and veterinarians.\n\n\n\nThe Affiliated Physicians and Employers Health Plan, which is administered by QualCare, began in 2004 and provides health coverage to more than 20,000 members. In 2011 it partnered with the Employers Association of New Jersey, many of whose member employers have joined the MEWA.\n\n\n\nDawn Wright, vice president of QualCare, said \u201cMEWAs are a great alternative when run appropriately and when offered through an association or sponsor that is fully committed to the program. Our MEWA, Affiliated Physicians and Employers Health Plan, has seen great success and has experienced over 80 percent growth in 2014 because we have always listened to our members and continuously offered new benefits, networks and coverages to meet their needs.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to have a qualified and experienced plan manager to oversee the operations of a MEWA and assist members in the management of their risk.\u201d\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nBooker defeats Bell and other Election Day results\n\nN.J. real estate leaders react to news that Hersh will step down\n\nPrivate-sector cleanup experts playing key role at Roche site", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "TruPlan, the multiple-employer health plan launched in 2013 and sponsored by Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center in Secaucus, will wind down operations by year's end after failing to attract enough m", "title": "Meadowlands Hospital shutting down multiple-employer health plan, for now | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20141105/NJBIZ01/141109851/meadowlands-hospital-shutting-down-multipleemployer-health-plan-for-now", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20141105/NJBIZ01/141109851/AR/0/AR-141109851.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "TruPlan, the multiple-employer health plan launched in 2013 and sponsored by Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center in Secaucus, will wind down operations by year's end after failing to attract enough m", "title": "Meadowlands Hospital shutting down multiple-employer health plan, for now | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20141105/NJBIZ01/141109851/AR/0/AR-141109851.jpg"}, "creator": "@bethfitzgerald8", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "TruPlan, the multiple-employer health plan launched in 2013 and sponsored by Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center in Secaucus, will wind down operations by year's end after failing to attract enough members beyond its core group of hospital employees to put it on a financially sustainable footing.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Gaburo said in January that Meadowlands will move its employees into a self-insured health plan backed by the hospital.\nThe Affiliated Physicians and Employers Health Plan, which is administered by QualCare, began in 2004 and provides health coverage to more than 20,000 members.\n\u201cThe whole concept is very good: health care groups are going to take on more risk and I think we will see a lot of that with health care reform,\u201d Marshall said.\nTruPlan, the multiple-employer health plan launched in 2013 and sponsored by Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center in Secaucus, will wind down operations by year's end after failing to attract enough members beyond its core group of hospital employees to put it on a financially sustainable footing.\n\u201cThey are mostly small businesses in the Secaucus area, and most of them have just a handful of employees,\u201d Marshall said."}
