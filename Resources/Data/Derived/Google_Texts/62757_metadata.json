But one post-abortive woman testified on Monday that as far as she's concerned, \u201cThat's not fair.\u201d\n\nChristine Kocsis, who paid for her own abortion in New York seven years ago, urged legislators to support the \u201cReproductive Parity Act\u201d during a hearing on Monday. The bill would require any insurance company that covers prenatal care for expectant mothers to also pay for abortion.\n\nKocsis admitted the issue did not apply in her situation, because \u201cI didn't have insurance then.\u201d But she added, \u201cI cannot imagine if I had been in that place in my life, and I had been paying for insurance and found out it would only cover me if I carried my pregnancy to term.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's not fair,\" she said emphatically.\n\nBut social conservatives and free marketeers say it is unfair to compel a business owner, especially a religious one, to cover abortion under penalty of law.\n\nSen. Randi Becker, R-Eatonville, successfully blocked the bill last year. Some of her constituents have opted to go uninsured in order to avoid indirectly subsidizing abortion. They deserve to be covered, Becker said.\n\n\u201cWe can't take that choice away,\u201d Sen. Becker added.\n\nKocsis' words came as part of a panel presentation before 11 Democratic state senators, who called an ad hoc hearing that they alone attended.\n\n\u201cFor everything the Affordable Care Act has to offer,\u201d state Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler said, \u201cit does not guarantee women full access to all reproductive services, specifically abortion.\u201d\n\nOthers who spoke on Monday included Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest, the National Organization for Women (NOW), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Community Abortion Information and Resource Project (a member of the National Network of Abortion Funds, which hosts an annual bowl-a-thon to raise money for abortion). The state chapters of NARAL and the ACLU have also backed the bill.\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\nThe debate is likely to continue, as it has the last several years. The state House passed the bill last year by a 53-43 margin and again this year, 54-44. But the Senate Majority Coalition Caucus, comprised of 24 Republicans and two Democrats, did not bring the bill up for a vote.\n\nIt is expected to die in the Senate again this year, although Democratic Governor Jay Inslee has promised to sign the bill if it lands on his desk.\n\nLisa M. Stone, the executive director of the pro-abortion law group Legal Voice, said last year the bill had to pass.\n\n\u201cWe need to ensure that Washington maintains its values,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "Christine Kocsis, who paid for her own abortion seven years ago, says no insurance company should be able to choose not to pay for the procedure.", "title": "It\u2019s \u2018not fair\u2019 that insurance doesn\u2019t have to pay for my abortion, woman testifies in Washington", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.data.lifesitenews.com/images/news/ChristineKocsis-250px.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/its-not-fair-insurance-doesnt-have-to-pay-for-my-abortion-woman-testifies-i", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "Christine Kocsis, who paid for her own abortion seven years ago, says no insurance company should be able to choose not to pay for the procedure."}, "description": "Christine Kocsis, who paid for her own abortion seven years ago, says no insurance company should be able to choose not to pay for the procedure.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce824\"", "article_summary": "NewsAbortion, Politics - U.S.OLYMPIA, WA, March 4, 2014 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) \u2013 Health insurance companies in Washington state currently have the right to choose not to pay for abortion.\nThe bill would require any insurance company that covers prenatal care for expectant mothers to also pay for abortion.\nLisa M.
