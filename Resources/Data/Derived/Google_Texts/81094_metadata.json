On Wednesday at 7:00 AM, Cruz described remembering the eerie music from the films The Shining and Psycho.\n\n\u201cAnd it occurred to me that perhaps one of the great philosophical conundrums with which we must all wrestle is whether Obamacare is more like (Friday the 13th\u2019s) Jason or (A Nightmare on Elm Street\u2019s) Freddy,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nCruz stated:\n\nArgument for Jason, because Obamacare is the biggest job killer in this country. When Jason put on his hockey mask and swung that machete, boy there was carnage like nothing else. On the other hand, You could make a powerful argument for Freddy, because as James Hoffa, the President of The Teamsters, said, \u2018Obamacare is a nightmare. It\u2019s a nightmare for the men and women of America. While the Senate slept, the men and women didn\u2019t get their respite from the nightmare causing them to lose their jobs, never get hired, be reduced to 29 hours a week, driving up their health insurance premiums and jeopardizing their health care.\u2019\n\nCruz even brought up the horror film Freddy vs. Jason, forgetting precisely what happened in the film other than the title character\u2019s fight, he explained how he he thought Obamacare should be stopped.\n\n\u201cBut the only way to stop Jason and Freddy is if the American people rise up in such overwhelming numbers that the members of this Senate listen to the people, and we step forward and avert this train wreck. We step forward and avert this nightmare,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nPhoto Credit: New Line Cinema", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz Compares Obamacare to Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Cruz Compares Obamacare to Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th", "title": "Cruz Compares Obamacare to Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Clip%20Art%20Graveyard/A-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street-New-Line-Cinema.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2013/09/25/cruz-compares-obamacare-to-nightmare-on-elm-street-and-friday-the-13th/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cruz Compares Obamacare to Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th", "title": "Cruz Compares Obamacare to Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Clip%20Art%20Graveyard/A-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street-New-Line-Cinema.jpg", "creator": "@kerrypicket", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Senate, Ted Cruz,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2013-09-25T08:38:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd79\"", "article_summary": "We step forward and avert this nightmare,\u201d said Cruz.\nCruz stated:Argument for Jason, because Obamacare is the biggest job killer in this country.\nOn the other hand, You could make a powerful argument for Freddy, because as James Hoffa, the President of The Teamsters, said, \u2018Obamacare is a nightmare.\nOn Wednesday at 7:00 AM, Cruz described remembering the eerie music from the films The Shining and Psycho.\n\u201cAnd it occurred to me that perhaps one of the great philosophical conundrums with which we must all wrestle is whether Obamacare is more like (Friday the 13th\u2019s) Jason or (A Nightmare on Elm Street\u2019s) Freddy,\u201d said Cruz."}
