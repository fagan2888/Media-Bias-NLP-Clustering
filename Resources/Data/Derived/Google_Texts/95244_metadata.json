An analysis of 1,724 dove-bones was published in the Scientific Reports journal .These bones found in a cave in Gibraltar, reveal tooth marks, cuts and evidence of roasting.\n\nWorkers at the site unearthed a haul of pigeon bones and found that some bore tooth marks, cuts from stone tools or signs of burns. These examinations conclude that they were created when the meat was left to cook on the glowing embers of a fire.\n\nThe evidence also suggested that Neanderthals ate much like a latter-day Homo sapiens would tuck into a roast chicken, pulling the bones apart to get at the soft flesh.\n\n\"They liked what we like and went for the breasts, the drumsticks and the wings,\" study author Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, told Phys.org.\n\nIt was not known how the birds were captured. However, the speculations prove that they would have been relatively easy to snatch from their nests by a moderately skillful and silent climber.\n\nThe majority of bird bones at Gorham's Cave belong to rock doves, the wild ancestors of modern feral pigeons. g sediments ranging from 67,000 to 28,000 years old.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef98\"", "article_summary": "A new research on Neanderthals, an extinct human species in the genus Homo, possibly a subspecies of Homo sapiens, revealed that they hunted and ate wild pigeons long before modern humans started consuming bird meat.\nThe majority of bird bones at Gorham's Cave belong to rock doves, the wild ancestors of modern feral pigeons.\nThe evidence also suggested that Neanderthals ate much like a latter-day Homo sapiens would tuck into a roast chicken, pulling the bones apart to get at the soft flesh.\nAccording to scientists, Neanderthals were catching, butchering and roasting pigeons as much as 67,000 years ago.\nNeanderthals lived in parts of Europe, Central Asia and Middle East for up to 300,000 years but vanished from the fossil record about 30-40,000 years ago."}
