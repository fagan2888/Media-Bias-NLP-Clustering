which was created in the 16th century and used for private worship - is made of animal skin and lined with gold leafing.\n\nIt is not known who commissioned it to be made or how four pages of it went missing.\n\n\n\nChannel Seven chairman Kerry Stokes purchased the 514-year-old book for $15.5 million The Rothschild Prayerbook contains 67 paintings done by some of the most talented Renaissance artists\n\nWhen Hilter took the prayerbook from the Rothschilds, he stored it in the Nazi vaults with other pieces of priceless art works until it was moved to the Vienna Library, presumably because he thought it would be safer there.\n\nAfter the fall of the Nazis, the library refused to return the prayerbook to the Rothschilds.\n\nThe family waged a 60-year battle with the Austrian government to get it back.\n\nIn 1999, it was finally returned to its rightful owners, according to Channel Seven's Sunday Night.\n\n\n\nThe book then went under the hammer at a Christie's auction months later in England and was purchased by an anonymous buyer.\n\nThe prayerbook was not to be seen for another 15 years.\n\nThe prayerbook was created in the 16th century and used for private worship It is not known how four pages of the book went missing but it was once owned by Adolf Hitler\n\nBut then in 2014, it re-appeared at another Christie's auction at New York City's Rockefeller Centre.\n\nAs a phone bidder, Mr Stokes - an art enthusiast - bought the slice of history for $15.5 million to add to his collection in Perth in Western Australia.\n\nBut he will not keep it to himself like the prayerbook's previous owners, it will soon go on a tour of the east coast to Canberra and Melbourne.\n\nMr Stokes said the book felt alive underneath his fingertips when he first touched it.\n\nIts pages are made of animal skin and lined with gold leafing, and has pictures of Madonna holding Jesus Christ The prayerbook is now part of Mr Stokes' private art collection in Perth in Western Australia\n\n'When I first saw it I actually didn\u2019t know if I should touch it and open it, I started to turn the pages and the hair on the back of my arm stood up,' he told Sunday Night.\n\n'I\u2019m a pretty tough nut I guess and I love art as one of the expressions that...probably appeals to the softer side a lot of people would deny I have.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Australian,media,mogul,pays,15,million,514,year,old,book", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2746949/Australian-media-mogul-pays-15-million-514-year-old-book.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "The Rothschild Prayerbook was once owned by a European banking family and was taken from them by Adolf Hitler (pictured).", "title": "Australian media mogul pays $15 million for a 514-year-old prayerbook", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2746949/Australian-media-mogul-pays-15-million-514-year-old-book.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/07/article-2746949-212733B200000578-833_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2746949/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2746949/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "keywords": "Australian,media,mogul,pays,15,million,514,year,old,book", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2746949, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-09-07T17:28:35.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Louise+Cheer+for+Daily+Mail+Australia", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-09-07T18:45:45.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Australian media mogul pays 15 million 514 year old book"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "The Rothschild Prayerbook was once owned by a European banking family and was taken from them by Adolf Hitler (pictured).", "title": "Australian media mogul pays $15 million for a 514-year-old prayerbook", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2746949/Australian-media-mogul-pays-15-million-514-year-old-book.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/07/article-2746949-212733B200000578-833_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "The Rothschild Prayerbook was once owned by a European banking family and was taken from them by Adolf Hitler (pictured)."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc47\"", "article_summary": "Each page of the prayerbook -
