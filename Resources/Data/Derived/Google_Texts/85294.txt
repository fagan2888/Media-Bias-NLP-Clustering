LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) - Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury says quarterback Pat Mahomes is day-to-day after the sophomore injured his left knee in the first quarter of the 55-52 loss to No. 4 TCU.

Mahomes was hit going out of bounds at the 1-yard line after a 15-yard run on the second possession of Saturday’s game. He came up limping but stayed in, handing the ball off to DeAndre Washington who scored the first of his four touchdowns.

Mahomes wore a brace the rest of the game and his mobility was hampered.

Kingsbury didn’t have a “scientific diagnosis” but said Mahomes didn’t want to discuss it or have trainers look at it.

Junior backup QB Davis Webb started games last year for Texas Tech, which plays No. 5 Baylor in Arlington on Saturday.
