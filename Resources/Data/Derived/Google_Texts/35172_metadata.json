Boycott what offends you; it\u2019s the American way.\n\nWhile your actions may not result in change \u2014 you may happen to be in the minority, after all \u2014 withdrawing financial support from anyone who does not back you is nevertheless a sign of self-respect. One recent example of such consumer pride comes from Chastity Garner. Last week, she said in a post on Garner Style that she\u2019d stop spending her dollars at Target until the mass retailer began to \u201cinclude true plus sizes\u201d in their designer collaborations.\n\nThe issue is the Altuzarra for Target collection, which, in Garner\u2019s words, features \u201cliterally 50 pieces of beautiful (and I mean beautiful) affordable clothing,\u201d yet all of it comes in only standard sizes. None is made for plus-size women like Garner. Addressing the chain store directly, she comically writes, \u201cYou have once again made me feel like a second-class customer and because of that I\u2019m going to have to discontinue my relationship with you altogether.\u201d\n\nIn response to her call to boycott action, Joshua Thomas, a Target spokesperson, told Refinery 29: \u201cWe appreciate the opportunity to hear directly from our guests. We\u2019ll take this feedback into consideration as we move forward.\u201d Yeah, right. While nothing may change at Target anytime soon, I am certainly interested to see if Garner manages to make a dent in their bottom line. Her readers, in the meantime, are offering alternative suggestions for those in the plus range, including Lela Rose for Lane Bryant.\n\nThough some plus-size women clearly suffer from a scarcity of clothing options, other plus-size women may be, in the words of Frances Kuffel, \u201cshockingly overstocked\u201d in certain items. In one of her recent What Fat Women Want columns, she notes the tendency of gift-givers to overload plus-size women with products obviously intended to make a woman feel \u201cmore feminine.\u201d Number one on Kuffel\u2019s humorous, though, pointed list is \u201cthe Big Scarf, the kind she can twiddle and bundle and hide in.\u201d While \u201cno woman has enough jewelry,\u201d Kuffel notes \u201cfat women have enough of the oversize, chunky (i.e., distracting) jewelry.\u201d Additionally, she advises against any \u201cmedia gifts that are about weight, exercise, or nutrition unless she has specifically asked for it.\u201d\n\nA common theme is running through the words of both these writers. Garner does not want to feel \u201csecond-class,\u201d while Kuffel suggests she, too, has been overlooked, mistaken for some kind of generic \u201cfat lady.\u201d The total percent of adults over the age of 20 who are overweight, including those who are obese, is 69 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's not them we don't want to take the time and trouble to really look at and see, it's us. What \u2014 you'd rather watch thin people on TV?
