What the Times didn\u2019t do is lay out some of the terrible ideas these economists promoted.\n\n1. Raise Taxes On the Poor to Cut Them on the Rich: Stephen Moore, who works for the Wall Street Journal in addition to being parked at the Heritage Foundation, has been at dinners of economists advising candidates such as Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal. In 2010, Moore said he\u2019d \u201craise the 10 percent tax rate to 15 percent and lower the [top] rates.\u201d\n\n2. Just Suspend All Taxes: Art Laffer is most known for his \u201cLaffer Curve\u201d idea, where he proposed that cutting taxes creates so much growth it will bring in more revenue. But he\u2019s been a right-wing economist who has been preaching a number of odd policies for decades. In 2010, he suggested just suspending all taxes to stimulate the economy. He has met with both Jeb Bush and Ben Carson.\n\n3. Get Rid of Corporate Income Tax Altogether: Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University has advised Ben Carson, who called him to talk to him about the deficit. Kotlikoff wrote an op-ed in January 2014 in which he said we shouldn\u2019t just lower the corporate income tax, we should eliminate it. Larry Kudlow, a CNBC host and economics pundit, also advocated the same idea.\n\n4. Detroit\u2019s Budget Crisis Is a Good Thing: Rand Paul adviser Mark Spitznagel wrote a column urging a collapse of Detroit\u2019s public budget and economic system, noting that \u201cthe good news is that, as Rothbard noted, such a collapse is the recovery process\u2026.Given this, purging Detroit\u2019s balance sheet (specifically the disproportionate unfunded liabilities that have plunged it deep into the red) is the best \u2013 maybe even the only available path to renewal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative economists are pushing Republicans to raise taxes on the poor and further deregulate Wall Street", "title": "The 8 worst economic proposals GOP candidates are considering", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Conservative economists are pushing Republicans to raise taxes on the poor and further deregulate Wall Street", "title": "The 8 worst economic proposals GOP candidates are considering", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/04/the_8_worst_economic_proposals_gop_candidates_are_considering_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/rick_perry6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservative economists are pushing Republicans to raise taxes on the poor and further deregulate Wall Street", "title": "The 8 worst economic proposals GOP candidates are considering", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/rick_perry6.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Zaid Jilani", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, corporate income tax, Income inequality, laffer curve, Wall Street", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34ba\"", "article_summary": "Get Rid of Corporate Income Tax Altogether: Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University has advised Ben Carson, who called him to talk to him about the deficit.\nThe New York Times recently named a number of economic advisers who are currently advising or are interviewing to begin working for GOP presidential candidates.\nKotlikoff wrote an op-ed in January 2014 in which he said we shouldn\u2019t just lower the corporate income tax, we should eliminate it.\nIn 2010, Moore said he\u2019d \u201craise the 10 percent tax rate to 15 percent and lower the [top] rates.\u201d2.\nWhat the Times didn\u2019t do is lay out some of the terrible ideas these economists promoted."}
