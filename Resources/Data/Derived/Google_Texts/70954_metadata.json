However, section (2)b is problematic because it ties a member\u2019s cost-share to the silver metallic tier. As drafted, this section could effectively eliminate tiered bronze and silver products, which are often the most cost efficient options for consumers. By requiring the preferred tier cost-share to match the silver metallic cost-share, plans will not be able to comply with the bill and the actuarial value calculator under federal law for a bronze or even a silver tiered network offering. Both the bronze and silver products on the federally facilitated marketplace (FFM) have been well received by consumers who are focused on affordability.\" Steve Goldman, a former state Department of Banking and Insurance commissioner currently representing hospitals opposed to the plans: \"It is critical that the commission support these measures, as well as legislation to freeze enrollment into Horizon\u2019s OMNIA plan, to ensure that the state does not enroll its employees into a deeply flawed plan. Horizon \u2014 New Jersey\u2019s largest health care insurer, which administers the State Health Benefits Plan \u2014 has failed to provide any transparency to health care consumers and providers as to how the providers were being placed into tiers. Furthermore, they continue to go to great lengths in court to block the discovery of this information. This creates a terrible precedent for the needed revisions to the health care delivery system in New Jersey, and compromises patients' access to care. No one but Horizon knows the matrices and criteria used to place providers into tiers and some of the state\u2019s highest rated hospitals and doctors have been placed into tier 2.\"\n\nHorizon's OMNIA tiered network health plan split virtually all the state's hospitals into two tiers.\n\nCommission member Robert Pittfield said the bills that made demands about which hospitals to include \u2014 namely University Hospital \u2014 water down the integrity of the idea of a tiered network.\n\nCommission member Thomas Hastie called it \"market meddling.\"\n\nThe State Health Benefits Plan has 1,100 subscribers in tiered plans, out of 840,000 covered lives, meaning the impact of such plans is minimal, according to David Pointer, assistant director, New Jersey Public Employees' Health Benefits Program.\n\nBut the SHBP also offers, in addition to Horizons plan, a tiered network plan from Aetna. The Aetna Liberty plan is similar to the OMNIA plan, but includes many of the \"Tier 2\" hospitals in its top tier.\n\nAetna previously told NJBIZ it had created the plan at the request of the state pension and benefits division.\n\nCurrently, there are 614 members signed up for Horizon\u2019s plan and 524 signed up for Aetna\u2019s in the SHBP.\n\nPointer said the plans are a response to the market and are a favorable option for employers preparing for the \u201cCadillac Tax,\u201d which will penalize for high-cost plans.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Two bills on tiered networks \u2014 one placing a freeze on enrollment, and the other setting ground rules for tiered network structure \u2014 were opposed by a state commission Friday.", "title": "State benefits review panel opposes tiered-network bills | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20160520/NJBIZ01/160529976/state-benefits-review-panel-opposes-tierednetwork-bills", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/images/njbiz-logo-share.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "Two bills on tiered networks \u2014 one placing a freeze on enrollment, and the other setting ground rules for tiered network structure \u2014 were opposed by a state commission Friday.", "title": "State benefits review panel opposes tiered-network bills | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/images/njbiz-logo-share.jpg"}, "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Two bills on tiered networks \u2014 one placing a freeze on enrollment, and the other setting ground rules for tiered network structure \u2014 were opposed by a state commission Friday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But the SHBP also offers, in addition to Horizons plan, a tiered network plan from Aetna.\nMore about the bills Five tiered network bills sent to full Assembly on divided 3-2 committee voteThe first set of bills calls for a freeze on enrollment in tiered network health plans, until legislation regulating those types of plans is passed into law.\nHorizon's OMNIA tiered network health plan split virtually all the state's hospitals into two tiers.\nHorizon \u2014 New Jersey\u2019s largest health care insurer, which administers the State Health Benefits Plan \u2014 has failed to provide any transparency to health care consumers and providers as to how the providers were being placed into tiers.\nThis creates a terrible precedent for the needed revisions to the health care delivery system in New Jersey, and compromises patients' access to care."}
