Syracuse, N.Y. - Central New York hospitals are taking pay cuts of nearly $3 million because their patient care does not pass muster with the federal government.

The government is penalizing nearly every hospital in the region for the second year in a row under a program created by the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, that ties hospital Medicare payments to performance. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older and the disabled.

St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center in Syracuse got the biggest penalty of any hospital in the region -- $1.7 million.

Hospitals could gain or lose up to 1.25 percent of their Medicare reimbursements under the incentive program for the federal fiscal year that began Oct. 1 and runs through September 2014. The penalties or bonuses are based on how hospitals measure up on 24 quality indicators that look at everything from death rates of heart attack patients to cleanliness of patient rooms.

On top of that, the government imposed penalties of up to 2 percent of Medicare payments on hospitals that had excessive numbers of patients readmitted within 30 days of their last hospital stay. The government says readmissions are symptoms of wasteful spending and uncoordinated care. Most of St. Joe's penalty is tied to excessive readmissions.





On a percentage basis, Oswego Hospital received the biggest penalty - 1.71 percent -- of any hospital in the region. Most of that is because the hospital readmitted too many patients.

For the second consecutive year, Community Memorial in Hamilton was the only hospital in the region to get a bonus: 0.22 percent.

While the percentages are small, the penalties can hurt Central New York hospitals that count on Medicare for more than half of their revenue. St. Joe's, for example, received a 1.19 percent penalty, which equals $1.7 million.

"Our hospitals are not making a ton of money," said Gary Fitzgerald, president of Iroquois Healthcare Alliance, a hospital trade association. "Some are breaking even and some are losing money. So every dollar of Medicare we lose is significant to our hospitals."
