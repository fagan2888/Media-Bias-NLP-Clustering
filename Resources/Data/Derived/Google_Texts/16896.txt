Protest marchers in Alabama on Sunday embarked on the second day of their planned 860-mile trek to Washington, D.C., as part of "America's Journey for Justice."

Sponsored by the NAACP, "America's Journey for Justice" is scheduled to cross through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia before reaching Washington, D.C., in mid-September.

The marchers are expected to cross into Georgia around Friday.

Organizers say rallies are planned for several stops along the route, including Atlanta; Greenville, South Carolina; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Washington, D.C., according to preliminary plans announced by the NAACP.

The marchers are focusing on different issues as they cross each state. In Alabama, the focus is on economic inequality, for instance. In Georgia, it will be education reform.
