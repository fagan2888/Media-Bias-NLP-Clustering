Pundits who might have recently dismissed Trump\u2014Republican intellectuals among them\u2014are now coming to terms with the fact that even if he doesn\u2019t win, he has still changed the shape and tenor of the Republican primaries and the future of the GOP. Of the recent reappraisals of Trump, two of the most interesting are from Ross Douthat and David Frum, two intellectuals loosely associated with the reformicon movement\u2014a faction which has a fair claim to come up with a plausible explanation of why the GOP has been fertile ground for a Trump insurgency. But their analysis falters because they are still not willing to grapple with the racism that lies at the heart of Trump\u2019s appeal.\n\nThe strength of the reformicons is that they have long applied a class analysis to the GOP, a party they see as divided between a plutocratic elite and a struggling working class. \u201cA majority of Republicans worry that corporations and the wealthy exert too much power,\u201d Frum writes in the latest issue of The Atlantic. \u201cTheir party leaders work to ensure that these same groups can exert even more. Mainstream Republicans were quite at ease with tax increases on households earning more than $250,000 in the aftermath of the Great Recession and the subsequent stimulus. Their congressional representatives had the opposite priorities.\u201d This class division long precedes Donald Trump, but it helps explain why he\u2019s been able to win the trust of voters who feel the traditional GOP establishment has been ignoring their interests.\n\nFor more than a decade, reformicons like Douthat, the New York Times columnist, have argued that the Republican establishment has become too beholden to the business elite, risking support among the white working class. To ward off this problem, the reformicons have called for policies to help the white working class, ranging from immigration policies that clamp down on low-skilled immigrants to targeted tax relief for the middle class. Although somewhat apart from the main reformicons as a group, Frum has echoed many of their ideas. So Douthat and Frum can both plausibly claim (or, more accurately, hint) that while Trump wasn\u2019t what they had in mind, his ability to mobilize white working-class voters with populist-sounding rhetoric vindicates their arguments that this group has been politically neglected.\n\n\n\nDouthat and Frum have a far better sense of Trump\u2019s appeal than most mainstream Republicans, who still think he\u2019s just using charisma picked up from reality TV. But they can\u2019t bring themselves to consider the way Trump\u2019s naked appeal to white identity politics threatens both the GOP and their own reformicon agenda. As Douthat notes in the Times, the sizable Trump faction \u201chas turned out to include precisely the kind of voters Romney needed in 2012 and who stayed home instead: Blue-collar whites with moderate views on economics and a weak attachment to the institutional G.O.P.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "He's winning the voters that GOP reformers yearn for\u2014but with racism and xenophobia, not policy ideas.", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "He's winning the voters that GOP reformers yearn for\u2014but with racism and xenophobia, not policy ideas.", "title": "Republican Intellectuals Still Don\u2019t Get Donald Trump", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/85ce5529f1fc541d95f1dca48ed982722124e86b.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/126971/republican-intellectuals-still-dont-get-donald-trump", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He's winning the voters that GOP reformers yearn for\u2014but with racism and xenophobia, not policy ideas.", "creator": "@HeerJeet", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/85ce5529f1fc541d95f1dca48ed982722124e86b.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Republican Intellectuals Still Don\u2019t Get Donald Trump", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/85ce5529f1fc541d95f1dca48ed982722124e86b.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Republican Intellectuals Still Don\u2019t Get Donald Trump \",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/126971/republican-intellectuals-still-dont-get-donald-trump\",\"section\":\"Donald Trump\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-01-05T12:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":126971,\"author\":\"Jeet Heer\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Donald Trump\",\"Ross Douthat\",\"David Frum\",\"Reformicons\",\"Republican Primary 2016\",\"Election 2016\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Donald Trump", "published_time": "2016-01-05"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Within the space of a few months, Donald Trump has gone from a joke to an imminent threat.\nFor more than a decade, reformicons like Douthat, the New York Times columnist, have argued that the Republican establishment has become too beholden to the business elite, risking support among the white working class.\nTo ward off this problem, the reformicons have called for policies to help the white working class, ranging from immigration policies that clamp down on low-skilled immigrants to targeted tax relief for the middle class.\nBut they can\u2019t bring themselves to consider the way Trump\u2019s naked appeal to white identity politics threatens both the GOP and their own reformicon agenda.\nAlthough somewhat apart from the main reformicons as a group, Frum has echoed many of their ideas."}
