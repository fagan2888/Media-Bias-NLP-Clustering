The three week course teaches teens cooking basics and the importance of sustainable farming by using the community\u2019s own garden.\n\nEach student gets a cookbook and a set of cooking utensils to sharpen their new skills.\n\nThe Pine Manor Improvement Association\u2019s culinary classes are the brainchild of Florida Gulf Coast University professor Chef James Fraser.\n\nHe founded ICARE \u2013 or The Institute for Culinary Awareness Research & Education. Fraser recognized a desperate need in Pine Manor, which is considered a food desert, an area with limited or no access to fresh, healthy and affordable foods.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I so much chose Pine Manor as much as Pine Manor perhaps chose me,\u201d said Fraser. \u201cThey were looking for a program to run, and I was looking for a place to run my program.\u201d\n\nmission is to educate people about where their food comes from through the use an 11,000 square foot community garden, and how to turn that produce into nutritional and delicious meals.\n\n\u201cMy feel is that these students have had maybe a new perspective, and maybe a better way to appreciate or better way to understand the things that are in front of them,\u201d said Fraser. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have soda pop. You don\u2019t have to have convenient-style food. You have options, and you\u2019re in control of those options, and you can direct and manipulate the food choices you make to your benefit.\u201d\n\nInstructing the teen summer class is Chef Pyro Rodriguez. He owns Pyro\u2019s Creations in Naples. The week before graduation is pizza day. Rodriguez teaches the teens how to make dough from scratch.\n\n\u201cWhat is that called? What are we doing now?\u201d Rodriguez asked.\n\n\u201cKneading,\u201d the class said in unison.\n\n\u201cWhy do we knead things?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo activate the gluten in it.\u201d\n\nThis is his first time teaching teens how to cook. Rodriguez makes cooking fun and interesting using foods like pizza, chicken nuggets and desserts from scratch, while using various herbs and produce from the garden outside. He said he does it to give back.\n\n\u201cI wish I would have had it when I was growing up,\u201d said Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez said the biggest challenge so far is keeping the kids focused and leaving their problems at the door.\n\n16-year-old Skylar Smith has a big smile on her face. Her long, brown hair is pulled back into a ponytail. She\u2019s finally wearing the coveted chef\u2019s jacket signifying her status as a graduate.\n\nSkylar\u2019s mom, Dianne Smith, can barely speak through her tears awaiting her daughter\u2019s graduation.\n\n\u201cIt lets them see that there something outside of their regular home and advance,\u201d said Smith. \u201cTo live inside of a dark hole, they have a chance to see that\u2019s there\u2019s something else out there, and that being a cook isn\u2019t a bad thing. It can be something that\u2019s a wonderful thing. Where they can help their community, help the city or wherever they go. It\u2019s something they will always use, whether it\u2019s for their own family or for the good of their community.\u201d\n\nPine Manor Improvement Association Community Coordinator Shari Clark helps run the community garden. She said programs like this help the at-risk community lower its crime rate.\n\nThe Lee County Sheriff\u2019s Office reports cases of simple assault have dropped 71 percent and residential burglary reports have dropped 85 since 2012. Over the past three years, the total number of reported crimes in Pine Manor have dropped 72 percent.\n\n\u201cThis community center is a safe place for kids,\u201d said Clark. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere they can go, and they\u2019re not hanging out on the streets and getting into trouble.\u201d\n\nThe big test is what the teens do after finishing this program. But at the graduation ceremony, the students show off their cooking expertise.\n\nThey make pasta from scratch and work in stations during a buffet-style lunch service for their guests.\n\nSkyler Smith said it went off without a hitch.\n\n\u201cActually, it went pretty fine with all the people we had,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIt was nice and mellow and we got everything done nice and quick. I thought they thought it was fabulous.\u201d\n\nChef Fraser said the impact this program is having on Pine Manor is obvious.\n\n\u201cUltimately you see the type of change at graduation,\u201d said Fraser. \u201cWhere the emotion comes through and the realization of they\u2019ve just done something great or something unusual or something that not everybody has done. And that\u2019s going to set them apart today and hopefully in the future.\u201d\n\nFraser\u2019s hope for ICARE is to make it an affordable alternative to traditional culinary school.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/teaching-teens-cook-may-be-improving-neighborhood", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201508/432265199.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Teaching Teens To Cook May Be Improving This Neighborhood"}, "story_id": 432243346, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Amy Tardif, Tara Calligan", "org_id": 399, "dc": {"title": "Teaching Teens To Cook May Be Improving This Neighborhood"}, "nid": 11640, "datePublished": "2015-08-16", "keywords": "nutrition, food desert", "wordCount": 1008, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd102b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I so much chose Pine Manor as much as Pine Manor perhaps chose me,\u201d said Fraser.\nThe three week course teaches teens cooking basics and the importance of sustainable farming by using the community\u2019s own garden.\nOver the past three years, the total number of reported crimes in Pine Manor have dropped 72 percent.\nI thought they thought it was fabulous.\u201dChef Fraser said the impact this program is having on Pine Manor is obvious.\n\u201cTo activate the gluten in it.\u201dThis is his first time teaching teens how to cook."}
