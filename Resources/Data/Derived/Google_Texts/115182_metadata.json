So was a former president of Brazil. The founders of Google. A former president of Mexico. And John Cusack.\n\nThey were all going to Davos, the Swiss resort that holds an annual conclave of the wealthy and powerful. The jet \u2014 arranged by a Saudi businessman \u2014 provided a luxurious living-room setting for a rolling discussion: Couldn\u2019t the big names at Davos be doing more to solve the world\u2019s big problems?\n\nIn the background, a Clinton staff member named Doug Band had an idea that would change the ex-president\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cOnly Bill Clinton could bring a group like this together,\u201d Band thought.\n\nBill Clinton didn\u2019t need Davos. He could do this himself.\n\nFrom that revelation came the Clinton Global Initiative \u2014 an annual gathering of the wealthy and powerful centered not on a place but on a man. In the decade since, that program has become the public face of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, the sprawling organization that is now at the center of the Clintons\u2019 public and professional lives and a springboard for Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nToday, the Clinton Foundation is unlike anything else in the history of the nation and, perhaps, the world: It is a global philanthropic empire run by a former U.S. president and closely affiliated with a potential future president, with the audacious goal of solving some of the world\u2019s most vexing problems by bringing together the wealthiest, glitziest and most powerful people from every part of the planet.\n\nThe evolution of the foundation, which began as a modest nonprofit focused largely on the ex-president\u2019s library in Arkansas, is a nearly perfect reflection of the Clintons themselves. It was not designed as a master plan but rather has grown, one brainstorm at a time, in accordance with the ambitious, loyal, restless and often scattered nature of its primary namesake. Many programs were sparked by chance encounters in Bill Clinton\u2019s life. A meeting with a Harlem shopkeeper. A friend\u2019s plan to fight AIDS. The flight to Davos. Emergency heart surgery.\n\nThe foundation now includes 11 major initiatives, focused on issues as divergent as crop yields in Africa, earthquake relief in Haiti and the cost of AIDS drugs worldwide. In all, the Clintons\u2019 constellation of related charities has raised $2 billion, employs more than 2,000 people and has a combined annual budget of more than $223 million.\n\nRelated: Investors Should Protest Funds to Clinton Foundation\n\nIn the middle of it all is Bill Clinton, a new kind of post-\n\npresidential celebrity: a convener who wrangles rich people\u2019s money for poor people\u2019s problems. In the process, the foundation elevates the wealthy by giving them entree to one of the nation\u2019s most prominent political families.\n\nThis account of the foundation\u2019s history is drawn from interviews with key players \u2014 including some foundation insiders who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by the charity to comment publicly \u2014 and a review of organization records. Through the foundation, Bill Clinton declined a request for an interview but provided a written statement to The Washington Post.\n\nAt its heart, the Clinton Foundation is an ingenious machine that can turn something intangible \u2014 the Clintons\u2019 global goodwill \u2014 into something tangible: money.\n\nFor the Clintons\u2019 charitable causes. For their aides and allies. And, indirectly, for the Clintons themselves.\n\nBut today, the very things that made the foundation work for Bill Clinton\u2019s purposes \u2014 its mega-dollar donations and its courting of the richest and most powerful interests in the world \u2014 have proved troublesome for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nAs donations have surged, particularly as her bid for the Democratic nomination grew closer, she has been forced to answer for whether those supporters have been not merely giving to a charity but also paying to curry favor with a former secretary of state and a would-be president.\n\nSights on something big\n\nIn the beginning of it all, Bill Clinton was feeling unfulfilled.\n\nIn the months after he left the White House in 2001, he was living at his family\u2019s new home in Chappaqua, N.Y. His wife was in the Senate. His daughter was away, first at Stanford, then at Oxford. He stewed about leftover legal bills and bad press over last-minute pardons.\n\nTo pass the time, he turned to TiVo.\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg had given Clinton an early version of the digital TV recorder. The former president holed up for hours watching movies and the TV shows he had missed while he was president, several friends recalled.\n\n\u201cYou go from running the country,\u201d one foundation insider said, \u201cto doing nothing.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite nothing. There was a Clinton Foundation back then, started in 1997. There were vague plans for future international charity work. But the nonprofit focused mainly on Little Rock, where Clinton was planning a library and a graduate school of public service, and envisioning an urban renaissance for the city that nurtured his political career. So the famously obsessive Clinton obsessed some more about buildings in Little Rock.\n\nThe green roof. The floor made out of recycled tires. The tiny maps of his electoral wins.\n\n\u201cI carried Montana,\u201d Clinton said in one tour, pointing out an error without breaking stride, recalled Skip Rutherford, a former president of the foundation.\n\nClinton took note of the lights in the replica Oval Office. And the ceiling.\n\n\u201cCeiling is too low,\u201d he said, according to Rutherford. Somebody measured. Sure enough: several inches lower than the real thing. Down it came.\n\nClinton\u2019s ambitions began to expand after he \u2014 and the fledgling foundation \u2014 moved into offices in Harlem, in the state where Hillary Clinton had just been elected senator. There, Bill Clinton was met by adoring crowds. And he began to believe that the Clinton Foundation was ready to do more.\n\nAs he had hoped at the outset, the foundation could aim higher than building a museum to the past. It could provide staff and money to address new ideas in the present.\n\nOnce again, as the Harlem offices buzzed with activity, Clinton had people who could follow up on his brainstorms.\n\n\u201cDee Solomon, she owned a card shop on Lenox Avenue,\u201d said Clyde Williams, the foundation\u2019s domestic policy adviser at the time, recounting the meeting that began one such brainstorm. \u201cShe said: \u2018Mr. President, I need your help. I\u2019m a small-business owner in this community.\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what I need you to do, but I need your help.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe president agreed to help. But how?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out,\u201d Williams told him.\n\nThey did. By 2002, Williams had recruited Booz Allen Hamilton, a management consulting firm, and New York University business school students to mentor Solomon and other small-business owners in Harlem.\n\nEvetta Petty, who owns the Harlem\u2019s Heaven hat boutique, said: \u201cIt actually saved me. I think I\u2019d be out of business by now\u201d without that help. Her new mentors told her how to track inventory, build a customer database and offer coupons to bring in buyers. \u201cI mean, I make fabulous hats. But I didn\u2019t really understand how to sell them the best way I could. Now I do.\u201d\n\nThe brainstorms continued. Clinton met high-schoolers who didn\u2019t feel prepared for the SAT. \u201cHe was like, \u2018We\u2019ll do something about it,\u2019\u00ad \u201d Williams recalled. Foundation staff members partnered with the Princeton Review for a national program. He met poor people who didn\u2019t know about the earned-income tax credit. Soon there was a program for that, too.\n\nRelated: Clinton Foundation: 'We Made Mistakes'\n\nWas there ever a time when foundation officials told Clinton that one of his ideas wouldn\u2019t work?\n\n\u201cNot when I was there,\u201d Williams said. He left the foundation in 2006.\n\nAt the same time, Clinton did more formal planning with aides. He was just 56. He would be an ex-president for a long time. He wanted to do something big. And something international. He wanted to stay out of domestic policy, so it didn\u2019t look as though he was meddling in the domain of the president who had succeeded him. Or the senator he was married to.\n\nIra Magaziner, a longtime aide, had an idea that fit both criteria.\n\nNew drugs were available to fight the progress of HIV and AIDS, but in Africa the drugs were too expensive for many people. Magaziner wanted to lower the cost. He knew Clinton didn\u2019t have the money to help, because he was still fundraising for the library and his own legal bills.\n\nBut, Magaziner told Clinton, he had a name brand with limitless value.\n\n\u201cWe should use that reputation and your contacts for something big. If we succeed at this, we can help save millions of lives,\u201d Magaziner wrote in a memo he handed to Clinton at an AIDS conference in 2002. \u201cIf we are not so successful, we still might help save tens of thousands of lives which would not be so bad.\u201d\n\nThe idea was sealed, Magaziner said, when Clinton shared the stage with Nelson Mandela. In a hallway after the event, the former South African president reminded Clinton of a promise: Clinton had said he would do something for Africa after he left the White House.\n\nMandela told Clinton: Do it.\n\n\u201cThat means you do it,\u201d Magaziner told Clinton.\n\nBut the truly big brainstorm of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s early years came on that plane to Davos in 2004. Friends saw Clinton \u2014 the lost, lonely, TiVo-bingeing ex-president \u2014 transformed into a champion of Harlem and an international philanthropist. A celebrity, even among celebrities.\n\nThat night in Switzerland, Band began to work on a memo proposing a new kind of conference.\n\nExpanding in all directions\n\n\u201cNow here\u2019s something else in my hot little hand,\u201d Clinton said, standing on a stage at the Sheraton Times Square, according to media reports. \u201cMy old friend Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa here has just said he\u2019s willing to develop a cellphone network for Gaza and link it to Jordan\u2019s network. Why, thanks, Carlos. Come up here and be recognized.\u201d\n\nIt was September 2005. A year and a half after Band\u2019s brainstorm, the first meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative was a smashing success. Some Clinton aides had been skeptical that it would work, but Clinton had shrewdly timed it to coincide with a meeting of the U.N. General Assembly \u2014 when New York was already chockablock with world leaders looking for something more interesting than a meeting of the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nSo there were dozens of heads of state in attendance. Bono was there. Mick Jagger was there. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. So was Slim, a Mexican billionaire who is one of the world\u2019s richest men.\n\nSo were chief executives from around the world, who wanted to meet heads of state and people like Bono and Slim.\n\nTo get in, their companies had all been required to pledge a \u201ccommitment to action\u201d \u2014 a specific promise to do good in the world. Starbucks pledged to help poor coffee farmers. Goldman Sachs pledged to preserve forests in Tierra del Fuego. The crown prince of Bahrain pledged to \u201ceducate select Bahraini students for leadership roles.\u201d\n\nFor hours, they came to announce their pledges in front of Clinton \u2014 revivalists, suddenly seized by the spirit of charity. Clinton nodded approvingly from center stage as companies and individuals promised to spend their money and resources on projects the foundation would monitor. Their pledges added up to $2.5 billion.\n\nHe was doing good. But the foundation was also doing well: Every ticket to the event cost $15,000, in addition to the do-gooder pledge. (Full-time do-gooders, such as activists and nonprofits, got in free.) Many corporations were also encouraged to make separate donations to the foundation. Corporate sponsors who generally paid at least $250,000 were showcased in the conference\u2019s official literature, and they received invitations to exclusive receptions.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006 \u2014 the years before and after Clinton\u2019s new conclave began \u2014 his foundation\u2019s revenue more than doubled, from $58 million to $134 million.\n\n\u201cThis was the fundraiser of fundraisers for the foundation,\u201d one foundation insider said. The success of this idea \u2014 a Clinton-centered \u201cDavos with a soul\u201d \u2014 had tapped a vast new reservoir of money. \u201cIt\u2019s so much better than going to a rubber-chicken dinner.\u201d\n\nThe model that would guide the Clinton Foundation \u2014 and in many ways later come to vex Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign \u2014 was now in place: Woo the world\u2019s most powerful interests to help the powerless.\n\nRelated: 7 Countries Gave Millions to Clinton's Foundation When She Was at State\n\nBill Clinton, in a statement to The Post, said the foundation has found that \u201cpartnership and cooperation\u201d work best.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with both center-right and center-left governments, large and small businesses and NGOs, and Republicans, Democrats, and independents \u2014 all of whom we have publicly disclosed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 2005 meeting began a golden age for the Clinton Foundation; now energized and well funded, it started to expand in all directions.\n\nThe old ideas kept growing. The business mentoring program that started in Harlem spread to nine cities. The AIDS program that started with Mandela spread until it was reducing the cost of drugs to fight a number of deadly diseases in 70 countries.\n\nIn that program, the Clinton Foundation persuaded drug companies to lower their prices. Then it sent volunteers and staffers to help governments use them, distributing HIV tests, getting those with positive tests to hospitals, setting up pharmacies to handle the drugs.\n\nClinton did little of the detailed work in the AIDS initiative. But he did enough. Aides said he presided at key moments and lent the program his massive goodwill.\n\n\u201cParticularly for the governments in Africa,\u201d the Clinton name opened crucial doors, said Magaziner, who ran the program. \u201cIf we had showed up as a bunch of us and they didn\u2019t know who we were, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily have trusted that we could do what we said.\u201d\n\nIn all, the foundation says, this work has provided cheaper drugs to 9.9 million people. Has it saved millions of lives, as Magaziner promised Clinton in the beginning? A spokeswoman wouldn\u2019t say. She said estimating that number would violate the initiative\u2019s principle of \u201coperating with humility.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Clinton was approving new programs, in widely divergent fields.\n\nAfter the former president had quadruple-bypass surgery, the foundation partnered with the American Heart Association to fight childhood obesity. After Clinton borrowed a plane from Canadian mining magnate Frank Giustra, the foundation began a new development effort \u2014 funded in part by $100 million from Giustra \u2014 that included anti-poverty programs in a number of countries where Giustra has had business interests.\n\nAnd in one case, a Clinton Foundation program began with a dinner party in London.\n\nClinton was seated next to Tom Hunter, a shoe-store and real estate tycoon who was Scotland\u2019s first billionaire. The two men started talking about Africa.\n\n\u201cI knew very little about Africa, so he said, \u2018If you are genuinely interested in Africa, come travel with me,\u2019 \u201d Hunter once told the Christian Science Monitor. He did. After visiting the continent with Clinton, Hunter announced a $100 million gift over 10 years, to fund the new \u201cClinton-Hunter Development Initiative,\u201d to help farmers and alleviate poverty in Malawi and Rwanda.\n\nBy 2009, the foundation had grown to a $242-million-a-year organization. It had nine branches, plus independent fundraising arms in Canada and Britain.\n\nAt the center of it all was Clinton, inhabiting a role he had created for himself: a \u201cconvener.\u201d He wasn\u2019t a philanthropist, at least in the classic sense. He was more like the world\u2019s middleman.\n\nIn many cases, Clinton persuaded the rich and powerful to give, and he lent their gifts a tint of global prestige as they passed through. As Clinton blessed their money, their money blessed him, too. When he traveled to Africa, aides said, massive crowds strained to get a look at him.\n\nThere was other obvious proof of his exalted new status. The world\u2019s most powerful men went out of their way to see him.\n\nSlim, the Mexican billionaire, began traveling to hear Clinton give talks. \u201cHe\u2019d sit there and take notes during Clinton\u2019s speeches,\u201d recalled Amed Khan, a longtime Clinton aide. \u201cHe\u2019d make a list of the 10 greatest leaders on Earth, the 10 greatest orators on Earth.\u201d Clinton was at the top, Khan said.\n\nIn 2007, Slim made an even bigger pledge: $100 million, to support Clinton Foundation projects in Latin America, where Slim\u2019s telecom business is active.\n\nFor Clinton, the foundation had re-created many of the things he loved about the presidency \u2014 cheering crowds, an army of aides and a resonant sense that he was doing good on a global scale.\n\nEven better, in this job, there were no foreign crises to derail his plans. And no meddling Republicans. In fact, the foundation drew contributions from some who were once Clinton\u2019s most bitter GOP enemies, including Newsmax chief executive Christopher Ruddy and conservative mega-donor Richard Mellon Scaife.\n\nThere was also no date when the ride had to end.\n\nThe foundation came to mirror Clinton\u2019s White House in another way, too. It employed many of the same people, including Band and Magaziner, and saw some of the same interoffice infighting for Clinton\u2019s favor.\n\nRelated: How the Clinton Scandals Can Bring Down the Democrats\n\nBut the former White House employee who made the most in the foundation\u2019s heyday was probably Clinton himself. The ex-president didn\u2019t take an official salary from the foundation. But he has received at least $26 million in speaking fees from companies and organizations that were major donors to his foundation. And in many cases, what Clinton got paid to speak about was, in part, the foundation.\n\nBy the Clinton Foundation\u2019s accounting, it has done something good for at least 430 million people in more than 180 countries. (There are about 195 countries in the world, depending on how you count.) When foundation officials last looked back at 2,872 different \u201ccommitments\u201d made at the \u00adClinton-convened conferences, they found that only 4.8 percent had not met basic goals and were therefore \u201cunsuccessful\u201d by foundation standards.\n\nOverall, the foundation spends about 89 percent of its money on its charitable mission, according to the independent American Institute of Philanthropy. Based on that analysis, the watchdog group gave the foundation a rating of A for 2013, on a scale that goes to A-plus. Charity Navigator, the other leading group that rates charities, recently put the foundation on a \u201cwatch list\u201d because of the negative press that has surrounded it. (That group has not issued a rating for the Clinton Foundation, saying the foundation\u2019s structure is too complex to grade.)\n\nBut, for Clinton, the work of a convener has brought unexpected complications.\n\nFor one thing, the work relies on other people\u2019s money. And sometimes, they run short.\n\nBy 2009, Hunter, the Scottish mogul who had pledged the $100 million for development in Africa, had lost big in the financial crisis. He told the foundation he couldn\u2019t give at the pace he had promised \u2014 he needed to retain cash for his for-profit businesses. \u201cHe said he would try to continue to support what we were doing in Rwanda\u201d but could no longer fund the work in Malawi, said Bruce Lindsey, the longtime chairman of the foundation\u2019s board of directors.\n\nIn response, the foundation found another donor for Malawi. Hunter has given $20 million to $25 million so far \u2014 at most a quarter of what he pledged. Hunter\u2019s spokesman said he still plans to honor the full pledge to the Clinton-Hunter Development Initiative, although over a longer period of time.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s broader Africa initiative continued, but under a new name.\n\nIt was called the \u201cClinton Development Initiative.\u201d Named after the convener alone.\n\nCampaign brings changes\n\nBy the end of the last decade, the Clinton Foundation had been built to fit Bill Clinton\u2019s role in the world. He was a private citizen, a super-connected retiree who could raise and spend money with very little scrutiny of who gave it and who got it.\n\nBut then, in 2007, Hillary Clinton began running for president.\n\nSince then, the foundation has been reshaped \u2014 awkwardly, at times \u2014 to accommodate her roles as candidate, secretary of state and, now, candidate again.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s rise has more closely aligned the foundation with the Clintons\u2019 political network. It brought new attention, which at times boosted fundraising.\n\nBut it also brought a totally new level of scrutiny \u2014 and transparency \u2014 to the sprawling operation her husband built.\n\nSome headaches began with her first presidential campaign. For instance, donors to the successful AIDS program began to worry.\n\n\u201cSecretary Clinton was running for president and they thought this should be separate,\u201d Magaziner said. They wanted to be certain that their money would go only to fight disease.\n\nThe concerns sparked a conversation within the foundation about whether to split off the health program, which by that point had grown larger than the rest of the organization.\n\nThe AIDS program, now called the Clinton Health Access Initiative, became an independent legal entity in 2010. Today, based in Boston, it employs 1,500 of the more than 2,000 people who work for Clinton-related charities. Bill Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea Clinton, still sit on its board.\n\n\u201cWe operate on the ground and we make things happen. [The Clinton Global Initiative] is more a convening conference, using Clinton\u2019s convening power to bring groups together,\u201d Magaziner said, explaining the split. \u201cThey\u2019re both legitimate things for a foundation to do. But they\u2019re different.\u201d\n\nThe spinoff added one more level of complexity to an already difficult-to-track organization. A number of record-keeping slip-ups that have earned the foundation recent scrutiny originated with the Boston-based health group.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s tenure at the State Department brought other big changes.\n\nFor one thing, the Obama administration required the foundation to split itself again. The Clinton Global Initiative became its own entity. The idea was to draw a distinction \u2014 at least in theory \u2014 between the secretary\u2019s official interactions with world leaders and her husband\u2019s global schmooze-fests with the same people (which Hillary Clinton also attended).\n\nAlso, for the first time, the Clinton Foundation had to say who had given it money.\n\nThe list stretched to 200,000 names.\n\nIt included foreign governments, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which could ask the State Department to take their side in international arguments. And it included a variety of other figures who might benefit from a relationship \u2014 or the appearance of a relationship \u2014 with the secretary. A businessman close to the ruler of Nigeria. Blackwater Training Center, a controversial military contractor. And dozens of powerful American business leaders, including some prominent conservatives, such as Rupert Murdoch.\n\nIn a brief news conference on the campaign trail last month, Hillary Clinton was asked whether she regretted the way the foundation had handled foreign donations.\n\n\u201cI am so proud of the foundation,\u201d she said in Cedar Falls, Iowa. \u201cIt attracted donations from people, organizations from around the world, and I think that just goes to show that people are very supportive of the lifesaving and life-changing work it\u2019s done here at home and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThe unveiling of the foundation\u2019s donor list also showed another side of Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cconvening.\u201d It appeared that some wealthy donors \u2014 who traveled with Clinton or attended his events \u2014 also had made valuable business connections at the same time.\n\nGiustra, the Canadian mining magnate, attended Clinton-related events and met the leaders of Kazakhstan and Colombia, countries where he would later make significant business deals.\n\nAnd in Haiti, the Clinton Foundation\u2019s point man was Denis O\u2019Brien, an Irish billionaire, who led a network of businesses and charities in donating to the earthquake-ravaged nation. After Clinton introduced O\u2019Brien to Marriott, another foundation donor, the company joined O\u2019Brien to build a hotel near the headquarters of O\u2019Brien\u2019s company in Port-au-Prince.\n\nO\u2019Brien and Giustra have said that Clinton inspired them to give back and that they did not seek to benefit financially from their relationship with him.\n\nToday, the Clintons defend their foundation\u2019s work by saying that its focus always has been on charity.\n\n\u201cWe and our supporters care only about impact, not ideology,\u201d Bill Clinton said in his written statement to The Post. \u201cWe are an entirely nonpolitical foundation.\u201d\n\nHe said he started the foundation as a private citizen to pursue causes he cared about in public life. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been afraid to take on big challenges when we believe we have the chance to make progress and improve lives,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nAt times, the Clinton Foundation has employed several key members of Hillary Clinton\u2019s political team.\n\nDuring her tenure as secretary, the foundation paid a second salary to Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s official personal aide, who acted as a contractor to the foundation. The foundation hired Maura Pally, now acting chief executive, who worked previously for Hillary Clinton at the State Department and served as deputy counsel for her 2008 presidential campaign. Dennis Cheng, another Hillary Clinton aide, went from Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign to the State Department to the foundation and then to the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation also hired as a consultant Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime adviser to both Clintons from their White House days, paying him $10,000 a month starting in 2009 to advise a project to promote Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential legacy, several people familiar with the arrangement said. (Blumenthal\u2019s salary was first reported by Politico; foundation officials would not confirm it.)\n\nRecently released e-mails have shown that while on the foundation payroll, Blumenthal fed back-channel \u2014 and often unreliable \u2014 intelligence reports on Libya to Clinton during her time as secretary.\n\nAfter Hillary Clinton left the State Department, she became a member of the foundation\u2019s board of directors. Like her husband, she has never drawn a salary from the foundation.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s presidential ambitions coincided with a boom in the foundation\u2019s fundraising. Between her departure from the State Department and the formal beginning of her campaign this spring, the Clinton Foundation announced a plan to build a $250 million endowment.\n\nThe money was raised ahead of schedule.\n\nThe foundation also became the new vehicle for her policy ideas.\n\nThere was \u201cToo Small to Fail,\u201d a program to encourage early-childhood education. And \u201cNo Ceilings,\u201d a joint effort with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Its aim is to improve women\u2019s lives around the world, including by boosting literacy, fighting for equal pay and improving health.\n\nStarting in 2011, Chelsea Clinton began work at the foundation, often supporting these and other domestic initiatives. More important, some insiders say, she brought her experience working as a management consultant for several years with McKinsey & Co. She helped lead management changes. Band was ousted.\n\nLindsey was replaced as chief executive in 2013 by Eric Braverman, a former colleague of Chelsea Clinton\u2019s at McKinsey who also had worked with Bill Clinton and others on Haitian relief efforts. Braverman left the organization in January. His position is being permanently filled this week by Donna Shalala, who was secretary of health and human services under Bill Clinton.\n\nNow, as Hillary Clinton begins a new presidential run, she has brought new questions for the foundation and its donors. What if she wins? How could this President Clinton avoid conflicts of interest if she deals with donors to the family charity?\n\nAnd what if she doesn\u2019t win?\n\nCould the foundation still raise money if the Clinton family\u2019s political ambitions are dead and buried?\n\nTrying to head off criticism, Hillary Clinton formally stepped down from the organization\u2019s board when she began her campaign.\n\nThe foundation also has been churning out fact sheets that highlight its charitable work. On Friday, Bill Clinton penned a letter to donors, dismissing criticisms as political attacks and promising that he is \u201cmore committed than ever\u201d to the foundation\u2019s work.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation remains a foundation about everything, sprawling into disjointed fields whose only common bond is that they once caught a Clinton\u2019s eye \u2014 a recent example is a project to fight elephant poaching in Africa, a passion of Chelsea and Hillary Clinton\u2019s.\n\nIn all this time, the foundation has killed off only one major initiative. It was the one that started back in Harlem, when that small-time card-shop owner asked Clinton\u2019s small-time foundation for help.\n\nBy 2012, that mentoring program \u2014 renamed the Clinton Economic Opportunity Initiative \u2014 had recruited hundreds of volunteers over its life.\n\nThen, it was gone.\n\n\u201cThe initiative was too labor-intensive to be successful at scale,\u201d Lindsey, the chairman of the foundation board, said in an e-mailed statement. He added: \u201cThe success or failure of individual businesses was too dependent on factors beyond the foundation\u2019s control.\u201d The NYU business students began working on Clinton projects in Haiti.\n\nIn essence, the work of mentoring small businesses was not easily expanded to a global scale. For the Clintons\u2019 mega-charity, the project that had launched its ambitions was no longer ambitious enough.\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report.\n\nDavid A.
