Polls showed that the charges stuck, and the ongoing uproar in the summer of 2009 almost derailed Obamacare. The same fears have shadowed the law ever since.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether a decision by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to pay Medicare physicians for those difficult and time-consuming discussions with patients and families would spark another round of recriminations.\n\nWith an aging population and growing public awareness that high-tech interventions are often futile at the end of life, doctors have encouraged private insurers to cover advanced-care conversations. Some state Medicaid programs already do so.\n\nMany states have passed laws making it easier to document end-of-life care goals in medical records, and in Congress, bipartisan bills in both the House and the Senate have called for physician reimbursement for such conversations. No bills have made it to floor votes, however.\n\nThe Obama administration tried to implement a similar policy in 2010 \u2014 after it was dropped from the ACA \u2014 but eventually reversed course in response to continued political outcry.\n\nAdvanced-care planning doesn\u2019t mean shunning aggressive care or specifying a \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d order. People can also state in their care directives that they want \u201ceverything done.\u201d\n\nLast year, the American Medical Association developed billing codes for these consultations to nudge CMS toward reimbursement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The provision recalls the &quot;death panels&quot; discussion during the initial battles over Obamcare.", "title": "Medicare expected to pay for end-of-life talks", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/medicare-end-of-life-discussion-pay-death-119712.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/02/150702_medicare_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Congress,Health Care,Medicare,American Medical Association,Physicians,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The provision recalls the &quot;death panels&quot; discussion during the initial battles over Obamcare.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11ed\"", "article_summary": "HEALTH CARE Medicare expected to pay for end-of-life talks The provision recalls the \"death panels\" discussion during the initial battles over Obamcare.\nThe new policy could be part of an annual Medicare physician payment rule, which could be released any day.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether a decision by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to pay Medicare physicians for those difficult and time-consuming discussions with patients and families would spark another round of recriminations.\nAdvocates for better end-of-life care expect Medicare to soon announce that it will start paying physicians for having advanced-care planning conversations with patients \u2014 reviving the widely misunderstood provision that gave rise to \u201cdeath panel\u201d fears and nearly sank the Affordable Care Act.\nAdvocates say they expect it to be included, but they note that it\u2019s no sure thing and that they\u2019ve been disappointed before."}
