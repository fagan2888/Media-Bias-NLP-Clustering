(http://northwestmri.com/mri-scan-3). Long known for their flat rate MRI services, the Lebanon, Oregon based MRI diagnostic imaging center will now support patients with high deductible insurance plans and traditional insurance with direct billing, as well as those without insurance.\n\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150519/217073LOGO\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150519/217072\n\nWith the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, high deductible plans, and basic coverage plans are much more prevalent, but still leave MRI customers with high medical bills. While many more patients now have medical coverage, many policies cover medical imaging at only 50%, even after the deductible is met, leaving the remaining 50% payable by the patient. With the average cost of an Oregon MRI at $1900, paying 50% of that price ($950) is unaffordable for the majority of Oregonians.\n\n\"With health care costs at an all time high, and insurance coverage often falling short of full payment for services like medical imaging, Northwest MRI is committed to making affordable MRI's available to anyone with or without insurance,\" said Michael Bender, founder and owner of Northwest MRI.\n\nAnd it's not just low MRI reimbursement rates that patients have to worry about. High deductible policies often leave the patient to pay the first $2000 to $5000 of their medical bills. With an unexpected MRI, often the entire cost of imaging is not covered by these policies. Northwest MRI offers a $599 flat rate for cash customers with high deductible policies.\n\nNorthwest MRI was founded in 2009, to offer affordable MRI services with the highest quality equipment in a comfortable atmosphere. Northwest MRI has provided over 3000 MRI scans and has delivered thousands of dollars of savings to Oregon patients from around the state. Northwest MRI is leading the state with $599 flat rate pricing, and no hidden fees. Northwest MRI is locally owned and operated in Lebanon, Oregon.\n\nPR Contact Matt Andresen, (541) 231-6220\n\nEmail\n\nMichael Bender, (541) 570-1728\n\nEmail\n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/northwest-mri-to-now-bill-most-insurance-plans-300086038.html\n\nSOURCE Northwest MRI\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://northwestmri.com\n\n", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "oregon", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "LEBANON, Ore., May 20", "description": "LEBANON, Ore., May 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Northwest MRI to Now Bill Most Insurance Plans.", "author": "Northwest MRI", "og": {"url": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/northwest-mri-to-now-bill-most-insurance-plans-300086038.html", "image": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150519/217072", "type": "website", "description": "LEBANON, Ore., May 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Northwest MRI is pleased to announce that they now bill insurance...", "title": "Northwest MRI to Now Bill Most Insurance Plans"}, "Publisher": "PR Newswire", "cf_entity_title": "Northwest MRI to Now Bill Most Insurance Plans", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "keywords": "Northwest MRI, oregon, New Products & Services, Health Care & Hospitals, Medical Pharmaceuticals, Insurance", "date": "2015-05-20T08:30:00Z", "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "twitter": {"site": "@PRNewswire", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LEBANON, Ore., May 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Northwest MRI is pleased to announce that they now bill insurance for their low cost MRI Scans.\nNorthwest MRI was founded in 2009, to offer affordable MRI services with the highest quality equipment in a comfortable atmosphere.\nLong known for their flat rate MRI services, the Lebanon, Oregon based MRI diagnostic imaging center will now support patients with high deductible insurance plans and traditional insurance with direct billing, as well as those without insurance.\nNorthwest MRI has provided over 3000 MRI scans and has delivered thousands of dollars of savings to Oregon patients from around the state.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150519/217073LOGOPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150519/217072With the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, high deductible plans, and basic coverage plans are much more prevalent, but still leave MRI customers with high medical bills."}
