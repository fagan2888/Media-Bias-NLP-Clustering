To say they came unhinged would, of course, falsely suggest that they were hinged to begin with. But you get the idea. Over at Roger Ailes\u2019 network, they\u2019ve decided that the report\u2019s release is a grand scheme to distract the American public from Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to know about it,\u201d Fox\u2019s Jesse Watters said on Outnumbered today, reacting like any good citizen of an authoritarian regime. \u201cI think people do nasty things in the dark, especially after a terrorist attack.\u201d\n\nWatters added that he found it curious that the report\u2019s release came on the same day that health care expert Jonathan Gruber, whose consulted the lawmakers who developed Mitt Romney\u2019s health care plan in Massachusetts and Obamacare four years later, was testifying before Congress. Gruber has come under scrutiny for clumsy remarks insulting the intelligence of voters and once suggesting that Obamacare insurance subsidies were only available to those who received insurance on state-based exchanges, which is the key question in a hot-button case the Supreme Court will likely decide in June.\n\n\u201cI find it ironic that they\u2019re dropping this report on the same day that Gruber\u2019s testifying, to knock that out of the front pages,\u201d Watters said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The network doesn't want to talk about the report's mortifying revelations VIDEO", "title": "Fox News\u2019 sick reaction to torture report: It\u2019s a distraction from Obamacare!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The network doesn't want to talk about the report's mortifying revelations VIDEO", "title": "Fox News\u2019 sick reaction to torture report: It\u2019s a distraction from Obamacare!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/09/fox_news_sick_reaction_to_torture_report_its_a_distraction_from_obamacare/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/andrea_tantaros-e1418150615229.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The network doesn't want to talk about the report's mortifying revelations VIDEO", "title": "Fox News\u2019 sick reaction to torture report: It\u2019s a distraction from Obamacare!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/andrea_tantaros-e1418150615229.png", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Andrea Tantaros, bush administration, Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, conservative media, Democrats, Fox News, Health care reform, jesse watters, Jonathan Gruber, Media Matters, Obamacare, outnumbered, Senate Intelligence Committee, Torture, Torture Investigation, torture report, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "How are they taking the report over at Fox News, long an apologist for the Bush-Cheney administration\u2019s war on terror policies?\nOver at Roger Ailes\u2019 network, they\u2019ve decided that the report\u2019s release is a grand scheme to distract the American public from Obamacare.\n\u201cI find it ironic that they\u2019re dropping this report on the same day that Gruber\u2019s testifying, to knock that out of the front pages,\u201d Watters said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to know about it,\u201d Fox\u2019s Jesse Watters said on Outnumbered today, reacting like any good citizen of an authoritarian regime.\nTo say they came unhinged would, of course, falsely suggest that they were hinged to begin with."}
