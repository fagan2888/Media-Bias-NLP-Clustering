Nikki Haley during her 2012 State of The State address. Behind her is John Yancey McGill. Associated Press\n\nOne of the most Republican states in the nation suddenly has a new lieutenant governor who\u2019s a Democrat.\n\nRepublican Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s new right hand man is Yancey McGill, a long-time state senator from the rural eastern part of the state. The lieutenant governor\u2019s job is pretty powerless and thankless in South Carolina, and few people wanted it when it came open this week after Glenn McConnell decided to step down to become president of the College of Charleston, his alma mater.\n\nAnd it\u2019s especially undesirable because the main job is to preside over the Senate, which goes home Thursday. A new lieutenant governor will be elected in November in a race that\u2019s already underway.\n\nMr. McGill volunteered even though it meant leaving the state senate seat he\u2019s held for 25 years. He isn\u2019t likely to run again, as he narrowly held on to his seat the last election. Republicans grumbled but in the end voted overwhelmingly for him. After all, Mr. McGill\u2019s views aren\u2019t that different from their own \u2013 he has sided with Republicans on ethics and budget matters.\n\nMr. McGill took the pledge in front of his family and friends. There was reason to celebrate after all\u2014he\u2019s the first Democrat to hold the post since 1995, and becomes the only Democrat to currently hold statewide office.\n\nHere\u2019s more from the (Columbia, S.C.)
