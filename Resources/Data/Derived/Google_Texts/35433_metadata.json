Maxx)\n\n\u201cHow much will my MRI cost?\u201d It sounds like a simple question. But before Oct. 1, it was very difficult to get an answer.\n\nNow, Massachusetts is pulling back the curtain on what has been a largely secret world of health care prices. A new state law says health insurers must be able to tell members, in advance, how much a test, treatment or surgery will cost. The idea is to help patients become health care shoppers \u2014 especially patients who have to pay a lot out of pocket before their insurance kicks in.\n\nPhone Calls And Forms\n\nI threw out my back last week and went to the doctor. She sent me down the hall for X-rays. I may need more. So, I was curious: How much does an X-ray cost? I called my insurer, Blue Cross.\n\nThe recorded message didn\u2019t mention health care prices, so I went with, \u201cFor all other inquires, press 0.\u201d\n\nOn came Jamie D. (customer service reps don\u2019t give out their last names) and I explained that I wanted to compare the price of lower back X-rays at a few different facilities.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cDo you know the name of the provider you\u2019re going to be working with?\u201d\n\nI had the doctor\u2019s name, but I didn\u2019t have most of the other information Jamie wanted. Blue Cross, Harvard Pilgrim and Tufts Health Plan will ask you for lots of details before giving you an estimate.\n\nBlue Cross, for instance, wants the procedure and/or diagnostic codes (CPT or ICD-9) for each X-ray I may need, my doctor\u2019s National Provider Identifier (NPI) and the name, address and NPI for my hospital or lab, so it can consolidate all the charges into one estimate.\n\n\u201cTypically with the X-rays there\u2019s going to be a charge for the provider who renders the X-ray and then who\u2019s reading it,\u201d Jamie explained, \u201cso it\u2019s like a professional and a facility charge.\u201d\n\nJamie directed me to an online form. I called my doctor and got the information. Twenty minutes later I clicked submit, and that was for just one lab. If I wanted to compare prices, I\u2019d have to fill out separate forms for each one. Once I\u2019d submitted all the correct information, Blue Cross had 48 hours to get me an estimate. I guess it goes without saying I\u2019d never do this in an emergency.\n\nSo far, it didn\u2019t feel like shopping. The main point of this new requirement is to help patients make smarter choices. We\u2019re supposed to start behaving more like consumers of health care. So where\u2019s the instant gratification I get from finding a designer sweater for $16.99 at T.J. Maxx?\n\nInsurers\u2019 Concerns\n\nInsurers aren\u2019t thinking that way. They all sound a little overwhelmed by trying to put a price tag on medical care.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is really about trying to make this information personalized and useful,\u201d said Derek Abruzzese, vice president for strategy and product development at Tufts Health Plan. \u201cUnfortunately, you know, health care is very complex and so it\u2019s difficult to make things simple, straightforward and precise.\u201d\n\nSo many things can change when patients actually go in for treatment.\n\n\u201cYou know, they needed an extra lab, an extra MRI or some sort of diagnostic that [neither] we, nor the member or the provider for that matter, could have foreseen at the time that estimate was requested,\u201d said Bill Gerlach, director of member decision support at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts.\n\nInsurers are also worried about getting the price right because the new state health cost control law puts insurers on the hook if their estimates are wrong.\n\n\u201cIf we show an estimate that is lower and someone goes and pays more, then we are liable. We\u2019re working very hard \u2026 to be accurate,\u201d said Sue Amsel, who is working on a new health care shopping tool that Harvard Pilgrim Health Care hoped to have up and running this month.\n\nHarvard Pilgrim\u2019s site is delayed until later this fall. Tufts\u2019 shopping tool won\u2019t be ready until the spring. Both are providing estimates over the phone for now.\n\nBlue Cross has a cost estimator for its PPO members and will expand the tool to HMO members early next year. But unlike Tufts and Harvard Pilgrim, Blue Cross will only offer binding estimates for members who fill out a form online or call the 1-800 member line.\n\nIn the meantime, Amsel has a demo of Harvard Pilgrim\u2019s \u201cNow I Know\u201d site (see below).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to just click on MRI,\u201d Amsel said, showing me on my laptop. Next, she selected a body part, in this case the brain. A new page popped up that showed how much a Harvard Pilgrim member, with a high deductible plan, would have to pay for the most common brain MRI at different hospitals around Boston.\n\n\u201cHere you see that your range is from $372 to $1,223,\u201d she said. Amsel says that kind of range, where one hospital is paid three to four times more for the same test, is not unusual.\n\nOkay, this is not as exciting as my bargain sweater, but Amsel says people who have to spend a lot of their own money before insurance picks up the tab need to know how much their care will cost.\n\n\u201cWe know that people are frustrated,\u201d she said. \u201cThey go to the doctor not knowing, they come back with a big bill that they didn\u2019t expect. They weren\u2019t able to prepare for it, they weren\u2019t able to plan for it, so I think this will help them quite a bit.\u201d\n\nYour insurer should spell out what\u2019s included and what\u2019s not in the estimate you receive. Pay close attention to what is not part of the estimated price, because you may have to pay for any extras.\n\nA new era is dawning in Massachusetts. We can find out, in advance, how much everything from a blood test to open heart surgery costs. The requirement for insurers began Oct. 1; the same rule takes effect for hospitals in January. But in these early days, getting an accurate price still isn\u2019t quick or easy.\n\n\u2014 Heres a demo screengrab of the cost calculator Harvard Pilgrim hopes to have ready this fall:\n\nListen to the audio version of this story below:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new state law says health insurers must be able to tell members, in advance, how much a test, treatment or surgery will cost.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A new state law says health insurers must be able to tell members, in advance, how much a test, treatment or surgery will cost.", "title": "In Mass., You Can Now Get Prices For Health Care In Advance (But It\u2019s No T.J.
