Lakewood Hospital to be replaced by a family health center



Lakewood Hospital to close for family health center: Q&A (video)

Cleveland Clinic and the Lakewood Hospital Association will close Lakewood Hospital and replace it with a health center by late 2016, officials said today.

That's a decade sooner than a current city contract calls for. But Mayor Mike Summers and hospital officials said during a press conference Thursday that the existing business model of 233 inpatient beds is not sustainable.

Why is the change taking place?

Lakewood Hospital, which is owned by the city and run by the Cleveland Clinic, has been plagued by low occupancy rates. Half the beds are occupied at any one time. The hospital has been operating at a loss since 2005, Cleveland Clinic President and CEO Toby Cosgrove said.

"The need for inpatient care for people living in Lakewood has declined," he said. "But the demand for outpatient services is rising." | Read Bruce Geiselman's story
