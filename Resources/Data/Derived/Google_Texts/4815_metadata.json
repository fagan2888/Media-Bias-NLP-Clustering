Those of us who actually treat pancreatic cancer patients, we see that occasionally.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut even the most aggressive regimen is a combination of three very toxic chemical agents that have only a marginal benefit. In a person with Stage IV pancreatic cancer, it\u2019s a little like you\u2019re playing defense, but the other\u2019s team is on your 1-yard line.\u201d\n\n\n\nCarter said the cancer was discovered during a surgical procedure to remove \u201ca small mass\u201d in his liver and that it had spread.\n\n\n\nWhen cancer is found in the liver, it has often spread from somewhere else in the body \u2013 often the pancreas. While pancreatic cancer survival rates have been improving, the disease is still considered incurable for the nearly 49,000 Americans diagnosed with it annually \u2014 80 percent of whom die within a year.\n\n\n\nWithout treatment, a pancreatic cancer patient\u2019s survival is typically measured in months, with less-aggressive chemotherapy extending survival six to seven months, Dr. Bose notes.\n\n\n\nHe adds that new immunotherapy techniques, which aim to boost the body\u2019s immune system to combat cancer, hold promise for the future. But there are no experimental therapies and drugs undergoing clinical trials that are likely to benefit patients in the near term.\n\n\n\n\u201cImmunotherapy has become a hot topic and very hopeful topic, and it\u2019s been working for such disease as melanoma and brain tumors. Unfortunately, some of the agents that have been developed to boost the immune system to fight those cancers haven\u2019t been very helpful in targeting pancreatic cancer, but this is an evolving field.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe adds that Carter is living proof that living a healthy lifestyle can counteract familial and genetic risks that increase the odds of developing cancer.\n\n\n\nCarter has maintained he may have escaped pancreatic cancer, at least up until now, because he was the only member of his family who didn\u2019t smoke.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s right about that,\u201d Dr. Bose says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2016 NewsmaxHealth.
