The public probably knows more about the CIA than about the judiciary.\u201d\n\nNow that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s 2014-15 term is about to begin, we should again ask ourselves about that court\u2019s near-total lack of transparency.\n\nDuring the last week of June every year, the Supreme Court takes over the news cycle with the announcement of blockbuster cases. That\u2019s great, but June only highlights the secrecy that exists at the court during the rest of the year. For example, only a handful of people get to see those cases argued by some of the best (and increasingly specialized) advocates in the country. Why? Because the court refuses to allow the American people to watch oral arguments on television, or even listen to them live over the Internet.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even if the justices had non-frivolous reasons to prohibit cameras at the court\u2019s oral arguments (they don\u2019t), none of those reasons would apply to decision announcement days when lawyer showboating is not possible (they don\u2019t talk, and they often aren\u2019t even there, as the court does not announce ahead of time which decisions it will hand down on which days). Oh, and the justices have complete and total control over the \u201chand down\u201d script. But the announcements of decisions like Hobby Lobby (religious freedom) and Citizens United (First Amendment campaign speech) are major moments in American history, and only about 250 lucky folks who happen to be at the court are allowed to witness historical moments in person, in the courtroom.\n\nRecently, Justice Stephen Breyer was asked about the court\u2019s reluctance to enter the 21st century and allow a broad segment of the American people to observe what the lucky few who are actually in the courtroom are allowed to see. He had no specific objections but simply said that \u201call of us are conservative where the court is concerned. We are trustees \u2026 So I\u2019ll say we\u2019re nervous about it. And probably that\u2019s the most favorable you\u2019ll get. I mean, nervous, uncertain, not aware of what\u2019s going to happen. And as long as we\u2019re uncertain \u2026 it\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\nWith respect to Justice Breyer, this decision shouldn\u2019t be tough at all. State supreme courts, lower federal courts and supreme courts in other countries like Canada and the U.K. televise their public hearings with great success. It is well past time for our Supreme Court to do the same.\n\nThe lack of cameras at the Supreme Court is only one of many ways the justices hide their work from the American people. When deciding whether to recuse themselves from a given case (not participate because of a conflict of interest), the justices rarely explain their decisions or hold hearings to hear arguments on the motion to recuse. Last term, for example, Justice Samuel Alito first recused himself without any explanation from an important case concerning new live-streaming technology, and then reversed himself right before the oral arguments, again without any explanation. His initial reasons and his change of mind remain a mystery.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The court plays a growing activist role in our politics and lives -- yet all nine justices hide in the shadows", "title": "Scalia has a secrecy problem: Hiding and hypocrisy at the Supreme Court", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The court plays a growing activist role in our politics and lives -- yet all nine justices hide in the shadows", "title": "Scalia has a secrecy problem: Hiding and hypocrisy at the Supreme Court", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/29/scalia_has_a_secrecy_problem_hiding_and_hypocrisy_at_the_supreme_court/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/antonin_scalia4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The court plays a growing activist role in our politics and lives -- yet all nine justices hide in the shadows", "title": "Scalia has a secrecy problem: Hiding and hypocrisy at the Supreme Court", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/antonin_scalia4.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eric Segall and Lisa McElroy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, David Souter, Editor's Picks, Elena Kagan, Hobby Lobby, John Roberts, Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9cd7\"", "article_summary": "State supreme courts, lower federal courts and supreme courts in other countries like Canada and the U.K. televise their public hearings with great success.\nDuring the last week of June every year, the Supreme Court takes over the news cycle with the announcement of blockbuster cases.\nIt is well past time for our Supreme Court to do the same.\nThe lack of cameras at the Supreme Court is only one of many ways the justices hide their work from the American people.\nBecause the court refuses to allow the American people to watch oral arguments on television, or even listen to them live over the Internet."}
