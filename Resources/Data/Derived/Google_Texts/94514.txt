An Oklahoma man has died after being infected with a rare amoeba during a swim in Lake Murray, the NY Daily News reported. This is just a month after brain-eating amoebas killed a teen living in Minnesota.

Health officials reported his death was caused by Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), a disease that results from contracting the single-celled amoeba Naegleria fowleri. This deadly, brain-eating organism is found in most lakes, ponds, and rivers, but multiplies most rapidly in warm, stagnant water. People are more likely to contract the amoeba when they dive or otherwise submerge their head underwater. In this position, amoebas can easily travel up the nose and into the brain, where it proceeds to destroy tissue.

Once infected with PAM, a person's symptoms range from high fever, to headache and vomiting, which worsens as the disease spreads. Severe symptoms associated with brain-eating amoebas include seizures, hallucinations, even coma. The disease cannot be spread from person to person.

Southern states tend to have more cases of PAM, and since 1998, seven cases have occurred in Oklahoma alone. This latest tragedy highlights the importance of certain safe swimming behaviors, especially in late summer when water temperatures are increased. Making a point not to dive in stagnant water, which increases the chance of water going up a swimmer's nose, in addition to using earplugs or simply holding the nose during swims can reduce overall risk.
