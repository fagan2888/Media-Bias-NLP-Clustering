It brings something special. It\u2019s like taking Old America away, a little more of it,\u201d said Glenn Benthin, a part-time Sunset Beach resident who was convinced he should buy a condo here after whittling a day away at Caddy\u2019s four years ago.\n\n\u201cI could see myself coming back here and sitting all day long.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nResidents with a longer history in Sunset Beach have mixed feelings about the bar that at times has been overrun with rude tourists, leading to rules restricting the locals from bringing their own beverages to the surrounding beach during high season, a policy that doesn\u2019t apply elsewhere on the island.\n\n\u201cAs far as a bar, Caddy\u2019s is more of a touristy restaurant; it\u2019s not really a restaurant or a bar to hang out at,\u201d said Eric Corson, president of the Sunset Beach Civic Association.\n\n\u201cThe locals just go hang on the beach. They bring their own chair and cooler.\u201d\n\nWhile Corson is no regular at Caddy\u2019s, a part of him still would be sorry to see it go. He hopes the building at least would remain as a public snack shack should the state end up buying it from Amico.\n\nCorson remembers visiting Sunset Beach back when Caddy\u2019s was called the Driftwood Inn.\n\n\u201cIt was more of a seedier, biker bar type. It wasn\u2019t as touristy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI guess back then the tourists were all kind of seedier themselves.\u201d\n\nBefore skyrocketing land values drove construction of luxury waterfront mansions, beach residents could hoof it over to a variety of bars such as Beach Nutts, The Penguin and Hank\u2019s Seabreeze.\n\nThose shacks that once lined the beach in the 1960s slowly went extinct between the mid-1980s up until the recent real estate boom, longtime resident Allan Sansotta says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crying shame that the character of Sunset Beach must change. We who have been spectators to that change for nearly 50 years remember, fondly, the Sunset of our youth,\u201d Sansotta said.\n\n\u201cPrice per foot on the Gulf made the small beach bars impossible.\u201d\n\nStill, Amico, who also has a large stake in the historic Janus block in downtown St. Petersburg, saw profits to be made at one of the old shacks when he bought it and the surrounding lands in 2001.\n\nInitially, neighbors and city officials praised him for overhauling the faded bar at 9000 W. Gulf Blvd. with new upper and lower decks, beach picnic tables, landscaping and a host of other improvements that made his renamed Caddy\u2019s on the Beach into a unique, all-day attraction.\n\nAmico\u2019s claim on the beach behind the bar clashed with officials at Florida\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection, who insisted portions that had eroded into the Gulf of Mexico and later were restored artificially with offshore sand were public property.\n\nAfter this dispute spoiled Amico\u2019s first attempt to sell the property to Pinellas County in 2005, he sued the state, arguing that the historic construction of jetties to the north at Johns Pass had altered the natural flow of sand and starved his beach, necessitating those frequent restoration projects.\n\nThe ensuing settlement clearly spells out the owner\u2019s rights to the beach behind and adjacent to Caddy\u2019s \u2014 even the sand replenished every few years with state and federal funds, Amico says.\n\nWhen Amico again looked to sell in 2012, DEP officials suggested the beach wasn\u2019t part of his private property and he filed another lawsuit seeking damages from the state.\n\nNow the state agency is considering just buying Caddy\u2019s to settle the dispute.\n\nIn February, officials at the city of Treasure Island and Pinellas County got a letter asking if either government would object to such a sale.\n\nTreasure Island would be out about $11,000 in annual property taxes, City Manager Reid Silverboard told commissioners at a recent meeting, but the state likely would turn over the land to the city to operate as a park.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re talking about when they purchase that property is actually tearing down all the buildings, clearing that property,\u201d Silverboard said.\n\n\u201cIf the city acquired the property, we would want beach parking as well as a restaurant facility, maybe pavilion rental.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nCommissioners voted unanimously not to object to a possible sale.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be asked, but in the long run, it doesn\u2019t matter if we have an objection or not. If they\u2019re going to settle, they\u2019re going to settle,\u201d said Alan Bildz, a city commissioner who represents Sunset Beach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure some people are going to have a half a tear in their eye,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen Amico mentioned the prospect of a sale, there was an outcry among the bar\u2019s 28,000 Facebook fans, many of whom said they plan vacations around hanging out there.\n\nBenthin wrote a letter to the city saying Treasure Island itself might \u201cfade away\u201d\u2019 should Caddy\u2019s disappear.\n\nA world traveler who was born in Germany and now lives in Oklahoma, Benthin says Sunset Beach\u2019s last bar on the beach is unlike any other place on the globe.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re rich, poor, have money, young, old, whatever \u2014 if you go there, you\u2019re going to see a little bit of everything,\u201d said the 54-year-old. Benthin knew nothing about the Tampa Bay area when a friend invited him for a visit four years ago and took him to Treasure Island.\n\n\u201cWe had breakfast on the picnic table and I looked across there, I looked at a shack across the street from Caddy\u2019s and I said, \u2018I could live right there,\u2019 \u201d said Benthin, who ended up buying a condo rather than a shack.\n\nMany locals have resented Amico for turning their chilled-out neighborhood beach into a raucous tourist party zone, and the Caddy\u2019s owner has had his share of conflicts with the city about parking, rules on the beach and other issues.\n\nBut the spot that had become spring break central has calmed down considerably in the last couple of years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been pretty cool about it. He\u2019s definitely enforced the no-coolers-on-his-beach policy and I don\u2019t blame him, but I don\u2019t know how it all became his beach so fast,\u201d Corson said.\n\nAmico says he has turned a shabby bar into a business that grosses $5 million a year by offering visitors and locals a place on the beach where they can get cheap beer, food and free beach chairs all day.\n\n\u201cA family can come there and they can feel like they went on vacation and spend $60,\u201d Amico said.\n\nDespite all the ongoing legal wrangling, Amico says the bar is still very profitable.\n\nHe\u2019s not sure when or if the state will make him an offer or if that\u2019s how the case finally will be resolved.\n\nIf the price is right, though, Amico is ready to get out of the business and experience a little bit of the lifestyle Caddy\u2019s patrons come out to enjoy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m too old to get beat up anymore. I\u2019ve been fighting my whole life and I\u2019m too old to keep fighting. I want to relax and enjoy my life,\u201d he said.\n\njboatwright@tampatrib.com\n\n727-215-1277\n\nTwitter: @JBoatwrightTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 01 Mar 2015 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "Beach bums and retired bankers once had a half-dozen bars right on the sand on the south end of this island where they could drink and watch the sun set over the Gulf of Mexico.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Beach bums and retired bankers once had a half-dozen bars right on the sand on the south end of this island where they could drink and watch the sun set over the Gulf of Mexico.", "title": "Sun may be setting on Caddy\u2019s on the Beach", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pinellas-county/sun-may-be-setting-on-caddys-on-the-beach-20150301/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150301/ARTICLE/150309958/EP/1/2/EP-150309958.jpg", "height": 2662}, "updated_time": "2015-03-01T11:20:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Beach bums and retired bankers once had a half-dozen bars right on the sand on the south end of this island where they could drink and watch the sun set over the Gulf of Mexico.", "title": "Sun may be setting on Caddy\u2019s on the Beach", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150301/ARTICLE/150309958/AR/0/AR-150309958.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-03-01T01:00:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-03-01T11:20:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29d0\"", "article_summary": "Today on Sunset Beach, there\u2019s only one place where the party still spills out from bar stools directly to beach chairs.\nAlthough it\u2019s had many names through the years, the owner of Caddy\u2019s on the Beach says his two-story restaurant and drinking joint on Gulf Boulevard is the longest continuously operating beach bar in Florida.\nCorson remembers visiting Sunset Beach back when Caddy\u2019s was called the Driftwood Inn.\nwith new upper and lower decks, beach picnic tables, landscaping and a host of other improvements that made his renamed Caddy\u2019s on the Beach into a unique, all-day attraction.\n\u201cAs far as a bar, Caddy\u2019s is more of a touristy restaurant; it\u2019s not really a restaurant or a bar to hang out at,\u201d said Eric Corson, president of the Sunset Beach Civic Association."}
