Recently leaked files include Crackle details, along with emails about Ryan Gosling, Leonardo DiCaprio and Will Smith's kids

Hackers released a seventh cache of files leaked from Sony Pictures Entertainment on Saturday, along with a promise of more to come.

Someone claiming to be a member of hacking group Guardians of Peace sent an email to journalists that listed two web addresses where new Sony information could be found.

The email also said that a "Christmas gift" would be arriving soon that will "put Sony Pictures into the worst state." Countless Sony files, revealing everything from embarrassing email threads to salary details, have been released online following a Nov. 24 cyberattack on the studio.

According to Recode, the newest batch of files includes a PowerPoint presentation given about Sony-backed video site Crackle.

The Daily Beast reports that Sony files released on Dec. 5 include emails from the studio's execs about several film stars.
