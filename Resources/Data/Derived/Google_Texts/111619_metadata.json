And his 85 penalty minutes led the NHL, 14 more than the Avalanche\u2019s Cody McLeod, who was second. Clearly, having these two guys on the same team would cause problems.\n\nBackground: Downie played 33 games for the Avalanche over three seasons, beginning late in 2011-12 when he was acquired from Tampa Bay in a three-team trade that sent Avs defenseman Kyle Quincey to Detroit. Downie suffered a major knee injury and played just two games during the 48-game, lockout-shortened season of 2013.\n\nChambers\u2019 take: It didn\u2019t look like a wise trade at the time, but sending Downie to Philadelphia early last season for Max Talbot was a good move. At the time, Downie was a pending unrestricted free agent making $700,000 more than Talbot, who is locked in through 2015-16 at relatively low salaries of $1.25 million and $1 million in the final two years. The Flyers let Downie into the UFA market, and his best deal was a one-year, $1 million contract with Pittsburgh. Downie has helped the Penguins but, unlike Talbot, he takes unwise penalties and is viewed as a bomb ready to explode and hurt the team. Talbot, 30, is a better forward and teammate.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NHL,Spotlight,Steve Downie", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Steve Downie, a 27-year-old who was a first-round draft pick in 2005, entered Saturday tied for seventh on his team in scoring.", "title": "Steve Downie: Spotlight in the Penguins forward", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/12/13/steve-downie-spotlight-penguins-forward/20342/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/12/Steve-Downie.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Steve Downie, a 27-year-old who was a first-round draft pick in 2005, entered Saturday tied for seventh on his team in scoring.", "title": "Steve Downie: Spotlight in the Penguins forward", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/12/13/steve-downie-spotlight-penguins-forward/20342/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/12/Steve-Downie.jpg", "creator": "@mikechambers", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Steve Downie, a 27-year-old who was a first-round draft pick in 2005, entered Saturday tied for seventh on his team in scoring."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b2a\"", "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Steve Downie, forward, PenguinsWhen: The Avalanche begins a three-game trip Thursday at Pittsburgh.\nWhat\u2019s up: Steve Downie, a 27-year-old who was a first-round draft pick in 2005, entered Saturday tied for seventh on his team in scoring.\nDownie has helped the Penguins but, unlike Talbot, he takes unwise penalties and is viewed as a bomb ready to explode and hurt the team.\nTalbot, 30, is a better forward and teammate.\nDownie suffered a major knee injury and played just two games during the 48-game, lockout-shortened season of 2013."}
