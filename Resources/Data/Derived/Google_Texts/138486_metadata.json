He frustrated Alvarez early, pounded him with big right hands in the middle rounds, and made him look just like he said he would \u2014 like any other opponent.\n\nMayweather was favored 117-111 and 116-112 on two ringside scorecards while a third inexplicably had the fight 114-114. The Associated Press scored it 119-109 for Mayweather.\n\n\u201cI just listened to my corner, listened to my dad,\u201d Mayweather said. \u201cMy dad had a brilliant game plan, and I went out there and got the job done.\u201d\n\nMayweather remained unbeaten in 45 fights and added another piece of the junior middleweight title to his collection in a fight that was fought at a 152-pound limit. Alvarez weighed in at that weight, but was an unofficial 165 pounds when he got into the ring while Mayweather, who weighed in at 150 1/2 pounds, was an even 150.\n\nThe extra weight did Alvarez no good and the punching power that brought him 30 knockouts in 43 fights wasn\u2019t a help either. The Mexican star was seldom able to land a solid punch, with most of his punches either missing or glancing off of Mayweather.\n\n\u201cNo doubt he\u2019s a great fighter, a very intelligent fighter,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cThere was no solution for him.\u201d\n\nMayweather said he actually had to put on weight during the day to even get close to what he weighed the day before.\n\n\u201cWhen I woke up this morning, I was 146 pounds, so I had to call my chef and get something in my system,\u201d he said.\n\nMayweather\u2019s speed was the difference all night as he was able to land straight rights and left jabs, then get out of the way before Alvarez was able to respond. But while Mayweather used great defense, he wasn\u2019t afraid to attack often and at different angles, finding Alvarez with punches he couldn\u2019t anticipate.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very talented, very elusive,\u201d Alvarez said.\n\nWhen it was over, Mayweather didn\u2019t even celebrate, walking over to a corner to look at the crowd. Just another payday, just another win for Money May. The only surprise came when it was announced the decision wasn\u2019t unanimous, with judge C.J. Ross scoring it even.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t control what the judges do,\u201d Mayweather said.\n\nAlvarez was supposed to be Mayweather\u2019s greatest challenge and he did his best to force the action. Like others, though, he couldn\u2019t solve the puzzle that is Mayweather and spent much of his night punching at an opponent who had already moved away from him.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to get him, it\u2019s extremely simple,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great fighter, very intelligent. The frustration was getting in there, but he\u2019s a great fighter. We tried to catch him.\u201d\n\nAlvarez said before the fight that he had the game plan to solve Mayweather\u2019s tricky defense and fast hands. If it failed, he said, he had other game plans he would implement to win the fight.\n\nBut he had no plan that worked once he got into the ring and found out just how difficult Mayweather can be.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, he also missed me a lot,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cHis punches landed on my gloves.\u201d\n\nRingside punch stats showed Mayweather dominance, crediting him with landing 232 of 505 punches to 117 of 526 for Alvarez.\n\nThe sellout crowd of 16,746 at the MGM Grand on Mexican Independence weekend tried its best to urge Alvarez (42-1-1) on, but the cheers of \u201cCanelo! Canelo!\u201d were faint and wistful by the late rounds. Mayweather was so much in charge that the only question was whether the ringside judges would allow him to pitch a shutout.\n\nThey didn\u2019t, but that was the only disappointment on a night that Mayweather solidified his claim to being one of the best ever and padded his bank account in a way no other fighter has ever done.\n\nMayweather came out aggressive and used his speed to hit Alvarez with one or two shots in the early rounds and then get safely out of the way. Alvarez tried to stalk Mayweather and throw right hands, but Mayweather was usually safely out of the way by the time the punches arrived.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tough competitor,\u201d Mayweather said. \u201cA tough competitor.\u201d\n\nAlvarez kept trying to force the fight, but every time he went after Mayweather he paid for it with a counter right or a combination to the head. By the fourth round he was beginning to get frustrated, landing a low blow that angered Mayweather, who was further angered when Alvarez refused to touch gloves with him to resume the fight.\n\nThe fight was one of the richest ever \u2014 if not the richest ever \u2014 with a live gate of $20 million and at least another $100 million from pay-per-view. Tickets were so hot that celebrities were actually offering to buy them and some tickets were being offered online for as much as $29,000.\n\nMayweather was the big beneficiary of that, making a guaranteed $41.5 million to $5 million for Alvarez. Add in his purse from his win over Robert Guererro in May and Mayweather made $73 million in two fights \u2014 easily making him the highest-paid athlete in the country.\n\nAlvarez had some star power himself, with his red hair, good lucks and big punching power winning over most of his native Mexico. The fight was on free TV in Mexico, and some estimates were that 70 million people would watch.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fighting off his shortest layoff in years, Mayweather was sharp, efficient and sometimes brutal in dismantling an unbeaten fighter who was bigger and was supposed to punch harder.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fighting off his shortest layoff in years, Mayweather was sharp, efficient and sometimes brutal in dismantling an unbeaten fighter who was bigger and was supposed to punch harder.", "title": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. dominates Canelo Alvarez for record payday", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/15/floyd-mayweather-jr-dominates-canelo-alvarez-recor/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/15/mayweather-alvarez-bo_lanc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/15/mayweather-alvarez-bo_lanc.jpg", "description": "Fighting off his shortest layoff in years, Mayweather was sharp, efficient and sometimes brutal in dismantling an unbeaten fighter who was bigger and was supposed to punch harder.", "card": "summary", "title": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. dominates Canelo Alvarez for record payday"}, "Author": "Tim Dahlberg", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, CJ Ross"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNo doubt he\u2019s a great fighter, a very intelligent fighter,\u201d Alvarez said.\nMayweather was the big beneficiary of that, making a guaranteed $41.5 million to $5 million for Alvarez.\nAlvarez tried to stalk Mayweather and throw right hands, but Mayweather was usually safely out of the way by the time the punches arrived.\nBut while Mayweather used great defense, he wasn\u2019t afraid to attack often and at different angles, finding Alvarez with punches he couldn\u2019t anticipate.\nThe frustration was getting in there, but he\u2019s a great fighter."}
