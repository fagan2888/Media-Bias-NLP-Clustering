Chris Smith (R-N.J.) and right-wing media outlets raising hell.\n\nBut the only reason that congressional staffers have to choose from these plans at all is because a Republican amendment to Obamacare requires it. Thanks to this amendment, congressional staffers, who once had to pay for abortions out of pocket, can now buy insurance that covers abortions.\n\nThe bizarre story of how a conservative, anti-abortion Republican ended up expanding abortion access for congressional staff dates back to the initial fight over the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Here's how it happened: The Obamacare exchanges were expressly designed to provide insurance to the uninsured, so congressional staffers\u2014who, like most Americans, already had insurance\u2014were initially excluded. Republicans claimed that this amounted to Democrats \"exempting\" themselves and their staff from Obamacare, and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) introduced an amendment that would force members of Congress and their staff to use the exchanges. Grassley's proposal was intended to embarrass Democrats. But Democrats called Grassley's bluff, and the law passed with his amendment.\n\nBut Grassley's measure forced congressional staff out of the Federal Health Benefits Program, which federal law prohibited from offering any abortion coverage. Under the the federal plan, any congressional employee who wanted an abortion had to pay for it out of pocket. Now that they're on the Obamacare exchanges, though, congressional employees will only pay out of pocket for abortion insurance. They'll be able to choose any of the 112 plans available via Washington, DC's health care exchange, only 9 of which do not cover abortion.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "How a Republican publicity stunt allowed Congressional staffers to purchase abortion coverage for the first time in decades.", "title": "Oops: Republican Obamacare amendment expanded abortion access for GOP staffers", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/12/republican-obamacare-amendment-gives-abortion-coverage-gop-staffers", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/screen_shot_2013-12-05_at_6.17.55_pm.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/12/republican-obamacare-amendment-gives-abortion-coverage-gop-staffers", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/screen_shot_2013-12-05_at_6.17.55_pm.png", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/screen_shot_2013-12-05_at_6.17.55_pm.png"}, "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Oops: Republican Obamacare amendment expanded abortion access for GOP staffers"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Congress,Reproductive+Rights,Top+Stories", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1d7\"", "article_summary": "Now that they're on the Obamacare exchanges, though, congressional employees will only pay out of pocket for abortion insurance.\nBut the only reason that congressional staffers have to choose from these plans at all is because a Republican amendment to Obamacare requires it.\nThe bizarre story of how a conservative, anti-abortion Republican ended up expanding abortion access for congressional staff dates back to the initial fight over the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\nBut Grassley's measure forced congressional staff out of the Federal Health Benefits Program, which federal law prohibited from offering any abortion coverage.\nThanks to this amendment, congressional staffers, who once had to pay for abortions out of pocket, can now buy insurance that covers abortions."}
