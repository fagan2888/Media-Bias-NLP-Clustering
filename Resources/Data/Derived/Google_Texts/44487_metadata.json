It is a point Republicans on the campaign trail are happy to make. The question is what their alternatives would be. Every GOP presidential candidate\u2019s health-policy platform begins with repealing the law, but for most, that\u2019s also where it ends, at least for now.\n\nJONATHAN ERNST/REUTERS\n\nAmong the 12 candidates still in the GOP race, only two, ex-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, have posted health plans, and both use broad brush-strokes. Mr. Bush proposes reducing federal health-care regulations and creating new tax credits to help people buy coverage; Mr. Carson wants to expand tax-protected health-savings accounts. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has described his health-policy ideas in a few paragraphs in an op-ed piece that also indicates support for such measures. Louise Radnofksy reports.\n\nJERRY SEIB\u2019S EARLY HIT: PAUL RYAN BRINGS A DOSE OF KEMP OPTIMISM INTO THE 2016 CAMPAIGN\n\nBack in 1993, the late Jack Kemp\u2014fresh from a career in Congress and a seat in the Cabinet, and having established himself as heir to Ronald Reagan\u2019s brand of optimistic conservatism\u2014set up a new advocacy group called Empower America. He hired as an economics assistant a bright young 23-year-old from Wisconsin.That assistant\u2019s name: Paul Ryan. This weekend\u2019s Kemp Forum event in South Carolina raises the question of whether there is anyone in the Republican Party, other than Mr. Ryan, capable of carrying to a national audience the sunny Kemp message of what he called bleeding-heart conservatism.

The Clinton campaign said its plan would closely resemble the pending legislation, called the Family Act, in other ways. Like that legislation, it would include 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave and a minimum two-thirds wage replacement rate. Her announcement came a day before her rival for the nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, plans a news conference in Iowa to discuss his paid family leave program. He has been highly critical of Mrs. Clinton for her rejection of the pending bill, which he supports. Anna Louie Sussman and Laura Meckler report.\n\nPlus: Bill Clinton brushed off Donald Trump\u2019s latest effort to draw attention to the former president\u2019s dealings with women, suggesting the Republican presidential front-runner would have to get closer to capturing the GOP nomination to merit a response \u2026 Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to limit his sold-out rally in Vermont Thursday night to those who had pledged to support him for president didn\u2019t work out exactly as planned \u2026 The State Department\u2019s internal watchdog found that the department gave \u201cinaccurate and incomplete\u201d answers to groups seeking access to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2018s records \u2026 If the Clintons are nervous how their family foundation will play on the campaign trail, they aren\u2019t showing it \u2026 If the loudest supporters translate to the most votes, then say hello to President Bernie Sanders \u2026\n\nCHRISTIE SLAMS U.S.-IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: Chris Christie on Thursday said Iran is a bigger threat than Islamic State terrorists and those who support the nuclear deal negotiated by President Obama\u2019s administration have \u201ctarnished\u201d their reputation on foreign policy. \u201cThey made the world a darker and more dangerous place,\u201d the Republican presidential candidate said in an appearance before the World Values Network, a conservative Jewish group that includes billionaire GOP donor Sheldon Adelson. In 2012, Mr. Christie referred to \u201coccupied territories\u201d in the region after a trip to Israel. Some Republican Jews condemn the phrase, as it gives credence to the view that Palestinians have a right to live in disputed Israeli lands. Mr. Christie later apologized for his remarks.

The unintended delivery of the missile to Cuba has confounded investigators and experts who work in a regulatory system designed to prevent precisely such equipment from falling into the wrong hands, said those familiar with the matter. For more than a year, amid a historic thawing of relations between the U.S. and Cuba, American authorities have tried to get the Cuban government to return the missile, said people familiar with the matter. At the same time, federal investigators have been tracing the paper trail of the wayward Hellfire to determine if its arrival in Cuba was the work of criminals or spies, or the result of a series of blunders, these people said.

On Friday, Chinese stocks closed up 2% after the government suspended its trading-halt mechanism overnight and European shares edged higher as markets stabilized.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s nuclear test sent shock waves around the world.

Washington Bureau Chief Jerry Seib explains.\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE READING AROUND THE WEB\n\nThe slowdown in China\u2019s economy is so worrisome for the government in Beijing because it faces an unprecedented \u201cfiscal crisis\u201d in which tax expenditures figure to fall well below spending required on social programs and assistance to local governments, writes John Lee for Forbes.\n\nThe Middle East has entered a dangerous and unpredictable period in which the region is wracked by a series of \u201call-out\u201d and \u201cwould-be\u201d civil wars, while \u201cIran and Saudi Arabia now lead rival coalitions waging proxy wars\u2014figuratively across the region, and literally across Syria, Yemen, and (to a lesser extent) Iraq,\u201d writes Kenneth Pollack of Brookings.\n\n\u200bWithout a court case, there isn\u2019t an absolute definition of who is a \u201cnatural born citizen,\u201d writes Byron York in the Washington Examiner.
