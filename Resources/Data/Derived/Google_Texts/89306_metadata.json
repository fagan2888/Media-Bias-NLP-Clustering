More than one in five Californians with private health insurance reported receiving \u201csurprise\u201d medical bills at least once over the previous two years, according to a 2015 Consumer Reports survey.\n\nToday in Sacramento, consumer advocates will launch a campaign they hope will eliminate such surprises. Legislation introduced last year by Assembly member Rob Bonta, D-Oakland, is back, after falling just three Assembly votes short of passage in 2015.\n\nThe California Medical Association is fighting Bonta\u2019s bill, and it is busy preparing a plan of its own with a different approach to the problem \u2014 one that puts more of the financial onus on insurers and gives doctors a better deal.\n\nAt issue: the practice at many hospitals and outpatient surgery centers of using doctors not covered by a patient\u2019s insurance plan \u2014 specialists such as anesthesiologists, pathologists and radiologists \u2014 for procedures that are otherwise covered.\n\nBecause health plans typically pay a small fraction of the charges by these \u201cout of network\u201d specialists, consumers get saddled with their bills. And what they charge is often a lot more than what the insurers pay their in-network docs.\n\nUnder Bonta\u2019s proposal, health plans would pay these specialists more or less what they pay their covered physicians for similar care. The specialists would accept that level of payment and stop sending big bills to patients.\n\nThe CMA says this plan would put too big a squeeze on doctors\u2019 pocketbooks. Instead, the association wants to set the payments in line with what the doctors charge.\n\nMichael Dondero of Long Beach has experienced the unsettling feeling of coming home to a large, unexpected medical bill. He had hernia surgery last year that was pre-approved by his health plan, held in a hospital covered under the plan and performed by a physician who was also part of the covered network.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, it went fantastic,\u201d Dondero said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a lot better now.\u201d\n\nBut about a month after the surgery, Dondero received something that didn\u2019t make him feel so good: an unexpected bill for $771. It turned out the anesthesiologist on duty during his procedure was not covered by his insurance.\n\n\u201cTo me it was a real eye-opener,\u201d Dondero said. \u201cI just assumed an in-network procedure at an in-network hospital would be covered. But you know what happens when we assume.\u201d\n\nDondero appealed to his insurance company, and after a month of back and forth letters and phone calls, he ended up paying a much smaller amount.\n\nBoth the Bonta bill and the proposal being drafted by the physicians\u2019 association share the goal of ensuring that patients won\u2019t get the kind of unwanted surprise that landed in Dondero\u2019s mailbox.\n\nBut after that, the plans diverge. Bonta\u2019s plan is more palatable to the health plans than the one being crafted by the medical association, which would claw back the financial advantage for specialist doctors.\n\nMany specialists say the benchmark established by Bonta\u2019s bill is far too low, claiming it would cut physician compensation by two-thirds.\n\nIn Bonta\u2019s plan, physicians who think they were underpaid can appeal through an independent review.\n\nStill, the medical association argues that the bill essentially penalizes doctors for insurer networks that are too small to meet the needs of patients. Doctors should not be forced to pick up the slack when health plans don\u2019t have enough specialists to perform the medical services they\u2019ve promised to cover, the association says.\n\nJanus Norman, a senior vice president of the CMA, says the Bonta bill would create a disincentive for health plans to negotiate reasonable rates with providers.\n\nThe crux, Norman said, is whether surprise bills are ultimately the responsibility of the health plans or the doctors who generate them.\n\nBonta said the argument is not that simple, and that he has spent a year trying to find the middle ground between insurers and physicians.\n\n\u201cThe challenge has always been getting reimbursed appropriately, and that\u2019s where the fight has been,\u201d Bonta said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fully within the ambit of plans to determine who\u2019s in the network, and it\u2019s not fully in the ambit of providers to determine that.\u201d\n\nBut one thing is clear, he said: \u201cYou can\u2019t punish the patient if they do everything right. They schedule it in advance; it\u2019s in the network. It\u2019s not on the patient to find out which providers that day are in the network or not.\u201d\n\nHealth Access California, a consumer advocacy group based in Sacramento that is sponsoring the Bonta bill, expects to announce today that the California Labor Federation has signed on as co-sponsor. Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access, said he hopes this expanded support will help tip the scale in favor of the bill\u2019s passage.\n\nWright argued that physicians bear a substantial share of responsibility for the surprise bill problem, and that they have stood in the way of fixing it. So now they should be willing to work out an arrangement that suits everyone, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are working to end surprise billing, yet the California Medical Association has delayed and held that process hostage for a year to demand high reimbursement rates for its members,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWe\u2019ve put a lot of options on the table, and CMA has rejected all of them.\u201d\n\nNorman countered that doctors do want to fix the problem, but that the \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adcause of it is the increasingly restricted choice of providers offered by health plans.\n\nThe medical association\u2019s plan to get higher rates for doctors, based on an average of what similar physicians charge, is a method already employed in other states, including New York and Connecticut.\n\nBill Barcellona, chief lobbyist at the California Association of Provider Groups, which represents physicians that negotiate with insurance companies, said the proposal could throw the payment system out of whack, with some physicians receiving rates \u201c200 percent higher\u201d than what they currently get.\n\nBonta said he hopes to negotiate a compromise but won\u2019t tolerate an attempt by the medical association to push its own agenda at the risk of undermining the main objective of eliminating surprise bills for consumers.\n\nHe said he is prepared to counter the competing proposal from the association, if necessary, by pushing his own bill through quickly \u2014 possibly as early as April.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t my preference to push this over the finish line, but we will do that if we\u2019re pushed,\u201d he said.\n\nDondero said his surprise bill blindsided him a little, but that in retrospect it shouldn\u2019t have. He urged others to contest such bills, like he did.\n\n\u201cI think usually when other people get that bill, they just pay it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can fight it. The thing is, you don\u2019t take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer the first go-round.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legislation fell three votes short last year.
