That\u2019s going to change with the medical school, and I think we will be able to ride that as well.\u201d\n\nThe 48-hour program will offer classes taught by both Neeley and UNTHSC professors. Cron said the program is designed to take about two years and three months, but students can finish at their own pace.\n\n\u201cMore doctors and nurses have shown interest in the program than originally anticipated, but the class will be no larger than 15 students,\u201d Cron said.\n\nCron said the program will help students adapt to changes in the health care industry spurred by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIf they raise their head from their daily work at all, they\u2019ll see this is the direction it [the health care industry] is going into,\u201d Cron said. \u201cThere is no question it\u2019ll move in this direction where the [health care] provider takes over more of the management.\u201d\n\nThe healthcare MBA will put providers who are first-line managers in the position to move up to a director level or higher, benefitting the entire health care industry, Cron said.\n\n\u201cIf I focus on them [first-line managers], it also makes our program valuable to almost everybody else in the healthcare system,\u201d Cron said. \u201cWhether its free-standing clinics or home health care, they\u2019re all involved in this system.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "https://www.tcu360.com/2016/03/tcu-announces-healthcare-mba-program/", "description": "The Neeley School of Business is teaming up with UNTHSC to offer an MBA in health care.", "original-source": "https://www.tcu360.com/2016/03/tcu-announces-healthcare-mba-program/", "og": {"site_name": "TCU 360", "description": "The Neeley School of Business is teaming up with UNTHSC to offer an MBA in health care.", "title": "TCU announces health care MBA program", "url": "https://www.tcu360.com/2016/03/tcu-announces-healthcare-mba-program/", "image": "https://www.tcu360.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2983-1170x878.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tcu360", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "https://www.tcu360.com/2016/03/tcu-announces-healthcare-mba-program/", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 1493406777650727}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Academics"}, "article_summary": "Cron said the program will help students adapt to changes in the health care industry spurred by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cWhether its free-standing clinics or home health care, they\u2019re all involved in this system.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no question it\u2019ll move in this direction where the [health care] provider takes over more of the management.\u201dThe healthcare MBA will put providers who are first-line managers in the position to move up to a director level or higher, benefitting the entire health care industry, Cron said.\nBeginning this summer, the Neeley School of Business and UNTHSC will offer a Master of Business Administration in health care.\n\u201cIf they raise their head from their daily work at all, they\u2019ll see this is the direction it [the health care industry] is going into,\u201d Cron said."}
