This gives me an opportunity to help us move in the right direction.\u201d\n\nShe said hospital officials were looking for someone to dig into the complexity of reimbursements, something that now ties directly to hospital care.\n\nProvisions in the Affordable Care Act allow the federal government to cut Medicare reimbursements to hospitals because of complications patients acquire in the hospital. Butler Memorial will incur a 1 percent reduction from its Medicare discharge payments for the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.\n\nHaid will work with physicians as regulations and standards change, and implement teams to look at ways to improve an existing process \u2014 or implement a new one \u2014 to streamline work.\n\n\u201cOver the years, things have been moving more toward quality and efficiency,\u201d Haid said. \u201cIt's gone from treating illness to helping patients become well and maintaining that wellness.\u201d\n\nShe will work with physicians' offices to make sure certain benchmarks are hit, such as scheduling immunizations and screenings such as mammograms and colonoscopies on time.\n\nHaid has been at Butler Memorial for nearly 16 years. She has a bachelor's degree in nursing from Penn State and a master's in informatics from Walden University, an online university based in Minneapolis.\n\nMegan Guza is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
