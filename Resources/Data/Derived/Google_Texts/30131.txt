Those creepy-crawlies can do more than just gross you out. Some can give you serious diseases if they bite you, while others can cause dangerous allergic reactions. Here’s a list of the most dangerous summer insects to avoid and ways to protect yourself.

Lyme disease has spread across numerous counties in the Northeastern region of the U.S. and has surged 320 percent since 1993. The disease is now spreading rapidly across the nation to states that have never had cases of Lyme disease before, such as North Dakota, a new report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention found.

Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is transmitted to humans through an infected tick bite. The first symptom a victim usually notices is a rash shaped like a bull’s eye. As the infection progresses, other symptoms become noticeable, including a fever, a headache, muscle and joint aches, fatigue, and a stiff neck. While Lyme disease is hard to diagnose, if left untreated the infection can spread to joints, the heart, and the nervous system, causing life-long consequences, and occasionally death. Because ticks attach to animal hosts, such as mice, deer, and birds, the disease can spread easily.

While ticks are clearly insects to be cautious of this summer, other insects also carry diseases or that can release poisonous venom into a human. Below is a list of ten insects to watch out for this summer and how to protect oneself from them.
