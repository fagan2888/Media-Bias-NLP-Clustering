Janet Jackson will make one of her first public performances in sometime Sunday at the BET Awards, weeks after the singer caused Internet frenzies with several announcements about her comeback to music.

Jackson will be honored with the Ultimate Icon: Music Dance Visual Award at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, where performers include Nicki Minaj, Chris Brown, Kendrick Lamar and cast members of the hit series, “Empire.”

Ciara, Jason Derulo and newcomer Tinashe will pay tribute to 49-year-old Jackson, who released a new song last week and is readying a full album and tour this fall.

Minaj and Brown, who have won a handful of BET Awards over the years, are the top nominees with six each. Brown is nominated twice for video of the year with his hits “Loyal” and “New Flame.” Other nominees for the top prize include Minaj’s eye-popping video for “Anaconda,” Beyonce’s “7/11,” Big Sean’s “IDFWU” and Common and John Legend’s Oscar-winning “Glory,” from the film “Selma.”

Beyonce and Lil Wayne are both up for four awards at Sunday’s show (8 p.m. Eastern), which will be hosted by Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross, who both star in the hit ABC series, “Black-ish.”
