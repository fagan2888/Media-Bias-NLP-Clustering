DENVER (AP) - The last time Tom Brady and the New England Patriots came to town, Peyton Manning watched the game on television from inside the locker room. This time around, the Denver Broncos QB will be on the field.

Manning meets Brady for a 17th time - a trip to Super Bowl 50 at stake.

Perhaps only fitting these two storied QBs meet in the AFC title game next weekend, since Manning didn’t get to suit up against New England on Nov. 29, because of a foot injury. That game was a thriller, with Brock Osweiler leading the Broncos to a 30-24 overtime victory.

Manning’s foot healed, he guided the Broncos to a 23-16 win over Ben Roethlisberger and the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday.

Brady is still vintage Brady, leading the Super Bowl champion Patriots to the AFC title game for a fifth straight season.
