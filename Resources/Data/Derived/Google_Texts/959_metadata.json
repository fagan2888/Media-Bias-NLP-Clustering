Obama offers the presidential version of a shrug. \u201cAs has been well documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life. I don\u2019t think it is more dangerous than alcohol.\u201d\n\nWhile he calls smoking and toking \u201ca bad habit and a vice,\u201d this doesn\u2019t seem to mean much of anything\u2014certainly nothing serious. But it is serious. The president is cutting the legs out from under every parent and schoolteacher and clergyman across the country who is trying to steer kids away from illegal drugs. Our \u201ccoolest president\u201d ever has made drug education into a punch line.\n\nAs it stands, the law will not be enforced (by executive directive) and the criminal drug market will be augmented by the open production and sale of marijuana. Moreover, Obama speculated that legalizing \u201chard\u201d drugs, including cocaine and meth, might ultimately be a matter of creating a \u201cnegotiated\u201d or \u201ccalibrated\u201d dose for safer use. From a policy perspective, that leaves you with treating the wounded through programs now consolidated under the Obamacare banner. The result is appalling. Allow more and more poison to harm more and more families, destroy the respectable basis for prevention education that deters the use of these poisons, and just treat the victims, again and again and again.\n\nAs absurd as the administration\u2019s policy has become, it is even more striking that no serving national leader, Democrat or Republican, has called the administration to task. Where is the tradition of President Reagan and the bipartisan work against the drug problem that was led for years by senators Biden, Leahy, Feinstein, Hatch, Grassley, and Sessions and representatives Rangel, Cummings, Hoyer, Issa, Ros-Lehtinen, and Wolf? Why don\u2019t the dedicated public servants at such places as the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2014those who know the truth, have dedicated their professional lives to protecting Americans from substance abuse, and even risk their lives daily\u2014speak up?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Barack Obama,DEA,Drugs,Marijuana,Michael Warren", "og": {"site_name": "Weekly Standard", "description": "The head of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration is now openly criticizing Barack Obama for his recent comments over the question of marijuana legalization, according to multiple reports.\nThe&nbsp;Boston Herald&nbsp;reports it has sources who heard DEA chief Michele Leonhart slam Obama at last week's National Sheriffs' Association winter meeting in Washington.
