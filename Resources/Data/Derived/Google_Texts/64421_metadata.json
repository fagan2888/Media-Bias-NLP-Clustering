The uninsured rate for children has been declining in the past decade\u2014 to around 7.3 percent, though it had not declined further under the ACA.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to move an uninsured rate that is so low so quickly,\u201d Kenney said.\n\nThe low uninsured rates are due to the expansion of public coverage for children over the past several decades. As the report notes, more than half of all states offer coverage through Medicaid or CHIP to children with families with incomes that are 250 percent of the federal poverty level. Children\u2019s participation in Medicaid is much higher than adults\u2014it reached 88.1 percent in 2012.\n\nRelated: Uninsured Rate Lowest Ever Recorded by Gallup\n\nThe researchers think the uninsured rate for children has potential to dip even lower in the future through Medicaid expansion, as well as if CHIP funding is continued at current levels. The program\u2019s funding expires next year, so Congress must approve it before Sept 30, 2015.\n\n\u201cIf Congress takes no action and CHIP funding is not continued, you would see a big increase in uninsured children,\u201d CCF\u2019s Joan Alker said in the media briefing. She estimated, \u201c500,000 to 200,000 nationally children could become uninsured if CHIP is not extended.\u201d\n\nRight now, the report says, the majority of uninsured children have incomes that would make them eligible through CHIP or Medicaid. But problems with backlog in enrollment processing have prohibited some from receiving coverage.\n\n\u201cMany states are working through considerable backlogs for Medicaid or CHIP and we expect many of those to be children,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nRelated: Can IRS Collect ACA Taxes When It Can\u2019t Handle Tax Complaints?\n\nAnd while researchers did not find that Obamacare had a significant impact on uninsured rates for children, they did find a sizable difference in the uninsured rate for parents\u2014specifically in states that expanded their Medicaid programs.\n\nSo far, the uninsured rate among parents\u2014especially low and middle-income people\u2014has fallen to record low levels within the last year. The uninsured rate for parents dropped 14.4 percent between last September and June 2014. In states that chose to expand their Medicaid programs, that number dropped 33.3 percent. Meanwhile, there was \u201cno statistically significant change\u201d in states that did not expand their program.\n\n\u201cParents in nonexpanding states were almost twice as likely to be uninsured as parents in expanding states,\u201d the authors said.\n\n\u201cAs states continue to expand Medicaid, we certainly expect enrollment will increase,\u201d Alker said \u201cMedicaid and CHIP programs have potential to drive uninsured rates down even further.\u201d\n\nShe added that there are several states currently considering expanding their Medicaid programs including Indiana, Utah and Wyoming. \u201cNext year we\u2019re going to see more action on this, once the midterm elections are over.\u201d\n\nTop Reads From the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While the president\u2019s health care law has significantly sliced the uninsured rates for", "title": "Obamacare Has Not Cut Uninsured Rate for Kids", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/09/Obamacare-Has-Not-Cut-Uninsured-Rate-Kids", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04032012_Medicaid_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/09/Obamacare-Has-Not-Cut-Uninsured-Rate-Kids", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04032012_Medicaid_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "While the president\u2019s health care law has significantly sliced the uninsured rates for", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd443\"", "article_summary": "So far, the uninsured rate among parents\u2014especially low and middle-income people\u2014has fallen to record low levels within the last year.\nThe uninsured rate for parents dropped 14.4 percent between last September and June 2014.\nThe low uninsured rates are due to the expansion of public coverage for children over the past several decades.\nThe uninsured rate for children has been declining in the past decade\u2014 to around 7.3 percent, though it had not declined further under the ACA.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to move an uninsured rate that is so low so quickly,\u201d Kenney said."}
