African-American.\n\nYes, they represented a small percentage of Ferguson\u2019s larger population, which spent months urging a peaceful reaction to the grand jury decision.\n\nBut this week, these young people -- armed with guns, bats, and crowbars -- took it upon themselves to be the \u201cface\u201d of Ferguson\u2019s black community.\n\nAnd that does not sit well with this store employee.\n\n\u201cThey hire black folks. I\u2019m black. We\u2019re a community man. We can\u2019t do this. This ain't the way to do it. This ain't the way to do it. This is what they want. They want to say, look, they can\u2019t control themselves. Look at the animals,\u201d said the unidentified employee.\n\nWe met him at the height of the looting. He was powerless to stop it.\n\nWith every new crowd, we kept circling back to the same question: Where are these kids\u2019 parents?\n\nAn hour later, she was photographed a few miles away at Ferguson City Hall, helping to overturn a police cruiser.\n\nSimply put, this young woman pulled one over on us.\n\n\u201cIf they had that opportunity, they would have taken that opportunity. Because some of these people just don\u2019t want to do anything, but take away from people -- to damage property from somebody else, instead of getting jobs for themselves,\u201d said Bobby.\n\nSt. Louis County resident Bobby, like so many other older, black, hardworking, law abiding St. Louis County residents, was furious over what he described as the hijacking of a movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me to see what\u2019s going on in this neighborhood. I\u2019m a black man, and it hurts me more than anything in the world. Because these young people that had these jobs, they don\u2019t get up in the morning to go to work. They don\u2019t have a job now,\u201d said Bobby.\n\nThere is no denying this community\u2019s outrage over the failure to hold Officer Darren Wilson criminally responsible for Michael Brown\u2019s death.\n\nThe sentiment here, it was a sham, another example of this area\u2019s criminal justice system protecting a racist police department.\n\nBut these mothers have a problem with how these young people went about expressing their anger and frustration.\n\n\u201cThe destruction of property is not going to avenge Mike Brown. It is not going to bring that young man back. Is it going to make me a proud homeowner in St. Louis county? No. It\u2019s making me remember the places I tried to escape to make a better life for mine and my children,\u201d said Felicia Willis.\n\nDuring the summer and fall of 2014, everything changed in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nOne family lost their child.\n\nIn response, a town already struggling with race relations violently reached its breaking point.\n\nAnd an entire generation of young people showed the country, on live television, just how far we have to go to make things better.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is not how Maria Flores wanted to celebrate this Thanksgiving, supervising a crew as it boarded up the front entrance to her restaurant located on Ferguson\u2019s South Florissant Avenue.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New York's PIX11 / WPIX-TV", "description": "FERGUSON, Missouri (PIX11) \u2014 This is not how Maria Flores wanted to celebrate this Thanksgiving, supervising a crew as it boarded up the front entrance to her restaurant located on Ferguson\u2019s\u2026", "title": "Ferguson residents, business owners decry violence after grand jury decision", "url": "http://pix11.com/2014/11/28/ferguson-residents-business-owners-decry-violence-after-grand-jury-decision/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/ferguson1.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/ferguson1.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@PIX11News", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PIX11News"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "New York News, Weather, Entertainment, Transit and More", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=587593522", "fb": {"pages": 76073377041}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://pix11.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1ed18cbab7a076bdb92e6a7ec0bae5ab?s=16", "application-name": "New York's PIX11 / WPIX-TV", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/pix11news", "published_time": "2014-11-29T01:39:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-29T01:43:23+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/pix11news"}, "keywords": "ferguson, missouri, st. louis, looting, protesting, michael brown, darren wilson", "google-site-verification": "NwkxplaUCiSUM7fwyF8LprcUZJryQRaTVtXjbjzon-4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Ferguson, Missouri, St. Louis, looting, protesting, Michael Brown, Darren Wilson"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb1e\"", "article_summary": "St. Louis County resident Bobby, like so many other older, black, hardworking, law abiding St. Louis County residents, was furious over what he described as the hijacking of a movement.\nI\u2019m a black man, and it hurts me more than anything in the world.\nYes, they represented a small percentage of Ferguson\u2019s larger population, which spent months urging a peaceful reaction to the grand jury decision.\nBut this week, these young people -- armed with guns, bats, and crowbars -- took it upon themselves to be the \u201cface\u201d of Ferguson\u2019s black community.\nIs it going to make me a proud homeowner in St. Louis county?"}
