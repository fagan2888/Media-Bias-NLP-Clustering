It always is \u2013 it always will be. Government can do a few things well (the military leaps to mind). But even those successes are woefully mismanaged and obstinately wasteful of money (with the military \u2013 usually due to its civilian overseers).\n\nThere is no \u201creform\u201dof this. You can\u2019t improve government quality of service. Because government is organized and run by humans \u2013 and thus subject to the immutable laws of human nature. Two particularly pertinent such laws: the Wallet and Yellow Pages Rules.\n\nThe Wallet Rule: You go out on a Friday night with your wallet. You go out the following Friday night with my wallet. On which Friday night are you going to have more fun?\n\nObviously you will have more fun with my wallet than yours \u2013because at the end of the revelry you care what your wallet looks like. My wallet? You don\u2019t care quite so much. Government is always using other peoples\u2019wallets \u2013 and the Friday night party never, ever ends.\n\nThe Yellow Pages Rule: If you can find it in the Yellow Pages \u2013 the government shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\n\nIn large part because of the Wallet Rule. The private sector will always do things more wisely and well \u2013 because they are spending their own money. And thus are constantly caring about the shape of their wallets. (And because they are businesses competing for our attention \u2013 our wallets too.)\n\nThe horrendous disaster that is ObamaCare is giving us countless additional examples of government uber-failure (not that we needed them). Both in the cataclysmic damage it is doing to the private sector \u2013 and its own miserable forays into pretending to be the private sector. To the latter \u2013 behold: the collapsing ObamaCare co-ops.\n\nObamaCare co-ops were/are twenty-three separate state-level attempts by the federal government to serve as health insurance clearinghouses. The results? Predictably \u2013 disastrous. In fact, the government knew they would fail \u2013 they just (as usual) underestimated how much and by how many. From June of 2013:\n\nObamaCare Co-ops Are Focus of Four Federal Investigations Because co-ops are relatively untested vehicles for selling and managing health insurance programs, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget has predicted that as many as 43 percent of the new groups will go bankrupt within a few years.\n\nAgain, government doesn\u2019t care about this titanic waste of money \u2013 because it\u2019s not their money. The underestimation of their failure? About 57%. Flash forward two years:\n\nObamaCare Co-Ops at Risk of Failing After Billions in Loans Just 15 of the original 23 co-ops remain in operation, and the (Barack Obama) administration acknowledges that more of them could fail, potentially leaving a strike against President Obama\u2019s signature law.\n\nI\u2019ll bet large coin the other fifteen are on the way out \u2013 any takers? Water is wet, the sun rose again today \u2013 and the government fails at pretending to be the private sector. So why on Earth have governments all over the country since the early 2000s been trying to impersonate Internet Service Providers (ISPs)?\n\nThese attempts have been so terrible \u2013 twenty states have passed laws limiting their local governments\u2019 getting into it. But undaunted by a decade\u2019s worth of evidence, President Obama and his federal Democrats immediately jumped in with both Left feet.\n\nBecause why fail all over again in thirty states \u2013 when you can fail all over again in all fifty. (Or fifty-seven \u2013 or fifty-nine. Or whatever.)\n\nGovernment\u2019s rigid insistence on involving itself in this sector is above-and-beyond absurd. Private sector ISPs have in twenty years invested $1.2 trillion in building and rebuilding anew our Internet network. Creating and exponentially increasing the Web speeds by which we are now all dazzled. Remember 28K dial-up? No one under 30 does \u2013 because the private sector left it in the dust a more than a decade ago. We now effortlessly, seamlessly stream HD videos on multiple devices \u2013 on the same WIRELESS network.\n\nSo what exactly will a government ISP add to this equation? \u201cCompetition!\u201dthe Left screeches. But at least 94% of Americans have access to at least two broadband providers \u2013 with more being added all the time. As both wired and wireless providers of all sorts (cellular, satellite, etc.) get faster, bigger, better and have ever further reach.\n\nAnd realistically, if by now you do not have access (and 99+% of us do) \u2013 it is likely because you have chosen to live so remotely as to render yourself all but unreachable. By just about anything \u2013 let alone broadband. And that\u2019s your choice and responsibility \u2013 not ours, and certainly not our government\u2019s.\n\nAnd if you are that remote \u2013 and are anxiously awaiting broadband access \u2013 in whom do you have more faith reaching you first? The private sector \u2013 or government?\n\nI\u2019ll bet large coin on the private sector \u2013 any takers?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Government is an inherently failed entity.
