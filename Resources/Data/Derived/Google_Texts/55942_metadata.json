Look, I want \u2014 we\u2019re going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. ObamaCare is a total and complete disaster. It\u2019s going to be gone. We\u2019re going to come up with a great health-care plan, whether it\u2019s health care savings accounts. We have a lot of different things. We can get rid of the lines between states, we\u2019ll have great competitive bidding. But I say all the time, you can call it anything you want. People are not going to die in the middle of the street. People are not going to die on the sidewalk if I\u2019m president, okay.\n\nTODD: Let me get something definitive from you on this \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Chuck, excuse me, I say that to packed houses with thousands and thousands of people. Republicans mostly. And I get standing ovations. I\u2019m not going to let that happen. If I\u2019m president, we\u2019re not going to have people dying on the streets. You can call it whatever you want \u2014\n\nTODD: No, I understand that. Let me ask you this \u2014\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t call it mandate, it\u2019s common sense.\n\nTODD: Do you think that it should be a law anybody who can afford health insurance has to have it?\n\nTRUMP: I think, no. I think it\u2019s going to be up to them. I want it to be up to them. But I\u2019m really talking about people that can\u2019t afford it. We\u2019re not going to let people die in squalor because we are Republicans. Okay? That\u2019s part of the problem with the Republicans. Somehow they got fed into this horrible position. We\u2019re going to take care of people. But, no, people don\u2019t have to have it. We\u2019re going to have great plans. They\u2019re going to be a lot less expensive than ObamaCare. They\u2019re going to be private. There are going to be lots of different options. We\u2019re going to have a lot of different options. Right now you have no options. You know why? Because the insurance company controlled Obama because they gave him a lot of money. That\u2019s why you have lines around the states and you can\u2019t get competitive bidding.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump on Health Care: 'We're Not Going to Let People Die in Squalor Because We Are Republicans'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Trump on Health Care: 'We're Not Going to Let People Die in Squalor Because We Are Republicans'", "title": "Trump on Health Care: 'We're Not Going to Let People Die in Squalor Because We Are Republicans' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/22trump.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/21/trump-on-health-care-were-not-going-to-let-people-die-in-squalor-because-we-are-republicans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump on Health Care: 'We're Not Going to Let People Die in Squalor Because We Are Republicans'", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/22trump.jpg", "title": "Trump on Health Care: 'We're Not Going to Let People Die in Squalor Because We Are Republicans' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Donald Trump", "published_time": "2016-02-21T08:28:42-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "We\u2019re not going to let people die in squalor because we are Republicans.\nWe\u2019re going to come up with a great health-care plan, whether it\u2019s health care savings accounts.\nI\u2019m not going to let that happen.\nPeople are not going to die on the sidewalk if I\u2019m president, okay.\nLet me ask you this \u2014TRUMP: I don\u2019t call it mandate, it\u2019s common sense."}
