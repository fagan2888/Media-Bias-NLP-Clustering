On Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) responded to last Sunday’s episode of HBO’s True Blood —the one in which foul-mouthed vampires and assault weapon-blasting yakuza thugs invade a Ted Cruz fundraiser thrown at the George W. Bush Presidential Library. Bloody mayhem, naturally, ensued.

The senator from Texas was not impressed. From his Facebook page :

Of all the places I never thought to be mentioned, HBO's True Blood vampire show would have to be near the top of the list. Sunday night, they aired a misogynist and profanity-ridden episode where Texas Republicans are murdered attending a "Ted Cruz fundraiser."

Well, I'm sorry to have lost the vampire vote, but am astonished (and amused) that HBO is suggesting that hard-core leftists are blood-sucking fiends....
