Our culture has actually taught our kids to be this self-absorbed and narcissistic. Any time their feelings are hurt, they are the victims.\n\nPiper told students the small Christian liberal arts school is \u201cnot a day care\u201d or a \u201csafe place,\u201d but \u201ca place to learn.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the university would not follow the trend of some colleges that issue \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d before expressing a potentially distressing or provocative idea.\n\nPiper told The Daily Signal that his letter reflects concern not only for students, but for cultural trends against free speech as universities are hit by political protests demanding \u201csafe spaces\u201d where opposing perspectives are barred.\n\nLast month, protests drawing thousands of students at the University of Missouri to demand greater diversity forced the resignation of the school\u2019s president and the chancellor of its flagship campus.\n\nThe incident inspired similar movements across campuses, including Yale and Ithaca College, where students have pushed administrators to create safe spaces for racial minorities. But the issue also sparked debate as to whether the shifts go too far in restricting free speech.\n\n\u201cToday, the antithesis of the liberal arts is the shouting down of another human being because you disagree with him or her,\u201d Piper told The Daily Signal. \u201cThe creation of a safe space so that a countering idea cannot enter your world\u2014that is not education. That is nothing but ideological fascism.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201csafe spaces\u201d contradict the goal of higher education, which should be to pursue truth, not protect only some opinions. He also said it is the job of educators to help others pursue truth, a job that must be taken on with \u201cconfidence and courage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking my peers, my fellow academicians in the eye and saying we\u2019ve created this,\u201d Piper said, adding:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cToday, the antithesis of the liberal arts is the shouting down of another human being because you disagree with him or her,\u201d Everett Piper says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cToday, the antithesis of the liberal arts is the shouting down of another human being because you disagree with him or her,\u201d Everett Piper says.", "title": "'Grow Up,' College President Tells Whining Students", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151201_OklaCollegePres_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-02T06:53:15+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1InkZpF"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cToday, the antithesis of the liberal arts is the shouting down of another human being because you disagree with him or her,\u201d Everett Piper says.", "title": "'Grow Up,' College President Tells Whining Students", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151201_OklaCollegePres_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "individual freedom", "published_time": "2015-12-01T19:20:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-02T06:53:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Everett Piper, Oklahoma Wesleyan University, safe space, Mizzou, University of Missouri"}, "article_summary": "The incident inspired similar movements across campuses, including Yale and Ithaca College, where students have pushed administrators to create safe spaces for racial minorities.\nEverett Piper, president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, called on students to \u201cgrow up\u201d after he got a complaint from an undergraduate who felt \u201cvictimized\u201d following an on-campus sermon on love.\nAs debate heats up over \u201csafe spaces\u201d at campuses across the United States, one college president is standing up to students who claim they\u2019re victims when their opinions are challenged.\nLast month, protests drawing thousands of students at the University of Missouri to demand greater diversity forced the resignation of the school\u2019s president and the chancellor of its flagship campus.\nThat is nothing but ideological fascism.\u201dHe said \u201csafe spaces\u201d contradict the goal of higher education, which should be to pursue truth, not protect only some opinions."}
