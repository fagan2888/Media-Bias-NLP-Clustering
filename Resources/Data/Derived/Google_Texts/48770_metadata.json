Whether we\u2019re talking the good kind (you\u2019re living in a mansion) or the scary kind (a killer is chasing you through the woods), the causes of dreams are still enigmatic. Experts do have some theories about why we dream, though, and most of them say dreaming is in some way beneficial.\n\nOne theory suggests we dream to remember information we learn during the day \u2014 one experiment found that subjects who dreamed of the maze they were tasked with completing that day completed the maze much faster the next day than those who had not dreamed of it.\n\nAnother theory suggests the opposite: that we dream to forget. Our brains make tons of neural connections during the day based on everything we do, see, touch, and experience. Some researchers believe that during sleep, and specifically REM sleep where dreams occur, our brains review the neural connections made through the day and dump any unnecessary ones.\n\nThere are plenty more theories in the video above, including that dreams are responsible for keeping our brains working, and that we dream to fulfill our own wishes.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "why, do, we, dream, scientists, explain, most, popular, theories, why, we, dream", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Here are the various theories on why we dream.", "title": "Science Tries To Explain Why We Dream", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/why-do-we-dream-scientists-explain-most-popular-theories-why-we-dream-364978", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/11/dream.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here are the various theories on why we dream.", "title": "Science Tries To Explain Why We Dream", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/why-do-we-dream-scientists-explain-most-popular-theories-why-we-dream-364978", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/11/dream.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/11/dream.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-12-11T17:29:23-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-11T18:05:53-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Here are the various theories on why we dream."}, "article_summary": "Experts do have some theories about why we dream, though, and most of them say dreaming is in some way beneficial.\nAnother theory suggests the opposite: that we dream to forget.\nThere are plenty more theories in the video above, including that dreams are responsible for keeping our brains working, and that we dream to fulfill our own wishes.\nOur brains make tons of neural connections during the day based on everything we do, see, touch, and experience.\nDreams are still a mystery to scientists and researchers."}
