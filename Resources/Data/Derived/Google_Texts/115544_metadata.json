Earlier that morning, they had trimmed their training camp roster of 90 men to 78, waiving nine, cutting one, trading another and placing a rookie on the injured reserve.\n\nWhen they returned Tuesday, just hours before the 2 p.m. deadline to reduce the list to 75, Kubiak and Co. revealed the final three cuts.\n\nNathan Palmer\u2019s work at Dove Valley is done. The third-year receiver who spent most of last season on the practice squad was waived. Following Tuesday\u2019s practice, rookie linebacker Danny Mason and tight end Dan Light, a recent waiver claim, were let go as well.\n\nThe three joined cornerback Tevrin Brandon, safety Ross Madison, guard Andre Davis, tight end/fullback Joe Don Duncan, quarterback Zac Dysert, punter Spencer Lanning, tight end Jake Murphy, running back Jeremy Stewart and linebacker Chase Vaughn among the first wave of cuts this week.\n\nWATCH: Trending Now: Broncos cut three more players\n\nChris Clark, a veteran right tackle, was traded to Houston for a seventh-round pick in the 2016 draft. Inside linebacker Reggie Walker was released. And Jeff Heuerman, the Broncos\u2019 third-round pick who tore his anterior cruciate ligament in minicamp, was, as expected, placed on the injured reserve.\n\nWhile the moves abruptly ended the work of some, they secured that of others.\n\nJames Casey is the Broncos\u2019 sole fullback with Duncan gone.\n\nBritton Colquitt is still their punter after agreeing to a reduced salary and beating out Karl Schmitz and Lanning.\n\nTrevor Siemian, a seventh-round pick out of Northwestern, is their third-string quarterback, should they decide to keep as many.\n\nAnd Michael Schofield, a second-year offensive lineman, is now a swing tackle in the wake of the Clark trade.\n\nThe Broncos play their final preseason game Thursday, against the Cardinals, giving 22 other players who survived the first round one last audition before the final group of 53 is selected by 2 p.m. Saturday. Ten of those may find their exit isn\u2019t permanent; the team must select 10 players to its practice squad by 11 a.m. Sunday.\n\nA week later, the decision-making and workload for Kubiak only gets larger. On Sept. 13, the Broncos begin their regular season against his former team, the Baltimore Ravens, at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos waive three more to trim roster to 75 players", "title": "Broncos waive three more to trim roster to 75 players", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/01/broncos-waive-three-more-to-trim-roster-to-75-players/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150901_094435_nathan-palmer.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150901_094435_nathan-palmer.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-01T09:34:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T17:51:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7d7\"", "article_summary": "Gary Kubiak and the Broncos\u2019 coaching staff went home Monday night still facing difficult decisions and having little time to make them.\nFollowing Tuesday\u2019s practice, rookie linebacker Danny Mason and tight end Dan Light, a recent waiver claim, were let go as well.\nAnd Jeff Heuerman, the Broncos\u2019 third-round pick who tore his anterior cruciate ligament in minicamp, was, as expected, placed on the injured reserve.\nOn Sept. 13, the Broncos begin their regular season against his former team, the Baltimore Ravens, at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\nWhen they returned Tuesday, just hours before the 2 p.m. deadline to reduce the list to 75, Kubiak and Co. revealed the final three cuts."}
