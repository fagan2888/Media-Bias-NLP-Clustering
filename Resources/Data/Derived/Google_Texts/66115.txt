The American Atheists got very close to having a booth at the Conservative Political Action Conference last year, but then the group’s president David Silverman got a little mouthy. “I used the word attack,” he says sheepishly at this year’s conference. (He also said on CNN that, “The Christian right should be threatened by us,” but that’s neither here nor there.)

A year later, the secular group has made nice with the American Conservative Union and was rewarded with a booth in CPAC’s exhibit hall and a speaking slot, utilized by American Atheists board member Jamila Bey.



“We’re not here to create trouble,” Bey swears. “We are here to say, ‘You can’t say in order to believe in small government, you have to believe in Jesus.’”

The audience reacted pleasantly to Bey who had an early morning speaking slot on Thursday. (Though not with the same enthusiasm as, say, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas).

Holding court at the downstairs booth, which holds buttons and a brochure answering the question “Why are we here?” an attendee dips by to wish Bey and Silverman well.

“That’s what people have been doing all day to me,” Bey says. “She’s maybe the 100th person who’s walked by me and said, ‘Hi, good job, thank you.’”



Silverman said he’s also gotten a mostly positive reception. “We have met so many atheists,” he says. “The other thing, not only have we met so many atheists, but we met so many Christians who agree that we ought to have a table and so many Christians who agree that there should not be Christianity in conservatism.”

But have there been haters?

“Oh yeah, yeah, there have been some haters, but they have been the minority,” Silverman says.
