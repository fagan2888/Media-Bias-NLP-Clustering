According to the report, Masiello has drawn the support of Outback Steakhouse co-founder and Tampa resident Chris Sullivan, a close friend of Pitino who could be ready to ramp up his financial support of USF athletics.\n\nMasiello, who just finished his third season at 25-8 with Manhattan, would not comment on the USF position when approached after the Jaspers\u2019 71-64 loss against Pitino\u2019s Cardinals in Friday\u2019s wee hours. Masiello also played for Pitino at Kentucky and served six seasons as a Louisville assistant.\n\nPelphrey, the former head coach at South Alabama (2002-07) and Arkansas (2007-11), said he has not been contacted by new Bulls athletic director Mark Harlan, who is finishing his stint as UCLA associate athletic director and won\u2019t arrive in Tampa until April 7. Pelphrey said he would be interested in the USF position, but is first concentrating on his duties with the Gators, who are headed to their fourth consecutive NCAA tournament Sweet 16 appearance.\n\nHarlan hasn\u2019t offered specifics about his USF coaching search timetable. He said USF will employ a search firm to locate candidates. He will be open to sitting head coaches and assistants.\n\n\u201cI think John would be a great fit at USF,\u2019\u2019 Donovan said. \u201cSometimes what happens is you take difficult jobs. I think John took two very hard jobs. Had he been given one more year (at Arkansas), he had a lot of players coming back and a great recruiting class, I think he really would\u2019ve had it going there. It would be a tremendous loss for us, but I want what\u2019s best for him and his family.\u2019\u2019\n\nPelphrey, who followed former USF coach Stan Heath to Arkansas in 2007-08, guided the Razorbacks to a 23-win season and an NCAA tournament victory against Indiana in his first year. At South Alabama, he won the 2006 Sun Belt Conference tournament, but his 24-7 team fell to Florida in the NCAA tournament\u2019s first round.\n\nOverall, Pelphrey is 149-122 as a head coach \u2014 80-63 at South Alabama, 69-59 at Arkansas.\n\n\u201cJohn is one of the smartest basketball players I\u2019ve ever been around and he would play an exciting, pressing style, which I think is important at USF,\u2019\u2019 Pitino said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a better job now, believe it or not, then when they were in the Big East. Even with a new arena or whatever, they still couldn\u2019t compete in recruiting with the Syracuses and Louisvilles of the world. Now they\u2019re on par with everyone (in the American Athletic Conference). Just get a guy in there now who can recruit, play a style to excite fans, drum up the support and I think you\u2019ve got something really special.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cMy perception of USF is they\u2019ve changed leagues so much and the program has been in a constant state of flux,\u2019\u2019 Donovan said. \u201cThey\u2019ve clearly made a commitment to their facilities. Tampa is a great city. I think they\u2019re in the right league (AAC) now. It\u2019s manageable. The Big East was too hard of a jump and now the program is in a good place. I\u2019d be excited for John to get a shot at running USF\u2019s program. He\u2019d be terrific.\u2019\u2019\n\njjohnston@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7353\n\nTwitter: @JJohnstonTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 22 Mar 2014 19:58:42 -0400", "Description": "ORLANDO \u2014 University of Florida assistant John Pelphrey, who led two different programs to NCAA tournament bids during a nine-season head-coaching stint, was endorsed Saturday for the Universi", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "ORLANDO \u2014 University of Florida assistant John Pelphrey, who led two different programs to NCAA tournament bids during a nine-season head-coaching stint, was endorsed Saturday for the Universi", "title": "Pelphrey, Masiello emerge in USF coaching search", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/colleges/usf-bulls/pelphrey-masiello-emerge-in-usf-search-20140322/", "image": {"width": 332, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140322/ARTICLE/140329709/AR/0/AR-140329709.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2014-03-22T20:37:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "ORLANDO \u2014 University of Florida assistant John Pelphrey, who led two different programs to NCAA tournament bids during a nine-season head-coaching stint, was endorsed Saturday for the Univer", "title": "Pelphrey, Masiello emerge in USF coaching search", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140322/ARTICLE/140329709/AR/0/AR-140329709.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-03-22T19:58:42Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-03-22T20:37:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "basketball,coach,USF"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe517c\"", "article_summary": "Additionally, CBSSports.com reported Saturday that another Pitino prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Manhattan coach Steve Masiello, has emerged as a serious candidate for the USF position.\n\u201cI think John would be a great fit at USF,\u2019\u2019 Donovan said.\nI think John took two very hard jobs.\nPelphrey said he would be interested in the USF position, but is first concentrating on his duties with the Gators, who are headed to their fourth consecutive NCAA tournament Sweet 16 appearance.\nHarlan hasn\u2019t offered specifics about his USF coaching search timetable."}
