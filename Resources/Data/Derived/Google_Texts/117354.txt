The Colorado Rockies’ third game in their homestand against the San Francisco Giants, scheduled for Sunday at 2:10 p.m., was postponed because of inclement weather. The game will be rescheduled for a future date that the team will announce later.

The Rockies (10-8) have split their two games with the Giants (8-11), winning Friday’s game, 6-4, and losing Saturday’s 11-inning duel, 5-4.

The Rockies will stay with their current pitching rotation, meaning lefty Tyler Matzek, who was scheduled to start Sunday’s game, will now start Monday night’s game at the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Tickets for Sunday’s game at Coors Field will be valid for the rescheduled game and can be exchanged for tickets of equal value to any game this season, so long as the exchange is made before the April 26 matchup is rescheduled.

No cash refunds will be issued, and exchanges will be accepted at the Coors Field ticket office and at all Rockies Dugout stores.

Tickets purchased on the StubHub will be valid for the rescheduled game, but they cannot be exchanged.
