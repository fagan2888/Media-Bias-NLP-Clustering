But The Associated Press reported earlier this year that the links could also result in personal information \u2014 including age, income, ZIP code, whether a person smokes and if a woman is pregnant\u2014 being sent to technology firms involved in marketing and advertising.\n\nA civil liberties group that previously had criticized the administration said the latest changes show a strong commitment to protecting privacy. Still, the Electronic Frontier Foundation said there\u2019s room for improvement. Administration officials said they are open to that.\n\n\u201cWe applaud HealthCare.gov\u2019s decision to support \u2018Do Not Track\u2019 and give their users strong privacy controls,\u201d said Cooper Quintin, a staff technologist with the foundation. \u201cWe think that this is a great first step (and) would be thrilled to see more organizations, both public and private, follow their lead.\u201d\n\nEnrollment Season\n\nHealthCare.gov\u2019s 2016 sign-up season starts Nov. 1, just a few weeks away.\n\nThis will be the third open enrollment for taxpayer-subsidized private health insurance under President Barack Obama\u2019s law, and the administration said it is focusing on making the online health insurance markets more customer-friendly. Also in the works are electronic tools to help consumers answer basic questions, such as whether the health plans they\u2019re looking at include their doctors and cover their medications. Another new feature will help customers get a better sense of their potential costs, not just premiums but deductibles and co-payments as well.\n\nAbout 10 million people are getting subsidized private coverage through federal and state insurance markets created by the law. Along with a Medicaid expansion now accepted by a majority of states and an improving economy, it\u2019s helped bring the number of uninsured people down to historically low levels \u2014 about nine percent of the population.\n\nThe administration expects the remaining 10.5 million eligible uninsured people to be a tougher sell. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell said that\u2019s because the most eager customers have already enrolled, and many of the remaining uninsured are young adults who may not see the value of coverage or are juggling tight household budgets.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jack Gillum contributed to this report.\n\nRelated:\n\nCopyright 2016 Associated Press.
