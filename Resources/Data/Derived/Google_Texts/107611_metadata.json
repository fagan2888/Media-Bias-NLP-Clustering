As eerily similar as the Russian aggression in Crimea (and for that matter, Georgia, a few years back) is to Soviet expansionism of the mid-20th century, it\u2019s not the same thing at all. The terms are different, the consequences are different, and even Putin \u2013 who has run a repressive regime and seems worrisomely nostalgic for the days of the Soviet empire \u2013 is different.\n\nThe old construct (and not just for the U.S.-Soviet match-up) used to be that America was a big, powerful country with a massive military and could vanquish any act of foreign aggression or human rights abuse with a quick and effective visit from U.S. troops. That is no longer the case. Not only do other nations have military forces of their own, but some have leaders who are willing to devastate their own countries and murder their own people in the face of a military threat from the U.S. or anyone else. The ill-conceived war in Iraq has had an enormous impact on the current U.S. ability to threaten a military strike, whether in Eastern Europe or, for that matter, the Middle East. That conflict was not, as the American public was told, a slam-dunk effort which would end quickly and with accolades and flowers from the Iraqi people. It was long, it was expensive, it was painful, and we ended up with basically nothing for the effort.\n\n[See a collection of editorial cartoons on Vladimir Putin and Russia.]\n\nThe argument has been made that other nations are not afraid of challenging President Obama because he has made it clear he is not eager to get involved in another war. It\u2019s true that he isn\u2019t but nor does the American public want to get involved in another war. We\u2019re still struggling out of a damaging recession, and the financial and human costs of policing the world are looking too high.\n\nThe hopeful reality is that Putin, while being a frightening character, is not stupid, and is not interested in being isolated from the world. He clearly wants to be a player on the world stage (the Sochi Olympics extravaganza was only part of it), and being made an international pariah is not going to get him there. The popular uprising in Ukraine was literally and figuratively a bit too close to home for Putin, who is throwing people in jail in Russia (now that the Olympics are over) to quell dissent. But at some point, Putin must realize that further aggression will result not only in diplomatic isolation, but economic punishment. That is something Russia cannot afford, and would only result in more discontent among an already restive Russian people.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the U.S. cannot afford to launch a military strike in Eastern Europe. But Russia can\u2019t afford it either. While Ukraine is hardly an economic powerhouse, its military is in relatively good shape (especially compared to Russia) and could be helped by foreign economic assistance of necessary. Putin does not have the old Soviet powerhouse behind him to annex Ukraine or even beat it into submission. Ukraine\u2019s future is rosier if it aligns more with Europe; bribes of trade deals and financial packages from Russia won\u2019t work.\n\nThe Cold War conflict was rooted in military power. The modern crisis in Eastern Europe is about money. And Putin\u2019s Russia doesn\u2019t have the economic power to sustain its current act of aggression. Let\u2019s hope that Putin realizes that before too much damage is done.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Putin\u2019s Russia Lacks the Economic Might to Annex Ukraine", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Russia doesn\u2019t have the economic might to sustain its occupation of Crimea.", "title": "Not the Cold War", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/susan-milligan/2014/03/03/putins-russia-lacks-the-economic-might-to-annex-ukraine", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/f9/0bfe1407cca41c3b849a590092f865/media:37031d870ceb4adabe5d0d488532f0f3UkraineProtests.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Russia doesn\u2019t have the economic might to sustain its occupation of Crimea.<br>", "card": "summary", "title": "Putin\u2019s Russia Lacks the Economic Might to Annex Ukraine"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "March 3, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Susan Milligan,Putin, Vladimir,Cold War,Ukraine,Russia,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Russia doesn\u2019t have the economic might to sustain its occupation of Crimea."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e34\"", "article_summary": "And Putin\u2019s Russia doesn\u2019t have the economic power to sustain its current act of aggression.\nWhile Ukraine is hardly an economic powerhouse, its military is in relatively good shape (especially compared to Russia) and could be helped by foreign economic assistance of necessary.\nPutin does not have the old Soviet powerhouse behind him to annex Ukraine or even beat it into submission.\nBut at some point, Putin must realize that further aggression will result not only in diplomatic isolation, but economic punishment.\nUkraine\u2019s future is rosier if it aligns more with Europe; bribes of trade deals and financial packages from Russia won\u2019t work."}
