Signs have been installed to alert drivers of the changes.\n\nCity officials say the ban is part of effort to keep side streets clear for emergency vehicles and cut down on late-night noise. After a six-month trial period, the City Council will take another look at the ban to see whether or not it worked.\n\nAnother change that went into effect Friday is a curfew on outdoor dining.\n\nThe number of seats a restaurant or bar can have on the sidewalk will be based on its indoor seating capacity, and all patrons will have to be inside by midnight Sundays through Thursdays and by 1 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nPrior to Friday, patrons can remain out on restaurant or bar patios until 2 a.m. nightly.\n\nCity officials said they received about 30 complaints in June and July over crowded sidewalks downtown and late-night noise. The dining curfew is also a temporary change. The City Council will look at the issue again in three months to determine if additional changes are needed.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-08-14 07:01:00", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14830426|asset_type=story"}, "description": "Two proposals designed to dampen some of the noise produced in busier parts of downtown Raleigh during the weekend take effect Friday night.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-14 22:56:12", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"description": "Two proposals designed to dampen some of the noise produced in busier parts of downtown Raleigh during the weekend take effect Friday night.", "title": "Downtown Raleigh's sidewalk dining curfew, left-turn restrictions take effect Friday :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/downtown-raleigh-s-sidewalk-dining-curfew-left-turn-restrictions-take-effect-friday/14830426/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2015/05/31/14681373/14681373-1439607365-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Two proposals designed to dampen some of the noise produced in busier parts of downtown Raleigh during the weekend take effect Friday night.", "title": "Downtown Raleigh's sidewalk dining curfew, left-turn restrictions take effect Friday :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/downtown-raleigh-s-sidewalk-dining-curfew-left-turn-restrictions-take-effect-friday/14830426/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2015/05/31/14681373/186462-16000-20150531220811-StanTheMan-frame-1-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-14T07:01:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "pinterest": "nohover", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "City officials said they received about 30 complaints in June and July over crowded sidewalks downtown and late-night noise.\nCity officials say the ban is part of effort to keep side streets clear for emergency vehicles and cut down on late-night noise.\nAnother change that went into effect Friday is a curfew on outdoor dining.\nThe City Council will look at the issue again in three months to determine if additional changes are needed.\nThe dining curfew is also a temporary change."}
