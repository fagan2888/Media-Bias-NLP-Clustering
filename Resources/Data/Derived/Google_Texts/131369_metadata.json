Instead of letting all of this success bloat his ego to unmanageable proportions, Sheeran has kept his wits about him. When People declared that he was among the sexiest people on the planet, he took the honor in stride.\n\nAccording to ABC News, Ed Sheeran is all about the humility. While this is probably just in his nature, the singer received plenty of advice from the likes of Taylor Swift, Chris Martin, and Pharrell Williams during his meteoric rise to fame.\n\nInstead of believing his own press, Sheeran tries to keep a level head.\n\n\u201cThe same thing Taylor said to me was the same thing Pharrell said, same thing Chris Martin said, is just the same thing: Constant humility, constant evolution and be a sponge, soak up your influences.\u201d\n\nWhen People magazine added Sheeran to their annual list of sexy people last year, the songwriter didn\u2019t start posting shirtless selfies on Instagram. Instead, he let the publications flattering declaration roll off his back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen myself as a sex symbol, and I think if I didn\u2019t play music no one else would [see me that way] either. We\u2019re attracted to people who are good at things. So being in that People magazine thing is very flattering, because it means people think I\u2019m good at my craft. But I would never say that I\u2019m a sex symbol.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Ed Sheeran has discussed the success he\u2019s enjoyed following the release of his debut album in 2011. During a chat with the Toronto Sun, the singer said he isn\u2019t letting the acclaim fill his skull with nonsense. Instead, Sheeran is focusing on the music, which could include a new album and a decidedly off-beat collaboration.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to bask in it. I like being able to share it with people, I like being able to fly my family out to places, put them on holidays and stuff like that, be able to go to a bar with my friends and being able to just say \u2018drink up.'\u201d\n\nAs for the future, Sheeran is already thinking about his new record.\n\n\u201cThe next thing I\u2019ll have out is collaboration with The Game. I\u2019ve been working on the follow-up album recently\u2026 I\u2019ve started writing new songs for that so that will be not next year, but possibly the year after that.\u201d\n\nAre you a fan of Ed Sheeran? What do you think about the talented singer/songwriter\u2019s seemingly endless humility? Is this an attribute that all artists should openly embrace?\n\n[Lead image via Randy Miramontez / Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ed Sheeran is a lot of things, but he's certainly not full of himself.
