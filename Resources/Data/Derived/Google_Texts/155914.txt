Douglas County and Castle Rock authorities are increasing patrols around area schools after multiple rumors of threats have been reported throughout the week.

Earlier in the week, a threat — not specified by authorities — was made to a DougCo school over social media. Since that time “rumors of threats at multiple schools” have been made, according to a news release from the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office.

“At this time, officers say there is no imminent danger,” according to the release.

Authorities have increased patrols at Castle View, Douglas County and DC Oaks high schools.

The school district is working with authorities to pursue all leads.

In addition, rumors of suicide pacts have been actively investigated, and are false, according to the release.

Over the past two weeks there have been four teenagers in Douglas County who have committed suicide, three boys and one girl. Two of the suicides were by hanging and two were by guns, Douglas County Coroner Lora Thomas said. None of the four suicides appear to be related, she said.

Anyone with any information, or has heard a threat, is asked to call Castle Rock police at 303-663-6100 or the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office at 303-660-7500.
