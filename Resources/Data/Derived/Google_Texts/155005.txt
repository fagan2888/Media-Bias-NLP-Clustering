Boulder-based BackJoy's goal of building a "24-hour bubble of postural protection" recently received a multimillion-dollar shot in the arm.

The burgeoning BackJoy, a maker of seats, shoes, pillows and other products designed to improve posture and reduce back pain, recently raised more than $8.67 million, according to filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Sandbridge Capital, a private equity firm with offices in New York and Los Angeles, also acquired a minority stake in BackJoy, officials for the Boulder firm said.

The backing of Sandbridge, which counts designer Tommy Hilfiger and former Crocs executive Ron Snyder among its advisers, could help BackJoy improve its position as a consumer products brand, as opposed to a medical device firm, said Bing Howenstein, BackJoy's chief executive officer.

"(The investment and Sandbridge's expertise will) help us guide our products into areas that are really more about a lifestyle," he said.

BackJoy's products currently are sold in 43 countries, including 6,500 stores across the United States. The additional capital will help to flesh out BackJoy's apparel and footwear offerings, he said.

BackJoy's journey to this point — and to Boulder — did not come without a storyline.

Partial credit for Howenstein's role of a CEO of a growing Boulder-based firm can be given to a seemingly unlikely subject: Robert Urich.

The late actor, known for his roles in TV shows "Vega$," "Soap" and "Spenser: For Hire," also took a spin as an infomerical star, touting the Cybersonic toothbrush.

Urich's ads caught the attention of Howenstein, who was working as a producer in Hollywood.

"(I thought), 'Wow, what a cool business,'" Howenstein said. " ... It was wildly successful. Why don't I try and do that?"

Howenstein licensed the technology for a "sitting device" developed by Preston Willingham and launched BackJoy via the infomercial avenue.

The one-man show was successful, generating $8.8 million in revenue for the then-Valencia, Calif.-based firm, according to Inc. magazine's 2011 ranking of the 500 fastest-growing privately held firms in the United States. As back problems seemed to become a growing issue for people worldwide, Howenstein believed the product he was pitching had greater potential.

"I also realized there was no Dr. Scholl's for back pain," he said, referencing the iconic brand of footwear orthotic products.

In an overhaul at BackJoy, Howenstein turned to former Crocs executive Ron Snyder, who helped firm create a global supply chain. BackJoy relocated to and relocated the company to Boulder in 2011, when it flipped its approach to retail and wholesale from direct-to-consumer.

The 110-employee BackJoy, which has a 23-person office in Boulder, is expected to add about five to 10 more workers locally this year.
