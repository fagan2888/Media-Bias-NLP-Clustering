There is the story of its corrupt public institutions, its feckless leaders, its poisonous racial politics, its practically nonexistent economy, the riots that have led to its thrice being occupied by federal troops. The most horrific story may be that of the death of its children.\n\nDetroit has the highest child-mortality rate of any American city, exceeding that of many parts of what we used to call the Third World. The rate of death before the age of 18 in Detroit is nearly three times New York City\u2019s, and its infant-mortality rate exceeds that of Botswana. The main cause of premature death among the children of Detroit is premature birth \u2014 the second is murder. While the city\u2019s murder rate among adults is nothing to be proud of, more horrifying is the fact that between 30 and 40 children are murdered in Detroit in a typical year. Some of those children are nine-month-olds killed by rifle fire in their beds; some are budding criminals in their late teens \u2014 and each of those situations offers its own unique horrors. So dangerous is the city that children are being armed by their parents, which has predictable consequences. \u201cI work in the Wayne County Juvenile Court, and these children are obtaining guns from adults,\u201d children\u2019s-law attorney Lynda White told the Detroit News, which has been conducting an in-depth investigation of how Detroit\u2019s children are dying. \u201cThey\u2019re obtaining guns illegally from people who are supposed to be responsible and people who are supposed to protect them. And if that person who has a huge influence in your life is giving you a gun, some of them tend to think it\u2019s okay to carry it. And they\u2019re being told, \u2018You need this for your protection, you live in Detroit.\u2019\u201d\n\nDetroit represents nothing less than progressivism in its final stage of decadence: Worried that unionized public-sector workers are looting your city? Detroit is already bankrupt, unable to provide basic services expected of it \u2014 half the streetlights don\u2019t work, transit has been reduced, neighborhoods go unpatrolled. Worried that public-sector unions are ruining your schools? Detroit\u2019s were ruined a generation or more ago, the results of which are everywhere to be seen in the city. Worried that Obamacare is going to ruin our health-care markets? General-practice physicians are hard to find in Detroit, and those willing to accept Medicaid \u2014 which covers a great swath of Detroit\u2019s population \u2014 are rarer still. Worried about the permissive culture? Four out of five of Detroit\u2019s children are born out of wedlock. Worried that government is making it difficult for businesses to thrive? Many people in Detroit have to travel miles to find a grocery store. This is the endgame of welfare economics: What good is Medicaid if there are no doctors? What good are food stamps where there is no food? What good are \u201cfree\u201d schools if you\u2019re so afraid to send your children there that you feel it prudent to arm them first?\n\nDetroit is what Democrats do.
