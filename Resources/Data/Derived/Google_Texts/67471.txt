Kurt Angle got out of rehab this week, after spending time there after a recent drinking and driving arrest. According to PWS on Sept. 7, Angle is scheduled to appear next week at a Team 3D Academy event.

Angle was arrested immediately following an episode of “TNA Impact Wrestling” for drinking and driving and checked into rehab shortly following his initial court date. This was Angle’s fifth time to be arrested.

Angle was arrested in 2007 for the charge of driving under the influence, in 2009 for driving with a suspended license with a controlled substance, in 2011 for “being in control of a motor vehicle while intoxicated,” again in 2011 for a DUI and this most recent time in August.

All charges against Angle were dropped in the first two cases, he was fined with a suspended sentence in the third, and the fourth incident dropped the DUI and charged him with only reckless driving.

Whether Kurt Angle will immediately return to TNA Wrestling following his rehab release is unknown, although he will appear at the Team 3D Academy along with Hulk Hogan, Samoa Joe, Jay Lethal and more. The event is raising money for the “Hope For a Single Mom” charity.
