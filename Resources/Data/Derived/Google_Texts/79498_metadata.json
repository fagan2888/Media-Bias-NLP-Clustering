It's part of the same campaign and features a different person: Carmen Carerra, a television personality and transgender woman. A third iteration of the ad, scattered across other subway trains, features a heterosexual couple. The accompanying text on all three versions is stern yet not alarmist, reading, \u201cBe HIV sure: One night can change your HIV status.\u201d\n\nThe campaign\u2019s goal \u2014 to heighten HIV awareness and stem the spread of the virus \u2014 is neither new nor unexpected. Experts have long classified New York City as an hot spot of the epidemic in the U.S. Over 110,000 residents are infected with the virus, and in 2013, 2,832 residents were newly diagnosed with the disease.\n\nBut the execution of this campaign is novel, a departure from the city\u2019s past anti-HIV efforts. Previously, ominous and dramatic messaging reigned, akin to lurid anti-smoking campaigns. A 2010 New York City Department of Health video illustrated in macabre detail HIV\u2019s ability to cause osteoporosis, dementia and anal cancer. The 30-second spot also featured a cast of distressed young men; no heterosexual couples or women were included.\n\nDr. Demetre Daskalakis, an infectious-disease specialist who now runs the city\u2019s Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, has spearheaded the movement away from that dramatic tone. Daskalakis \u2014 who came from Mount Sinai Hospital \u2014 stepped into the role this September. But he\u2019s hardly a routine bureaucrat. He identifies as a \u201cgay health warrior\u201d on Twitter and built a reputation as an advocate willing to deploy unorthodox tactics, like vaccinating for meningitis in nightclubs.\n\nHe played a major role in developing the city\u2019s #BeHIVSure campaign, one of two efforts that launched on Dec. 1 \u2014 World AIDS Day \u2014 with the blessing of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2026 focusing on health and less on disease,\u201d Daskalakis said of the campaigns.\n\nThe change in messaging is part of a change in policy. Daskalakis is eager to engage the majority demographic that\u2019s HIV negative in efforts to combat the epidemic.\n\n\u201cAn HIV negative test is as much a call to action as an HIV positive test,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like there\u2019s a continuum of care for people living with HIV, there\u2019s a continuum of care for people at risk.\u201d They should be educated, tested often and armed with prophylactics, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what #BeHIVSure is about.\u201d\n\nHe is implementing the unconventional tactics he introduced as an infectious-disease doctor. He noted that the city will target those who seek intimacy on the Web \u2014 \u201cthe sex clubs of the future are online,\u201d he says \u2014 and bolster messaging aimed at the city\u2019s transgender population.\n\nFor the many New York City nonprofits dedicated to battling HIV, Daskalakis\u2019 approach is welcomed.\n\n\u201cThe former administration \u2026 was very into fear-based messaging,\u201d said Terri Wilder, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT-UP). \u201cFear-based messaging doesn\u2019t really work.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s new approach has an affinity with these nonprofits\u2019 campaigns. Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis (GMHC) released a new set of ads on Dec. 15 that eschew alarming statistics; instead, they feature two young men canoodling and smiling. One poster hangs in the low-ceilinged network of tunnels beneath Grand Central that connect subway platforms. \u201cWe\u2019re about trust, respect and commitment,\u201d the pink lettering on the ad reads. \u201cI love my boo.\u201d\n\nThe campaign \u2014 titled \u201cI Love My Boo\u201d \u2014 is aimed at a high-risk demographic notoriously difficult to reach: African-American and Latino men ages 13 to 24 who have sex with other men. Anthony Hayes, a spokesman for GMHC, said the campaign looks to unstitch the long-standing scarlet letter tethered to HIV.\n\n\u201cThese campaigns are meant to show loving, intimate gay couples in a different way,\u201d he said. He\u2019s quick to commend the city\u2019s newest efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s about reaching people where they are, whether that\u2019s a doctor giving meningitis vaccinations in clubs or testing vans going around the city.\u201d (Daskalakis is a former board member at GMHC.)\n\nFor those who have lost loved ones to the virus, this shift in messaging is a reprieve from the fear and guilt often packaged with HIV education. But there is apprehension that subdued messaging might belie a still dangerous epidemic.\n\nDina Wilcox was living in Manhattan\u2019s Greenwich Village in 1988 when her eventual husband, Art, was diagnosed with HIV. When he died in 1991, they had been married just nine months. Art\u2019s diagnosis dovetailed with the city\u2019s unprecedented HIV scare. The number of AIDS deaths in the late 1980s and early \u201990s was climbing rapidly and peaked in 1994 with over 8,300 AIDS-related deaths. As a result, Wilcox said, she and Art were met with animosity.\n\n\u201cHe was treated like a guilty person,\u201d Wilcox recalls. \u201cThe [doctor] said \u2026 \u2018Start thinking about what you did to cause this.\u2019\u201d Later in the treatment process, one doctor nearly refused to touch Art, Wilcox said.\n\nShe said she witnessed HIV transform from a death sentence into a manageable disease \u2014 a massive step forward but also one capable of lulling New Yorkers into a dangerous state of complacency.\n\n\u201cUntil the number of infections every year go down \u2026 we need to be a bit dramatic,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stigmatize anyone, but neither do I want anybody to make the mistake of thinking [the epidemic is over].\u201d\n\n\u201cI also understand that living with the toxic drugs you have to take to survive the virus, and the side effects \u2026 it\u2019s not an easy ride,\u201d she added.\n\nDaskalakis\u2019 leadership comes at a pivotal moment for New York. The state is now in the unique position to quash the epidemic by bringing the number of new cases each year under 750. (About 80 percent of new cases in New York state are based in New York City.) The city has seen a steep decline in new diagnoses over the past several years, down from about 6,000 in 2001 to 2,832 in 2013.\n\n\u201cWe actually, truly can end the AIDS epidemic,\u201d said Jennifer Flynn, executive director of VOCAL-NY, a New York City\u2013based organization that assists low-income individuals with HIV. \u201cIt sounds hyperbolic, [but] the rate of getting people onto treatment can for the first time ever outpace the rate of new infections, and we can get ahead of the epidemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn places even like New York \u2014 where it\u2019s the epicenter of the epidemic in the United States \u2014 we can talk about getting to zero new infections within five years,\u201d Flynn said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Under new leadership, city is turning away from fear-based campaigns toward more nuanced messaging", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/4/new-york-hiv-.html", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/1/4/new-york-hiv-/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "height": 801}, "type": "article", "description": "Under new leadership, city is turning away from fear-based campaigns toward more nuanced messaging", "title": "New York City\u2019s public health \u2018warrior\u2019 revamps HIV messaging"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/1/4/new-york-hiv-/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "title": "New York City\u2019s public health \u2018warrior\u2019 revamps HIV messaging", "description": "Under new leadership, city is turning away from fear-based campaigns toward more nuanced messaging", "card": "summary", "site": "@AJAM"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "keywords": "New York City, HIV, New York, U.S., Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb73\"", "article_summary": "A 2010 New York City Department of Health video illustrated in macabre detail HIV\u2019s ability to cause osteoporosis, dementia and anal cancer.\n(About 80 percent of new cases in New York state are based in New York City.)\nFor the many New York City nonprofits dedicated to battling HIV, Daskalakis\u2019 approach is welcomed.\n\u201cAn HIV negative test is as much a call to action as an HIV positive test,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about reaching people where they are, whether that\u2019s a doctor giving meningitis vaccinations in clubs or testing vans going around the city.\u201d (Daskalakis is a former board member at GMHC.)"}
