Instead, Penders sits in front of a television with a laptop close by so that he can continually fire off 140 or fewer characters throughout the night, tweeting a wealth of anecdotes, analysis and opinions, still beguiled by the game he left five years ago.\n\n\u201cIt starts at 7, and it ends at 3 a.m.,\u201d Susie Penders said. \u201cAnd then he tapes the ones he can\u2019t watch. We must spend $500 a month on TV programming.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney well spent,\u201d Tom Penders said.\n\nAfter Penders began his coaching career in 1971 at Tufts University, he became one of the game\u2019s most outspoken figures. A natural fit for a television studio, where many former colleagues have landed during their postcoaching careers, Penders, 69, favors the freedom that Twitter provides as a soapbox.\n\n\u201cI would say just about every one of them, former coaches that are on television, they\u2019re all looking to get back into coaching,\u201d Penders said. \u201cThey don\u2019t tell you anything. They\u2019re auditioning for another job.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPenders signed up for Twitter in November 2009 at the behest of his daughter Karli Penders, who was helping him plan the promotion of his book, \u201cDead Coach Walking: Tom Penders Surviving and Thriving in College Hoops.\u201d\n\nAt first, Penders would tell Karli or Susie what to tweet. Shortly after he left his final coaching job, at the University of Houston, in March 2010, Penders signed in more regularly.\n\nAs he learned the nomenclature of RTs and LOLs, Penders began interacting with associates from the world of college basketball, like Dick Vitale, Tim Brando and Fran Fraschilla. Former Tufts players, some of whom he had not talked to since their time together in the Boston area, began following him and catching up through direct messages.\n\nWhile enamored of how he could maintain more than 40 years of college basketball networking in a few sentences on Twitter, Penders also quickly learned how a single tweet, like an offhand postgame quote, could foster controversy.\n\nOn Sept. 5, 2012, Penders alleged that Billy Gillispie, a former Texas Tech coach, tried to take Penders\u2019s job while he was at Houston. Penders described Gillispie in a derogatory way. Media outlets in Texas and Kentucky, where Gillispie formerly coached, picked up the tweet.\n\nPenders said that Karli still kept track of her father\u2019s online presence and had to occasionally reprimand him.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re telling the truth and you\u2019re giving an honest opinion, so what?\u201d Penders said of his brash tweeting style. \u201cI don\u2019t set out to hurt anybody. But I do think if I have experience in the field, I have an obligation to the 7,200 followers that follow me.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nJeff Goodman, who covers college basketball for ESPN Insider, said he first interacted with Penders on Twitter a few years ago, while covering a game at Barclays Center.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe was just annoying me, honestly,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cWe kept going back and forth. He was hard to take. Kind of since then, I\u2019ve kind of come to appreciate him on Twitter. He is frank, he is honest, he is entertaining, and I think there\u2019s not enough guys out there who have his background who utilize Twitter and aren\u2019t afraid to express their opinions.\n\n\u201cJust like me, he\u2019s right a bunch, he\u2019s off a bunch. I love the fact there\u2019s no filter with him. You want to hear the truth.\u201d\n\nGoodman said that a majority of active coaches with Twitter accounts often used them as promotion tools, without substance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t follow most of them,\u201d Goodman said.\n\nPenders\u2019s provocative style isn\u2019t restricted to college basketball. Last fall, he used Twitter to criticize the strategies of Kansas City Royals Manager Ned Yost and the Giants\u2019 offensive coordinator, Ben McAdoo.\n\nHe has also made public his ire for N.C.A.A. President Mark Emmert, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell, and Phil Jackson\u2019s efforts to introduce the triangle offense to the Knicks.\n\nThe tweets are not always full of vitriol. When Jerry Tarkanian and Dean Smith died, Penders shared with his followers unknown morsels from his friendships with the coaches.\n\n\u201cI just try to speak to people and reply to people that come through my Twitter,\u201d Penders said. \u201cFive to 10 percent of my tweets, I just originate. I feel like I can give information that people might be interested in. It\u2019s like a conversation.\u201d\n\nPenders, who endured several heart ailments during his coaching career, is currently not interested in getting back into the business. He admitted that he would not be tweeting if he were pursuing another job.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be as truthful when you\u2019re coaching,\u201d Penders said.\n\nDuring his postcoaching career, Penders has occasionally worked in television, covering college basketball games for local stations in Texas and the Atlantic 10 conference. He chose not to accept broadcasting commitments this season because his younger sister, Kathy von der Lieth, was seriously ill with uterine cancer. She died on Dec. 26.\n\nPenders is unsure if he will return to television. Instead, he said he approached Twitter the same way he did when in front of a camera, treating the audience \u201cas a friend\u201d and providing people with insightful and appealing material as they follow the games together.\n\nWith no superiors to report to, Penders has become liberated through his keyboard. To the pleasure of his followers and the likely dismay of others, including fellow coaches and co-workers, that means calling out overused jargon by color commenters, suggesting rule changes and advocating systematic overhauls that he could not voice as a coach.\n\nPenders believes there is substance to be found in his tweets, that he is not kvetching for the sake of it.\n\n\u201cBasketball and coaching was my life, and I care about the profession,\u201d Penders said. \u201cI care about the direction that it seems to be going in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime":
