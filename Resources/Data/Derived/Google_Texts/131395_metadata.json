Many people cannot afford insurance on the private market. Charities can only cover so much.\n\nBefore Obamacare, insurance companies regularly denied health insurance, due to pre-existing conditions, even to those that could afford the premiums.\n\nMost of us are one auto-accident or family catastrophic health condition away from bankruptcy, without health insurance.\n\nYes, we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and insurance. Other countries have done it and we should make that a priority.\n\nBut, in the meantime, as a nation, we do not need to be in the business of intentionally denying proper healthcare access to fellow human beings, based on their socio-economic background.\n\nWe do not need the haves and the have nots, when it comes to proper healthcare in this country.\n\nTim Gobble", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/2/4/293407/Healthcare-Right-Or-Privilege.aspx", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2015-02-04T19:54:52.6688282Z", "modified_time": "2015-02-04T19:55:31.9068294Z"}, "type": "article", "title": "Healthcare: Right Or Privilege?"}}, "article_summary": "In this country, a reasonable level of basic health care, for any legitimate health condition, should be a right, not a privilege.\nWe do not need the haves and the have nots, when it comes to proper healthcare in this country.\nMost of us are one auto-accident or family catastrophic health condition away from bankruptcy, without health insurance.\nChildren born into poverty deserve the same care for broken bones, cancer, diabetes, or any other disease or condition, regardless of parents wealth.\nBefore Obamacare, insurance companies regularly denied health insurance, due to pre-existing conditions, even to those that could afford the premiums."}
