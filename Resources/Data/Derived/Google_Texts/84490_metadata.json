Israeli officials admitted the likelihood\u2014already acknowledged by many\u2014that this killing was carried out in revenge for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers.\n\nBoth sides have stepped up their aggression in the past few days, with rocket launches from Gaza into Israel and Israeli airstrikes against Gaza.\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar cycle: attack for attack, murder for murder. Such patterns are familiar from conflicts across the world, but they have a special resonance in the Holy Land.\n\nAfter all, it was from Israel, nearly 3,000 years ago, that this famous concept spread.\n\nThe Book of Exodus in the Hebrew Bible says, \u201cThe penalty shall be life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.\u201d\n\nThe Book of Deuteronomy uses even stronger language: \u201cShow no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.\u201d\n\nAnd the Book of Leviticus says again, \u201cAnyone who maims another shall suffer the same injury in return: fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The injury he inflicted on another shall be inflicted on him.\u201d\n\nFew biblical laws are repeated three times; this is one of those few. It is known as the lex talionis, or \u201claw of retaliation,\u201d and it would seem to be central to the biblical worldview.\n\nFlare-up in Israeli-Palestinian violence: Why now?\n\nThis law is often brought as evidence that the Bible cannot be a reliable guide for modern morality: Who today would truly advocate for this kind of retributive justice?\n\nIt seems barbaric that the penalty for arson, for example, would be burning the arsonist to death\u2014this sounds like something out of the Middle Ages, not out of the 21st century.\n\nThough famously biblical, lex talionis isn\u2019t a biblical creation at all.\n\nIt was already present in the famous Code of Hammurabi, from the 18th century BCE: \u201cIf an upper-class man should blind the eye of another upper-class man, they shall blind his eye,\u201d and so on through breaking bones, knocking out teeth, etc.\n\nEarlier Mesopotamian law codes, two generations before Hammurabi, take what we would consider a more civilized approach to the matter:\n\n\u201cIf a man bites the nose of another man and thus cuts it off\u201d \u2014don\u2019t ask\u2014 \u201che shall weigh and deliver sixty shekels of silver; an eye, sixty shekels; a tooth, thirty shekels \u2026\u201d\n\nIt turns out that the oldest codes in the Near Eastern legal tradition, Sumerian laws from the 21st century BCE, also have payment in place of retaliation.\n\nThe concept of \u201ceye for an eye\u201d isn\u2019t really representative of some primitive state of humanity\u2014it\u2019s actually a development from an earlier system of monetary compensation.\n\nYet it was not a permanent shift; some of the earliest interpreters of the Bible read the lex talionis as advocating for monetary compensation: the value of an eye for an eye.\n\nThis remains a very common interpretation even today\u2014quite likely as an attempt to make the biblical custom seem less harsh in comparison to contemporary cultural and legal norms.\n\nHas the Middle East crisis reached a tipping point?\n\nIn the Talmud, the fundamental Jewish legal text, there is an extended discussion about the phrase \u201ceye for an eye,\u201d with multiple rabbis arguing, and the text concluding, that the phrase means nothing other than financial compensation.\n\nEventually, in Judaism the literal reading of lex talionis came to be associated with heresy.\n\nThere is another important aspect of \u201ceye for an eye\u201d that is often overlooked: in the Bible, the law prescribes that the punishment be leveled against the offending individual by the state.\n\nIt is not permitted for the victim himself to turn around and inflict the same injury on the aggressor. On this the Bible and modern law agree.\n\nBut another biblical legal tradition provides the exception to this rule, and it too has enjoyed a long life down to the present: the idea that in the case of premeditated murder, someone from the family of the victim is appointed the \u201cblood-avenger.\u201d\n\nThe notion of putting a murderer to death is common enough even today (see: death penalty). But not so the idea that it is the obligation of the victim\u2019s family, rather than of a central government.\n\nThis biblical passage enshrines in law the retaliatory instinct of anyone whose close relative has been injured. And it is this instinct that we see playing itself out in the Middle East today.\n\nThe problem, both between the two nations and for the rest of the world, is defining which side is playing which role. Both Israel and Gaza believe themselves to be the blood-avenger, and the other to be the murderer.\n\nYet even in the case of blood vengeance, biblical law at least keeps the system under the watchful eye of the elders, who arbitrate the claims of the respective parties, just as in the more direct cases of lex talionis.\n\nNowhere in the world is the Bible more alive and its traditions more present than in Israel and Palestine, the lands from which the holy book emerged.\n\nWas teen's death a revenge killing?\n\nAs the conflict between the two parties worsens, yet again, comparisons with the kinds of retaliation and blood vengeance found in the Bible grow more and more apt.\n\nAnd so, therefore, does the need for a third party to play the part of arbitrator: to settle the price of monetary compensation, to declare the terms of retaliation, and to put a stop to the cycle of blood vengeance.\n\nThat's a role the Bible calls for someone to fill - and we're all still waiting.\n\nJoel S.
