I was in a holiday store that sells goods for Christmas, Halloween, and Easter. Its Easter card selection was cute but didn\u2019t include anything even remotely religious. So I went to the neighborhood card store to pick up something a bit more on-topic for the highest day of the church year.\n\nPaper Source had a bunch of cards featuring bunnies. Some chicks. Dogs with bunny ears. Cats with bunny ears. One card was just bunny ears with no animal attached to them at all. The only remotely religious card was one making light of Judas. ...\n\nI went up to the counter and asked to be directed to the religious Easter card selection. The lady at the counter took me right back to the Judas card. Literally, a card teasing about Judas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There she goes, there she goes again.\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is another classic example of M.Z. \"GetReligionista \r\nemeritus\" Hemingway spotting another cultural hook that is big enough, and \r\nhot enough, to cover as a valid religion-news trend.\r\n\r\nTo state the question bluntly: Has Easter evolved into the new Xmas?\r\n\r\nSaints preserve us.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Hemingway -- writing at The Federalist of course -- is not \r\npredicting something along the lines of the dreadful church-state \"War on \r\nChristmas\" stories that, tragically, have become a permanent part of \r\nAmerica's cable-TV and click-bait online news marketplace.\r\n\r\nNo, she is asking a more serious question, one captured in the \r\ndouble-decker headline on her piece:\r\n\r\n    The Easter Bunny\u2019s War On Easter Is Going Too Far\r\n\r\n    If you celebrate Easter with fake bunny ears, you're set.
