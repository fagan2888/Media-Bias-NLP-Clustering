I have concluded that he thinks everyone, not just Americans, are idiots.\n\nWe know he lies about everything, but these two topics are clearly near and dear to his heart.\n\nMy friend, Paul Driessen, is a policy analyst for the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, a free market think tank. Among the pundit class he\u2019s ranked very high by his colleagues. Here\u2019s what he has to say about climate change:\n\n\u201cEarth climate always has changed, is always changing, and always will change\u2014but not from fossil-fuel use. Solar fluctuations, deep ocean circulation patterns, and other powerful natural forceshave driven climate change and weather events throughout Earth\u2019s history and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s hubris is breathtaking. He now thinks an army of regulators can control our planet\u2019s temperature and climate by tweaking emissions of plant-fertilizing carbon dioxide, a mere 0.04% of the atmosphere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s communities do not need to be protected from climate change. They need to be protected from the excesses of authoritarian presidents and bureaucrats.\u201d\n\nDriessen and I look at and listen to Obama and wonder if others too see and hear someone uttering some of the most absurd claims about the climate. Then we worry that this someone is the President of the United States with the power to turn his ignorance into national policy.\n\nAt this point we have suffered his initial failure to respond to the recession he inherited from the 2008 financial crisis. More than six years later the economy has barely moved toward a normal rate of growth. Then we were gifted with ObamaCare and the disruption of what was widely regarded as the best health system in the world. And, for good measure, he imposed Common Core on an already weakened educational system. It is being repealed and opposed in many states. For good measure, his foreign policy, if he has one, is widely regarded as a total failure.\n\nHow is it a former \u201ccommunity organizer\u201d possesses a seemingly vast understanding of meteorology? Did they also teach that at the Harvard Law School? \u201cClimate change,\u201d said Obama, addressing a graduating class of the Coast Guard Academy, \u201cconstitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security, and make no mistake; it will impact how our military defends our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur military and our combatant commanders,\u201d the President told the Academy graduates, \u201cour services\u2014including the Coast Guard\u2014will need to factor climate change into plans and operations, because you need to be ready.\u201d For what? For a rainstorm? For snow? Wind?\n\nThis is the same President who sees no threat to our national security from Iran whose leaders shout \u201cDeath to America\u201d every day when they aren\u2019t also shouting \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d He has zealously been pursuing a deal that would enable Iran, the leading supporter of terrorism, to have nuclear weapons. Meanwhile Islamic State (ISIS) is taking over more territory in northern Iraq and into Syria. Obama might as well be dropping bags of marshmallows on them.\n\nHe blamed climate change in the form of \u201csevere droughts\u201d for the rise of Islamism in the Middle East and Africa. Someone needs to tell Obama that there have always been severe droughts somewhere on the planet, and floods, and forest fires, and blizzards, and hurricanes. Even so, in the last eighteen years, there have actually been LESS of these natural events, along with the flatlining of the planet\u2019s overall or average temperature\u2014there has been no warming!\n\nNot content to blame climate change for the rise of terrorism, the White House issued a report that was described as \u201ca doomsday scenario of health, security, economic and political issues.\u201d The thing about climate is that it measured in centuries, not years. As for the weather, while records are maintained, it is usually reported as today\u2019s news with a forecast of the coming week.\n\nSo you shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the report blamed \u201casthma attacks\u201d on climate change!\n\nSuffice to say there isn\u2019t a glimmer of hard evidence to support anything the President is saying these days about climate change.\n\nAnd this is the same President that wants the U.S. and the rest of the world to give up the use of fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil and natural gas\u2014to \u201cstop climate change.\u201d\n\nIF Obama\u2019s climate change idiocy is just a way to distract Americans from the real problems we have encountered thanks to his failure to address them, then it is purely cynical and political.\n\nIF Obama really believes this stuff, he is unfit to be President.\n\n[Originally published at Warning Signs]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/05/barack-climate-change-obama/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obama-Signs-Executive-Order.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Barack \u201cClimate Change\u201d Obama"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "He blamed climate change in the form of \u201csevere droughts\u201d for the rise of Islamism in the Middle East and Africa.\nSo you shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the report blamed \u201casthma attacks\u201d on climate change!\nSuffice to say there isn\u2019t a glimmer of hard evidence to support anything the President is saying these days about climate change.\nHere\u2019s what he has to say about climate change:\u201cEarth climate always has changed, is always changing, and always will change\u2014but not from fossil-fuel use.\nSolar fluctuations, deep ocean circulation patterns, and other powerful natural forceshave driven climate change and weather events throughout Earth\u2019s history and will continue to do so.\u201d\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s hubris is breathtaking."}
