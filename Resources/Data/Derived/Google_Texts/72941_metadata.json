Then it\u2019s easy to watch,\u201d said Venus, who won U.S. Open titles in 2000 and 2001, but had lost in the third round or earlier each of the past four years. \u201cSo it depends on how my nerves are.\u201d\n\nSerena acknowledged having a bout with the jitters before her second-round match, when she double-faulted 10 times, made another two dozen unforced errors and needed to come back over and over just to claim the opening set against a qualifier ranked 110th. Afterward, she took pointers from coach Patrick Mouratoglou and headed out to the practice court right away.\n\nThen, in the third round, against someone ranked 101st, Serena dropped the first set and was two games from defeat in the second before turning things around. Again, she put in more work to fix things.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud that I was able to serve a lot better. Obviously I had to,\u201d she said after winning 22 of 28 first-serve points and never facing a break point against Keys. \u201cI was like, \u2018Serena, it\u2019s now or never. You\u2019ve got to get that serve together.'\u201d\n\nAs for whether she\u2019d need to head out for a training session with Mouratoglou this time, Serena said: \u201cNo, not today. I\u2019m going to take the rest of the day off and relax and just enjoy it.\u201d\n\nAnother women\u2019s fourth-round match scheduled for Sunday was scratched when 25th-seeded Eugenie Bouchard withdrew with a concussion, two days after slipping and falling in the locker room. The 21-year-old Canadian, the runner-up at Wimbledon last year, was supposed to play Roberta Vinci of Italy.\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at twitter.com/HowardFendrich", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Serena Williams to face Venus Williams in US Open quarterfinals", "title": "Serena Williams to face Venus Williams in US Open quarterfinals", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/06/serena-williams-to-face-venus-williams-in-us-open-quarterfinals/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150906_031339_serena-williams.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150906_031339_serena-williams.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-06T15:12:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T23:50:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Venus\u2019 match came first in Arthur Ashe Stadium, so then she had to decide whether to watch Serena play.\nNEW YORK \u2014 No need for any extra practice for Serena Williams after this performance.\n1-seeded Serena said after needing only 68 minutes to dismiss Keys, a 20-year-old American with formidable serves and forehands who simply was outplayed.\nPlaying far better than she did earlier in the U.S. Open as she chases a calendar-year Grand Slam, Williams set up a quarterfinal against older sister Venus with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over 19th-seeded Madison Keys on Sunday.\n'\u201dAs for whether she\u2019d need to head out for a training session with Mouratoglou this time, Serena said: \u201cNo, not today."}
