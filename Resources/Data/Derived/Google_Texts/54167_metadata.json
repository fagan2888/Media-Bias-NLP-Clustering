This is despite the sheer volume of content it offers consumers: billions of health care choices through the insurance finder and more than 500 pages of new content, all of which is designed to grow with ongoing consumer feedback and as our health care system improves.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Park developed Healthcare.gov as the first central database of health coverage options.\n\nThe site combined \u201cinformation about public programs, from Medicare to the new Pre-Existing Conditions Insurance Plan, with information from more than 1,000 private insurance plans,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nIn November 2010, Park announced what he described as \u201cgood news.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve updated the Healthcare.gov Insurance Finder to include more private insurance plans and health insurance companies,\u201d Park stated in another HHS press release.\n\n\u201cThe Insurance Finder allows you to compare different plans, showing important information that has never before been made public, such as the percentage of people who applied for coverage and were denied.\u201d\n\nIn July 2012, Nextgov.com reported it was Park who tapped the private sector to drive innovation, including at the HHS websites.\n\nEventually, two high-tech contractors, CGI Federal and UnitedHealth Group unit Quality Software Services Inc (QSSI), were brought in to administer and expand Healthcare.gov.\n\nCGI Federal, based in Canada, was the main contractor behind the site. While the company has been taking most of the heat for the technological problems, CGI is blaming QSSI and the federal government for Healthcare.gov\u2019s poor performance.\n\nCGI senior Vice President Cheryl Campbell told the House Energy and Commerce Committee last week, \u201cUnfortunately, the (front door software) created a bottleneck that prevented the vast majority of users from accessing [Healthcare.gov].\u201d\n\nAndrew Slavitt, executive vice president with QSSI\u2019s parent company, fired back that the website jamming was a result of a \u201clate decision\u201d that required users to register on the site before browsing for insurance products.\n\nSlavitt, however, did not mention who made the decision.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., has been criticized by the White House for asking Park to testify. White House officials claimed Park was too busy attempting to fix Healthcare.gov and that his attending a congressional hearing would stall the repair efforts. Eventually, Park agreed to testify.\n\nIn a letter to Park asking him to testify, Issa said it was unacceptable that Park had found time to speak to the news media but not appear before Congress.\n\nIssa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, wrote that millions of Americans \u201chave lost their health insurance and are rapidly approaching a point where they must begin to prepare for the possibility of having no health insurance on Jan. 1, 2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey deserve your sworn testimony before their elected representatives about what went wrong \u2013 not simply media outlets that White House officials have deemed an appropriate use of your time away from working on the website project,\u201d Issa said.\n\nAt the age of 24, Park co-founded the health-care technology company Athenahealth, which went public with a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion.\n\nHe reportedly began his business career as a consultant for Booz Allen Hamilton, the firm that has been in the news lately for its employment of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\n\nWith research by Brenda J. Elliott.\n\nWhat will be the endgame of Obamacare? It will offer the finest health care to all Americans\n\nIt will oversome initial hurdles and become an accepted institution in American life just like Social Security\n\nOnce the bugs are worked out, Americans will be grateful for what government has done for them\n\nIt will stand for a hundred years as Obama's crowning achievement\n\nA rocky start for a massive new improvement is par. A year from now, nobody will remember the glitches\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is right. It'll sweep Democrats into office because people are so appreciative of all the changes\n\nAmericans will rise up soon and demand even Democrats repeal it\n\nIts spectacular failure will set back the liberal left agenda\n\nIt'll be repealed in the next year\n\nIts most egregious provisions will be delayed a year, allowing Democrats to get re-elected in 2014\n\nIt will stand for a hundred years as Obama's greatest curse on America\n\nAmericans will learn to curse Obama's name every time they need medical care\n\nPeople will be so fed up, it'll lead to rioting in the streets\n\nIt'll lead to a national catastrophe of people unable to get health care\n\nIt will cause a massive Republican sweep in the next election\n\nThis manufactured crisis will result in single payer within 2 years\n\nOther View Results", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Is an Obama administration official escaping blame for the catastrophic Healthcare.gov website?
