Collin Peterson of Minnesota, voted in favor of the bill, and seven Republicans voted against it.\n\nSome felt that dismantling Obamacare in pieces wasn't sufficient given that Republicans promised to completely repeal Obamacare.\n\nThe Daily Signal reported Thursday that Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a joint statement that the House reconciliation bill that repeals only parts of Obamacare \"simply isn't good enough.\"\n\nOther Republicans argued that the legislation was a step in the right direction, and should move forward.\n\nRepresentative Tom Price, R-Ga., chairman of the House Budget Committee, said in a statement the bill \"repeals the most coercive components of Obamacare \u2014 eliminating onerous taxes, the individual and employer mandates, an Obamacare slush fund, and lifting unnecessary burdens on employers and employees.\"\n\nPrice noted the legislation would increase funding for community health centers while eliminating government support for Planned Parenthood, which is under investigation after a series of undercover videos related to its role with aborted baby body parts.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a pro-life group, praised the House's efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider.\n\n\"Today\u2019s House vote cuts Planned Parenthood's Medicaid funding \u2014 the most significant portion of the abortion business' overall $528 million a year in taxpayer funding. Women have the most to gain from congressional action to reroute these tax dollars to community and rural health centers, which provide comprehensive health care services to women, but do not abort the lives of unborn children and harvest their body parts,\" Dannenfelser said.\n\nSome conservatives called the House's action a \"show vote\" that won't go anywhere in the Senate.\n\n\"The House reconciliation bill includes a number of vulnerable provisions that will be tough to get past the Byrd rule unless they are addressed,\" said Paul Winfree, director of the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe Byrd rule allows senators to remove provisions in reconciliation legislation that don't relate to budgetary matters.\n\n\"Ultimately, I suspect the bill will look very different if it gets through the Senate as a reconciliation bill,\" Winfree said.\n\nOriginally published at The Daily Signal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/house-approves-bill-that-defunds-planned-parenthood", "image": "http://www.churchmilitant.com//images/social_images/2015-10-27-niles-a.jpg", "title": "House Approves Bill That Defunds Planned Parenthood"}, "twitter": {"site": "@church_militant", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "House Approves Bill That Defunds Planned Parenthood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"Ultimately, I suspect the bill will look very different if it gets through the Senate as a reconciliation bill,\" Winfree said.\nNews:WASHINGTON, October 27, 2015 (Kate Scanlon) - The House approved a budget reconciliation bill Friday that would repeal portions of Obamacare and cut federal funds to Planned Parenthood for one year.\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B.
