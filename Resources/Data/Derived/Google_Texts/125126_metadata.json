I wasn\u2019t like it was made out to be, \u2018He\u2019s disgruntled, he\u2019s exiled from the team.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t the case. I had a choice.\u201d\n\nWhy did he make that choice?\n\n\u201cJust where I was at,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere my thoughts were, how I felt. I thought it was best for me just to mve on.\u201d\n\nI asked him if he wavered when injuries mounted. (At one point, the Nuggets had no point guards.)\n\n\u201cNo, I knew I was staying away,\u201d he said. \u201cI was asked to come back, but I decided to stay away and continue to work out and be prepared for whatever happens. I\u2019d say I wish I could be out there with my teammates, but I just made the decision for myself just to stay away. I didn\u2019t want to bring any more attention to the organization or to the players to distract them from moving foward. So I just kind of stayed away.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI just kind of flipped the page. The only lingering part was me just sitting around. That was probably the most irritating part. The learning experience, you can continue to learn no matter what year you are in the NBA. Whether you did right or wrong, you learn from it and move on.\u201d\n\nI asked if he planned to try to have any closure with Shaw Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to play the game and get on,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point in the season where we need to get this win. That\u2019s where my focus is.\u201d\n\nA bit earlier, at his pregame session with the media this afternoon \u2014 the home coach\u2019s usual session 105 minutes before NBA gametime \u2014 I asked Shaw if he would shake hands with Miller, wave at him, speak with him or otherwise seek a bit of that closure.\n\n\u201cI feel that we have closure,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go out of my way to not make contact. If we cross paths, I have no problem with speaking to him. I don\u2019t think either of us have taken this situation personally. It\u2019s an unfortunate situation that happened. Neither of us wanted it to happen. I don\u2019t have any problemw with him. I\u2019ve said all along I\u2019ve had the utmost respect for him and still do as a player.\n\n\u201cOnce again, it was unfortunate. But he\u2019s moved on. He\u2019s in a better place in terms of his situation. His team\u2019s going to be in the playoffs. He\u2019s going to be able to contribute to that. I\u2019m happy for him to be in that situation. For us, we\u2019ve gotten to develop some of the guys who were playing behind him more time so that we can see what they can do. That\u2019s a positive that I take out of that situation as well\u2026It\u2019s not the first time that these things have happened. So at least on my end, there\u2019s nothing personal at all. This will be the first time that we\u2019ve actually laid eyes on each other since the first of January when the incident took place and the first time we\u2019ve spoken.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com\n\nMeet the Blogger", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Andre Miller,Brian Shaw,Denver Nuggets", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Nuggets coach Brian Shaw and Washington guard Andre Miller about to see each other for first time since Jan. 1", "title": "Brian Shaw and Andre Miller: Will they shake on it after Nuggets split?", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/03/23/shaw-miller/10225/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/03/bryan-shaw-andre-miller-495x389.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Nuggets coach Brian Shaw and Washington guard Andre Miller about to see each other for first time since Jan. 1", "title": "Brian Shaw, Andre Miller talk Nuggets split; Miller says it was his call to stay away", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/03/23/shaw-miller/10225/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/03/bryan-shaw-andre-miller-495x389.jpg", "creator": "@TFrei", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Nuggets coach Brian Shaw and Washington guard Andre Miller about to see each other for first time since Jan. 1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd41e2\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019d say I wish I could be out there with my teammates, but I just made the decision for myself just to stay away.\n\u201cI said I wanted to stay away and they granted it.\nI wasn\u2019t like it was made out to be, \u2018He\u2019s disgruntled, he\u2019s exiled from the team.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t the case.\n\u201cI was asked to come back, but I decided to stay away and continue to work out and be prepared for whatever happens.\nHe\u2019s going to be able to contribute to that."}
