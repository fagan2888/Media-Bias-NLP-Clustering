Such is the nature of a place where residents talk of the gunshots they sometimes hear, the abandoned buildings they drive past, and the jobs that have faded away and rarely been replaced.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey survey the state, especially Prattville, a suburb of Montgomery less than 40 miles away, where the median household income, $58,773, is more than double Selma\u2019s, $22,076, and they speculate aloud about why their city has not thrived.\n\n\u201cSometimes you wonder if it\u2019s going to be around, if it\u2019s going to get extinct,\u201d said Juanita Tripp, 70, who has lived in Selma her entire life and now works at a furniture store.\n\nBut a development at Craig, which for decades trained American pilots and has a runway that can accommodate some of the world\u2019s largest aircraft, could be the catalyst for a reversal of the economic slump in a county, now about 70 percent black, where the biggest annual draw is a re-enactment of the 1965 crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge by civil rights marchers.\n\nResearchers note that in a county of approximately 42,000 people, a rush of new jobs related to the training center would move the unemployment rate sharply downward. (The state said Dallas County\u2019s unemployment rate was 11.7 percent in April, the most recent month for which data is available, nearly five percentage points higher than the statewide figure.)\n\nIf there is any trepidation about a Middle Eastern presence in an Alabama town, it has not surfaced. Instead, mindful of the economic stakes, local officials are doing all they can to preserve Selma\u2019s chances. The mayor did not respond to messages seeking comment, and the executive director of the Selma & Dallas County Economic Development Authority declined a request for an interview, citing his desire not to endanger the project.\n\nSelma would not be the first Alabama city to secure a momentous investment from abroad. Airbus has a significant presence in Mobile, and Honda, Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz all operate large factories in the state. In Wilcox County, which borders Dallas County, a Chinese company runs a copper plant.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in many instances, the story here has been about Dallas County and the longstanding economic struggles of the self-described Queen City of the Black Belt.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been in the running for many projects and have not made it to that last point,\u201d said Nisa Miranda, the longtime director of the University of Alabama Center for Economic Development.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt is a troubling and grim record that many people here blame for quality-of-life issues that contributed to a population decline in Selma of more than 2 percent in about two years, even as Alabama\u2019s population increased by nearly 1 percent.\n\n\u201cWhen we first came to Selma, it was peaceful and quiet, and at night you could walk anywhere you wanted,\u201d Charity Baskin said as she chatted on her porch on a recent afternoon, a short walk from Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, which civil rights protesters used as a meeting place in the 1960s. \u201cBut as the years went by, it started getting violent, and we don\u2019t care for that violence.\u201d\n\nThere are far rosier takes on Selma and its prospects, though, and in conservative Alabama, there is a feeling among some here that the plights are more individual than systemic.\n\n\u201cIf you work hard, you\u2019ll get ahead,\u201d said Randy Malone, 53, though he acknowledged that Selma \u201ccan always be better.\u201d\n\nAnd there is a sense here, in a region of deep and proud religious traditions, that a higher power will someday redeem Selma.\n\n\u201cA lot of people prayed for a better economy,\u201d said David Summerlin, whose hardware store customers can also pick up a brownie \u2014 with nuts \u2014 for 75 cents. \u201cThey pray every day, and they pray hard. And I think it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment was evident even to a relative newcomer in a city filled with natives.\n\n\u201cA lot of hope and faith, that\u2019s what\u2019s holding them,\u201d said Teja Schmitt, who arrived in Selma four years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s the faith. People so strongly believe that there are going to be changes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo one knows whether those changes will include pilots from overseas.\n\n\u201cIt will make the economy better if it happens,\u201d said Ray Martin, who owns a barbershop on Alabama Avenue. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to wait and see.\u201d", "article_metadata":
