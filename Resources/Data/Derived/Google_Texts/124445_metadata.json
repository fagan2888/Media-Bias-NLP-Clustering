Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo\n\nAs if the fringe right needed any more evidence that Tom Donohue and the Chamber of Commerce have joined the collaborator ranks of surrender-monkey, fellow-traveler RINOs, the corporate chieftain raised the white flag on Obamacare in his \"State of American Business\" address this morning.\n\nDonohue noted that the Chamber had opposed Obamacare, warning the administration of the \"many flaws in this massive piece of legislation.\" But, he went on:\n\nThe administration is obviously committed to keeping the law in place, so the Chamber's not out opposing it. We have been working pragmatically to fix those parts of Obamacare that can be fixed while doing everything possible to make regulations and mandates as manageable as possible for business. In 2014 we will working to repeal some of the onerous healthcare taxes, repeal, delay or change the employer mandate and give companies and their employees more flexibility in the choice of health insurance plans. \u2026 All responsible parties need to work together and be more open to change because this nation still needs true health care reform that controls costs, improves quality and expands access to the uninsured.\n\n[ See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]\n\nEmphasis mine, obviously. It's worth noting that his affirmative comment about the Chamber not opposing the law was not in the prepared remarks Chamber flacks distributed to reporters. Speaking to the media after his speech, Donohue elucidated about how to deal with Obamacare:\n\nWhat we have to do is delay whatever we have to delay for short periods of time while we look these things over, go through all the stuff everybody's talking about, keep what works, fix what we can still fix and get rid of some of the things that might not fit.\n\nThat sounds strikingly \u2026 pragmatic. And maybe he means it. But whether he does or not is in a sense beside the point \u2013 the Chamber of Commerce is about as establishment Washington GOP as it gets, so its president adopting a pragmatist tone of having to live with Obamacare is a striking example of the kind of Obamacare acceptance that Greg Sargent, for example, has written about. Remember that for much of the GOP \u2013 and virtually all of its activist base \u2013 the only fix for Obamacare is repeal, full stop.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Chamber of Commerce Is \u2018Not Out Opposing Obamacare\u2019", "og": {"url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2014/01/08/chamber-of-commerce-is-not-out-opposing-obamacare", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "type": "article", "description": "The group\u2019s president becomes the latest Republican in the ranks of acceptance.", "title": "How the Chamber of Commerce Learned to Stop Worrying and Live With Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The group\u2019s president becomes the latest Republican in the ranks of acceptance.", "card": "summary", "title": "Chamber of Commerce Is \u2018Not Out Opposing Obamacare\u2019"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Jan. 8, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Robert Schlesinger,Affordable Care Act,business,U.S. Chamber of Commerce,economy,picks,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The group\u2019s president becomes the latest Republican in the ranks of acceptance."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8a8\"", "article_summary": "Donohue noted that the Chamber had opposed Obamacare, warning the administration of the \"many flaws in this massive piece of legislation.\"\nIt's worth noting that his affirmative comment about the Chamber not opposing the law was not in the prepared remarks Chamber flacks distributed to reporters.\nRemember that for much of the GOP \u2013 and virtually all of its activist base \u2013 the only fix for Obamacare is repeal, full stop.\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Tom Donohue walks from the White House after a meeting with White House staff regarding the fiscal cliff, Wednesday, Dec. 19, 2012, in Washington.\nBut, he went on:The administration is obviously committed to keeping the law in place, so the Chamber's not out opposing it."}
