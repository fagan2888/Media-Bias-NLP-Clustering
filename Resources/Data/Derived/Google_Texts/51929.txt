A 12-year-old boy who was shot by police after they mistook his replica airsoft gun for a real gun died Sunday, police said.

Officers responded on Saturday afternoon to a call about someone waving around a gun at a Cleveland playground, Cleveland.com reports. The caller told police that gun was likely not real and that the person was “probably a juvenile,” but those comments were never relayed to the officers who responded.

“There is a guy with a pistol, it’s probably fake, but he’s pointing it at everyone,” the caller says in a recording of the 911 call released by police, USA Today reports.

Police reportedly fired two shots; the boy was hit in the torso and underwent surgery on Saturday. A hospital spokesperson confirmed Sunday that the boy had since died.

The police department said in a statement that an orange marker that typically appears on toy guns to distinguish them from real guns was missing. Two police officers have been placed on administrative leave, NBC reports.

Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office is investigating along with the Cleveland police.
