Hester will not play against the Baltimore Ravens after being waived a day after the team cut down to its 53-man roster.\n\nIn his place, the Broncos added linebacker Adrian Robinson off the NFL waiver wire. Robinson, at 6-feet-1, 250 pounds, is in his second NFL year. He played in 12 games last season for Pittsburgh, then was traded to Philadelphia. The Broncos are his third team in nine days.\n\nHester\u2019s departure leaves the Broncos with four running backs: Ronnie Hillman, Knowshon Moreno and rookies Montee Ball and C.J. Anderson. And Robinson\u2019s addition increases the linebackers to seven, including Nate Irving, Steven Johnson, Paris Lenon, Shawn Phillips, Danny Trevathan and Wesley Woodyard (Von Miller will be on the suspension list for the first six games).\n\nIn other news, the Broncos signed seven players to their practice squad, including six that were cut from the team Saturday.\n\nWide receiver Tavarres King and offensive lineman Vinston Painter, who were drafted in the fifth and sixth rounds this year, respectively, cleared waivers, along with offensive linemen Paul Cornick and Ben Garland, wide receiver Gerell Robinson and defensive end John Youboty.\n\n\u201cWe thought enough of them, obviously, to draft them and fortunately for us they cleared waivers and we got them back,\u201d Broncos coach John Fox said.\n\nThe newcomer is running back Edwin Baker, a second-year player who was on San Diego\u2019s practice squad (first 15 weeks) and active roster (final two weeks) in 2012.\n\nCornerback Champ Bailey, meanwhile, lightly participated in positional drills without the boot that supported his injured ankle. Bailey did not don any pads but looked healthy.\n\nFox declined to say much about Bailey. \u201cNo injury updates, as per league (rules), we do not announce those today,\u201d he said. \u201c(Bailey) was at practice . . . It was good to have him out there.\u201d\n\nQuarterback Peyton Manning expects the home crowd to have a big affect on Thursday\u2019s game against the Ravens.\n\n\u201cI think the crowd will play a big role. Glad to be at home, it\u2019s an exciting opportunity starting out the NFL season when everybody is watching you,\u201d Manning said. \u201cI want them as loud sa possible can when Broncos are on defense and as quiet as they can be when the Broncos are on offense \u2026 Having played here as an opponent a number of times, it\u2019s an extremely tough place to play.\u201d\n\nManning said he will undoubtedly have butterflies before his 16th NFL opening day.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t, you probably should be doing something else,\u201d he said.\n\nMike Chambers: , mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mchambersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos cut Jacob Hester, add Adrian Robinson from NFL waivers", "title": "Broncos cut Jacob Hester, add Adrian Robinson from NFL waivers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/01/broncos-cut-jacob-hester-add-adrian-robinson-from-nfl-waivers/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130901__jacob-hester-broncosp1.jpg", "height": 453}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130901__jacob-hester-broncosp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-01T12:07:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:06:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd91ec\"", "article_summary": "Minus fullback Jacob Hester, the Broncos on Sunday began preparing for Thursday\u2019s NFL opener against the defending Super Bowl champions at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\nIn other news, the Broncos signed seven players to their practice squad, including six that were cut from the team Saturday.\nIn his place, the Broncos added linebacker Adrian Robinson off the NFL waiver wire.\nHester will not play against the Baltimore Ravens after being waived a day after the team cut down to its 53-man roster.\nThe newcomer is running back Edwin Baker, a second-year player who was on San Diego\u2019s practice squad (first 15 weeks) and active roster (final two weeks) in 2012."}
