Investigators say a man was hacked to death with what appeared to be a machete during a home invasion near South Carolina.

North Charleston deputies said three men forced their way into the victim's home around 4 a.m. Saturday and started stabbing and hacking him. The attacked continued outside, where the victim's body was found.

The three men ran away, and authorities have not found them. They did not say if anything was taken from the home.

Deputies say a relative of the victim and a baby were also at the home, but were not harmed.

The name of the victim has not been released.
