The unwelcome surprise is for procedures they think are covered by insurance but are not, ranging from a few hundred dollars for an emergency room visit to tens of thousands of dollars for an operation.\n\nReporter Haley Sweetland Edwards wrote the story \u201cYou Only Think You\u2019re Covered\u201d for this week\u2019s issue of \u201cTime Magazine\u201d and she joins me now from Miami to discuss it.\n\nSo, what is the trap that people are getting caught into? You basically break it down to this in-network versus out-of-network chasm.\n\nHALEY SWEETLAND EDWARDS, TIME MAGAZINE REPORTER: Right. So, people will go to an in-network hospital, see an in-network provider, and over the course of that medical visit, interact with other medical providers who are out of network. So, an in-network hospital will contract with out-of-network providers \u2014 radiologists, anesthesiologists, lab technicians. All of those people, even though they\u2019re working at an in-network hospital, can be out of network and often are.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: There\u2019s no way for a consumer to know when you walk in who is in network. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re wearing different colored uniforms?\n\nHALEY SWEETLAND EDWARDS: Right, right. And even when patients ask ahead of time, they say, you know, \u201cI\u2019m going in for this procedure, is my doctor in network, is my anesthesiologist in network?\u201d They don\u2019t know to ask other questions like, is the consulting surgeon on duty that day who may or may not be in the operating theater, is he also in network?\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Now, the Affordable Care Act is supposed to make it, that as you say in the story, if I break my arm and I go the ER, I\u2019m supposed to basically get in-network rates. But that\u2019s not the whole story.\n\nHALEY SWEETLAND EDWARDS: That\u2019s not the whole story. Obamacare does takes us a step in the right direction where they say, you know, if you break your arm and are whisked off to the hospital, the other end of that ambulance ride, no matter where you show up, they have to charge \u2014 your insurance company has to charge you as if that facility is in network, which is great. It\u2019s better than it was before.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t protect you from everyone else working at that facility, whether or not they\u2019re in network. So, you can still get hit later with these surprise bills from the providers themselves, from the drug makers, from the device makers.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, you just rattled off different interests all trying to figure out who gets the bill. So what are states doing to try to fix this or if there\u2019s any federal legislation? What\u2019s happening?\n\nHALEY SWEETLAND EDWARDS: It\u2019s been halting. There are about 10 states that have passed different legislation, attempting to address this problem. California and Florida have transparency measures in place, that patients theoretically are suppose to be told ahead of time whether there will be an out-of-network provider. They are also supposed to protect patients in emergency situations. But it\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s really stop-and-go.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Reporter Haley Sweetland Edwards joining us from Miami from \u201cTime Magazine\u201d \u2014 thanks so much.\n\nHALEY SWEETLAND EDWARDS: Thanks so much for having me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One in three American adults who have private health insurance coverage are hit with surprise medical bills they thought were covered by insurance, which can range from a few hundreds dollars to tens of thousands for an operation.
