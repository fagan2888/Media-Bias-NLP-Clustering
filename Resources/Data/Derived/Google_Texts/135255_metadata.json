Plans also call for the house to be sold as Home Hospice focuses entirely outpatient care at homes, nursing homes and hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe loss is not just for the patients,\u201d Carter said. \u201cIt\u2019s a loss for the families.\u201d\n\nHospice House provided specialized end-of-life in-patient care. Often the goal was improving patients\u2019 condition enough to move them to their homes but Hospice House also worked to comfort people who would die there.\n\nStaff reeled, including the Rev. Jimmy Braswell, a chaplain at Hospice House, who said he was \u201cshocked.\u201d Families of loved ones cared for at the facility also grieved.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just going to be such a loss to our community,\u201d said Merry Worley, whose parents John and Mary Imagene Worley both died at Hospice House and who was finishing up her volunteer application as news came that the facility would shutter. \u201cIf you have your loved one in your home, and he\u2019s in the active dying stage, you are pretty much alone. You can call them and they will come, but it\u2019s not like they have a shift that\u2019s going on all the time, so all you have to do is walk down the hall. There\u2019s a sense of peace there.\u201d\n\nHome Hospice is a for-profit company that staffs and operates Hospice House. But the home itself is owned by the Hospice House Foundation, which raises money to pay for costs of maintaining the home, such as electric bills.\n\nHospice House is separate from the nonprofit foundation, which cannot cover the for-profit company\u2019s operating expenses such as paying employees. Even still, Carter said a large donation would not solve the problem.\n\nIn recent years, Home Hospice absorbed about $200,000 a year in losses from operating the Hospice House and projected those losses to triple this year.\n\nHospice House also accepted patients who could not pay, and Carter said the company lost about $1 million operating Hospice House, which essentially gave away millions more in care.\n\nThe reason, Carter said, is fewer patients and Medicare reimbursements.\n\n\u201cIt is not a financial problem, it is really truly regulations, because the rules are preventing access for in-patient care,\u201d Carter said, adding that continuing to operate Hospice House would threaten the company\u2019s other home-care hospice services.\n\nHospice House patients will likely get hospice care at their homes, nursing homes and hospitals, Home Hospice officials said. Carter said Home Hospice might need to adapt its at-home treatments. And none of the home-care offices will close in Odessa, Midland, Andrews and Big Spring.\n\n\u201cThe majority of hospice care can be done in home environments,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThe difference is when there are those who need medical intervention. We no longer have the Hospice House as a place we can take them.\u201d\n\nIn order to comply with Medicare reimbursements, at least 80 percent of the company\u2019s patients already received care at home. And Hospice House, with more expensive round-the-clock care, had been operating at a loss for years.\n\nIn a statement, founder and owner Hilton Chancellor said they accepted that loss because \u201cmedically and spiritually we knew it would be a winner for patients and families in our community.\u201d Since 2000, Hospice House served about 6,000 West Texans and their families.\n\nTo meet expenses, an average of five of the facility\u2019s nine beds must be filled daily. Last year the average was closer to two patients daily.\n\n\u201cThe Medicare benefit is really the bread and butter of a hospice house,\u201d said Braswell, who will keep his job, performing out-patient services. \u201cWhat insurance pays and donations are really a small part of it \u2013 they are needed \u2013 but a small part of it.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s initial statement that they would close Hospice House because of \u201cstricter government healthcare rules\u201d left many decrying the Affordable Care Act as to blame on social media. Company officials on Thursday sought to correct that impression.\n\n\u201cThis is not what some call \u2018Obamacare\u2019 causing us to close the Hospice House,\u201d Chancellor said in a Thursday statement. \u201cThese are Medicare rules being implemented under the Obama administration that have restricted access to care and caused many impatient facilities to close around the county.\u201d\n\nCompany representatives explained four general categories of ways someone could be admitted to in-patient care at the Hospice House:\n\nFirst, if there was a need for medical intervention to treat a malady overwhelming the ability of the at-home care in place \u2014 for example, an Alzheimer\u2019s patient who suffered a stroke. A patient would be stabilized at home. Second, if someone needed care in the last stages of their life. Third, if a family needed \u201crespite care\u201d for a loved one for a short-period of time while they tended to an emergency like a death in the family. And finally, if the patients were children.\n\nBut federal government\u2019s interpretation of the requirements a patient must meet in order for Medicare to reimburse hospice care narrowed as part of an effort to reduce Medicare spending, according to Home Hospice representatives. They described that as a decade-long trend intensifying in recent years.\n\nBraswell said that in recent years, Hospice House suffered limitations in people who qualified for \u201crespite care\u201d and that people could no longer choose to die there unless they suffered an additional, treatable medical problem.\n\nWorley said she was unsure whether her father would have qualified had he died now instead of 2010. She said she knew of Hospice House through friends who took their loved ones there, and she first took her mother, who suffered a massive stroke in 2006 and died within 24-hours.\n\n\u201cIt was such a warm place for such a hard time,\u201d Worley said.\n\nWorley\u2019s father\u2019s death was not as sudden, she said, and she took him three separate times, beginning in 2008. He suffered maladies that included serious heart disease and the Hospice House helped her handle downturns such as dementia, which prompted one of his stays.\n\n\u201cThey make the patient as comfortable and as possible and make the family also as comfortable as possible and provide you with information that helps you understand what\u2019s happening to the person there and help you deal with your feelings about that,\u201d Worley said, describing the home she described as beautiful.\n\nThe foundation owns the Hospice House property, which is the former Mellie Van Horn boarding house and later a bed and breakfast.\n\nCarter said she did not know how much the home was worth including assets. But the appraised value of the property, at 903 N. Sam Houston Ave, is $435,799, according to the Ector County Appraisal District. The home was built in 1938. Carter said the money would go to the foundation if the home is sold as planned.\n\nThe foundation will also have to find a new focus, Carter said.\n\nJohn O\u2019Hearn, the executive director of planning and development for Medical Center Hospital, where doctors refer patients to Hospice House, called it a sad day. His grandmother died at Hospice House in 2008, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we could facilitate those short term transfers and put [patients] in a comfortable environment,\u201d O\u2019Hearn said, because of the hospital\u2019s proximity of the house. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have that anymore.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Odessa American", "description": "Home Hospice of West Texas will close Hospice House in Odessa, the only in-patient hospice serving the region, in response to a decline in patients that company representatives Thursday attributed to increasingly stringent Medicare reimbursement rules.", "title": "Hospice House closes", "url": "http://www.oaoa.com/news/article_61e932ce-b08c-11e3-9765-0017a43b2370.html", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/oaoa.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/9e/79ea0ae6-b06a-11e3-a9fa-001a4bcf6878/532b49300396b.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C353", "height": 353}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OdessaAmerican", "card": "summary", "creator": "@OAcrude"}, "description": "Home Hospice of West Texas will close Hospice House in Odessa, the only in-patient hospice serving the region, in response to a decline in patients that company representatives Thursday attributed to increasingly stringent Medicare reimbursement rules.", "fb": {"app_id": 262976343803266}, "keywords": "hospice house,braswell,home hospice,shutter,health,news,business,government,local", "google-site-verification": "C7e6nzDhqJTTTeUDX9X1Id7MX9Idah2bzp4dl3PyUdQ", "news_keywords": "hospice house,braswell,home hospice,shutter,health,news,business,government,local"}, "article_summary": "Hospice House patients will likely get hospice care at their homes, nursing homes and hospitals, Home Hospice officials said.\nThere\u2019s a sense of peace there.\u201dHome Hospice is a for-profit company that staffs and operates Hospice House.\nJimmy Braswell, a chaplain at Hospice House, who said he was \u201cshocked.\u201d Families of loved ones cared for at the facility also grieved.\n\u201cThis is not what some call \u2018Obamacare\u2019 causing us to close the Hospice House,\u201d Chancellor said in a Thursday statement.\nBut the home itself is owned by the Hospice House Foundation, which raises money to pay for costs of maintaining the home, such as electric bills."}
