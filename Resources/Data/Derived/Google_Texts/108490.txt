The man accused of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 7-year-old girl made his first court appearance in Love County.

Fount Duston, 34, had a black eye and other visible injuries as he entered the courtroom Friday morning.

No one could explain how the alleged child abuser received the new injuries.

And Duston only shook his head when asked questions by the media.

"I am very angry," said Gaylon Taylor, outraged by what Duston is accused of doing to his niece. "My feelings and emotions went from scared, helpless, to very angry," he said about being face-to-face with Duston.

Prosecutors alleged Duston kidnapped the child from a neighborhood near "H" and NW 10th Streets in Ardmore on Saturday.

They claim he took the child to his home in Marietta where he forced her to perform sex acts, gave her vodka and raped her.

Ardmore police located and rescued the victim on Sunday, following a statewide Amber Alert.

District Attorney Craig Ladd charged Duston with nine felonies in Love County, and one felony in Carter county, including two counts of kidnapping, rape, rape by instrumentation, three counts of lewd molestation, feloniously pointing a firearm, possession of a firearm, and furnishing an alcoholic beverage to a person under 21.

Ladd said more could be added to that list if investigators confirm Duston also had child pornography in his home.

"They are reviewing computers, and cameras, and things like that, and if that ends up being something that constitutes more offense we will file more charges," Ladd said.

Due to the nature of the charges, Associate District Judge Charles E. Roberts denied his bond. He is to remain in the Carter County Jail until trial.

His next court date in Love County is set for Feb. 4.
