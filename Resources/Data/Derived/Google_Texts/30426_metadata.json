So I come away feeling a little bit more encouraged, I would say, than when I arrived,\" he said.\n\nMorneau agreed that the \"tone and tenor\" from colleagues around the table was better than two months earlier at the Shanghai meeting.\n\nNoting the divergence in inflation risk between the United States and Canada, Poloz said the risk of an overshoot in inflation is \"pretty far away\" for Canada and that the U.S. economy is \"quite a bit ahead of us.\"\n\nWhile investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates later this year, Canada could hold official interest rates at 0.50 percent - near a historic low - into 2017.\n\nPoloz also dismissed the suggestion that a recent rise in the price of oil to about $40 a barrel from $30 a barrel previously was a bad thing for the Canadian economy because it could make exports less competitive by helping to push up the value of the Canadian dollar.\n\n\"A drop in oil prices is unambiguously negative for the Canadian economy, all things considered,\" Poloz said.\n\nHe also said that global central banks still have tools to ease monetary policy if needed.\n\n\"There is pretty general agreement amongst the central bankers that we all have ammo, as you put it, we have room to maneuver. I guess it is fair to say we've discovered we have more room to maneuver than we thought we had five years ago in the way of the financial crisis,\" Poloz said.\n\n(Reporting by Andrea Hopkins; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said on Friday he was mor", "title": "Bank of Canada's Poloz more optimistic about global economy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/15/Bank-Canadas-Poloz-more-optimistic-about-global-economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/canada-cenbank_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/15/Bank-Canadas-Poloz-more-optimistic-about-global-economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/canada-cenbank_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said on Friday he was mor", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"A drop in oil prices is unambiguously negative for the Canadian economy, all things considered,\" Poloz said.\nIn holding key overnight rates steady this week, the Bank of Canada said in its Monetary Policy Report that weaker global growth was one of the biggest downside risks to Canada's export-driven economy.\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said on Friday he was more encouraged about the state of the global economy after hearing from his G20 colleagues at the spring meeting of the group than he was heading into the discussions.\nNoting the divergence in inflation risk between the United States and Canada, Poloz said the risk of an overshoot in inflation is \"pretty far away\" for Canada and that the U.S. economy is \"quite a bit ahead of us.\"\nHe also said that global central banks still have tools to ease monetary policy if needed."}
