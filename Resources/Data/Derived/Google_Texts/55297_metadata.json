Then the Senate lumped the two bills together approving them in a 65-33 vote on Friday morning.\n\nThe tax extender bill, one portion of the package, made several tax cuts permanent, including a provision that would eliminate $113 billion in taxes on research and experimentation over 10 years.\n\nSeveral \"deal-breaker\" riders, including a provision to defund Planned Parenthood, were not included in the final package.\n\nThe bill is a win for Republicans because it ramped up military spending and nullified a 4-decade ban on exporting U.S. oil. But far-right conservatives who pledged a full repeal and not a delay of some Obamacare provisions, such as the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d and the medical device tax, may be disappointed.\n\nDemocrats also reaped important gains, winning concessions from Republicans in the form of tax cuts for low-income families and small businesses. Many center-leftists who were never thrilled with the tax on high-cost insurance plans will also view the Cadillac tax postponement as a victory.\n\n\"NIH really was the big winner here,\u201d said Loren Adler, research director at the Committee for a Responsible Budget.\n\nTwo things led to this giant payout for the agency: the sequester release deal, which gave Congress the flexibility to raise NIH\u2019s budget; and the broadly popular 21st Century Cures Act \u2014 a bill that aims to hasten the development of new medical therapies, which relies heavily on NIH investment.\n\nWith regard to the Affordable Care Act, G. William \u201cBill\u201d Hoagland, senior vice president for the Bipartisan Policy Center, said he was disappointed by the two-year delay to the Cadillac tax.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the design couldn\u2019t have worked, Hoagland said, \u201cIf we\u2019re really truly talking about controlling costs we have to have something like the Cadillac tax redesign going forward.\"\n\nBut such delays \u201ckick the can\u201d down the road until the next election.\n\nHoagland also worried that a provision of the package which bans the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) from helping to cover risk corridors \u2014 a policy Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) equated to a taxpayer \u201cbailout\u201d of insurance companies \u2014 could keep private insurers out of the marketplace.\n\nHoagland continued, \u201cAll it does is add more confusion and uncertainty to the healthcare marketplace in 2017.\"\n\nAdler noted that while the risk corridor provision deals a $2.5 billion blow to insurance companies, the delay to the insurer excise tax, which was 5 times as costly and affects largely the same players, will relieve some of the financial pain.\n\n\"They basically get a $12 billion windfall to make up for the fact that they just lost $2.5 billion,\" Adler said.\n\nGail Wilensky, PhD, a senior fellow at Project HOPE in Bethesda, Md., said in an email to MedPage Today that the bill landed somewhere \"between a compromise and a loss.\"\n\nWilensky, a former administrator at CMS, recognized a bill needed to be passed, and saw the boost to NIH as a plus.\n\nShe noted that the medical device and insurance excise taxes \u201cnever made policy sense\u201d but were intended to raise revenue. \u201cNow the revenue is gone for the two years.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d a \u201cclumsy version of a tax cap\u201d on how much of employers\u2019 contributions individuals can exclude from their taxable income, would also be postponed.\n\nAs one of only a handful of containment measures in the ACA, Wilensky said the Cadillac tax was \u201cbetter than nothing.\u201d Now, it\u2019s not certain it will ever be implemented. \u201cThat\u2019s a loss\u201d for ACA backers, she said.\n\nMarilyn Tavenner, president and CEO of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said in a press release, \u201cSuspension of the health insurance tax is an important step in providing relief to millions of seniors, employers, and families.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWe appreciate the bipartisan support for this effort and look forward to working with both parties to ensure quality, affordable coverage for consumers.\u201d Tavenner is also a former CMS administrator.\n\nThe American College of Radiology said, in a press release, that it was pleased to see protections for access to imaging for sick and injured Medicare beneficiaries. \u201cThis [Multiple Procedure Payment Reduction] rollback eases the impact on access to needed imaging care for auto accident and stroke victims, those with widespread cancer, and others who often require interpretations by different doctors to recover.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Shannon  Firth", "twitter": {"url":
