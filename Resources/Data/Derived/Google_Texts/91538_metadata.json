The car continued south, crossing railroad tracks and sliding across Phosphate Avenue.\n\nStill sideways, the car hit the southern curb on Phosphate Avenue, breaking off part of the curb, before continuing south across the lawn of Master Containers Inc., 209 Phosphate Blvd., the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nThe Volvo then struck a second set of railroad tracks and went airborne again, flying over Second Street S.W. and landing upright in a grass lot of a business at 307 S. Church Ave., the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nThe car continued south as it slid sideways, then spun again after its tires dug into the ground and went airborne a third time before striking a building, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nThe car went into the building and landed upside down, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. A tire and rim came off the car and struck another part of the wall, leaving a large hole. The hole in the building from the car was approximately 15 feet high and 25 feet wide.\n\nSimpson died at the scene.\n\nThe road was closed for about eight hours as crews from TECO cut power to the building and CSX stopped railroad traffic and inspected the tracks, the sheriff\u2019s office said.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 17 Nov 2013 14:05:21 -0400", "Description": "A Tampa man is dead after he lost control of his car early today, leading to a crash in which his car went airborne three times before striking a building in Mulberry, Polk deputies said.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "A Tampa man is dead after he lost control of his car early today, leading to a crash in which his car went airborne three times before striking a building in Mulberry, Polk deputies said.", "title": "Tampa man dies after crash, car goes airborne three times", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/tampa-man-dies-after-crash-car-goes-airborne-three-times-20131117/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131117/ARTICLE/131119317/EP/1/2/EP-131119317.jpg", "height": 340}, "updated_time": "2013-11-17T14:22:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "A Tampa man is dead after he lost control of his car early today, leading to a crash in which his car went airborne three times before striking a building in Mulberry, Polk deputies said.", "title": "Tampa man dies after crash, car goes airborne three times", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131117/ARTICLE/131119317/AR/0/AR-131119317.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-11-17T14:05:21Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-11-17T14:22:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A Tampa man is dead after he lost control of his car early today, leading to a crash in which his car went airborne three times before striking a building in Mulberry, Polk deputies said.\nand landing upright in a grass lot of a business at 307 S.
