Absolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cBut is our mental health system today better than it was two years ago? Absolutely yes.\u201d\n\nChoucair said that after half of the city\u2019s 12 clinics were closed in April 2012, every patient was offered services at the remaining clinics or at other health care facilities funded by the state and federal government. Through those facilities, and the federal Affordable Care Act, thousands more Chicago residents are receiving mental health care, he said.\n\nEmanuel, at an unrelated appearance before the hearing, said the city\u2019s approach \u201cexpanded coverage to more people, and more importantly than just more people, expanded also new benefits like psychiatric care that never existed because the old system did not loosen up the resources.\u201d\n\nN\u2019Dana Carter, a patient who for years has been the face of the Mental Health Movement coalition, said the city is ignoring people who fell through the cracks because of the closures and is undercounting the number of people treated at city clinics before half of them were closed.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the rising crime, when you see the people going to hospitals that didn\u2019t go very often, you look at Cook County Jail, these are all a result of choices that were made, decisions that were made without consideration of the people most affected,\u201d Carter said.\n\nIt took months for many patients to get treatment after the transition, Carter said, while others just weren\u2019t able to get to clinics that were farther from their homes, and many got reduced attention in the end. \u201cPeople that were not in and out of the mental wards now are,\u201d she said.\n\nCarter and other advocates note that city officials said more than 5,000 people were being treated at the clinics as the closures were contemplated in late 2011.\n\nThe city now says that there were 2,798 patients in the clinics at the time half were closed. Choucair told the Tribune that many of the patients on the original list were no longer \u201cactive,\u201d and that all of active patients either remained with the six surviving clinics or were referred to another provider.\n\nDr. Nneka Jones, who heads up mental health services at the Cook County Jail, has described the jail as the largest mental health facility in the state if not the country. She said the numbers of mentally ill detainees has grown about threefold to 2,800 in the past four years.\n\n\u201cMany of the crimes run the gamut, but we can say that about a third of them fall under the terms of what we call crimes of survival: retail theft, possession of drugs, prostitution,\u201d she said. Those folks would be better served at less cost in the mental health system rather than the criminal justice system, she said.\n\nAdvocates called for the city to reopen the closed clinics, accept Medicaid patients as well as the uninsured, and increase overall funding next year.\n\nChoucair said the city is considering serving Medicaid patients and plans to spend more money next year on mental health therapists who will respond to calls from street cops in three districts, an expansion of restorative justice programs in schools, and an increase in mental health care for children who are victims of sexual assault.\n\nTribune reporter Bill Ruthhart contributed.\n\nhdardick@tribune.com\n\nTwitter @ReporterHal\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Chicago mental health clinic closings spark opposing views", "Description": "Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s mental health care policies went on trial at City Hall Tuesday, with critics saying many patients ended up homeless, jailed or dead after the mayor closed half of the city\u2019s clinics, while city officials maintained that care for the mentally ill actually has been expanded.Those...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s mental health care policies went on trial at City Hall Tuesday, with critics saying many patients ended up homeless, jailed or dead after the mayor closed half of the city\u2019s clinics, while city officials maintained that care for the mentally ill actually has been expanded.", "title": "Chicago mental health clinic closings spark opposing views", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/chi-chicago-mental-health-clinic-closings-spark-opposing-views-20140819-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53f3f262/turbine/chi-chicago-mental-health-clinic-closings-spark-opposing-views-20140819", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp02.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/81127814", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-08-19", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc491\"", "article_summary": "Through those facilities, and the federal Affordable Care Act, thousands more Chicago residents are receiving mental health care, he said.\n\u201cDo we have a perfect mental health system in Chicago today?\nThose folks would be better served at less cost in the mental health system rather than the criminal justice system, she said.\n\u201cTwo years after starting our reforms, Chicago\u2019s mental health system today is stronger than it was.\nDr. Nneka Jones, who heads up mental health services at the Cook County Jail, has described the jail as the largest mental health facility in the state if not the country."}
