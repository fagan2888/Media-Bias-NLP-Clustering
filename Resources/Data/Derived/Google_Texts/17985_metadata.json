MercyCare is among the state\u0092s health care providers who agreed to take new patients through the Health and Wellness Plan, which debuted Jan. 1.\n\n\u0093Not everyone rushes to the doctor in January,\u0094 Archer said. \u0093But we will feel the clinical impact of that over the next 6 to 12 months.\u0094\n\nThe Iowa Health and Wellness Plan replaced IowaCare, the state\u0092s previous health care coverage program for low-income adults, when it expired Dec. 31. The new plan serves as a compromise between the governor\u0092s Health Iowa Plan and Medicaid expansion.\n\nIt serves Iowans aged 19 to 64 with income up to and including 133 percent of the federal poverty level by providing a \u0093comprehensive benefit package and provider network,\u0094 according to the Iowa Department of Human Services.\n\nIowaCare was a limited benefit program with a limited provider network \u0096 patients only had a handful of health care provider options, including the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City or the Broadlawns Medical Center in Des Moines. Under the new program, members are able to choose their primary care providers from a larger network spread across the state.\n\nSo far, the transition from IowaCare to the new health and wellness plan has gone \u0093very smoothly, especially in light of the delays many Americans have experienced at HealthCare.gov,\u0094 said Amy Lorentzen McCoy, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services.\n\nMore than 50,000 former IowaCare members automatically were enrolled in the new system, giving them access to more services and a choice in who provides their health care, including \u0096 in many cases \u0096 local options, McCoy said.\n\nIncluding those who have signed up since, the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan through mid-February boasted a total enrollment of 67,893 \u0096 55,034 in the wellness plan and 12,859 via the marketplace choice, according to McCoy.\n\nMembers can choose or are assigned providers, and they can make changes within a 90-day window.\n\nAlthough the transitional effort has been massive, McCoy said, the state has worked hard at keeping costs low. So far, she said, the total administrative cost of the transition and ongoing support sits at $1.5 million.\n\nUptick in patients\n\nThe transition\u0092s financial effect on local health care providers \u0096 both on the expense and revenue side \u0096 is evolving, according to industry experts.\n\nFor many local providers who were not part of the IowaCare network, the change means they\u0092re seeing new patients and getting coverage for those they used to treat in the emergency department without being reimbursed.\n\n\u0093When they needed acute medical services, we were providing that anyway through urgent care or the emergency room,\u0094 MercyCare medical director Archer said about Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids. \u0093So this makes more clinical sense that we would be able to take care of them longitudinally.\u0094\n\nIn preparation for the transition, Mercy polled its physicians about who would be willing to take new patients reallocated through the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan. Many agreed, including some willing to take as many as 200 additional patients, Archer said.\n\n\u0093Our physicians really stepped up and saw this as a community need,\u0094 Archer said. \u0093They were able to open their practices to meet patient needs.\u0094\n\nLocal providers, including those at Mercy, don\u0092t yet have exact numbers on how many new patients they are seeing and what that means for the bottom line.\n\nBut Shawn Steffan, director of revenue cycle for Mercy\u0092s hospital and physicians, said the change is \u0093definitely a positive.\u0094\n\n\u0093We took care of patients in the community through our emergent services,\u0094 she said. \u0093So, by allowing them to go receive their regular care here, that is a positive for both sides \u0096 the patient and the system.\u0094\n\nWith the new wider provider network, Cedar Rapids patients qualifying for the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan or Medicaid expansion have coverage options for care at Mercy or UnityPoint Health-St. Luke\u0092s Hospital.\n\nJeni White, director of revenue cycle for UnityPoint Health, said Cedar Rapids-area patients who were enrolled to local providers by the state seem to have been split between the two health care providers.\n\nIf patients wanted to go to one or the other \u0096 or to continue going to the UIHC in Iowa City \u0096 White said the hospitals have worked together to enable that to happen. White said UnityPoint has seen an uptick in patients since Jan. 1, although she indicated that it\u0092s too soon to know the patient-provider effect of the change.\n\n\u0093But the patients who were coming here and we were not getting paid for now will continue coming here, and now we will get reimbursed,\u0094 White said. \u0093That\u0092s a good thing. It\u0092s good for the community and for its providers.\u0094\n\nIt\u0092s been \u0091a lot of work\u0092\n\nThe UI Hospitals and Clinics, on the other hand, has seen a drop in patient assignments following the transition, said UIHC co-chief operating officer Scott Turner. The Iowa City-based provider has been assigned about 3,400 patients through the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan \u0096 down from the more than 9,000 assignments through IowaCare.\n\nUIHC officials have contacted those previously assigned to Iowa City through IowaCare to let them know they can continue to receive care at the hospitals and clinics. Turner said officials are working with patients receiving specialty care in Iowa City and \u0096 if they choose \u0096 helping them continue doing so through a referral process.\n\n\u0093If they want to continue receiving care here, we do that work for them,\u0094 Turner said.\n\nIn some cases, patients have developed a relationship with UIHC providers, and they want to continue seeing them. In other cases, patients would rather get care closer to home, said Tara Clark, assistant director of the UIHC\u0092s Department of Social Services.\n\n\u0093Our whole interest is making sure they have the primary care provider they want,\u0094 Clark said. \u0093Every patient situation is a bit different.\u0094\n\nRegardless of which option the patients choose, efforts to educate patients and help them through the transition has been \u0093a lot of work,\u0094 Turner said.\n\nUIHC staff members are contacting an average of 100 patients a day regarding the IowaCare transition, Turner said. They were making more than 200 contacts a day at one point. And then there are the enrollment fairs, including those at Coral Ridge Mall and the Iowa City Recreation Center.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s been a big institutional focus,\u0094 Turner said. \u0093We have been meeting every Monday for an hour since July planning and operationalizing all these different things.\u0094\n\nIt\u0092s too soon to tell what the financial effect for the UIHC will be \u0096 both in patient revenue and costs spent on education. March 31 is the deadline to choose a provider, and Turner said the hospital will know more then.\n\n\u0093The lion\u0092s share of the work will happen between now and the end of March,\u0094 he said.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | Tens of thousands of low-income Iowans are enrolled in Iowa\u0092s new comprehensive health benefit program, and state officials said it\u0092s serving as a national mode", "og": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/2014/03/01/eastern-iowa-weighing-the-effect-of-iowacares-end", "site_name": "The Gazette", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20140301/NEWS/303019967/AR/0/AR-303019967.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Tens of thousands of low-income Iowans are enrolled in Iowa\u0092s new comprehensive health benefit program, and state officials said it\u0092s serving as a national model for compliance with the Affordable Care Act."}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/2014/03/01/eastern-iowa-weighing-the-effect-of-iowacares-end", "description": "Tens of thousands of low-income Iowans are enrolled in Iowa\u0092s new comprehensive health benefit program, and state officials said it\u0092s serving as a national model for compliance with the Affordable Care Act.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Eastern Iowa weighing the effect of IowaCare's end"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2014-04-01T09:02:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_", "pubDate": "2014-03-01T03:30:00-05:00", "title": "Eastern Iowa weighing the effect of IowaCare's end"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The new plan serves as a compromise between the governor\u0092s Health Iowa Plan and Medicaid expansion.\nUptick in patientsThe transition\u0092s financial effect on local health care providers \u0096 both on the expense and revenue side \u0096 is evolving, according to industry experts.\nUnder the new program, members are able to choose their primary care providers from a larger network spread across the state.\nThe Iowa City-based provider has been assigned about 3,400 patients through the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan \u0096 down from the more than 9,000 assignments through IowaCare.\nBut when analyzing the direct effect of Iowa\u0092s new Health and Wellness Plan on local patients and health care providers, industry experts said it\u0092s too soon to tell."}
