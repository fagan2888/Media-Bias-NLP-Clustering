Forget the polls. Forget the talking heads on TV. Forget the lies and empty promises being pitched by the candidates. If you want to know who the Republican presidential nominee will be, look to Vegas.

South Point oddsmaker Jimmy Vaccaro has released odds on who will win the GOP nomination, and he hasn't lasted 40 years in this town by being wrong.

Although billionaire magalomaniac Donald Trump has dominated the airwaves, the conversation and even the polls to this point, there are still 5 candidates more likely to be nominated than the Donald.

Jeb Bush opened as the 2/1 favorite in Vaccaro's view and he remains the top choice after Thursday night's debate. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker had a rough night Thursday, but was still good enough to hold on to the second slot, at 5/1 odds. Ditto for John Kasich and Mike Huckabee, staying strong at Nos. 3 and 4, with 10/1 and 12/1 odds, respectively.

Then we have the apparent "winner" of Thursday's debate, Marco Rubio. Rubio was bunched up with Trump and New Jersey governor Chris Christie when the opening lines were released, but he looked relatable and prepared Thursday night, allowing him to leapfrong the two blowhards. Rubio sits at 12/1 in Vaccaro's latest odds, while Trump and Christie are nipping at his heels at 15/1.

The rest are probably also-rans, but keep an eye on Carly Fiorina, who jumped from 100/1 to 50/1 in Vaccaro's view, after a commanding performance in the jayvee debate. She probably won't get the nom, but could be a major influence as the process moves forward.

See below for all candidates' odds to win the Republican presidential nomination. And remember, this is for entertainment purposes only.
