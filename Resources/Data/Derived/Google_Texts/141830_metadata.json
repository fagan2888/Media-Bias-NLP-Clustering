The establishment answer, of course, is eight times as much \u2014 and more.\n\nCurrently, Iowa requires schools to administer the Iowa Assessments every year. Because those tests are developed by the University of Iowa, we get them at cost: about $4.25 per student.\n\nBut in 2013, the state created a task force to determine whether to require a different set of assessments as of 2016-17. The task force considered two possibilities: the Next Generation Iowa Assessments and the Smarter Balanced Assessments. The former would cost $15 per student. The latter cost significantly more and would need to be supplemented with a separate science test, for a likely total cost between $30 and $40 per student. Those tests would also require unknown millions to buy and maintain the necessary technology; the task force \u2014 incredibly \u2014 didn't even try to estimate the cost.\n\nThe tests we've used for years are now inadequate, we're told. We need tests that incorporate \"constructed responses\" that require human graders, or tests that the students will take on computers, with technology that can adjust the difficulty of the questions to the student's responses. We need to make the kids sit through twice as many hours of testing as they do now.\n\nThe task force recommended the most expensive tests (though not unanimously). If you suspect there are diminishing returns from all this expensive additional testing, you're a Luddite.\n\nWhat will get cut to pay for these tests? No one will say. Don't believe for a minute that the state will fund these new tests at no sacrifice to other educational funding. Every dollar the state spends on testing will be one less dollar available for general school funding \u2014 at a time when many districts are already making severe budget cuts. No matter how it's spun, the school districts are about to get hit with an enormous unfunded mandate.\n\nStandardized testing is now the Defense Department of the school budget: Only the most deluxe, big-ticket, exorbitant program will do. Never say no, regardless of what has to be sacrificed. The testing companies get richer; your kids' education gets poorer.\n\nThe only thing standing between us and this enormous increase in spending on standardized testing is our Legislature. If your school district has to make class sizes larger, cut band and orchestra, eliminate foreign language classes, or worse \u2014 all so we can have the shiniest new standardized tests \u2014 you'll know who's responsible: state legislators who decided that no price was too high.\n\nCHRIS LIEBIG of Iowa City has three kids in Iowa public schools and blogs about education issues at ablogaboutschool.blogspot.com, where he has posted an extended version of this essay.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1IzX4xr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Is no price too high for standardized tests in Iowa?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Is no price too high for standardized tests in Iowa?", "title": "Is no price too high for standardized tests in Iowa?", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/01/10/chris-liebig-standardized-testing/21546143/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Is no price too high for standardized tests in Iowa?", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0a05bbcab7e71527b909776193cbba323f2ecb10/c=0-598-2403-3001&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/10/B9315816126Z.1_20150110020356_000_G379KPT8V.1-0.jpg", "title": "Is no price too high for standardized tests in Iowa?", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/University of Iowa", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/University of Iowa", "title": "Is no price too high for standardized tests in Iowa?", "author": "Chris Liebig", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4c05b3e984a7a6dc6b04d3fcdb380e6d8144fdb3/c=0-198-2403-3402/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/10/B9315816126Z.1_20150110020356_000_G379KPT8V.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5d729fb2c5cee72a77a4083e189c6eefb5f70cb2/c=0-598-2403-3001/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/10/B9315816126Z.1_20150110020356_000_G379KPT8V.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee8beabd50bb8a92743b42c6788194e5039adc0c/c=0-649-2391-2447/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/10/B9315816126Z.1_20150110020356_000_G379KPT8V.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cd65d6a828fe68064c4a738433f2362b8602ae47/c=0-735-2391-2086&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/10/B9315816126Z.1_20150110020356_000_G379KPT8V.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-10T01:30:47.427000-06:00", "shorthed": "Price for standardized tests in Iowa?", "articleid": 21546143, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/00ceb86cda040dfe8482a0ec6fbf15d41232efa5/c=0-735-2391-2086/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/10/B9315816126Z.1_20150110020356_000_G379KPT8V.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ecc20b1c3a1829158d8054b43619cc3c6fa6c27f/c=189-0-2214-3600/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/10/B9315816126Z.1_20150110020356_000_G379KPT8V.1-0.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf95e\"", "article_summary": "Currently, Iowa requires schools to administer the Iowa Assessments every year.\nThe task force considered two possibilities: the Next Generation Iowa Assessments and the Smarter Balanced Assessments.\nBecause those tests are developed by the University of Iowa, we get them at cost: about $4.25 per student.\nThe task force recommended the most expensive tests (though not unanimously).\nThose tests would also require unknown millions to buy and maintain the necessary technology; the task force \u2014 incredibly \u2014 didn't even try to estimate the cost."}
