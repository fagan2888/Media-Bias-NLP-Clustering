GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) - Some running races wrap up with beer after the finish. A race in western Michigan is offering brew at aid stations along the course.

The “HopCat Full Circle 5k” is May 29, starting and ending at the HopCat brew pub in Grand Rapids.

New Holland Brewing, which makes “Full Circle” beer, is among those involved in the event. Organizers say a drink will be available at every mile.

Libby Swore, who co-owns Trivium Racing with her husband, Richard, tells The Grand Rapids Press (http://bit.ly/1WHENZK ) they have been talking about doing an event with HopCat for several years. She says it finally came together and it’s “a combination of a race and a bar crawl.”

Runners get a T-shirt, a finisher’s beer glass and access to a party afterward.
