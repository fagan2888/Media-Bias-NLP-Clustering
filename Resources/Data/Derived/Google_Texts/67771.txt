Rev. Al Sharpton is coming to Hartford on Saturday to join pastors and the community in a rally for peace in response to a surge of violence in Hartford in recent weeks.

There have been 12 homicides this year so far in Hartford and there have been several gatherings to end the violence and pay respect to the victims.

Concerned Pastors of Greater Hartford is hosting the Stop the Violence and Cease the Killing March and Action Rally. Sharpton and the National Action Network are partners in the event.
