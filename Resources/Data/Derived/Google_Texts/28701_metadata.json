Angus King, an Independent from Maine, says he won\u2019t support the House bill to defund President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration. Associated Press\n\nLate last year, Republicans decided to fund the Homeland Security department only through February in hopes of using the agency\u2019s funding as a lever to force change on immigration once the GOP controlled both houses of Congress. But the bill will need 60 votes to clear the Senate, meaning at least six Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents would have to vote yes.\n\nThat looks to be nearly impossible. A survey of several Democratic senators who have been critical of the executive action found most saying they would not support the effort.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for a political fight. I\u2019m looking to solve a problem,\u201d Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.) said in a statement. An aide said the senator is likely to oppose any Homeland Security spending bill that blocks the executive action.\n\nSen. Angus King (I., Maine), is also opposed, said his spokeswoman, Kathleen Connery Dawe. \u201cSen. King does not support the House bill to defund the president\u2019s executive action on immigration,\u201d she said. \u201cWithholding funds from the Department of Homeland Security would be particularly dangerous at a time of worldwide terrorist threats.\u201d An aide to Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.) said she believes \u201cthe only responsible way for Republicans to supersede this executive order is to finally consider, debate and vote on comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n\nAn aide said Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) would likely vote against the House bill, and a spokesman for Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.), who voiced concerns about executive action this fall, said she opposes defunding Mr. Obama\u2019s November action.\n\nAn aide to Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.) said the senator is opposed to using the Homeland Security budget to roll back the executive order. Mr. Tester said in a statement: \u201cIf the House had passed the comprehensive, bipartisan immigration bill that the Senate passed a year and a half ago, we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation right now. I wish the president wouldn\u2019t have gone out on his own, but threatening the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s budget doesn\u2019t solve the immigration crisis or strengthen our borders.\u201d\n\nNone of the Senate Democratic offices interviewed indicated they would support the move, but one, Sen. Joe Donnelly (D., Ind.), was noncommittal. \u201cSenator Donnelly will take a look at any immigration-related proposals as they come forward,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nOf course, even if the measure passed both houses, the plan was certain to draw a presidential veto, and neither house has the votes needed to override that.\n\nThe package taking shape in the House was an expansive pushback on Mr. Obama. It would kill his plan, announced in November, to temporarily shield millions of people from deportation, primarily parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the U.S. for at least five years. It would also kill a 2012 program that offered similar shelter to people brought to the U.S. illegally as children\u2014a sharp turnout from two years ago, when leading House Republicans were discussing a GOP version of the Dream Act, which offers a permanent legal status for this group.\n\nIn addition, the plan would roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s directive to prioritize deportation of recent border crossers and those with serious criminal records\u2014a policy that gives a measure of security to illegal immigrants who do not meet those criteria. It was also expected to revive the Secure Communities program, which uses local law enforcement to hold illegal immigrants who they encounter. In November, Mr. Obama ratcheted that program back.\n\nIn the House, Republicans said the prospect that the bill would falter in the Senate should not preclude them from trying to pass their favored approach now.\n\nDuring a private meeting of House Republicans on Friday morning, \u201cthere was a lot of discussion about not worrying so much these days about the Senate,\u201d said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R., S.C.).\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s quit trying to second guess what the Senate\u2019s going to do and let\u2019s do our job and then work it out from there,\u201d said Rep. Matt Salmon (R., Ariz.).", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Many Democratic senators who have criticized Obama's executive action on immigration said they wouldn't support the effort to defund Homeland Security in order to roll back the immigration changes.", "title": "Bill to Defund Homeland Security Unlikely to Pass Senate", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/01/10/bill-to-defund-homeland-security-unlikely-to-pass-senate/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GJ362_angusk_P_20150110120652.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Bill to Defund Homeland Security Unlikely to Pass Senate", "description": "Many Democratic senators who have criticized Obama's executive action on immigration said they wouldn't support the effort to defund Homeland Security in order to roll back the immigration changes.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Laura Meckler and Kristina Peterson", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Many Democratic senators who have criticized Obama's executive action on immigration said they wouldn't support the effort to defund Homeland Security in order to roll back the immigration changes.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-01-10T17:11:53-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/01/10/bill-to-defund-homeland-security-unlikely-to-pass-senate/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-52061", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Many Democratic senators who have criticized Obama's executive action on immigration said they wouldn't support the effort to defund Homeland Security in order to roll back the immigration changes.", "title": "Bill to Defund Homeland Security Unlikely to Pass Senate", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/01/10/bill-to-defund-homeland-security-unlikely-to-pass-senate/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GJ362_angusk_P_20150110120652.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-52061", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-01-10T17:14:58-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb5f2\"", "article_summary": "An aide said the senator is likely to oppose any Homeland Security spending bill that blocks the executive action.\nKing does not support the House bill to defund the president\u2019s executive action on immigration,\u201d she said.\nIn the House, Republicans said the prospect that the bill would falter in the Senate should not preclude them from trying to pass their favored approach now.\nSen.
