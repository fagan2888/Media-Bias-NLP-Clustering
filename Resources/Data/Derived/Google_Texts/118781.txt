Ardian Backs Cathay In French Pharma Deal

Cenexi, previously part of the Roche Group, has acquired production sites in France and Belgium

Cathay Capital Private Equity recently invested in French pharmaceutical development and manufacturer Cenexi Group. Terms were not disclosed.

Paris-based Cenexi, previously a subsidiary of the Roche Group, has one of the largest production sites for sterile ampoules in Europe. It became an independent company in 2008 and, since then, acquired production sites in France and Belgium.

Altogether, Cenexi operates three manufacturing facilities where it makes a variety of pharmaceutical products, including injectable sterile ampoules, injectables for cytotoxic oncology drugs and anti-allergenic indications.

Paris-based private equity firm Ardian arranged a unitranche financing facility to back Cathay on the transaction.

Previously known as Axa Private Equity, the firm was founded in 1996 by Dominique Senequier. Recently, it expanded its footprint in North America with the acquisition of Boonton, New Jersey-based General Calibration Inc.
