The drug costs an average of $5 for a 30-day supply.Montelukast, which is indicated to treat chronic asthma, decreased 19.9% in price during 2015. The drug costs an average of $18 for a 30-day supply.Duloxetine, which is indicated as a treatment for major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, saw a 10.4% price decrease last year. The drug costs an average of $38 for a 30-day supply.Atorvastatin, which is indicated to treat high cholesterol, decreased in price by 8.2% during 2015. The drug costs an average of $13 for a 30-day supply.Losartan, which is indicated to treat high blood pressure and reduce the risk of stroke, decreased in price by 4.8% during 2015. The drug costs an average of $9 for a 30-day supply.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "health-system,drugs,decrease,price,technician-news,", "og": {"type": "Article", "image": "http://pharmacytimes.s3.amazonaws.com/v1_media/_upload_image/_thumbnails/DrugsPills300x130.jpg", "site_name": "Pharmacy Times", "description": "Not every drug saw a price increase in 2015, despite widespread media coverage suggesting otherwise.", "title": "5 Drugs That Actually Decreased in Price Last Year"}, "description": "Not every drug saw a price increase in 2015, despite widespread media coverage suggesting otherwise."}, "article_summary": "The drug costs an average of $5 for a 30-day supply.Montelukast, which is indicated to treat chronic asthma, decreased 19.9% in price during 2015.\nThe drug costs an average of $38 for a 30-day supply.Atorvastatin, which is indicated to treat high cholesterol, decreased in price by 8.2% during 2015.\nThe drug costs an average of $13 for a 30-day supply.Losartan, which is indicated to treat high blood pressure and reduce the risk of stroke, decreased in price by 4.8% during 2015.\nThe drug costs an average of $9 for a 30-day supply.\nThe drug costs an average of $18 for a 30-day supply.Duloxetine, which is indicated as a treatment for major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, saw a 10.4% price decrease last year."}
