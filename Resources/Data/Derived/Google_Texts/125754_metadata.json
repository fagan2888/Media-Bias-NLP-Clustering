The association\u2019s survey team called a random sample of 525 psychiatrists and managed to reach 321 by telephone \u2013 most of them after multiple attempts. One-third of the listings contained inaccurate information.\n\nAccording to the survey:\n\n\u2022 51 percent said they were accepting new patients;\n\n\u2022 16 percent said there were not accepting any new patients;\n\n\u2022 13 percent said they were only accepting patients in their hospitals;\n\n\u2022 12 percent said they were only accepting Medicaid patients at public clinics;\n\n\u2022 8 percent were not psychiatrists.\n\nOf the 126 psychiatrists who answered the question about when they were accepting new patients, the survey found:\n\n\u2022 25 percent said the wait time for an appointment with a new patient is one to two weeks;\n\n\u2022 25 percent said the wait-time was two to four weeks;\n\n\u2022 25 percent said one to two months;\n\n\u2022 25 percent said longer than two months.\n\nBeachamp called the results \u201cappalling.\u201d\n\n\"There are 1,500 psychiatrists in New Jersey and at the end of the day there were only 172 who were in-network, accepting new patients and able to see them within a two-week period,\" Beauchamp said.\n\nPeople who are ready to see a psychiatrist are likely in the midst of a crisis, so a prolonged wait is more than just a discouragement, said Linda Gochfeld, a psychiatrist and member of the association\u2019s Public Policy Committee who collaborated on the study.\n\n\u201cPeople with severe emotional problems, depression or anxiety, struggle against the hopelessness and stigma to seek help,\u201d Gochfeld said. \u201cIt's not easy to make that phone call. If they don't get a positive response after a few tries they are likely to give up and may continue a downward spiral into hospitalization, disability or even suicide.\u201d\n\nThe association performed the survey last year and has since shared the findings with state officials and managed care companies to look for solutions. Managed care companies have been verifying and updating their listings of in-network psychiatrists at the association\u2019s request, Beauchamp said.\n\nThe association also wants the insurance companies to explain that out-of-network psychiatrists may be used if the consumer can show there is no one in network willing to take them on, Beauchamp said. State regulations require HMOs to offer specialists within 45 miles or one-hour driving time, of 90 percent of the plan\u2019s members, according to the survey\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cAccess to behavioral health care is necessary and important,\u201d said Ward Sanders, president of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans, a trade group for the managed care companies. \u201cFindings of inaccuracies concern the health plans and they have undertaken efforts to contact behavioral health providers and correct outdated information.\u201d\n\nDebra E Koss, a trustee for the New Jersey Psychiatric Association, blamed insurance companies for making it difficult for people to obtain treatment.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that the insurance companies - intentionally or inadvertently - have created barriers for patients seeking care. It is the insurance companies that are impeding access to care and wedging themselves between physicians and patients,\" Koss said.\n\n\u201cPatients throughout the state of New Jersey should not be misled into believing there are an insufficient number of psychiatrists for adults in our state,\" she added. \"The NJPA is committed to working with the Mental Health Association to strengthen the physician/patient relationship, as well as the insurance companies to encourage patient access to care.\"\n\nThe association encourages people to call 800-345-0143 if they are having difficulty finding a psychiatrist, she said.\n\nMental and behavioral health care is one of the essential benefits all insurance plans must offer if they sell coverage on the health exchange.\n\nSusan K.
