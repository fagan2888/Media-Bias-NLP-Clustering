Antitrust lawsuits are never friendly, but the animosity between some key players in this battle of tech giants is extraordinary \u2014 and for good reason.\n\nYou may remember that Amazon helped persuade the U.S. Department of Justice to sue Apple in April 2012, claiming that Apple conspired with five of the nation\u2019s largest publishers to fix the price of e-books at a level different than what Amazon had set. Amazon, the web\u2019s biggest retailer, had been selling published books at a money-losing rate of $9.99. Why? To get us to buy its Kindle e-book reader, and to dominate the e-book market. Amazon\u2019s strategy worked. According to court documents, the firm soon controlled 90 percent of the e-book market.\n\nThis meant that publishers \u2014 who had invested in the writing, production, promotion and distribution of these books \u2014 couldn\u2019t sell their wares at the recommended retail price of $14.99. Nor could brick-and-mortar stores match Amazon\u2019s money-losing discounts. Amazon\u2019s product-dumping and predatory pricing helped bankrupt many small-town bookstores. Yet, neither publishers nor independent booksellers sued Amazon, even though they might have had a good case (as we\u2019ll soon see).\n\nSo how did this wacky e-book case get so far?\n\nIt started in the Rainier Tower in Seattle, home of Steve Berman and his law firm, Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP. The gifted litigator works in a blue-gray steel building designed by one of Seattle\u2019s native sons, Minoru Yamasaki (also the architect of the World Trade Center in Manhattan). He built the tower atop an 11-story concrete base that, like an inverted pyramid, widens as it ascends. The effect is disorienting. Visitors swear it has at least 40 stories, but insiders know that the tower supports only 29 floors, all balanced on an extremely narrow pedestal.\n\nBerman works in a long, narrow office lined by windows. Visiting his suite can be unsettling: You either gaze straight out at the birds cartwheeling through the clouds, or glance down thousands of terrifying feet to Seattle\u2019s noisy streets. Berman is a calm man who made his name serving as a special assistant attorney general for 13 states in the Big Tobacco case. He was one of two private attorneys on the negotiating team, which produced a $206 billion settlement for states. Over the years, he\u2019s devised sound legal strategies to sue Blue Cross, Microsoft and Visa in class-action suits.\n\nYet every industry has its own patois and whenever Berman files a new case, he tends to master a new language. Take his 2001 price-fixing suit against Merck, Pfizer and dozens of other drugmakers. Berman claimed that Big Pharma had long engaged in \u201ca cartel and a conspiracy\u201d by reporting fictitious drug prices. But he couldn\u2019t break the code. It was only after he hired an ex-drug rep to translate the industry\u2019s terms that Berman cracked the case. He won about $500 million for pensioners, consumers and his firm.\n\nIn the Amazon case, Berman has alleged that Apple and the publishers colluded against consumers. His case rests on the assumption that the \u201ccorrect\u201d price of the Kindle editions of published books is $9.99. (That\u2019s like saying that the discounted price of a Mustang automobile on Cal Worthington\u2019s lot is the only \u201cright\u201d price, not the sticker price listed at Ford dealerships.)\n\nBerman\u2019s analysis used price as a means of charging violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act. \u201cThe real issue,\u201d explained Dan Crane, professor of law at the University of Michigan, \u201cis whether Apple orchestrated agreement among publishers, or whether it just negotiated a hard deal with them.\u201d\n\nAllegations of collusion attracted the DOJ and other government agencies charged with upholding state and federal laws. In April 2012, the DOJ picked up Berman\u2019s argument and sued Apple. But in their filings, DOJ attorneys seemed most upset that the publishing CEOs had met \u201cin private dining rooms of upscale Manhattan restaurants,\u201d such as Picholine, where they gathered around a chef\u2019s table, perhaps sipping Syrah and smoking cigars. Later, the five publishers separately agreed to set their own prices for books sold in Apple\u2019s iBookstore, and Apple agreed to act as their agent by upholding those prices \u2014 the so-called agency agreement.\n\nDuring pretrial hearings in the government\u2019s case, it seemed Judge Cote had already made up her mind about Apple\u2019s guilt \u2014 even before hearing the evidence. (I didn\u2019t attend those trials but have read the filings over the past three years.) Sure enough, in July 2013, the judge ruled that the publishers and Apple had indeed conspired to fix prices. By then, the publishers had settled with DOJ, not because they believed they had done anything wrong, but because they were scared of losing even more money at the trial.\n\nBerman seemed jubilant as the judge\u2019s decision cleared the way for his civil suit. \u201cWe\u2019ve long held that Apple and this group of book publishers [HarperCollins, Hachette, Macmillian, Penguin and Simon & Schuster] formed a cabal with the sole intent of extinguishing any competitive influences in the e-book marketplace.\u201d Because of that supposed collusion, the attorney suggested, the price of an e-book had shot up from $9.99 to $14.99.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what industry numbers show.\n\nEvery year, the \u201cLibrary & Book Trade Almanac,\u201d an authority in the field, reports annual sales by book category. It 2008, when Amazon had a lock on the market, it reported that the average price of an adult fiction e-book in the U.S. in was $8.71. In 2009, as more people self-published books, the average dropped to $8.21. In 2010, when Apple introduced its agency model for e-books, the price dropped 14 percent to $7.06. And when publishers were up and running against Amazon in 2011, the average price of an e-book sank by an astonishing 32 percent \u2014 to $4.83. \u201cThat\u2019s a steal,\u201d said Al Greco, a professor of marketing at Fordham University.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Behold tech's fiercest legal battle: Price-fixing, conflicts of interest, and two very hungry lawyers", "author": "Kathleen Sharp", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Behold tech's fiercest legal battle: Price-fixing, conflicts of interest, and two very hungry lawyers", "title": "Amazon\u2019s bogus anti-Apple crusade", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/12/amazons_bogus_anti_apple_crusade/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/bezos_cook.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Behold tech's fiercest legal battle: Price-fixing, conflicts of interest, and two very hungry lawyers", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/bezos_cook.jpg", "title": "Amazon\u2019s bogus anti-Apple crusade", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Amazon\u2019s bogus anti-Apple crusade", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Amazon.com, anti-trust lawsuit, Apple, ebooks, iPad, kindle", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ee9\"", "article_summary": "So how did this wacky e-book case get so far?\nIn the Amazon case, Berman has alleged that Apple and the publishers colluded against consumers.\nThe case in question involves another of America\u2019s biggest companies, Amazon, and its contention that Apple has been colluding to keep e-book prices artificially high.\nSure enough, in July 2013, the judge ruled that the publishers and Apple had indeed conspired to fix prices.\nYet, neither publishers nor independent booksellers sued Amazon, even though they might have had a good case (as we\u2019ll soon see)."}
