But doubling, over doubling, my health insurance cost has not been \u2018a little more.\u2019 It has been difficult to come up with that kind of payment every month. I would like to vote Democratic, but it\u2019s cost me a lot of money, and I\u2019m just wondering if Democrats really realize how difficult it\u2019s been on working-class Americans to finance Obamacare?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked.\n\nClinton and O\u2019Donnell discussed by what means the insurance was purchased.\n\n\u201cSo you were going to a broker and buying a health insurance policy? And in effect, it nearly tripled after you went onto the exchange and bought a policy under the Affordable Care Act? Is that right?\u201d Clinton asked.\n\n\u201cWe could not do that. It was much more expensive than just purchasing private insurance from an insurance company,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re still buying the private insurance directly?\u201d Clinton said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\n\n\u201cOK, well, first of all let me say, I very much want to get the cost down and that is going to be my mission because I do think that for many, many people, but there are exceptions, like what you\u2019re telling me, having the Affordable Care Act has reduced cost, has created a real guarantee of insurance, because if you\u2019d had a pre-existing condition under the old system you wouldn\u2019t have gotten affordable insurance, so it\u2019s done a lot of really good things, but it has become increasingly clear that we\u2019re going to have to get the cost down,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton later recommended to O\u2019Donnell to keep shopping.\n\n\u201cAnd one thing that I would like you to do, and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to make a difference, but I would like you to just go shopping on that exchange,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act for many, including O\u2019Donnell, has resulted in increased insurance costs and loss of coverage altogether, although Clinton has been trying to tie herself to it and President Obama\u2019s policies on the campaign trail.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton struggles with an Obamacare question during Sunday night's CNN town hall in Ohio.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton struggled to answer a question at Sunday night's town hall about the rising costs of health care after the passage of Obamacare, telling a woman to ke", "title": "Clinton Stumped on Obamacare Cost Question, Tells Voter She Should Keep Shopping", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-stumped-health-care-cost-question-tells-voter-keep-shopping/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton struggled to answer a question at Sunday night's t", "creator": "@JackHeretik", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "title": "Clinton Stumped on Obamacare Cost Question, Tells Voter She Should Keep Shopping", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e8f\"", "article_summary": "BY: Follow @JackHeretikDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton struggled to answer a question at Sunday night\u2019s town hall about the rising costs of health care after the passage of Obamacare, telling a woman to keep shopping around.\nAnd in effect, it nearly tripled after you went onto the exchange and bought a policy under the Affordable Care Act?\nTeresa O\u2019Donnell, an office manager in Ohio, told Clinton about how her monthly costs for health care insurance for her family of four went from $490 to $1,081 a month.\nBut doubling, over doubling, my health insurance cost has not been \u2018a little more.\u2019 It has been difficult to come up with that kind of payment every month.\nClinton and O\u2019Donnell discussed by what means the insurance was purchased."}
