It\u2019s a common disease, one that we\u2019re encouraged to get seasonal flu shots for every year, as we\u2019ll likely be exposed to at least a few strains of it at any given time.\n\nBut there are so many different types of influenza that it\u2019s often difficult to remember which strains impact humans \u2014 and which ones could never infect us, but rather thrive only in birds, pigs, or seals. A lot of these overlap as well, and what better way to visually explain the flu than through a Venn diagram \u2014 aptly termed the \u201cInflu-Venn-Za\u201d?\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown. According to the CDC, there are three main types of influenza viruses: A, B, and C. Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on what types of proteins they have on their surface \u2014 hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There can be 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes (H1-H18), and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes (N1-N11).\n\nAccording to the graph, Influenzas B and C can only be found in humans, and they don\u2019t cause pandemics (they\u2019re generally referred to as the \u201ccommon flu\u201d). Humans share the ability to be infected with H1N1 \u2014 the most common form of swine flu (which had a pandemic in 2009-2010) \u2014 with pigs. H5N1, meanwhile, is the \u201cbird flu\u201d we\u2019re all familiar with in the media, which is capable of infecting birds, pigs, and humans. Humans don\u2019t seem to be able to transmit it to one another; however, they can only get infected with it from birds or pigs. The other two main strains that affect pigs, birds, and humans include H7N9 and H9N2.\n\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing and mutating \u2014 either in antigenic drift (when they occur slowly) or antigenic shift (when they occur suddenly). Their changes can impact how they\u2019re transferred from animals to humans.
