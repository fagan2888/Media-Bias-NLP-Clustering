The singer is expected to be tapped to perform at the halftime show at Super Bowl XLVIII in February, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. An announcement could come as early as Sunday.\n\nNeither the NFL nor Fox, which is carrying the Super Bowl this season, would comment. An NFL spokesman would only jokingly say that Janet Jackson and Miley Cyrus have been ruled out as performers.\n\nIf he gets the gig, Mars better bring his winter coat or at least a warm sweater. This year\u2019s game is being played in the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.\n\nThe New Jersey locale would seem to require a homegrown act. However, Bruce Springsteen has already played the Super Bowl and Bon Jovi is in disarray after the exit of guitarist Richie Sambora from the band.\n\nMars might not be at the mega-star status of recent headliners like Beyonce and Madonna, but he\u2019s solidified himself as a scene-stealing performer, as indicated by his recent performances at MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards, the Grammys and Billboard Music Awards.\n\nHis sophomore album, last year\u2019s \u201cUnorthodox Jukebox,\u201d has sold more than 1 million records since its release in December, and chances are his smash \u201cLocked Out of Heaven\u201d will warm up the chilly stadium.\n\nRodman wraps up North Korea visit\n\nRetired NBA star Dennis Rodman left North Korea today after a five-day trip during which he met leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nRodman told the Associated Press as he was leaving his hotel in Pyongyang that Kim had spoken about his visiting again, and that Kim \u201creally actually wants to change things.\u201d\n\nHe said Kim had encouraged Rodman when he goes back to the United States to \u201csay some very good, positive, and very good things about this country, that\u2019s what we talked about a lot.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s official news agency, KCNA, said in a brief report that the two had \u201ca cordial talk,\u201d and that Kim invited Rodman back again \u201cany time.\u201d\n\nRodman first met Kim \u2013 a basketball fan \u2013 during a visit in February to promote the sport and make a film. Rodman has suggested \u201cbasketball diplomacy\u201d could warm relations and has called Kim an \u201cawesome guy.\u201d\n\nThe birthday bunch\n\nJazz musician Sonny Rollins is 83.
