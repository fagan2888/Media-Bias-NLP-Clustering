First, Obamacare\u2019s chief bioethicist, Ezekiel Emanuel, wrote that he wanted to die at 75\u2013strongly implying we should too.\n\nNow, he is telling you to be as good as he is by refusing your annual Obamacare checkup. From his NYT piece,\u201cSkip Your Annual Physical:\u201d\n\nNot having my annual physical is one small way I can help reduce health care costs \u2014 and save myself time, worry and a worthless exam. Around 45 million Americans are likely to have a routine physical this year \u2014 just as they have for many years running. A poke here, a listen there, a few tubes of blood, maybe an X-ray, a few reassuring words about diet, exercise and not smoking from the doctor, all just to be sure everything is in good working order. Most think of it as the human equivalent of a 15,000-mile checkup and fluid change, which can uncover hidden problems and ensure longer engine life. There is only one problem: From a health perspective, the annual physical exam is basically worthless.\n\nIf it is so worthless, then why in the hell did Obamacarians fight so damn hard to require insurance companies pay for a yearly \u201dwellness\u201d exam? Because they wanted us to think we are getting something valuable without charge? Even though that \u201csomething\u201d is worthless? Now, that is cynical.\n\nOr maybe, to hurt us?\n\nSome are actually hurt by physicals, because healthy patients who undergo an exam sometimes end up with complications and pain from further screening or confirmatory tests.\n\nFunny, I didn\u2019t hear Emanuel shouting this warning during the Obamacare Congressional debate. When he was in the bowels of the beast, why didn\u2019t he work to keep the free annual checkup out of Obamacare\u2019s required coverage?\n\nWhat\u2019s really going on? Cost control!\n\nThe checkups consume billions, although no one is sure exactly how many billions because of the challenge of measuring the additional screenings and follow-up tests.\n\nIf the annual physical is so worthless\u2013indeed harmful--why isn\u2019t Emanuel urging his pals in government to remove the annual wellness exam from required Obamacare coverage? Why didn\u2019t he suggest this course in his article?\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nWe aren\u2019t individuals anymore, but so many accounts payable. But here\u2019s the thing:\n\n\u2013 My neighbor\u2019s blood test portion of his annual checkup discovered a touch of anemia, which led to the search for a cause, uncovering colon cancer. He had no symptoms. That \u201cworthless\u201d physical might have saved his life.\n\n\u2013 A good friend learned during his \u201cworthless\u201d annual physical that he had prostate cancer.\n\n\u2013 A family member\u2013in excellent shape\u2013was determined to have diabetes during his physical, leading to steps that have kept him off insulin so far.\n\n\u2013 My mother was diagnosed with high blood pressure for the first time in her then 96 years. Now 97, her BP is under good control.\n\nEmanuel writes that studies indicate there is no real difference in death rates among patients who receive or don\u2019t receive yearly checkups. Perhaps, but so what? That isn\u2019t the only measure.\n\nThere is no question that the lives some individuals are saved\u2013which he acknowledges. But too few to matter, he says. And we owe it to others not to be among those supposed few:\n\nMy medical routine won\u2019t include an annual exam. That will free up countless hours of doctors\u2019 time for patients who really do have a medical problem, helping to ensure there is no doctor shortage as more Americans get health insurance.\n\nThis is the consequence of Obamacare: We aren\u2019t human beings anymore, just cohorts and statistical categories.\n\nTechnocrats: You\u2019d laugh\u2013except they are in charge.\n\nAnd the ruling class wonders why no one trusts them anymore.\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Wesley J.
