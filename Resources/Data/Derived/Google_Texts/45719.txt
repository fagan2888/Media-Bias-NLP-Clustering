As we wait for King v Burwell – just how far are Republicans on the court willing to destroy the institution’s reputation on behalf of their party? – one question I found myself wondering about was how much of its original goal Obamacare has achieved. We know that the number of uninsured has dropped sharply; we also know that there are still a lot of uninsured. So how are we doing?

There are three issues that, I find, most reporting on the program’s progress tend to ignore. The first is that the ACA was never intended to cover everyone – undocumented immigrants aren’t eligible, yet account for several percent of the population. Second, because signup isn’t automatic, there will always be some leakage, some eligible people who fall through the cracks. Finally, of course, a large number of states are refusing to expand Medicaid and in general trying to obstruct the law.

So it seems to me that to evaluate the program we should (a) look at states that have implemented the law as it was intended to work and (b) compare with a realistic benchmark. For the latter, I’d suggest Massachusetts, where Romneycare has been in operation for almost a decade – and which still has 5 percent of adults age 18-64 uninsured, probably about half undocumented immigrants and half eligible residents falling through the cracks.

How is Obamacare doing relative to that benchmark in its second year of operation? The answer is, pretty well. In Medicare expansion states, it’s already around 80 percent of the way there:

And notice that this been achieved while the deficit has been shrinking and we’ve been having the best job growth since the 1990s. Folks, this program works; not perfectly, but every single claim by its opponents — it won’t reduce the number of uninsured, it will cause soaring rates, it will explode the deficit, it will kill jobs — has been proved false.
