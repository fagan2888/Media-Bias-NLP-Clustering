For the first time in over a century the AAA Glidden Classic Car Tour is in central Oklahoma.

If you're driving down the road this week and start feeling like you've entered a time warp, there's a reason why.

For the first time in over a century, the AAA Glidden Classic Car Tour is in central Oklahoma.

The tour features about 130 vintage cars from 32 states, Canada and Germany all made before 1943. On Monday, they could all be found on the Tarmac of Sundance Airport.

Among the owners: Carol Elliott who at 89 years old she's happy to show you her mind is still firing on all cylinders. She can name all the presidents and all the serial numbers to her classic cars.

She bought a 20 model Dodge touring car because it's just like the one her dad got when he returned home from World War I.

“He got home and drove by the model T dealership real fast and went to Dallas and bought my Dodge and I still have it,” Elliott said.

She'll take it, who she calls Bonnie, out Wednesday when the tour heads to Automobile Alley in downtown Oklahoma City.

Throughout the week, the car owners are driving across Central Oklahoma, making daily stops along the way to show off their vehicles. They’ll visit Chickasha on Thursday and Norman on Friday.

The Glidden tour is the oldest and largest antique car tour in America developed back in 1904 to demonstrate the reliability of the automobile.

“The last time the Glidden tour was in Oklahoma was 1910, so every 105 years,” said Chuck Mai, AAA spokesman.

This is Elliott's 20th Glidden tour but she doesn't do much driving anymore. Now, she hopes her son will take up her hobby, and more people will find restoring classic cars is right up their alley.
