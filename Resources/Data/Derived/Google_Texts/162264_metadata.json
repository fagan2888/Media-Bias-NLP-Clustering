Hearings on Lynch likely to wait\n\nSenate Democrats appear increasingly likely to punt confirmation proceedings for attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch into next year, a move that would appease Republicans who want the fight to wait until they hold the majority.\n\nSenior Senate Democratic and White House aides say they are reluctant to provoke a process fight with the newly empowered Republicans. No final decision has been made, but several Democrats privately believe that there might not be enough time to confirm Lynch in the lame-duck session, anyway.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile Lynch has yet to be thoroughly vetted for the job, her nomination has not provoked a major outcry from Republicans, a sign she still stands a strong shot at being approved even in a GOP-led Senate \u2014 unless she trips up during her confirmation hearings.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee that will consider the nomination, is not making Lynch\u2019s confirmation his top priority in the remainder of the year. Instead, Leahy is pushing hard to enact the USA Freedom Act, a sweeping overhaul of domestic surveillance programs that proponents fear would die next year if it doesn\u2019t pass while Democrats control the Senate.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The GOP plan for Lynch: It's all about immigration)\n\nAdded to the hurdles: The White House has yet to formally send over the papers associated with the Lynch nomination, meaning the bureaucratic work of considering the nomination has yet to begin in earnest, let alone the nominee\u2019s own one-on-one meetings with senators.\n\nWith limited time to act this Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) appears more eager to enact a must-pass omnibus spending bill, a defense policy measure and scores of President Barack Obama\u2019s executive and judicial nominations that have long been awaiting action.\n\nOne Democratic leadership aide said Reid\u2019s approach will be \u201cpretty deferential\u201d to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who will be able to dictate the chamber\u2019s agenda starting in January. In addition to potentially holding off on Lynch, the aide said, Reid also will open up the amendment process on the defense policy bill and avoid blocking GOP votes by \u201cfilling the tree,\u201da tactic Republicans have long complained about. (Reid wants Leahy to try to attach his surveillance bill to the defense measure on the Senate floor.)\n\nThe White House has said it\u2019s up to the Senate leadership to decide when to process the nomination \u2014 so the decision on when to vote would be Reid\u2019s and Leahy\u2019s alone. If Senate Democrats were to move on the nomination in the lame-duck session, they would be blamed by the GOP \u2014 and potentially the White House \u2014 for single-handedly invoking a partisan fight.\n\nRight now, there doesn\u2019t seem to be \u201cthe stomach\u201d for a partisan fight over Lynch after Democrats were shellacked at the polls last week, one aide said. Administration officials are eager for Lynch to be confirmed by a strong bipartisan majority, and some Democrats believe those prospects, ironically, improve in a GOP Senate.\n\nAnother top Democratic aide added: \u201cTraditionally, AG nominations have taken longer than the amount of time we have in the lame duck.\u201d\n\nNo final decisions will be made before Thursday when the full Democratic Caucus will debate the way forward in the lame-duck and in the new Congress. Still, some Democratic senators have pushed for swift confirmation of Lynch.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, said it\u2019s his \u201cpersonal, strong preference\u201d to finish the nomination before year\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cI think it should be considered when it will be considered most favorably,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cThat\u2019s a judgment for the leadership to make in consulting with our Republican colleagues.\u201d\n\nPunting on Lynch presents a risk for both parties. If Democrats moved in the lame-duck session, her confirmation would be virtually assured, since their party still maintains 55 seats in the chamber, and it now takes just 51 to overcome a filibuster on a nomination after Reid moved to change the rules last year.\n\nBut next year, Republicans will likely have 54 seats, meaning if the party stays mostly united against her, the U.S. attorney\u2019s chances of confirmation for attorney general would darken.\n\nStill, officials in both parties said, Republicans are reticent to block Lynch\u2019s nomination right off the bat, as the party tries to show it has a responsible, governing agenda and as the White House touts her history-making nomination as the first black woman to lead the department. Yet if Republicans let her nomination sail through, McConnell could get attacked from his base for failing to block the new head of an Obama Justice Department that has come under frequent criticism from the right.\n\nHow she performs at her confirmation hearings \u2014 and responds to GOP questions over executive power and the White House\u2019s moves on immigration \u2014 could make all the difference if her nomination slips into next year.\n\nSeung Min Kim contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Senate Democrats and White House aides say they are reluctant to provoke a process fight.", "title": "Hearings on Lynch likely to wait", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/loretta-lynch-hearing-wait-112779.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/11/141111_loretta_lynch_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Senate Republicans,Congress,Barack Obama,Senate,Eric Holder,Loretta Lynch,Senate Democrats,White House,Department Of Justice", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Senate Democrats and White House aides say they are reluctant to provoke a process fight.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Hearings on Lynch likely to waitSenate Democrats appear increasingly likely to punt confirmation proceedings for attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch into next year, a move that would appease Republicans who want the fight to wait until they hold the majority.\nSenior Senate Democratic and White House aides say they are reluctant to provoke a process fight with the newly empowered Republicans.\nAdministration officials are eager for Lynch to be confirmed by a strong bipartisan majority, and some Democrats believe those prospects, ironically, improve in a GOP Senate.\nStill, some Democratic senators have pushed for swift confirmation of Lynch.\nNo final decision has been made, but several Democrats privately believe that there might not be enough time to confirm Lynch in the lame-duck session, anyway."}
