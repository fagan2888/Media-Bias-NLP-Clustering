Insurers are moving in and out,\u201d Sebelius said in an interview with the station.\n\nWhile Humana and Aetna are planning their fallout with some of the state's markets, companies like Aetna are considering expanding their ACA market presence. Centene has additionally expressed optimisim over the state markets.\n\nSebelius added \u201csome push and pull\u201d will continue \u201cover the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nAs New York Times' Margot Sanger-Katz predicts, individual coverage premium rates may actually rise substantially next year but that doesn't mean the markets are failing, they're just growing up. A confluence of factors like insurers pricing plans low to begin with and risk programs sunsetting for insurers will likely result in higher premiums in the coming year.\n\nA former Kansas governor, Sebelius served at the helm of HHS from 2009 to 2014. She left after HealthCare.gov \u2014 the federal government\u2019s site for enrolling in individual insurance \u2014 went live with glitches that thwarted attempts by many people to sign up for coverage.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nBloomberg : Former Obamacare Head Sebelius Says New Markets Still Fragile", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/cb/53/cb53f9afde14cd0261fd90e4952707b7.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-health-law", "news_keywords": "Payer,Health Law", "category": "News Post", "title": "ACA markets still tenuous, former HHS head Sebelius says", "pub_date": "may 13, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-13T21:55:53", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, May 13, 2016, 09:55 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-05-01T21:55:53", "teaser": "<p>Premiums may rise next year and insurers internally debate whether to exit or expand markets.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-05-13", "sailthru.description": "Premiums may rise next year and insurers internally debate whether to exit or expand markets.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Premiums may rise next year and insurers internally debate whether to exit or expand markets.", "title": "ACA markets still tenuous, former HHS head Sebelius says", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/aca-markets-still-tenuous-former-hhs-head-sebelius-says/419137/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/8d/b4/8db43580a1b48920cb2abfd3e10118ed.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3926\"", "article_summary": "Her comments followed recent announcements by UnitedHealth Group and Humana that they won\u2019t participate in some ACA state markets next year.\nRecommended ReadingBloomberg : Former Obamacare Head Sebelius Says New Markets Still Fragile\nCentene has additionally expressed optimisim over the state markets.\nShe left after HealthCare.gov \u2014 the federal government\u2019s site for enrolling in individual insurance \u2014 went live with glitches that thwarted attempts by many people to sign up for coverage.\nDive Brief:Former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Bloomberg Television that while Obamacare has extended medical insurance to about 20 million people, the new insurance exchanges are still shaky."}
