First, they had to practice technique. The more than 120 boys were each given a doll and a sword and told, cut off its head.\n\nA 14-year-old who was among the boys, all abducted from Iraq\u2019s Yazidi religious minority, said he couldn\u2019t cut it right. He chopped once, twice, three times.\n\n\u201cThen they taught me how to hold the sword, and they told me how to hit. They told me it was the head of the infidels,\u201d the boy, renamed Yahya by his IS captors, told The Associated Press last week in northern Iraq, where he fled after escaping the IS training camp.\n\nWhen Islamic State extremists overran Yazidi towns in northern Iraq last year, they butchered older men and enslaved many of the women and girls. Dozens of young Yazidi boys like Yahya had a different fate: The IS sought to re-educate them. They forced them to convert to Islam from their ancient faith and tried to turn them into jihadi fighters.\n\nIt is part of a concerted effort by the extremists to build a new generation of militants, according to AP interviews with residents who fled or still live under IS in Syria and Iraq. The group is recruiting teens and children using gifts, threats and brainwashing. Boys have been turned into killers and suicide bombers. An IS video issued last week showed a boy beheading a Syrian soldier under an adult militant\u2019s supervision. Last month, a video showed 25 children unflinchingly shooting 25 captured Syrian soldiers in the head.\n\nIn schools and mosques, militants infuse children with extremist doctrine, often turning them against their own parents. Fighters in the street befriend children with toys. IS training camps churn out the Ashbal, Arabic for \u201clion cubs,\u201d child fighters for the \u201ccaliphate\u201d that IS declared across its territory. The caliphate is a historic form of Islamic rule that the group claims to be reviving with its own radical interpretation, though the vast majority of Muslims reject its claims.\n\n\u201cI am terribly worried about future generations,\u201d said Abu Hafs Naqshabandi, a Syrian sheikh who runs religion classes for refugees in the Turkish city of Sanliurfa to counter IS ideology.\n\nThe indoctrination mainly targets Sunni Muslim children. In IS-held towns, militants show young people videos at street booths. They hold outdoor events for children, distributing soft drinks and candy \u2014 and propaganda.\n\nThey tell adults, \u201cWe have given up on you, we care about the new generation,\u201d said an anti-IS activist who fled the Syrian city of Raqqa, the extremists\u2019 de facto capital. He spoke on condition of anonymity to preserve the safety of relatives under IS rule.\n\nWith the Yazidis, whom IS considers heretics ripe for slaughter, the group sought to take another community\u2019s youth, erase their past and replace it with radicalism.\n\nYahya, his little brother, their mother and hundreds of Yazidis were captured when IS seized the Iraqi town of Sulagh in August. They were taken to Raqqa, where the brothers and other Yazidi boys aged 8 to 15 were put in the Farouq training camp. They were given Muslim Arabic names to replace their Kurdish names. Yahya asked that AP not use his real name for his and his family\u2019s safety.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an IS training camp, children told: Behead the doll", "title": "In an IS training camp, children told: Behead the doll", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In an IS training camp, children told: Behead the doll", "title": "In an IS training camp, children told: Behead the doll", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/19/in_an_is_training_camp_children_told_behead_the_doll/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/inside-the-caliphate-indoctrinating-children.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an IS training camp, children told: Behead the doll", "title": "In an IS training camp, children told: Behead the doll", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/inside-the-caliphate-indoctrinating-children.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Zeina Karam and Bram Janssen", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "They were taken to Raqqa, where the brothers and other Yazidi boys aged 8 to 15 were put in the Farouq training camp.\nDozens of young Yazidi boys like Yahya had a different fate: The IS sought to re-educate them.\nThe more than 120 boys were each given a doll and a sword and told, cut off its head.\nThey told me it was the head of the infidels,\u201d the boy, renamed Yahya by his IS captors, told The Associated Press last week in northern Iraq, where he fled after escaping the IS training camp.\nIn schools and mosques, militants infuse children with extremist doctrine, often turning them against their own parents."}
