After a closed-door meeting Tuesday, Reid, D-Nev., said Democrats would hold together to prevent the body from moving onto any of the 12 annual appropriations bills if Republicans aren\u2019t willing to negotiate.\n\n\n\nWhy it matters:\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama has already vowed to veto any of the appropriations bills that don\u2019t meet the same requirements Reid has set, but it\u2019s better for him politically if Democrats prevent them from ever reaching his desk. \u201cWe will not vote to proceed to the Defense appropriations bill or any appropriations bills until Republicans have sat down at the table and figured out with us how we\u2019re going to properly fund the Defense Department \u2026 and our families\u2019 domestic needs,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blasted the plan, despite having led his own caucus down a very similar road while in the minority in the past several years. Ultimately, the final goal seems to be a repeat of the deal struck in 2013 by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to circumvent the spending caps set by sequestration in 2011.\n\n\n\nThe Needle Moves on Immigration Reform\n\nThe Needle Moves on Immigration Reform Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images What happened:\n\n\n\nA new poll out this week from Pew Research Center shows that a whopping 72 percent of Americans believe immigrants in the U.S. illegally should be allowed to stay. Of that group, about two-thirds (42 percent of the public overall) believe those immigrants should be provided a path to citizenship, and the remaining third (26 percent) think they should be limited to permanent residency. Just 27 percent of the public don\u2019t believe the approximately 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally should be allowed to stay.\n\n\n\nWhy it mattered:\n\n\n\nThe news comes at the same time as a small but noticeable groundswell toward legislative steps for reform. Lawmakers and activists alike are floating proposals that, perhaps for the first time in several years, stand a chance of making it through Congress and becoming law. First among those, paired with increases in border security, are guest worker programs that would help bring low-skill workers to the U.S. legally and help keep the people trained in U.S. schools in the country after they complete their educations.\n\nMassive Data Breach Highlights Failure to Pass Cybersecurity Legislation\n\nMassive Data Breach Highlights Failure to Pass Cybersecurity Legislation Mark Wilson/Getty Images What happened:\n\n\n\nChinese hackers stole the personal data of more than 4 million current and former federal workers in December, landing a significant blow to the government\u2019s cybersecurity systems. The hack, detected in April and revealed to the public Thursday, was possibly the third or fourth significant theft of federal data in the last year, although it is not clear what foreign hackers or their alleged state sponsors may want to do with the information.\n\n\n\nWhy it mattered:\n\n\n\nThe incident was a serious slap in the face to lawmakers, who have tried without success to advance cybersecurity legislation. \u201cToday\u2019s reported breach is part of a troubling pattern by this agency in failing to secure the personal data of federal employees \u2013 the second major breach in a year,\u201d said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. \u201cCyberattacks present a critical threat to our national security and our economy. We cannot afford to keep dragging our feet in addressing the escalating threats posed by hackers out to steal individuals\u2019 personal information.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Scrambles to Patch NSA Lapse With USA Freedom Act\n\nSenate Scrambles to Patch NSA Lapse With USA Freedom Act Patrick Semansk/AP What happened:\n\n\n\nIt took several weeks and a lapse in the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance capabilities, but the Senate on Tuesday easily passed the USA Freedom Act. The reform bill renewed the controversial Section 215 and two other provisions of the Patriot Act, while blocking the NSA from collecting Americans\u2019 phone data in bulk.\n\n\n\nWhy it matters:\n\n\n\nThe Patriot Act remains mostly intact, but thanks to Edward Snowden's revelations the public mood has undeniably shifted away from giving the surveillance authorities carte blanche in the name of security. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky's senior senator, was embarrassed when he insisted on leaving the NSA unchallenged and was abandoned by the majority of his colleagues, who came down in favor of reform.\n\n\n\nIt was more of a mixed bag for Kentucky\u2019s junior senator, presidential candidate Rand Paul, who took a stand against the government\u2019s spying capabilities. Paul made an enemy of a number of his colleagues while boosting his bona fides to the libertarian skeptics who make up his support base nationally. \"Government's bulk collection of records is going to end,\" he said Sunday. Two hours later, it did. But it was back up and running two days later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeds Raid Aaron Schock's Campaign Office", "article_metadata": {"zone": "slideshows", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "5 Things to Know About Congress This Week: 6/5/2015", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "U.S. News breaks down what's happening on Capitol Hill this week.", "title": "5 Things to Know About Congress This Week: 6/5/2015", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/slideshows/5-things-to-know-about-congress-this-week-6-5-2015", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/e2/ca/d0649f94477cbf9879024390845f/150605-reid-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "U.S. News breaks down what's happening on Capitol Hill this week.", "card": "summary", "title": "5 Things to Know About Congress This Week: 6/5/2015"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "June 5, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "slideshow", "keywords": "Gabrielle Levy,Pulse,NSA,Congress,cybersecurity,Schock, Aaron,immigration,politics,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "U.S. News breaks down what's happening on Capitol Hill this week."}, "article_summary": "After a closed-door meeting Tuesday, Reid, D-Nev., said Democrats would hold together to prevent the body from moving onto any of the 12 annual appropriations bills if Republicans aren\u2019t willing to negotiate.\nWhy it mattered:The news comes at the same time as a small but noticeable groundswell toward legislative steps for reform.\nMassive Data Breach Highlights Failure to Pass Cybersecurity LegislationMassive Data Breach Highlights Failure to Pass Cybersecurity Legislation Mark Wilson/Getty Images What happened:Chinese hackers stole the personal data of more than 4 million current and former federal workers in December, landing a significant blow to the government\u2019s cybersecurity systems.\nLawmakers and activists alike are floating proposals that, perhaps for the first time in several years, stand a chance of making it through Congress and becoming law.\nWhy it mattered:The incident was a serious slap in the face to lawmakers, who have tried without success to advance cybersecurity legislation."}
