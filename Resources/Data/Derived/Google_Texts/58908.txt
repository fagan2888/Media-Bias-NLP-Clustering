At 18 years, 125 days old, Nathan MacKinnon set an Avalanche record for youngest player to score two goals in a game, breaking Ryan O’Reilly’s mark set in 2009 at 18 years, 272 days. In doing so, MacKinnon also set himself apart from all current NHL youngsters by taking the league rookie scoring lead.

It was all part of a fun day for the kid from Nova Scotia, as his two goals gave him 12 goals and 26 points on the season — one more than injured San Jose Sharks forward Tomas Hertl (knee surgery last month) has.

“(Pucks) are starting to go in a little more than they did at the beginning of the year, which is nice,” MacKinnon said. “I’m a little bit more relaxed. Hopefully, it continues. It’s night and day since the beginning of the year; I feel a lot more comfortable out there.”

MacKinnon got his first goal, on the power play, when an Andre Benoit shot deflected in off a leg. His second was much more picturesque, a wrister from the right side that caught the inside of the far post and went in.

Footnotes. Jamie McGinn had a strong game for the Avs, getting his third goal in as many games since moving into a top-six forward role. … Avs defender Erik Johnson scored his seventh of the season, a one-hopper from the blue line that chased Sharks starter Antti Niemi from the game in the second. “Shooting the puck is never a bad play,” Johnson said. “But I got a lucky break there obviously.”
