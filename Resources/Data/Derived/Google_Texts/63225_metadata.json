They called that the Great Depression.\u201d\n\nPrices go down, what\u2019s not to like?\n\nYet the cold economic reality means that when prices fall people stop spending, hoping things will get even cheaper. In response, businesses cut production and lay off workers. That means even less demand, and prices drop further.\n\nBy then, your economy\u2019s in a vicious downward spiral.\n\nMaking things worse, those falling prices bring declining wages and worsening debt burdens.\n\nAnybody who doubts how bad it could get should look back to the last time the United States caught a serious dose of deflation, from 1929-33. They called that the Great Depression.\n\nJapan has languished in a deflationary cycle pretty much since the late 1990s, its once-booming economy reduced to \u201clost decades\u201d of stagnation. The country now lays claim to the world\u2019s highest debt \u2014 over 1 quadrillion yen ($9 trillion) \u2014 more than twice the size of its total economic output.\n\nEurope is now teetering on the edge.\n\nSeventy-four percent of global investors expressed fears the euro zone was slipping into deflation, according to a recent Bloomberg poll.\n\nIn August, Italy registered negative inflation for the first time in over 50 years. It joined fellow euro zone strugglers Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Slovakia in the deflation club. France\u2019s inflation stands at 0.4 percen and Germany\u2019s at 0.8 percent, all well below the European Central Bank\u2019s 2 percent inflation target.\n\nIf the trend continues, some economists are predicting a lurch into a long-term stagnation, making the near-catastrophic euro zone debt crisis just the start. Growth has ground to a halt in France. Italy is mired in recession. Even Germany saw its economy contract in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThe European economy is in an exceptional situation,\u201d French Prime Minister Manuel Valls told the National Assembly in Paris on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s marked by weak growth and a disturbing threat from deflation that\u2019s calling into question all our most reasonable forecasts.\u201d\n\nNobel Prize -winning economist Paul Krugman says Europe\u2019s economy is performing worse now than in the 1930s.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the economics that are starting to resemble those dark times, he warned, looking to the rise of a new nationalism that threatens to undermine the post-WWII order \u2014 when Europe\u2019s former enemies came together in what became the European Union.\n\n\u201cThe European project \u2014 peace guaranteed by democracy and prosperity \u2014 is in deep trouble,\u201d Krugman wrote in a New York Times column. \u201cThe Continent still has peace, but it\u2019s falling short on prosperity and, in a subtler way, democracy. And, if Europe stumbles, it will be a very bad thing not just for Europe itself but for the world as a whole.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leaders fear declining prices could lead to economic hard times unseen since the formation of the European Union", "title": "Why Europe is terrified of deflation", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Leaders fear declining prices could lead to economic hard times unseen since the formation of the European Union", "title": "Why Europe is terrified of deflation", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/20/why_europe_is_terrified_of_deflation/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_141014842.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Leaders fear declining prices could lead to economic hard times unseen since the formation of the European Union", "title": "Why Europe is terrified of deflation", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_141014842.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Ames", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, deflation, Economics, Europe, European economy, GlobalPost", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd274\"", "article_summary": "Seventy-four percent of global investors expressed fears the euro zone was slipping into deflation, according to a recent Bloomberg poll.\nAnd, if Europe stumbles, it will be a very bad thing not just for Europe itself but for the world as a whole.\u201d\nIt joined fellow euro zone strugglers Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Slovakia in the deflation club.\n\u201cThe European economy is in an exceptional situation,\u201d French Prime Minister Manuel Valls told the National Assembly in Paris on Tuesday.\nTopics: deflation, Economics, Europe, European economy, GlobalPost, Business News, News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostLISBON, Portugal \u2014 From Putin\u2019s hordes massing over the eastern borders of Ukraine to the army of home-grown Islamic State fanatics threatening a murderous return from the Middle East, Europe has a lot be frightened of right now."}
