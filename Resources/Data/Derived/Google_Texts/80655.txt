Federal regulators are looking to save "Nemo" from ocean pollution.

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) said Tuesday it is considering new protections for the orange clownfish, which was made famous by the Disney movie "Finding Nemo."

The move comes after the left-leaning Center for Biological Diversity petitioned the NMFS to protect orange clownfish in 2012. The group threatened to sue the agency last year for not doing so, until it agreed to consider listing the orange clownfish as an endangered or threatened species.

“Finding Nemo is getting even more difficult — global warming and acidifying oceans are destroying the coral reefs the clownfish calls home,” said Shaye Wolf, climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Endangered Species Act protection and meaningful action to put the brakes on greenhouse gas pollution will help make sure these beautiful fish survive in the wild and not just a movie.”

The orange clownfish is threatened by ocean pollution caused by man-made carbon dioxide that finds its way into the water, the activists warn. Not only does the pollution ruin the coral reef habitat where these fish live, but it can also damage their hearing, sight and smell, making them easier targets for their predators, they say.

However, the NMFS will not consider the same protections for a handful of other coral reef fish. The agency said it does not believe the Hawaiian dascyllus, reticulated damselfish, blue-eyed damselfish, black-axil chromis, blue-green damselfish, or blackbar devil are endangered.
