Rep. Joe Sam Queen, D-Waynesville, for his District 119 House seat. One is barely old enough to drink, one campaigned for Barry Goldwater and one features Second Amendment-chest thumping on his website: \u201cUnited Nations \u2013 stay out of NC!\u201d\n\nAaron Littlefield, Dodie Allen and Mike Clampitt will face off in the primary. The winner will go up against Queen in November. The seat represents voters in Swain and Jackson counties and part of Haywood \u2014 namely the greater Waynesville, Lake Junaluska and Balsam area.\n\nThese three candidates took time with The Smoky Mountain News recently to talk shop. The discussions were loose. In addition to relaying their roots, candidates talked about such standard fare as the economy, healthcare and education. These legislative hopefuls also discussed some wildcard issues \u2014 gay marriage and marijuana legalization \u2014 that have fallen upon legislators in other states in recent years.\n\nDodie Allen, 79 \u2022 Auctioneer\n\nWhy she\u2019s running: \u201cI do feel that it\u2019s a calling almost. I feel that I can be a part of the cure and not the disease.\u201d\n\nOn political labels: \u201cIf you look at the classic definition of liberal, it\u2019s the same as a conservative.\u201d\n\nOn apathy: \u201cThe distrust in government is what drives apathy.\u201d\n\nOn education: \u201cEducation doesn\u2019t belong in the hands of an educational office in Washington, D.C. The local people and the parents should have control of our educational system.\u201d\n\nOn war: \u201cI\u2019ve never known peace.\u201d\n\nOn Rep. Joe Sam Queen: \u201cIf he would cut his hair I\u2019d respect him.\u201d\n\nHypothetical, gay marriage: \u201cI don\u2019t think I should have to go to the dagum state to get a license to get married \u2014 I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m homosexual or heterosexual.\u201d\n\nHow she relaxes: \u201cI don\u2019t! If I relax I may die. What are you talking about? If I relax I may forget what I\u2019m suppose to do.\u201d\n\nLast book read: \u201cDefense of Liberty,\u201d by Ron Paul.\n\nIn Dodie Allen\u2019s world there are two types of people. The division does not fall along party lines.\n\n\u201cIn my world, it\u2019s divided into thinkers and non-thinkers,\u201d Allen explained.\n\nThe candidate herself is a thinker. She thinks a lot. About politics. About government. About the future of America.\n\n\u201cI think we are unfortunately like Rome; I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to make it or not,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to learn from our mistakes and our history. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll live to see it.\u201d\n\nNearly 80 years old, the candidate has seen numerous societal cycles. The revolving ride has not gone unrecognized. She points out that varying political paths come in and out of vogue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a circle, we\u2019re on a wheel,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIt\u2019s reciprocal, just like fashion. Politics is reciprocal, philosophy is reciprocal.\u201d\n\nA self-described \u201cpolitical junkie,\u201d the candidate has been around long enough to see the pendulum swing a few directions. During her early twenties, she jumped on board the train trailing the banner of conservatism \u2014 a bold move for a girl hailing from a family full of Southern Democrats.\n\n\u201cOh God, I thought they were all going to have cats with straw tails,\u201d Allen recalled.\n\nThe candidate remembers an experience her husband\u2019s family had as the government took their property via eminent domain. A seminal experience in Allen\u2019s political trajectory, it blew her young mind \u2014 \u201cI was shocked that this went on in this United States of America\u201d \u2014 and sent her running into the arms of the Barry Goldwater presidential campaign.\n\nThe experience was a springboard, sparking a lifelong journey and appreciation of the conservative experience. She met William F. Buckley. She met Strom Thurmond. She went to weekend seminars.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when my real study began \u2014 philosophy, constitutionalism, I did a lot of study,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe would not have had Ronald Reagan if we had not had Barry Goldwater.\u201d\n\nThrough the years \u2014through a career at the Regional Bell Operating Company and raising four children \u2014 Allen dug deep into the conservative camp. She embraced the philosophy and the principals. She fell in love with John Locke.\n\n\u201cJohn Locke was way ahead of his time \u2014 appealing to the instincts of man, wanting to be free,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s conservative ideology that drives freedom.\u201d\n\nThe candidate came to Western North Carolina more than three decades ago. She eventually opened her auction house and settled into Sylva. She\u2019s run for this House seat before and is now doing so again.\n\nSitting in the auction house on a recent afternoon, Allen said that, if elected, she intends to focus on communication \u2014 communication with citizens, as well as lawmakers.\n\n\u201cCommunication is the foundation of success, and the lack of it can be the foundation of failure,\u201d she said. \u201cThrough communication we create good neighbors, harmonious communities. It\u2019s so important.\u201d\n\nMike Clampitt, 59 \u2022 Retired Charlotte fire captain\n\nWhy are you seeking office: \u201cOne, to be the ears of the citizens of Western North Carolina, and another, to be their voice. Also, to restore faith in our government.\u201d\n\nOn Moral Monday marchers: \u201cI don\u2019t think they understand exactly where this was going.\u201d\n\nOn roots: \u201cI go back six generations. I have a good sense of Western North Carolina and its needs.\u201d\n\nOn Rep. Joe Sam Queen: \u201cMr. Queen and I are in totally opposite areas for public policy.\u201d\n\nOn political labels: \u201cRepublican-conservative, or conservative-Republican, you can put that in any order that works.\u201d\n\nHypothetical, gay marriage: \u201cWhen it comes to marriage, marriage is between one man and one woman. If there is a contract between two individuals, that\u2019s their business.\u201d\n\nHow he relaxes: \u201cWork. Sounds crazy, but I like to mow. I have a farm and I like to mow. When I have something on my mind, I like to mow or garden.\u201d\n\nLast book read: \u201cOne Carbon Atom\u201d\n\nOver the past year, North Carolinians dissatisfied with the direction the state has taken have been marching on the capital in Raleigh. The marches have been dubbed Moral Mondays.\n\nMike Clampitt has had opportunity to watch the protests up close. He spent a recent term in Raleigh as a sargent of arms, charged with maintaining \u201cdecorum\u201d on the House floor.\n\n\u201cMake sure the legislators maintain their emotions,\u201d Clampitt explained.\n\nThe candidate recalled the Moral Monday events as \u201can interesting experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no problem with freedom of speech, [but] there is concern that, with that, you cause a disruption of the legislative process,\u201d Clampitt said.\n\nThe disruption of decorum probably wasn\u2019t the only thing giving the candidate pause during the Moral Mondays. He also agrees with the legislative decisions the marches were protesting.\n\nClampitt lauds the General Assembly for improving \u201cvoter integrity,\u201d lowering income tax and making North Carolina \u201cmore business friendly.\u201d He also agrees with lawmakers\u2019 decision not to embrace the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid.\n\n\u201cTo keep the financial house in order is to do what the legislature has done and not take the money,\u201d Clampitt said.\n\nThe candidate is running a campaign full of red-meat positions on the issues. He\u2019s a Second Amendment guy. He\u2019s not a fan of \u201cludicrous regulations\u201d on business. He\u2019s an advocate for state\u2019s rights. His politics tread into the risqu\u00e9.\n\n\u201cI am an Oath Keeper,\u201d Clampitt said.\n\nIn addition to being an Oath Keeper \u2014 a group of law enforcement and military types who intend to disobey orders they deem unconstitutional \u2014 the candidate is a retired fire captain, having served 28 years in Charlotte, and former director of Fire and Rescue Training at Central Piedmont Community College, also in Charlotte.\n\nIf he wins the primary, it will be Clampbitt\u2019s second time going up against Rep. Queen. He narrowly lost this race in 2012.\n\nAaron Littlefield, 22 \u2022 Worship leader, full-time student\n\nWhy he\u2019s running: \u201cI believe people deserve a candidate that is willing to actually discuss the issues at hand \u2014 the key word is discuss.\u201d\n\nOn the Affordable Care Act: \u201cI don\u2019t think you should force somebody to buy anything. Forcing somebody, I just don\u2019t like the concept.\u201d\n\nOn student-loan debt: \u201cIt\u2019s our ball and chain, it\u2019s weighing us down.\u201d\n\nOn recently buying his first gun, a 12-gauge shotgun: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to shoot, and the ammo\u2019s cheap. You never know what\u2019s going to happen. Why not? You buy car insurance, some people buy life insurance.\u201d\n\nHypothetical, marijuana legalization: \u201cThis one is going to get me burned at the stake here. I think it\u2019s worth looking at what happens in Colorado and Washington and then making an educated decision based on how they work.\u201d\n\nHow he relaxes: Exercise and catching up on Netflix viewing with his wife.\n\nLast book read: \u201cThe Epistle of James\u201d\n\nSitting in a caf\u00e9 across the street from the Western Carolina University campus, Aaron Littlefield covers a lot of ground. He talks about guns and God. He talks about political labels and the road construction on N.C. 107. He talks about his time spent campaigning for Mitt Romney.\n\n\u201cYou may notice I speak a lot faster than my opponents,\u201d Littlefield said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we are, we like to get things done. We like to go, go, go.\u201d\n\nThe candidate speaks of his generation, the millennials. He talks a lot about the millennials.\n\n\u201cWhat millennials want is a way forward,\u201d Littlefield said. \u201cWe don\u2019t care about campaign ideas or rhetoric, we want results.\u201d\n\nThe candidate is counting on the millennials, a growing population, particularly in Jackson County, to carry him in this election. He quotes Reagan \u2014 \u201cfreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction\u201d \u2014 and hopes he can motivate the youth to vote.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s time to pass the torch,\u201d Littlefield said. \u201cIf the millennial will wake up, the time is now, we have the numbers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "News, issues, and events from Haywood, Jackson, Macon and Swain counties in western North Carolina.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Jeremy Morrison", "og": {"url": "http://www.smokymountainnews.com/news/item/12725-house-party-three-gop-candidates-take-aim-at-rep-queen", "type": "article", "description": "News, issues, and events from Haywood, Jackson, Macon and Swain counties in western North Carolina.", "title": "House party: Three GOP candidates take aim at Rep.
