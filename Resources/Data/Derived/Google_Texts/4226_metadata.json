Jim Himes has not been a stranger to controversy this year, and he\u2019s likely to pop up again at the center of new congressional scuffles.\n\nHe angered organized labor but his star rose at the White House when he helped give President Obama the authority he needed to negotiate a new trade pact.\n\nHimes was denied a top Democratic Party job, but a group of centrists he leads may be growing in political clout. And House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who often chafed when Himes, D-4th District, crossed party lines, is likely to depend on the support of centrists like him if Democratic liberals abandon her when she negotiates with the GOP on key issues \u2013 especially the nation\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cCongressman Himes\u2019 thoughtfulness and diligence will continue to be a valued asset to House Democrats\u2019 efforts to advance a budget that invests in America and grows the paychecks of all Americans,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nTo many political analysts, centrists of both parties are a dying breed as congressional districts are increasingly reshaped to favor either liberal Democrats or conservative Republicans. Mixed or \u201cswing\u201d districts are on the wane. Even Himes\u2019 district has become less of a tossup and more Democratic through redistricting and the growth of minority groups.\n\nHimes is a co-chair of the New Democrat Coalition, a group of about 50 pro-business Democrats. Scott McLean, professor of political science at Quinnipiac University, said it\u2019s tougher for these New Democrats, a group created during President Clinton\u2019s second term, to make a mark now.\n\n\u201cCongress is way more divisive now, and that makes it harder for people who want to go to the middle,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many louder voices, stronger voices.\u201d\n\nHimes said he hopes the political trend reverses and the number of moderates \u2013 from both parties \u2013 grows. He also said he believes the Democratic Party has a \u201cbig tent\u201d that accepts those who don\u2019t vote a straight party line, while the GOP subjects its members to an ideological litmus test.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the party of tolerance; we celebrate our diversity,\u201d he said.\n\nHimes and other members of the New Democrat Coalition worked with the GOP to give the president broad authority to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact among the United States and 11 Pacific Rim countries. In doing so, the lawmaker angered organized labor, which is concerned the agreement will result in U.S. job losses.\n\nHimes responded to criticisms of his vote by saying, \u201cI do an enormous amount of work to determine what is best for my district.\u201d\n\nHimes also often splits with other members of the Connecticut congressional delegation, all Democrats, on defense spending. By seeking some cuts to military spending, Himes votes with other Democrats more often that his Connecticut colleagues, who represent districts that are home to large defense contractors, such as Electric Boat and United Technologies\u2019 Sikorsky Aircraft and Pratt & Whitney.\n\nEven as their numbers have shrunk, the remaining moderates of both parties may be key players in efforts to resolve several looming crises this fall, including any federal shutdown in October. Coalition members see opportunities to assert themselves in coming fights over a massive highway bill and an increase in the debt ceiling.\n\nThese are all areas where House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has had a tough time fashioning legislation that can pass with only GOP votes because his party\u2019s conservatives often reject compromises.\n\nGeoffrey Skelley of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, said New Democrats have a limited role in the budget-making process simply because they aren\u2019t in the majority. Republican House leaders and the White House will do most of the negotiating, he said.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s possible that the New Democrats could get involved if a larger compromise deal arises\u2026and House Republicans decide to seek out the help of some moderate Democrats in the House as a part of putting together a budget,\u201d Skelley said.\n\nHimes cautioned that any help New Democrats give the GOP will come at a price.\n\n\u201cWe New Dems don\u2019t exist for the purpose of compromising with Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cTo negotiate we need to know they will be reasonable.\u201d\n\nAny compromise budget would have to include an increase in funding for some New Democrat priorities, including infrastructure, education and scientific research, Himes said.\n\nFor example, Himes said the New Democrats may use their \u201ccreativity and policy chops\u201d to push reauthorization of a highway bill that would keep transportation money flowing to the states after the end of October.\n\nIn July, Himes and other New Democrats wrote to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Pelosi urging them to replenish the dwindling highway trust fund by taxing money U.S. corporations keep overseas.\n\nReps. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, and Elizabeth Esty-D-5th District, also signed the letter.\n\nNo ideological fights\n\nHimes, 49, is a former investment banker who defeated a Republican, former Rep. Christopher Shays, to win the 4th District seat in 2008.\n\nHis knowledge of Wall Street served him well in securing a slot on the House Financial Services Committee, a good perch from which to serve his constituents, many of whom work for banks and investment firms.\n\nHis understanding of Wall Street also led him to support a couple of GOP-favored changes in the Dodd-Frank financial reform act, which infuriated Pelosi and other Democrats and led liberal groups to lobby against his candidacy to head the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nHimes had earned the job of DCCC treasurer through his fundraising prowess, but Pelosi didn't choose him for the organization\u2019s top job. That went to Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, D-N.M., who rarely crossed party lines.\n\nHimes\u2019 political future seems secure, McLean said, even as he has attracted a challenger in state Rep. John Shaban of Redding, 51.\n\nHimes has already become a \u201cbundler,\u201d one of dozens of \"Hillblazers\" who have each helped raise at least $100,000 for Hillary Clinton. Once again, Himes has used his ability to raise political cash in a wealthy district to help other Democrats and boost himself up the party\u2019s ladder.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right at the crossroads of a lot of things,\u201d McLean said, and if Clinton fails to win the nomination, \"Himes can always say, 'I back the person who is the Democratic nominee.\"\n\nRep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., who co-chairs the New Democrats Coalition with Himes, calls the Connecticut lawmaker \u201cpragmatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe focuses on what can be accomplished, he doesn\u2019t get into ideological fights,\u201d Kind said.\n\nKind said the New Democrats organize a policy lunch meeting every Wednesday and hold smaller \u201cpolicy coffees\u201d throughout the week.\n\nObama administration officials are often invited to these events \u2013 last week\u2019s lunch featured Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.\n\nKind said a priority for the New Democrats is to find a way to prevent a government shutdown, which would occur if House Republicans don\u2019t agree to a short-term extension of current federal funding past Sept. 30.\n\nConservative Republicans insists the extension include the defunding of Planned Parenthood, which would force Senate Democrats to filibuster the short-term budget bill.\n\nA similar scenario played out two years ago, when conservative Republicans insisted a budget bill defund the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe government shut down for 16 days. Eventually Democrats helped Boehner push a bipartisan, two-year compromise through the House, and it passed the Senate. But that budget compromise will expire at the end of the month.\n\nWhen it comes to the threat of a shutdown, Himes, said it would be blamed on the GOP and \u201cwould be a politically unwise thing to do.\u201d\n\nPelosi appreciates that.\n\n\u201cWith another Republican government shutdown looming and an infrastructure funding deadline on the horizon, Congressman Himes has amplified Democrats\u2019 call for bipartisan solutions, not empty ideological grandstanding,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nRecently, Himes showed off his budget wonkishness by tweeting a yellowed photo of a newspaper article in the National Archives. Written by Alexander Hamilton in 1790, it detailed the new nation\u2019s debt \u201cdown to the penny!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/14/himes-new-dems-may-bridge-troubled-congressional-waters/", "news_keywords": "Politics, Washington, budget bill, Congress, Geoffrey Skelley, government shutdown, highway trust fund, Jim Himes, John Boehner, moderate Democrats", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/14/himes-new-dems-may-bridge-troubled-congressional-waters/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Rep.
