That creates both a three-story building along the street as well as a dramatic outdoor deck for the fourth floor\u2019s Eleve restaurant.\n\nThe second move was recessing the building\u2019s southeastern corner to create a small courtyard that not only preserves two large oak trees but also provides a welcoming outdoor spot for the cafe\u2019s customers.\n\nThat makes the building\u2019s most visible part, its northeastern corner, more compatible in size to its neighbors, while its less visible portion further down Wentworth Street is taller but also the same height as the neighboring parking garage.\n\nThe design practices good manners in another way.\n\nIts largely creamy exterior pallet of cast stone and stucco, complete with simple columns and pilasters, is a safe choice, a conservative complement to the historic surroundings.\n\nKessler says its exterior also has a decidedly French dialect, borrowing heavily from Parisian architectural types.\n\nThe Meeting Street facade also features a pronounced gallery entrance that runs the entire three floors as well as generously sized windows to give pedestrians more to look at.\n\nThe interior is where the \u201cBohemian\u201d name comes into play in its informal, unconventional and avant-garde sense.\n\nThere are colorful glass chandeliers, striking artwork (both in the gallery and in the lobby, halls and other public spaces), vibrant carpets and other fun touches, including the translucent stone registration desk that glows or the scalloped recess for a couch near the main door.\n\nThe Bohemian theme also appears on the rooftop deck, whose modern furniture, large pink glowing plant pots and artificial grass form a contemporary foreground to the historic rooftops just over the parapet.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun place to visit, whether grabbing a cup of coffee in the cafe or having Sunday brunch on the roof. (Much like the company\u2019s Bohemian Hotel\u2019s \u201cRocks on the Roof\u201d in Savannah is one of that city\u2019s best places to visit for a drink at day\u2019s end).\n\nAnd Kessler\u2019s design goal also shows how it fits in to the city.\n\n\u201cWe strive to design buildings that will become acclaimed structures for the preservationist of future generations,\u201d he says.\n\nCharleston\u2019s tourist scene succeeds because it\u2019s sort of the anti-Las Vegas.\n\nWhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, while many Charleston visitors probably think about what it would be like to live here.\n\nThat\u2019s why a new hotel here succeeds the best when it serves more than those who are passing through.\n\nReach Robert Behre at 937-5771.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Design, inside and out, of new Grand Bohemian Hotel speaks to individuality, Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nHome & Garden, \r\nRobert Behre, \r\nRobert Behre, architecture,Charleston,Eleve,Grand Bohemian,Grand Bohemian Gallery,Kessler Collection,LS3P,Meeting Street,Reese Vanderbilt Architects,Richard Kessler,Wentworth Street", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "It\u2019s Charleston\u2019s first full-service hotel to open since the city started topping national lists as the best city to visit.", "title": "Design, inside and out, of new Grand Bohemian Hotel speaks to individuality", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150905/150909635/design-inside-and-out-of-new-grand-bohemian-hotel-speaks-to-individuality", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150905/PC12/150909635/AR/0/AR-150909635.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150905/PC12/150909635/AR/0/AR-150909635.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s Charleston\u2019s first full-service hotel to open since the city started topping national lists as the best city to visit.", "title": "Design, inside and out, of new Grand Bohemian Hotel speaks to individuality", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150905/PC12/150909635/AR/0/AR-150909635.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150909635}}, "keywords": "Design, inside and out, of new Grand Bohemian Hotel speaks to individuality , Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nHome & Garden, \r\nRobert Behre, \r\nRobert Behre, architecture,Charleston,Eleve,Grand Bohemian,Grand Bohemian Gallery,Kessler Collection,LS3P,Meeting Street,Reese Vanderbilt Architects,Richard Kessler,Wentworth Street", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-05T12:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-09-04T17:04:00Z", "author": "Robert Behre"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "It\u2019s Charleston\u2019s first full-service hotel to open since the city started topping national lists as the best city to visit."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd193\"", "article_summary": "The Grand Bohemian Hotel\u2019s design is recessed on its southeastern tip to save two large live oaks, which shade an outdoor courtyard.\nAnd the Grand Bohemian Hotel at 55 Wentworth St. does not disappoint.\n\u201cWe strive to design buildings that will become acclaimed structures for the preservationist of future generations,\u201d he says.\n(Much like the company\u2019s Bohemian Hotel\u2019s \u201cRocks on the Roof\u201d in Savannah is one of that city\u2019s best places to visit for a drink at day\u2019s end).\nIt\u2019s Charleston\u2019s first full-service hotel to open since the city started topping national lists as the best city to visit."}
