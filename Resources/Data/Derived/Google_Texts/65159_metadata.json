(NYSE: HUM) today reported diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2Q 2015) of $2.85 compared to $2.19 for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 (2Q 2014). For the six months ended June 30, 2015 (1H 2015) the company reported EPS of $5.67 compared to $4.54 in the six months ended June 30, 2014 (1H 2014).\n\nThe company has included certain adjusted financial measures throughout this earnings press release. Adjusted pretax income and Adjusted EPS for 2Q 2015 and 1H 2015 were as follows (a):\n\nConsolidated pretax income (in millions) 2Q 2015 2Q 2014 1H 2015 1H 2014 GAAP $ 793 $ 646 $ 1,537 $ 1,332 2Q 2015 gain related to sale of Concentra (267 ) - (267 ) - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 526 $ 646 $ 1,270 $ 1,332\n\nDiluted earnings per common share 2Q 2015 2Q 2014 1H 2015 1H 2014 GAAP $ 2.85 $ 2.19 $ 5.67 $ 4.54 2Q 2015 gain related to sale of Concentra (1.18 ) - (1.18 ) - 1Q 2015 tax benefit related to then-pending sale of Concentra - - (0.35 ) - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 1.67 $ 2.19 $ 4.14 $ 4.54\n\nThe lower year-over-year Adjusted pretax income for the quarter and year to date reflected lower Retail segment operating results, partially offset by improved operating results from the Group and Healthcare Services segments. Lower results in the Retail segment were primarily related to lower-than-expected 2015 Medicare Advantage financial claim recovery levels and lower-than-anticipated reductions in inpatient admissions from its clinical programs. Overall, year-over-year hospital admissions are nonetheless down and are running consistent with the company\u2019s revised expectations. Humana believes it has appropriately reflected recent medical cost experience in its plan designs for 2016 submitted to CMS. Further discussion of the drivers of the business segment results are discussed in the sections below highlighting each segment.\n\nThe lower year-over-year Adjusted EPS for the quarter and year to date reflected the same factors impacting pretax income, partially offset by the favorable impact of share repurchases.\n\nProposed Merger\n\nOn July 3, 2015, the company announced it entered into a definitive agreement with Aetna Inc. (Aetna) under which Aetna will acquire all outstanding shares of Humana for a combination of cash and stock. Under terms of the agreement, Humana stockholders will receive $125 in cash and 0.8375 of an Aetna common share for each Humana share. The transaction is subject to approval by both Humana and Aetna shareholders, as well as expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust waiting period and approvals of certain state Departments of Insurance and other regulators. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016.\n\nEarnings Guidance\n\nThe company expects EPS for the quarter ending September 30, 2015 to be approximately $2.15. The company continues to project EPS for the year ending December 31, 2015 (FY 2015) of approximately $9.28. The company reaffirms its estimate for Adjusted EPS for FY 2015 of approximately $7.75 as noted below:\n\nDiluted earnings per common share FY 2015 GAAP $ 9.28 2Q 2015 gain related to sale of Concentra (1.18 ) 1Q 2015 tax benefit related to then-pending sale of Concentra (0.35 ) Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 7.75\n\nThe company also anticipates adjusting GAAP EPS in subsequent quarters for any transaction costs associated with the proposed merger with Aetna.\n\n\u201cOur major franchise, Medicare Advantage, is stabilizing and our clinical programs continue to focus on the needs of our members living with chronic conditions,\u201d said Bruce D. Broussard, Humana\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cFurthermore, as we gain additional experience with our individual commercial business, we are strengthening our understanding of the actions necessary to ensure we can offer individuals a sustainable product.\u201d\n\nBrian A. Kane, Humana\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, \u201cWhile certain operational challenges impacted our second quarter results, we are encouraged by recent progress and appreciate the diligence with which our leaders and associates have worked to overcome these issues. We remain confident that Humana\u2019s strategic and financial prospects position us well for continued growth.\u201d\n\nCONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS\n\nConsolidated revenues\n\nConsolidated revenues (including investment income) for 2Q 2015 were $13.73 billion, an increase of 12.4 percent from $12.22 billion in 2Q 2014, with total premiums and services revenues of $13.62 billion up 12.3 percent, increasing $1.49 billion from $12.13 billion in prior year\u2019s quarter. The year-over-year increase in premiums and services revenues reflected higher totals year over year in both the Retail and Group segments.\n\nConsolidated revenues for 1H 2015 rose $3.63 billion, or 15.2 percent, to $27.57 billion from $23.93 billion in 1H 2014 with total premiums and services revenues of $27.36 billion also up 15.2 percent, increasing $3.61 billion from $23.75 billion in the prior-year period. Higher Retail and Group segment premiums and services revenues also drove the year-over-year change in 1H 2015.\n\nConsolidated benefits expense\n\nThe 2Q 2015 consolidated benefit ratio (benefits expense as a percent of premiums) of 85.2 percent increased by 210 basis points from 83.1 percent for the prior year\u2019s quarter primarily reflecting higher ratios in both the Retail and Group segments. Prior-period medical claims reserve development (Prior Period Development) increased the 2Q 2015 consolidated benefit ratio by 10 basis points versus lowering that ratio by 40 basis points in the prior year. Excluding Prior Period Development, the consolidated benefit ratios were 85.1 percent and 83.5 percent for 2Q 2015 and 2Q 2014, respectively. Drivers of the segment-level ratios are discussed in the sections below highlighting each segment.\n\nThe 1H 2015 consolidated benefit ratio of 84.1 percent increased by 140 basis points from 82.7 percent in 1H 2014. The first-half increase primarily reflects the same factors impacting the second quarter year-over-year comparison. Prior Period Development lowered the 1H 2015 consolidated benefit ratio by 70 basis points versus lowering that ratio by 150 basis points in 1H 2014. Excluding Prior Period Development, the consolidated benefit ratios were 84.8 percent and 84.2 percent for 1H 2015 and 1H 2014, respectively.\n\nAs discussed in the Retail segment highlights below, the company\u2019s consolidated Prior Period Development was primarily from Medicare Advantage and individual commercial claims development in that segment. Consolidated Prior Period Development was as follows:\n\nConsolidated Prior Period Development (in millions) First quarter Second quarter First Half Favorable (unfavorable) Prior Period Development from 2014 recognized in FY 2015 $ 194 ($16 ) $ 178 Prior Period Development from 2013 recognized in FY 2014 $ 297 $ 49 $ 346\n\nConsolidated operating expenses\n\nThe consolidated operating cost ratio (operating costs as a percent of total revenues less investment income) of 13.3 percent for 2Q 2015 decreased 180 basis points from 15.1 percent in 2Q 2014, primarily reflecting lower ratios in the Retail and Group segments. Drivers of the segment-level ratios are discussed in the sections below highlighting each segment.\n\nThe 1H 2015 consolidated operating cost ratio of 13.8 percent decreased 140 basis points from 15.2 percent in 1H 2014, primarily reflecting a lower ratio in the Group segment with no change in the ratio for the Retail segment.\n\nAmortization expense associated with intangible assets is often used in determining operating earnings on a cash basis. The company\u2019s related amortization expense included in consolidated operating expenses was approximately $24 million and $28 million for 2Q 2015 and 2Q 2014, respectively, and approximately $50 million and $56 million for 1H 2015 and 1H 2014, respectively.\n\nBalance sheet\n\nAt June 30, 2015, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities of $11.13 billion, down $388 million from $11.52 billion at March 31, 2015 primarily reflecting higher common stock repurchases and other factors discussed herein.\n\nCash and short-term investments held at the parent company of $1.86 billion at June 30, 2015 increased $647 million from $1.21 billion at March 31, 2015, as proceeds from the sale of Concentra, subsidiary dividends to the parent company and the issuance of commercial paper were partially offset primarily by funding of subsidiary working capital, stock repurchases, capital expenditures and payment of stockholder dividends. Subsidiary dividends of $457 million in 2Q 2015 compared to $695 million in 2Q 2014. The year-over-year decline in dividends to the parent company from the subsidiaries is primarily driven by lower operating results in health plan subsidiaries including the impact of recording the significantly higher FY 2015 health insurance industry fee in the first quarter of 2015, as required by state insurance regulators. The company\u2019s health insurer fee increased from $562 million in 2014 to $866 million in 2015, a 54.1 percent increase.\n\nAt June 30, 2015, net receivables of $899 million were associated with premium stabilization programs established under health care reform, commonly referred to as the 3Rs(b), including $639 million associated with the 2014 coverage year that the company expects to collect in the second half of 2015. Approximately 77 percent of the total net 3Rs receivables were related to reinsurance recoverables. At June 30, 2015, net receivables (payables) for the 3Rs were as follows:\n\nNet Amounts Accrued for the 3Rs Balances Related Balances Related Total Balances (in millions) to 2014 plan year to 2015 plan year at 6/30/15 Assets (liabilities) Reinsurance recoverables $ 521 $ 168 $ 689 Net risk adjustment settlement (125 ) (41 ) (166 ) Net risk corridor settlement 243 133 376 Total Net Amounts Accrued for the 3Rs $ 639 $ 260 $ 899\n\nDays in claims payable of 41.1 at June 30, 2015 decreased 1.7 days from 42.8 at March 31, 2015. This change was primarily driven by changes related to incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims. This metric related to IBNR can change each period depending on process changes, such as the gradual implementation during 2014 of inpatient authorization review prior to admission as opposed to post adjudication, but also can change based on the claims receipt and payment cycle times, the prevalence of new providers, and the number of processing days in a month.\n\nDebt-to-total capitalization at June 30, 2015 was 29.0 percent, up from 27.6 percent at March 31, 2015 primarily reflecting commercial paper balances outstanding at the end of 2Q 2015, versus none outstanding at the end of the first quarter 2015, as increases in capital associated with 2Q 2015 earnings were substantially offset by share repurchases and cash dividends. As of June 30, 2015, the company had $300 million outstanding on its commercial paper program. The net proceeds of commercial paper issuances are to be used for general corporate purposes, including funding for subsidiary Part D receivables.\n\nCash flows from operations\n\nCash flows used in operations for 2Q 2015 were $608 million compared to cash flows used in operations of $200 million in 2Q 2014. This year-over-year change in operating cash flows primarily reflected the favorable claim payment timing effect in the prior year from growth in individual commercial membership, lower earnings exclusive of the gain on the sale of Concentra, and other working capital items.\n\nFor 1H 2015, cash flows used in operations totaled $501 million versus $471 million of cash flows provided by operations during 1H 2014. The year-over-year decline primarily reflected the same factors impacting second-quarter cash flows as well as the favorable impact in the prior year from higher growth in group Medicare Advantage membership, higher working capital associated with growth in the company\u2019s pharmacy business and the timing of Medicaid premium collections.\n\nCash flows for the second half of 2015 are expected to be favorably impacted by the collection of the 2014 final and 2015 mid-year Medicare risk adjustment receivables from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, income from operations, and collection of the 2014 reinsurance recoverables associated with the 3Rs. These items are expected to be partially offset by payment of the 2015 non-deductible health insurance industry fee and net payments for risk adjustment associated with the 3Rs.\n\nShare repurchases\n\nIn September 2014, the company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization with an expiration date of December 31, 2016 that replaced its previous $1 billion share repurchase authorization. At that time, the company announced that it expected to repurchase $1 billion of its outstanding shares no later than June 30, 2015 under the $2 billion authorization. Under a 10b5-1 plan, the company subsequently executed the following share repurchases towards that expectation:\n\nMethod of share repurchase Time period Shares\n\nrepurchased Average cost\n\nper share Total\n\nrepurchases Open market September 2014 269,000 $ 128.34 $ 34,465,000 Open market October 2014 \u2013\n\nNovember 2014 766,000 $ 130.50 $ 100,015,000 Accelerated share repurchase November 2014 \u2013\n\nMarch 2015 3,419,700 $ 146.21 $ 500,000,000 10b5-1 plan March 2015 145,000 $ 179.89 $ 26,085,000 10b5-1 plan April 2015 \u2013\n\nJune 2015 1,704,800 $ 177.81 $ 303,131,000 Total Share Repurchases through July 28, 2015 under September 2014 Authorization 6,304,500 $ 152.86 $ 963,696,000\n\nDuring 2Q 2015, the company executed share repurchases of approximately $303 million, or 1,704,800 of its outstanding shares, at an average price of $177.81 per share through its previously disclosed 10b5-1 plan. The company executed repurchases of 805,500 shares for approximately $101 million during 2Q 2014.\n\nThe company repurchased approximately 1,849,800 shares for $329 million during 1H 2015 compared to approximately 905,500 shares for $112 million during 1H 2014.\n\nAs of July 3, 2015, approximately $1.04 billion of the current $2 billion repurchase authorization was remaining. As a result of the proposed merger with Aetna, the company has suspended its share repurchase program.\n\nCash dividends\n\nThe company paid cash dividends to its stockholders of $42 million in 2Q 2015 and in 2Q 2014. Cash dividends of $86 million were paid to the company\u2019s stockholders during 1H 2015 and in 1H 2014. In April 2015, the company\u2019s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.29 per share, totaling $43 million in the aggregate, payable on July 31, 2015 to stockholders of record on June 30, 2015, an increase from the company\u2019s previous dividend of $0.28 per share.\n\nThe company\u2019s ability and intent to continue its quarterly dividend policy is not impacted by the proposed merger with Aetna, although the company has agreed that its quarterly dividend will not exceed $0.29 per share prior to closing the transaction.\n\nRETAIL SEGMENT(c)\n\nThis segment consists of Medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group accounts, as well as individual commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and financial protection products. In addition, the segment also includes the company\u2019s contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition (LI-NET) prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide Medicaid, dual eligible, and Long-Term Support Services (LTSS) benefits, collectively, its state-based contracts(d).\n\nRetail Segment Highlights\n\nWhile the company\u2019s stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) and group Medicare Advantage businesses are performing in line with the company\u2019s expectations, as previously disclosed, its individual Medicare Advantage and individual commercial businesses are facing certain challenges.\n\nMedicare Advantage operating results were negatively impacted by certain pricing assumptions in its plan designs for 2015. This was primarily related to lower-than-expected 2015 financial claim recovery levels and lower-than-anticipated reductions in inpatient admissions from its clinical programs. Overall, year-over-year hospital admissions are nonetheless down and are running consistent with the company\u2019s revised expectations. Humana believes it has appropriately reflected recent medical cost experience in its plan designs for 2016 submitted to CMS.\n\nOperating results for individual commercial continue to be challenged primarily due to the volatility and morbidity associated with new membership related to the start of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Medical claims associated with certain products, in particular ACA-compliant off-exchange offerings, continue to exceed prior expectations for FY 2015. Additionally, on June 30, 2015, CMS issued data with respect to the reinsurance and risk adjustment premium stabilization programs for the 2014 plan year which indicated a meaningfully different risk profile comparison for the company\u2019s membership relative to state averages than had been previously anticipated. This resulted in adjustments to certain of the 3Rs during 2Q 2015. The company is in the process of evaluating its pricing and continued participation in certain products for 2016.\n\nIn total, the company\u2019s state-based contracts business continues to perform in line with management\u2019s expectations. State-based business associated with the company\u2019s dual eligible membership is outperforming expectations while its Medicaid Temporary Assistance for Needy Families products are underperforming expectations.\n\nPremiums and services revenue:\n\nThe 2Q 2015 premiums and services revenue for the Retail segment was $11.56 billion, an increase of 15.8 percent from $9.98 billion in 2Q 2014. The increase resulted primarily from a 12.2 percent increase in average Medicare Advantage membership year over year, along with membership growth in the company\u2019s state-based contracts and stand-alone PDP offerings as well as a heavier percentage of individual commercial business in higher premium ACA-compliant plans.\n\n1H 2015 premium and services revenue for the Retail segment was $23.14 billion, an increase of 18.9 percent from $19.46 billion in 1H 2014, primarily reflecting the same factors impacting the year-over-year comparison for the second quarter.\n\nEnrollment:\n\nIndividual Medicare Advantage membership was 2,709,300 as of June 30, 2015, an increase of 350,300, or 14.8 percent, from 2,359,000 at June 30, 2014, and up 281,400, or 11.6 percent from 2,427,900 as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to net membership additions associated with the 2015 plan year, particularly HMO offerings.\n\nGroup Medicare Advantage membership was 473,100 as of June 30, 2015, a decrease of 6,600, or 1.4 percent, from 479,700 at June 30, 2014 and down 16,600, or 3.4 percent, from 489,700 at December 31, 2014. The decline from December 31, 2014 primarily reflects the loss of a large group account.\n\nMembership in the company\u2019s stand-alone PDP offerings was 4,442,500 as of June 30, 2015, an increase of 557,000 or 14.3 percent, from 3,885,500 at June 30, 2014, and up 448,500, or 11.2 percent from 3,994,000 as of December 31, 2014. These increases primarily resulted from growth in the company\u2019s low-priced Humana-Walmart plan offering.\n\nIndividual commercial membership decreased to 1,036,700 as of June 30, 2015, down 84,100, or 7.5 percent, from 1,120,800 at June 30, 2014, but up 20,500, or 2.0 percent from 1,016,200 at December 31, 2014. The year-over-year decline primarily reflects the loss of members subscribing to plans not compliant with changes mandated by health care reform, partially offset by growth in health care reform compliant plans, both on-exchange and off-exchange. The increase from December 31, 2014 primarily reflects new sales and better retention for plans compliant with health care reform.\n\nState-based Medicaid membership was 352,000 as of June 30, 2015 (including 16,400 dual-eligible demonstration members), an increase of 185,000, or 110.8 percent, from 167,000 (including 4,000 dual-eligible demonstration members) at June 30, 2014, and up 35,200, or 11.1 percent, from 316,800 (including 18,300 dual-eligible demonstration members) at December 31, 2014. These increases were primarily driven by the addition of membership from state-based contracts for the Florida Medicaid business.\n\nMembership in individual specialty products(e) was 1,203,600 as of June 30, 2015, a decrease of 25,900, or 2.1 percent, from 1,229,500 at June 30, 2014, but up 37,800 from 3.2 percent at December 31, 2014. The year-over-year decrease in membership reflects lower membership in supplemental health and financial protection product offerings. Specialty membership increased in 1H 2015 primarily due to increased membership in dental offerings.\n\nBenefits expense:\n\nThe 2Q 2015 benefit ratio for the Retail segment of 87.1 percent increased 190 basis points from 85.2 percent in 2Q 2014 due to higher benefit ratios for the company\u2019s individual Medicare Advantage and individual commercial businesses, as described above, as well as the impact of a higher mix of members from state-based Medicaid contracts. Prior Period Development increased the 2Q 2015 Retail segment benefit ratio by 10 basis points versus lowering that ratio by 60 basis points in the prior year. Excluding Prior Period Development, the Retail segment benefit ratios were 87.0 percent and 85.8 percent for 2Q 2015 and 2Q 2014, respectively.\n\nThe 1H 2015 benefit ratio for the Retail segment of 86.5 percent was 120 basis points higher than the 1H 2014 ratio of 85.3 percent, primarily reflecting the same factors impacting the year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter. Prior Period Development lowered the 1H 2015 consolidated benefit ratio by 80 basis points and by 170 basis points in 1H 2014. Excluding Prior Period Development, the Retail segment benefit ratios were 87.3 percent and 87.0 percent for 1H 2015 and 1H 2014, respectively.\n\nThe Retail segment Prior Period Development declined approximately $69 million year over year for 2Q 2015 and $158 million year over year for 1H 2015 primarily reflecting the impact of lower financial claim recoveries, flu-associated claims from the fourth quarter of 2014, and continued volatility in claims associated with individual commercial products. Retail segment Prior Period Development was as follows:\n\nRetail Segment Prior Period Development (in millions) First quarter Second quarter First Half Favorable (unfavorable) Prior Period Development from 2014 recognized in FY 2015 $ 188 ($11 ) $ 177 Prior Period Development from 2013 recognized in FY 2014 $ 277 $ 58 $ 335\n\nIn June 2015, the company engaged the actuarial firm Milliman to obtain an independent estimate of Humana\u2019s individual Medicare Advantage IBNR reserves as of May 31, 2015. Humana provided the claims data to Milliman but did not provide its estimates for comparison purposes until after the Milliman analysis was completed. Milliman used a variety of methods to create a range of estimates. Milliman\u2019s conclusion was that the company\u2019s individual Medicare Advantage medical claims reserves (excluding pharmacy) as of May 31, 2015 were good and sufficient.(f)\n\nOperating costs:\n\nThe Retail segment\u2019s operating cost ratio of 10.5 percent in 2Q 2015 decreased 20 basis points from 10.7 percent in 2Q 2014. The decrease primarily resulted from scale efficiencies associated with medical membership growth in the segment, partially offset by an increase in the non-deductible health insurance industry fee mandated by health care reform. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the Retail segment\u2019s operating cost ratio by approximately 160 basis points in 2Q 2015 and 120 basis points in 2Q 2014. Excluding the industry fee, the Retail segment operating cost ratios were 8.9 percent and 9.5 percent for 2Q 2015 and 2Q 2014, respectively.\n\nThe Retail segment\u2019s 1H 2015 operating cost ratio of 10.7 percent was unchanged from 1H 2014. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the Retail segment\u2019s operating cost ratio by approximately 160 basis points in 1H 2015 and 120 basis points in 1H 2014. Excluding the industry fee, the Retail segment operating cost ratios were 9.1 percent and 9.5 percent for 1H 2015 and 1H 2014, respectively, reflecting scale efficiencies within the segment.\n\nPretax results:\n\nRetail segment pretax income of $260 million in 2Q 2015 compared to $400 million in 2Q 2014, a decrease of $140 million, as growth in Medicare Advantage membership was more than offset by an increase in the benefit ratio.\n\nFor 1H 2015, pretax income for the Retail Segment of $635 million decreased by $134 million from 1H 2014 pretax earnings of $769 million. The 1H 2015 decrease primarily reflected the same factors impacting the quarterly comparisons.\n\nGROUP SEGMENT(c)\n\nThis segment consists of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and voluntary insurance benefits, as well as Administrative Services Only (ASO) products. In addition, the Group segment includes health and wellness products (primarily marketed to employer groups) and military services business, primarily the TRICARE South Region contract.\n\nGroup Segment Highlights\n\nThe Group segment continues to perform in line with company expectations, including fully-insured and ASO products as well as the company\u2019s TRICARE operations. On July 22, 2015, Humana responded to the request for proposal for the next generation of TRICARE contracts for the period beginning April 1, 2017.\n\nPremiums and services revenue:\n\nThe 2Q 2015 premiums and services revenue for the Group segment was $1.84 billion, up 2.6 percent from $1.80 billion in 2Q 2014, primarily reflecting an increase in fully-insured commercial medical per- member premiums, partially offset by a net decline in fully-insured commercial medical membership and a decline in ASO commercial membership.\n\nFor 1H 2015 premium and services revenue for the Group segment was $3.70 billion, an increase of 2.1 percent from $3.62 billion in 1H 2014, primarily reflecting the same factors impacting the year-over-year comparison for the second quarter.\n\nEnrollment:\n\nGroup fully-insured commercial medical membership was 1,179,100 at June 30, 2015, a decrease of 31,000, or 2.6 percent, from 1,210,100 at June 30, 2014, as higher small group business (less than 100 lives) membership year over year was more than offset by lower membership in large group accounts. Group fully-insured commercial medical membership was down 56,400, or 4.6 percent, from 1,235,500 at December 31, 2014 reflecting lower membership in both large group and small group accounts. Approximately 64 percent of group fully-insured commercial medical membership was in small group accounts at June 30, 2015 versus 65 percent at December 31, 2014, and 62 percent at June 30, 2014.\n\nGroup ASO commercial medical membership was 736,600 at June 30, 2015, a decline of 383,500, or 34.2 percent, from 1,120,100 at June 30, 2014, and down 367,700, or 33.3 percent from 1,104,300 at December 31, 2014. This decline reflects the loss of certain large group accounts due to continued discipline in pricing of services for self-funded accounts amid a highly competitive environment.\n\nMilitary services membership was 3,071,300 at June 30, 2015, generally unchanged with a decrease of 40,000, or 1.3 percent, from 3,111,300 at June 30, 2014, and down 19,100, or 0.6 percent, from 3,090,400 at December 31, 2014.\n\nMembership in Group specialty products was 6,179,700 at June 30, 2015, a decline of 396,300, or 6.0 percent, from 6,576,000 at June 30, 2014, and down 323,000, or 5.0 percent, from 6,502,700 at December 31, 2014. This decrease primarily resulted from the loss of certain fully-insured group accounts.\n\nMembership in HumanaVitality\u00ae, the company\u2019s wellness and loyalty rewards program, was 3,885,200 at June 30, 2015, an increase of 113,200, or 3.0 percent, from 3,772,000 at June 30, 2014, and up 28,400, or 0.7 percent, from 3,856,800 at December 31, 2014 primarily due to individual Medicare Advantage growth as well as growth in stand-alone sales.\n\nBenefits expense:\n\nThe 2Q 2015 benefit ratio for the Group segment was 81.4 percent, an increase of 250 basis points from 78.9 percent for 2Q 2014. The year-over-year increase in the benefit ratio primarily reflected the impact of higher specialty drug costs, net of rebates, partially offset by an increase in the health insurance industry fee included in pricing of the company\u2019s products. Prior Period Development increased the Group segment benefit ratio by 40 basis points in both 2Q 2015 and 2Q 2014. Excluding Prior Period Development, the Group segment benefit ratios were 81.0 percent and 78.5 percent for 2Q 2015 and 2Q 2014, respectively.\n\nThe 1H 2015 benefit ratio for the Group segment of 77.6 percent increased 190 basis points from the 75.7 percent ratio for 1H 2014, primarily reflecting the same factors impacting the year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter. Prior Period Development had no impact upon the Group segment benefit ratio in 1H 2015 and lowered the ratio by 40 basis points in 1H 2014. Excluding Prior Period Development, the Group segment benefit ratio was 77.6 percent for 1H 2015 and 76.1 for 1H 2014, respectively.\n\nOperating costs:\n\nThe Group segment\u2019s operating cost ratio was 24.1 percent in 2Q 2015, a decrease of 280 basis points from 26.9 percent in 2Q 2014, primarily reflecting the loss of certain large ASO accounts resulting in a lower percentage of ASO business which carries a higher operating cost ratio than fully-insured commercial business, as well as operating cost efficiencies associated with the fully-insured business as a result of cost reduction initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by the increase of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee mandated by health care reform. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee impacted the Group segment\u2019s operating cost ratio by approximately 140 basis points in 2Q 2015 and 100 basis points in 2Q 2014. Excluding the industry fee, the Group segment operating cost ratios were 22.7 percent and 25.9 percent for 2Q 2015 and 2Q 2014, respectively.\n\nThe Group segment\u2019s operating cost ratio of 24.3 percent for 1H 2015 was down 270 basis points compared to 27.0 percent for 1H 2014 primarily reflecting the same factors impacting the year-over-year comparison for the second quarter. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee also impacted the Group segment\u2019s operating cost ratio by approximately 140 basis points in 1H 2015 and 100 basis points in 1H 2014. Excluding the industry fee, the Group segment operating cost ratios were 22.9 percent and 26.0 percent for 1H 2015 and 1H 2014, respectively.\n\nPretax results:\n\nThe 2Q 2015 Group segment pretax income of $43 million increased from pretax income of $30 million in 2Q 2014, primarily reflecting an improvement in the segment\u2019s operating cost ratio, partially offset by an increase in the segment\u2019s benefit ratio.\n\nFor 1H 2015, pretax income for the Group segment of $197 million increased by $23 million versus 1H 2014 pretax earnings of $174 million. The 1H 2014 increase primarily reflects the same factors impacting the quarterly comparisons.\n\nHEALTHCARE SERVICES SEGMENT(c)\n\nThis segment includes services offered to the company\u2019s health plan members as well as to third parties, including pharmacy solutions, provider services, home based services, and clinical programs, as well as services and capabilities to advance population health.\n\nHealthcare Services Segment Highlights\n\nHealthcare Services operations continue to exceed previous expectations, primarily driven by improvements in pharmacy related cost initiatives as well as higher mail order and specialty pharmacy usage. Additionally, membership growth in the health plans has resulted in higher usage of services across the segment. The segment\u2019s 2Q 2015 results also reflect the sale of Concentra in June 2015, with the gain on that sale being reported in the Corporate results.\n\nRevenues:\n\nRevenue of $5.98 billion in 2Q 2015 for the Healthcare Services segment increased $965 million, or 19.3 percent, from $5.01 billion in 2Q 2014, primarily due to growth in the company\u2019s Medicare membership which resulted in higher utilization of the healthcare services businesses, partially offset by lower Concentra revenues due to the sale of the business in June 2015.\n\n1H 2015 revenue for the Healthcare Services segment was $11.85 billion, an increase of 22.6 percent from $9.67 billion in 1H 2014, primarily reflecting the same factors impacting the year-over-year comparison for the second quarter.\n\nOperating costs:\n\nThe Healthcare Services segment\u2019s operating cost ratio of 95.6 percent in 2Q 2015 was relatively unchanged compared to 95.2 percent in 2Q 2014.\n\nThe Healthcare Services segment\u2019s operating cost ratio of 95.5 percent for 1H 2015 was also relatively unchanged compared to 95.2 percent for 1H 2014.\n\nOperating statistics:\n\nPrimary care providers in value-based (shared risk and path to risk) relationships of approximately 43,000 at June 30, 2015 increased 11.7 percent from 38,500 at June 30, 2014, and increased 1.7 percent from 42,300 at December 31, 2014. At June 30, 2015, 55.7 percent of the company\u2019s individual Medicare Advantage members were in value-based relationships, compared to 53.6 percent at December 31, 2014, and 52.8 percent at June 30, 2014.\n\nMedicare Advantage membership in the Humana Chronic Care Program rose to 512,000 at June 30, 2015, up 48.6 percent from 344,500 at June 30, 2014, and up 21.7 percent from 420,700 at December 31, 2014, reflecting enhanced predictive modeling capabilities and focus on proactive clinical outreach and member engagement.\n\nPharmacy script volumes of 98.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 increased 20.6 percent compared to 81.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, driven primarily by higher average medical membership.\n\nPretax results:\n\nHealthcare Services segment pretax income of $223 million in 2Q 2015 increased from $206 million in 2Q 2014, primarily due to revenue growth from the pharmacy solutions and home based services businesses, as they serve the company\u2019s growing Medicare membership.\n\nin 2Q 2014, primarily due to revenue growth from the pharmacy solutions and home based services businesses, as they serve the company\u2019s growing Medicare membership. 1H 2015 pretax income for the Healthcare Services segment of $453 million increased by $62 million from 1H 2014 pretax earnings of $391 million, primarily reflecting the same factors impacting year-over-year comparisons.\n\nDetailed press release\n\nHumana\u2019s full earnings press release including the statistical pages has been posted to the company\u2019s Investor Relations site and may be accessed at http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=92913&p=irol-IRHome or via a current report on Form 8-K filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission this morning (available at www.sec.gov or on the company\u2019s website).\n\nFootnotes\n\n(a) Adjusted pretax income and Adjusted EPS for 2Q 2015 excluded a pretax gain of approximately $267 million, or $1.18 per share, associated with the completion of the company\u2019s sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Concentra Inc. Adjusted pretax income and Adjusted EPS for 1H 2015 excluded the 2Q 2015 adjusting item as well as a $0.35 per share tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2015 associated with the recognition of a deferred tax benefit on the then-pending sale of Concentra.\n\nThe company has included these financial measures (which are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)) in its summary of financial results within this earnings press release as management believes that these measures, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures, are useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the company\u2019s ongoing business and operating performance. The excluded items described herein are not a recurring part of the company\u2019s operating plan. Consequently, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n(b) Under health care reform, premium stabilization programs, commonly referred to as the 3Rs, became effective January 1, 2014. These programs include a permanent risk adjustment program, a transitional reinsurance program, and a temporary risk corridors program designed to more evenly spread the financial risk borne by issuers and to mitigate the risk that issuers would have mispriced products. In each case, operation of the program is subject to federal administrative action.\n\n(c) On January 1, 2015, the company realigned certain of its businesses among its financial reporting segments to correspond with internal management reporting changes and renamed its Employer Group segment the Group segment. The company\u2019s three reportable segments remain Retail, Group, and Healthcare Services.\n\n(d) State-based contracts include the company\u2019s operations and membership associated with Medicaid benefits provided for dual-eligible demonstration, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Long-Term Support Services (LTSS) programs.\n\n(e) The company provides a full range of insured specialty products including dental, vision, other supplemental health, financial protection, and voluntary insurance benefits. Members included in these products may not be unique to each product since members have the ability to enroll in multiple products. Other supplemental benefits include life, disability, and fixed benefit products including cancer and critical illness policies.\n\n(f) Milliman\u2019s estimate of Humana\u2019s individual Medicare Advantage Part C May 2015 month-end unpaid claims liabilities referred to in this press release included medical costs only, and did not include pharmacy costs or commercial product costs. It may not be appropriate for other uses. Milliman does not intend for this information to benefit, and assumes no duty or liability to, any third party. In developing their estimates, Milliman relied on discussions with Humana and Humana\u2019s medical benefits claim lag and membership data obtained from Humana. Milliman did not audit the data and performed no verification as to the accuracy of these data, although they performed reasonableness checks where possible. To the extent any information is inaccurate or incomplete, Milliman\u2019s results may likewise be inaccurate or incomplete. It should be emphasized that actuarial liabilities (reserves) are estimates. The exact liabilities will only be determinable after a sufficient passage of time permits the filing and payment of all outstanding claims.\n\nConference Call\n\nGiven the proposed merger with Aetna, the company is not hosting a conference call in conjunction with its 2Q 2015 earnings release and does not expect to do so for future quarters. Please direct any questions regarding this earnings press release to Humana Investor Relations or Humana Corporate Communications.\n\nCautionary Statement\n\nThis news release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in investor presentations, press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of Humana\u2019s executive officers, the words or phrases like \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201clikely will result,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprojects\u201d or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the company\u2019s SEC filings, a summary of which includes but is not limited to the following:\n\nHumana\u2019s merger with Aetna is subject to various closing conditions, including governmental, regulatory and stockholder approvals as well as other uncertainties and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.\n\nThe merger agreement between Humana and Aetna limits Humana\u2019s ability to pursue alternative transactions to the proposed merger with Aetna.\n\nThe number of shares of Aetna common stock that Humana\u2019s stockholders will receive in the merger is based on a fixed exchange ratio. Because the market price of Aetna\u2019s common stock will fluctuate, Humana\u2019s stockholders cannot be certain of the value of the portion of the merger consideration to be paid in Aetna\u2019s common stock.\n\nWhile the merger with Aetna is pending, Humana is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect Humana\u2019s results of operations, financial position and cash flows or result in a loss of employees, customers, members or suppliers.\n\nIf the merger agreement with Aetna is terminated, Humana may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to Aetna.\n\nFailure to consummate the merger with Aetna could negatively impact Humana\u2019s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nIf Humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively, if the premiums Humana receives are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to its members, if the company is unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for its members, lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of its members, or if its estimates of benefits expense are inadequate, Humana\u2019s profitability could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends.\n\nIf Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives, particularly its Medicare initiatives, state-based contract strategy, and its participation in the new health insurance exchanges, the company\u2019s business may be materially adversely affected, which is of particular importance given the concentration of the company\u2019s revenues in these products.\n\nIf Humana fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to strategically implement new information systems, to protect Humana\u2019s proprietary rights to its systems, or to defend against cyber-security attacks, the company\u2019s business may be materially adversely affected.\n\nHumana\u2019s business may be materially adversely impacted by the adoption of a new coding set for diagnoses (commonly known as ICD-10), the implementation of which has been deferred to at least October 1, 2015.\n\nHumana is involved in various legal actions, or disputes that could lead to legal actions (such as, among other things, provider contract disputes relating to rate adjustments resulting from the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, commonly referred to as \u201csequestration\u201d; other provider contract disputes; and qui tam litigation brought by individuals on behalf of the government) and governmental and internal investigations, any of which, if resolved unfavorably to the company, could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in its business practices. Increased litigation and negative publicity could also increase the company\u2019s cost of doing business.\n\nAs a government contractor, Humana is exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect its business or its willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs including, among other things, loss of material government contracts, governmental audits and investigations, potential inadequacy of government-determined payment rates, potential restrictions on profitability, including by comparison of profitability of the company\u2019s Medicare Advantage business to non-Medicare Advantage business, or other changes in the governmental programs in which Humana participates.\n\nThe Health Care Reform Law, including The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on Humana\u2019s results of operations, including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting the company\u2019s ability to expand into new markets, increasing the company's medical and operating costs by, among other things, requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products, lowering the company\u2019s Medicare payment rates and increasing the company\u2019s expenses associated with a non-deductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments; the company\u2019s financial position, including the company's ability to maintain the value of its goodwill; and the company\u2019s cash flows.\n\nHumana\u2019s participation in the new federal and state health care exchanges, which entail uncertainties associated with mix, volume of business, and the operation of premium stabilization programs, which are subject to federal administrative action, could adversely affect the company\u2019s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nHumana\u2019s business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase the company\u2019s cost of doing business and may adversely affect the company\u2019s business, profitability and cash flows.\n\nIf Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to its members, the company\u2019s business may be adversely affected.\n\nHumana\u2019s pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to regulations in addition to those the company faces with its core health benefits businesses.\n\nChanges in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect Humana\u2019s financial performance.\n\nIf Humana does not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels, Humana\u2019s gross margins may decline.\n\nHumana\u2019s ability to obtain funds from certain of its licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations.\n\nDowngrades in Humana\u2019s debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nThe securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption, which may adversely affect Humana\u2019s business.\n\nIn making forward-looking statements, Humana is not undertaking to address or update them in future filings or communications regarding its business or results. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed herein may or may not occur. There also may be other risks that the company is unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.\n\nHumana advises investors to read the following documents as filed by the company with the SEC for further discussion both of the risks it faces and its historical performance:\n\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014;\n\nForm 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, and\n\nForm 8-Ks filed during 2015.\n\nAbout Humana\n\nHumana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Ky., is a leading health and well-being company focused on making it easy for people to achieve their best health with clinical excellence through coordinated care. The company\u2019s strategy integrates care delivery, the member experience, and clinical and consumer insights to encourage engagement, behavior change, proactive clinical outreach and wellness for the millions of people we serve across the country.\n\nMore information regarding Humana is available to investors via the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s web site at www.humana.com, including copies of:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Humana Inc.
