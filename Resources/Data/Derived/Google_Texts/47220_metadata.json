However, when he was shut out, he settled for something that sounded a bit less intriguing \u2014 Water, Energy and the West.\n\nLooking at the syllabus on the first day \u2014 which explained how the class would combine, among other areas, engineering and literature \u2014 Tortorelli said he felt skeptical. And he wasn\u2019t alone.\n\n\u201cPeople were looking around at each other going, \u2018What is this?\u2019 \u201d said the junior from Hoenhe, a small Colorado town in Las Animas County. \u201cI just figured I\u2019d be there once and then hopefully switch out if the other class became available.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, a couple of days later Tortorelli had the opportunity to transfer out. But he rejected it because a funny thing happened \u2014 he was hooked by the quirky course that included an introduction to a book of essays called \u201cThe Land of Little Rain,\u201d published in 1903 by Mary Hunter Austin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s asking us, when we go out into the world for our engineering jobs, to be conscious of the implications of what we\u2019re doing on the world around us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been awesome. It\u2019s opening our minds to things a lot of us haven\u2019t thought about before.\u201d\n\nNow, the course\u2019s instructors, Kamini Singha and Sarah Hitt, chuckle and ask themselves how many closet writers and poets may be lurking around the engineering-heavy university. Singha is an associate professor in the school\u2019s geological engineering department. Hitt is an assistant professor in Mines\u2019 tiny liberal arts division. Both relatively new to the school, the pair met and hit it off to the point where they sought to find a way to work together.\n\n\u201cThere just seemed like there was a place where we could meet,\u201d Singha said. \u201cAnd in some ways, being here in the West, with some of the things that have been going on, the fires and floods here in Colorado, and the droughts in California, made it a very easy class.\u201d\n\nOne day students may work on an analysis of the properties of water molecules, the next they\u2019re taking that work and explicating poems that discuss the same area, searching for the relationships the authors had with water and why they chose the words they used in their works.\n\nOver the semester, the class has taken modern issues like global climate change, water law and fracking, and not only looked at them from today\u2019s perspective but also matched them to engineering and the implications on society of environmental decisions that were made as far back as the 1100s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to slap some science on something. We should know how the human self affects decisions,\u201d Hitt said. \u201cThe school is so intensive in science and engineering \u2014 we\u2019ve found that a lot of kids are thirsty to use their minds in a different way. That\u2019s all they talk about, how refreshing it is to use the other parts of their brains.\u201d\n\nLater in the semester, the students will take part in what Singha and Hitt are calling \u201cChoose Your Adventure.\u201d It may be writing a poem, it could be a painting, perhaps a scholarly analysis.\n\nOne project that Tortorelli is considering is a modern-day court case over water rights taking place near his home just outside Trinidad in which the judge and attorneys are looking for guidance in laws written 300 years ago.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t do that, he\u2019ll probably break out an interpretive dance in an ode to water.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s ever asked them to do these kinds of things,\u201d Singha said. \u201cWhen we started, my sense was that the non-engineering aspects of this would be completely foreign to them, really hard to grasp, but it\u2019s amazing how good they are.\u201d\n\nAnthony Cotton: 303-954-1292, acotton@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ anthonycottondp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado School of Mines students expand world beyond engineering", "title": "Colorado School of Mines students expand world beyond engineering", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/17/colorado-school-of-mines-students-expand-world-beyond-engineering/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140217__20140218_A4_CD18MINESPOETRYp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140217__20140218_A4_CD18MINESPOETRYp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-17T20:56:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:51:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNo one\u2019s ever asked them to do these kinds of things,\u201d Singha said.\nPicking classes for the current semester at Colorado School of Mines, Brandon Tortorelli hoped to register for what he thought would be a fun course called International Spies and Propaganda.\nLooking at the syllabus on the first day \u2014 which explained how the class would combine, among other areas, engineering and literature \u2014 Tortorelli said he felt skeptical.\n\u201cThe school is so intensive in science and engineering \u2014 we\u2019ve found that a lot of kids are thirsty to use their minds in a different way.\nHowever, when he was shut out, he settled for something that sounded a bit less intriguing \u2014 Water, Energy and the West."}
