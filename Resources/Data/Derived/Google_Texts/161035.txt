The Twitterverse erupted Monday morning after the account belonging to the U.S. Department of Defense tweeted a Martin Luther King, Jr. quote.

“‘The quality, not the longevity, of one’s life is what is important.’ MLK Jr. #MartinLutherKing,” the agency tweeted to its nearly 357,000 followers.

It didn’t take long for people to criticize the department for using the late reverend’s words to seemingly justify war.

“Good advice if you’re living in drone country,” wrote Jeremy Weiland.

“Show me the video where MLK justifies the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, suffocation of Gaza & imprisonment of African refugees,” wrote Rania Khalek.

One user countered with another quote by Mr. King: “The greatest purveyor of violence in the world today is my own government.”
