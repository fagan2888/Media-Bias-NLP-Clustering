GLENWOOD SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — Wildlife managers are worried about the health of owls, elk and other wild animals because food is buried under deep snow in the Rocky Mountains.

Ranchers are feeding elk to help them survive, and deer are foraging for scraps that are left behind. There has also been an unusual increase in the number of dead owls.

Colorado Parks and Wildlife Regional Manager Ron Velarde says there has been a significant impact on wildlife, but it’s not unusual so have periods of deep snow that force animals to scrounge for food.

The Glenwood Springs Post Independent reports (http://tinyurl.com/h8p3vdk ) part of the problem is continuing cold weather that has not allowed periodic thawing.
