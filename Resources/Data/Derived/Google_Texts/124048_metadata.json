However, PBS\u2019s Judy Woodruff wishes the Obama administration could get another crack at the rollout of ObamaCare.\n\n\n\nWhile moderating an ObamaCare discussion on Tuesday\u2019s PBS NewsHour, Woodruff posed this question to Ron Bonjean, a former Republican spokesman:\n\n\"But if they get a lot of people, if they get millions of Americans signed up, the website\u2019s working better, can't they undo that first impression?\"\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s too late for that, Judy. ObamaCare has already made its first impression on Americans, and that first impression was not good. The website was deeply flawed, not many people signed up in the first month, and millions of Americans lost their private health plans despite the president\u2019s assurances that they could keep them.\n\n\n\nIt was also a bit shortsighted for Woodruff to suppose that getting lots of people signed up and fixing the website will be enough to turn the tide of public opinion in favor of the law. She assumes Americans will like the substance of the law. But even if people get signed up, health care access and affordability may still be problems. Bonjean brought up some of those issues:\n\n\n\n\"People's premiums are likely to go up, people's deductibles are going to go up... getting to their doctor is going to be troublesome and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to see, along with the security, and lack thereof, of the exchanges.\"\n\nBelow is a transcript of the exchange:\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So Ron Bonjean, if the White House is able to do what they say they are \u2013 they are going to get the website working, if they can address some of these other problems \u2013 why won't they be able to undo some of the damage that\u2019s been done?\n\n\n\nRON BONJEAN, Singer Bonjean Strategies: This is what the president\u2019s really worried about. He\u2019s putting a firewall around ObamaCare right now because Democrats are running away from it in droves, and he\u2019s trying a last stand to put the best face of ObamaCare, you know, best face of the branding around ObamaCare that he can, because next year is an election year and it\u2019s so critical, and millions of Americans are losing their health insurance this January 1 and they need to get signed up into ObamaCare quickly.\n\n\n\nWOODRUFF: But if they get a lot of people, if they get millions of Americans signed up, the website\u2019s working better, can't they undo that first impression?\n\n\n\nBONJEAN: See, what\u2019s really interesting is that Republicans knew \u2013 we all know that the website\u2019s going to get fixed. I mean, you know, it\u2019s technology, eventually it\u2019s going to happen. But what we\u2019re talking about now is we\u2019re talking about the access and affordability of ObamaCare. People's premiums are likely to go up, people's deductibles are going to go up, the access around to getting to their doctor is going to be troublesome and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to see, along with the security, and lack thereof, of the exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "You never get a second chance to make a first impression.
