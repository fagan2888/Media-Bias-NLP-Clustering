New Mexico’s state Environment Department slammed the U.S. Department of Energy with more than $54 million in fines on Saturday over numerous violations that led to the indefinite closure of the nation’s only underground nuclear waste repository.

Two compliance orders delivered to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, outline more than 30 state permit violations at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in southeastern New Mexico at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The fines are the largest the state has ever imposed on the agency, The Associated Press reported Saturday.

But the state is still investigating more violations and could levy more fines against the agency are possible.

In February a truck hauling salt at WIPP caught fire. Nine days later a canister of waste from Los Alamos that ruptured in one of WIPP’s storage rooms, contaminating more than 20 workers and forcing officials to close the facility, halting efforts around the country to clean up Cold War-era waste.

The state is accusing Los Alamos of mixing incompatible waste, treating hazardous waste without a permit and failing to notify regulators about changes in the way waste was being handled, AP reported.

Resuming full operations at WIPP could take years and the cleanup is expected to cost around a half-billion dollars.
