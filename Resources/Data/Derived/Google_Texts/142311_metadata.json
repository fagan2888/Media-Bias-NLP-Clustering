He also urged North Korea to release Christian missionary Kenneth Bae and for Iran to release pastor Saeed Abedini. Abedini\u2019s wife has expressed her frustration at the State Department\u2019s perceived hesitancy in addressing her husband\u2019s imprisonment.\n\nIn discussing the State Department's commitment to work on behalf of universal human rights, he offered praise for Secretary of State John Kerry and his work on a Middle East peace deal, saying that the Obama administration will \"stand against the ugly tide of anti-Semitism.\"\n\nKerry has faced criticism in recent days for alluding to those boycotting Israel in comments at a conference in Germany, earning scorn from Israeli leaders for seemingly legitimizing those in opposition to Israel's policies.\n\nObama\u2019s speech was preceded by Shah\u2019s message, in which he called on leaders to commit \u201cto end extreme poverty in our lifetime.\u201d\n\nReferencing the parable of the Good Samaritan, he said the Biblical story was an example to all \u201cto practice our faith the hard way by serving the least fortunate\" and to \"prioritize the poor.\"\n\nIn his speech, President Obama stressed the importance of religious freedom worldwide. (AFP PHOTO/Jewel Samad)\n\nThe message of religious freedom and protecting the poor marked a vast difference from conservative pundit Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s keynote address at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast. He was criticized by some for using his speech to slam the President's healthcare reform instead of delivering a spiritual message.\n\nGospel singer Yolanda Adams and Christian contemporary artist Steve Green were on hand to serenade the crowd gathered at the Washington Hilton.\n\n\u201cSoul Surfer\u201d author Bethany Hamilton was also among the guests at the head table.\n\nHamilton read two passages from the New Testament and then shared her story of recovery after she lost her arm in a shark attack as a teenager.\n\nHaitian President Michel Martelly and Albania's President Bujar Nishani attended the event with other world leaders, members of Congress and some of Washington's most celebrated names.\n\nThe sitting President has always attended the event since it began 1953.\n\nThe event is sponsored by the Fellowship, an elusive Christian group also referred to as the Family. This year's gathering was hosted by Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and Janice Hahn (D-Calif.)\n\nllarson@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "LESLIE LARSON", "twitter": {"description": "President Obama and the First Lady joined Washington elite early Thursday for the National Prayer Breakfast.", "title": "President Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/president-obama-national-prayer-breakfast-article-1.1604182", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1604181.1391700386!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obamas-national-prayer-breakfast.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "Barack Obama", "parsely-author": "Leslie Larson", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "Barack Obama", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/president-obama-national-prayer-breakfast-article-1.1604182", "parsely-title": "President Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-06T08:30:55-0500", "sailthru.title": "President Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-02-06T13:30:55", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1604181.1391700386!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obamas-national-prayer-breakfast.jpg", "description": "President Obama and the First Lady joined Washington elite early Thursday for the National Prayer Breakfast.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "President Obama and the First Lady joined Washington elite early Thursday for the National Prayer Breakfast.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "President Obama and the First Lady joined Washington elite early Thursday for the National Prayer Breakfast.", "title": "President Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/president-obama-national-prayer-breakfast-article-1.1604182", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1604181.1391700386!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obamas-national-prayer-breakfast.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1604181.1391700386!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obamas-national-prayer-breakfast.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "LESLIE LARSON", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "In his speech, President Obama stressed the importance of religious freedom worldwide.\nPresident Obama and the First Lady joined thousands from the Washington elite early Thursday for the National Prayer Breakfast, an event that hit a decidedly more spiritual tone in 2014 than the highly politicized spirit at the 2013 occasion.\n(AFP PHOTO/Jewel Samad)The message of religious freedom and protecting the poor marked a vast difference from conservative pundit Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s keynote address at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast.\nHaitian President Michel Martelly and Albania's President Bujar Nishani attended the event with other world leaders, members of Congress and some of Washington's most celebrated names.\nDuring Obama's message, the President highlighted the peril of those enduring religious persecution worldwide and praised America's commitment to freedom of worship, saying \"religion strengthens America.\""}
