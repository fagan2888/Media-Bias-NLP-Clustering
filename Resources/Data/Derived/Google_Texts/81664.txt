New York Magazine is inciting controversy with its latest cover story, an expansive profile of celebrity photographer and alleged sex abuser Terry Richardson. Although the profile highlights the numerous sexual abuse lawsuits and allegations made against Richardson, Benjamin Wallace’s piece, titled “Terry Richardson: Artist or Predator?” paints Richardson as a guy whose art is just misunderstood. As Elon Green pointed out on Twitter, this framing of the headline itself is a “strange binary.” Writer Jessica Valenti explains why it’s so problematic: “What irritates me about the “artist or predator?!” framing is that it assumes 1) he can’t be both 2) that his victims just DON’T GET ART.”

Twitter then supplied some other headlines New York Magazine could consider:

Is Terry Richardson nearsighted or right handed RT @elongreen: What a strangely binary question. http://t.co/Y0zQuxtHxw — Erin Gloria Ryan (@morninggloria) June 16, 2014
